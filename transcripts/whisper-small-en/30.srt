00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,420

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:46,480
Hello everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Peter Attia drive.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
My guest this week is professor Tom Seifried, who many of you will know, but I suspect an

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
equal number of you will not know.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,120
Tom has come to us through many channels, meaning the requests to speak with Tom have

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,520
come on many levels.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,160
There's been a lot of requests through social media, through the site.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,360
And of course, based on our discussions with Dom Dagestino, Tom has been front of mind

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
for quite a while.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,760
This is my first time meeting Tom, but I feel sort of like I know him because I've read

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,640
so much of his work and Bob Kaplan, who of course you all know, as my trusty right hand

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,520
guy who lives in Boston actually takes a course from Tom and he's taken a course in

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,960
the past and continues to just wander around Tom's office and just hang out with him overall.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
So in some ways this felt kind of familiar though.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
It was my first time meeting Tom.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,360
Tom's background is that he's got a PhD in genetics and biochemistry from the University

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
of Illinois.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,160
He got that in the mid seventies and a bunch of other distinctions that I'm not going to

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,240
go into because we're going to link to all that stuff.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,040
He did his postdoc in the Department of Neurology at Yale and it was there that he first became

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,400
interested in ketones because of their application in the amelioration of recalcitrant seizures.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,400
As we get into in the episode, that led to his interest in cancer, which is now his focus.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,320
Tom has published over 150 peer reviewed publications.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,800
He's the author of numerous books, textbooks, etc., including kind of a treatise on this.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,760
So his magnum opus is effectively a book called Cancer as a Metabolic Disease.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,520
I probably got my first copy of this a few years ago and in many ways that's what sort

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
of felt quite familiar in speaking with him.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,000
He's currently a professor at Boston College and his research today focuses on the mechanisms

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,040
by which metabolic therapies can manage chronic diseases such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,880
lipid storage diseases and above all cancer.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,320
In this episode, we talk about Tom's background, as I sort of alluded to, his work in epilepsy

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,200
and how that led him to the interest in caloric restriction and ketosis.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,480
We revisit the man, the legend, Otto Warburg and talk about the Warburg effect and Warburg's

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,800
point of view on these things.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,480
And I do push him a little bit on this because I want to point out that it's not entirely

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,600
clear amongst people what the Warburg effect really implies and how ubiquitous it is.

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,440
And I have to be honest with you, I don't necessarily share Tom's views on a number

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
of these things.

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,280
So I wanted to do my best to sort of represent as many other views as possible, but at the

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,380
same time, I hope the discussion is helpful.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,160
We get into a bunch of the semantics.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,960
I knew this was a very technical topic and I know that not everybody has the luxury of

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,040
listening to this while they're reviewing the show notes.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,480
So we do go over the differences between respiration or oxidative phosphorylation and

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
fermentation.

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,580
It's very important to understand this.

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,400
So one thing to keep in mind with this podcast and frankly, any of the more technical episodes

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,760
we do, if you're struggling with a concept, hit pause.

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,280
I don't think it's worth sort of going through these, not understanding them.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,600
I think it's cool to listen to this, hit pause, go back, hit Wikipedia, ping us with a question

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,620
on social media or whatever, if there's a concept that's dumping you.

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,920
But this is obviously going to be one of the more important concepts.

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,120
If you can't understand the difference between respiration, oxidative phosphorylation as it

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,040
were and fermentation, then a lot of this won't make sense.

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,120
We also get into this idea of substrate level phosphorylation, a very important concept

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,740
and the fermentation of glucose.

66
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,200
We also talk a lot about glutamine.

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,360
This is something that I haven't spent a lot of time talking about in the past.

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,240
I think I do touch on it a little bit with Dom DeGostino, but we get into it in much

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
greater fashion.

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,560
We, of course, get into ultimately the fundamental question that I think people who are interested

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,280
in metabolic therapies for questions have to be able to answer, which is, is cancer

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,460
primarily a metabolic disease, meaning a disease whose origin arrives in the mitochondria or

73
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,660
in the metabolic machinery of the cell, or is it primarily a genetic disease where sometimes

74
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,200
you will and sometimes you won't sustain mitochondrial damage?

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
You'll see this in the interview.

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,440
It's not entirely clear to me that I buy the argument that cancer is entirely a metabolic

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,440
disease, though, as some of you will know, I am very bullish on the use of metabolic

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,960
therapies in cancer, but I'm also very bullish on the use of immunotherapy in cancer and

79
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,120
when appropriate chemotherapy in cancer.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,200
My view is that cancer is about as hard a disease as there is ever going to be to target,

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,760
and therefore we ought to turn our attention to as many legs of the stool as possible and

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
not just one.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,560
I think the discussion gets a little bit heated at one point when I take issue with something

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Tom said about suggesting that biopsies could exacerbate cancer.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,520
I really don't want anybody to come out of this believing that having a biopsy is going

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
to increase their risk of metastatic cancer.

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,840
I think that anyone's entitled to a hypothesis, but to my knowledge, there are absolutely

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,260
no evidence to support that claim.

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,900
We talk a lot about a particular type of cancer called glioblastome multiforme, GBM,

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,280
also known as a grade four astrocytoma.

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,180
This is, of course, a cancer that if you haven't heard of it, you've certainly heard of its

92
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
effect.

93
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,820
John McCain, who recently passed away, suffered from this.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,700
I lost a friend to this when I was younger, and I think that if you know somebody who

95
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,460
has died of brain cancer, the chances are there's a pretty good chance this is the cancer

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
they had.

97
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,380
This is one of those cancers that gives cancer a bad name.

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,080
In all fairness, I don't think there's ever been a true documented survivor of this cancer.

99
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,020
It also may provide one of the more interesting model systems to study metabolic therapies

100
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,380
for cancer.

101
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,980
I guess the most important thing we close with is I sort of pushed Tom a little bit

102
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,020
on what experiment he would want to see or do to advance the thinking in this field.

103
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,860
In many ways, Tom's a little bit of a guy that's on the sidelines of sort of mainstream

104
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
cancer.

105
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,340
These views, these metabolic views unfortunately, unfortunately in my view, don't get the attention

106
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,180
they deserve.

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,160
Other people that I'm going to be talking with in the future, such as Sid Mukerjee and

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,380
Lou Cantley, are going to be some ... I think some of the people who are now starting to

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,300
see through their own research some of the potential applications for these things.

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,060
I think that in many ways the problems that Tom has been working on for the last 30 or

111
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,900
30 years are very slowly beginning to gain acceptance.

112
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,740
I don't like to use the word mainstream, but I think you know what I mean, in the more

113
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,420
mainstream circles of oncology.

114
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,380
This interview does get technical at times, and so as is the case with virtually all of

115
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,380
our interviews, please pay attention to the show notes if you're having difficulty, if

116
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,100
for no other reason than the fact that a heck of a lot of work goes into preparing them

117
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,820
on the part of our analytical team.

118
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,700
If you like this podcast, I would ask of you very kindly to go and leave a review at

119
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,180
iTunes.

120
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,060
I suppose if you don't like this podcast, you can also do that.

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,940
Lastly, if you are interested in receiving a weekly email, which comes out every Sunday

122
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,320
morning from me, that usually talks about something I've done that week, something I've

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,460
learned that week, something that is hopefully of interest to you, by all means sign up for

124
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,540
that at PeterAttiaMD.com.

125
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,140
I think that's pretty much all I want to say as we go into this.

126
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,140
With that said, please give it up for my guest today, Dr. Tom Seifried.

127
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,020
Hey Tom, how are you?

128
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Well thank you very much.

129
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,580
Well thank you so much for making time.

130
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,120
I know you've got a long lineup of students outside your office here who are kind of pissed

131
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,780
at me for sitting here taking up time when you could be answering their questions.

132
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,780
They'll recover.

133
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,900
A lot of people have been sort of reaching out to me on social media and saying, you

134
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,980
know, you've got to have Tom on, you've got to have Tom on.

135
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,900
The podcast with Dom was excellent, but there's so much more we want to understand about cancer.

136
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,820
Certainly cancer is something near and dear to my heart.

137
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,900
I did my fellowship in oncology.

138
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,540
But at the same time, I think I understand cancer far less than I understand things that

139
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,860
I didn't formally train in.

140
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,420
I think I have a better understanding, for example, of heart disease than I do of cancer.

141
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,500
So I'm really excited to explore a lot of topics today and acknowledge that we probably

142
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,680
won't even scratch the surface of all that you think about.

143
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
But all that said, how did you get interested in this?

144
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,600
We started it when I was at Yale University, Department of Neurology, where we had been

145
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,400
working on epilepsy and lipid storage diseases and ganglicides, basically, the complex lipid

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,120
molecules.

147
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,840
And one of the individuals that I was working with at that time, Robert Yu, he was my mentor

148
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,520
at the time, he had done some research on ganglicide changes in tumors.

149
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,440
And we had been looking at that.

150
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,720
And I said, you know, there was some interesting molecules in those tumor cells.

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,800
So I also knew Dennis Spencer, who was the chief of neurosurgery at the time at Yale.

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,560
And he said, why don't you come up to the operating room with me and I'll get you a

153
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
nice piece of glioblastoma from a patient.

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
You know, I'm a basic scientist.

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm not a clinician.

156
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't know what's going on.

157
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,800
So I said, sure, you come into the operating room.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,520
And it was kind of an experience that I'll never forget, having someone take a tumor

159
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
out of someone's head.

160
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,840
And they were asking me all kinds of questions like, you know, do you think we should put

161
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,280
pellets of radiation in the cavity and, you know, all this kind of stuff?

162
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,480
I didn't know.

163
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
I said, I'm here to look at the ganglicide pattern in the tumor.

164
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,960
I don't know how to treat the cancer or anything like this.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,640
But any event, we had then started making our own brain tumors in the mouse based on

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,640
the work of Harry Zimmerman, who started the first school of neuropathology in the

167
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,160
United States at Yale University in the back of the 1930s.

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,360
And he was still alive at the time.

169
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
He lived to be 98 years old or something.

170
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,120
So I was interested in doing comparative studies of glycolipids in human and mouse brain tumors

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,400
to see whether or not we can come to some common changes.

172
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,000
And that's how we got started, pretty much looking at comparative biochemical profiles

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
between human tumors and mouse tumors.

174
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,200
And there was some similarities, but there were many differences as well.

175
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,880
But we didn't get into the kind of therapeutic evaluation of these tumors until we also had

176
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,280
a huge program in epilepsy, mapping genes for epilepsy.

177
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,440
We did a lot of things at Yale.

178
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Everybody was working on the glycolipids of the tumors, glycolipids of developing brain,

179
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,840
lipid storage diseases and epilepsy.

180
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,080
I wrote a grant internally at Yale, which was rejected, asking about ketogenic diets.

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
And what year was this?

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,680
This was back in the late 70s, early 80s maybe, 1980.

183
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,280
And they said, oh, nobody's interested in ketogenic diets.

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
It's kind of passe.

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,040
This was before the work at Hopkins or?

186
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Yeah, Hopkins, John Freeman was a friend of mine too, who was the godfather of ketogenic

187
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,240
diets.

188
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,560
He was the one that saved Jim Abrams' son, Charlie.

189
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,340
And Jim was a movie director.

190
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,760
And his friend Meryl Streep made the movie First Do No Harm, which was based in part on

191
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
Jim's experience with his son.

192
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,540
But I wasn't connected at that time to Abrams or any of that stuff.

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,560
That was even before the Charlie Foundation.

194
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,320
I just had this inkling that maybe ketogenic diet would be interesting to test against

195
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,640
some of the epilepsy models that I was working with.

196
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,520
Does that mean you suspected that something to do with glucose metabolism?

197
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,720
No, nothing.

198
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,360
I just thought it was an interesting approach, a non-drug approach for seizures.

199
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
And anyway, the grant was summarily rejected.

200
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,840
So I said, well, nobody's interested in this.

201
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,800
So I left Yale and I came up to Boston College here to start a program.

202
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,600
And then we were here from then it was 10 years, 15 years later, we developed some of

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,320
the best animal models for epilepsy.

204
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,400
And we were looking at brains of biochemistry and epileptic seizures and the genes that

205
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
caused epilepsy.

206
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,920
And then one of my PhD students, Mariana Tran, says, oh, they're having a big meeting out

207
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,520
in Washington on ketogenic diets for epilepsy.

208
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,640
And maybe our model would be appropriate for this.

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,160
I said, nah, this is, you know, I says after my experience at Yale, I said, nobody's interested

210
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
in this crap anyway.

211
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,880
You're still traumatized by the grant.

212
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
So I said, they're not in it.

213
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
You know, I got a summarily rejected.

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,080
So this is nobody interested in ketogenic diets.

215
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,800
So anyway, she said, oh, so I said I had a few extra bucks in the grant.

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
So I said, OK, go on out there.

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,380
In fact, she wrote a little blurb and they funded her to go out there.

218
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,360
So she comes back and starts telling me about, wow, you can't believe what I saw out there.

219
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,480
All these guys are interested in this ketogenic diet.

220
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,040
And this guy, Jim Abrams, and he wants to start this foundation called the Charlie Foundation.

221
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,640
It was like to study epilepsy and ketogenic diets and stuff.

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,140
So I said, all right, what the hell?

223
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,080
So we started to put them on the mice.

224
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,180
And it was funny because we didn't know what we were doing.

225
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,520
But then at the same time, it was two things came together at the same time.

226
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,880
We were studying ganglicides for lipid storage diseases.

227
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,600
And there was a drug company over in England that gave us this new drug that was supposed

228
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,320
to stop ganglicide synthesis and therefore reduce the storage in the brain.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,680
Of course, at that time at Boston College, animal didn't charge me for animals, which

230
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
they do now, which is a tragedy because you can really do a lot of work.

231
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
The damn mice cost so much money and there were so fewer restrictions.

232
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,880
I mean, we followed all of the animal care protocols, but we had access to a large number.

233
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,160
So we could do experiments that you couldn't do anywhere else.

234
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,520
So when we got the drug from the company, we were feeding the drug to the mice and we

235
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
looked at the ganglify.

236
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Yeah, it's really down.

237
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
But so was the body weight.

238
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,120
And then when we put the control group in, we found out that the tumors shrunk and the

239
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,360
ganglicides were reduced from this drug.

240
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,280
But then the body weight was also reduced.

241
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,960
And the controls were also...

242
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
They're both animals being fed ad lib?

243
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Ad libitum.

244
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,880
One had the drug, one didn't.

245
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Okay.

246
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,440
So the drug somehow either reduced intake or increased expenditure?

247
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,240
We don't know, but the body weights were reduced by about 15% or 20%.

248
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,880
And the tumors were significantly reduced by about 60%.

249
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,520
So I told the company that...

250
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I just threw them on...

251
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
This was a pilot study.

252
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,320
I told the company that your drug seems to really shrink brain tumors.

253
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,600
And they go, why?

254
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,800
This is a much bigger market than, say, Tay-Sachs disease, right?

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,840
So that's when they gave me $200,000 to investigate the mechanism by which their drug was stopping

256
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
brain cancer.

257
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,080
Because I showed them the data and they were all excited.

258
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,360
So we then began to investigate this.

259
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,080
And Perna Mukherjee, Dr. Mukherjee, who worked, started with me.

260
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
I said, hey, Perna.

261
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Which I hired her specifically to start looking at this.

262
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,360
And then when we realized that, what's working?

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,960
She said, a lot of times these drugs work through calorie restriction.

264
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,640
So I said, well, why don't we put a control group?

265
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,480
We all decided, let's put a control group for body weights.

266
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
And then we just...

267
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,680
One was the guys with the drug and losing weight.

268
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,480
The other guys would just take the food away from them.

269
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
So the body weights would be absolutely identical.

270
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
So they were parafet.

271
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,840
It wasn't parafet.

272
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,080
One group was eating ad libitum and they were losing body weight.

273
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
And the other group...

274
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Oh, I see.

275
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Okay, I got it.

276
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,440
We had to restrict the calories to match the body weight.

277
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
So they're parawated.

278
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Yes, parawated.

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Yes, and then we evaluated this and the tumors were exactly the same size.

280
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,040
So it had nothing to do with the drug.

281
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,360
Even though the drug was working on the targeted molecule, it wasn't the targeted molecule

282
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
that was responsible for this.

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,760
So that's when we also decided with the epilepsy overlapping, does the ketogenic diet work

284
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,120
through calorie restriction?

285
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,200
Because many of these children that get ketogenic diets, they have very restricted calories.

286
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,000
And you have to give very small...

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,120
You can't let kids eat massive amounts of fat because invariably, John Freeman told

288
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,360
me the diet doesn't work if they just...

289
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,480
Like one out of two or 300 kids just loves to eat all this fat and the seizures don't

290
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
go away.

291
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
So we...

292
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,960
In other words, the thinking at the time was there is some amount of caloric restriction

293
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,040
that is necessary within the context of the ketosis to also affect the epileptic seizures.

294
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
Yes, absolutely.

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
But you have to be very careful because many of these children are on the growth spurt.

296
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,080
So you have to be careful on how much restriction you give.

297
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,560
And the other thing, of course, it's self-restricted.

298
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,080
There's several physiological systems in our body that when you eat a lot of fat, you just

299
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
don't eat a lot of calories.

300
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
It's a turn off.

301
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,600
It works through the vagus nerve.

302
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,040
The hormone choliscis thekinin is kind of an appetite suppressor.

303
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,440
It affects the vagus nerve, which then stops the appetite.

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,920
You don't eat as much.

305
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,880
So I have so many stories.

306
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,680
So I was sitting on a bus one day...

307
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,040
You're on the right podcast, Tom, because we don't have time restrictions.

308
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,440
Yeah, but listen.

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,240
So they made this thing called the vagal nerve stimulator.

310
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,800
And it was made by a company, I can't remember the name of it, made a fortune.

311
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,960
They would implant the stimulator into the persons who has epilepsy.

312
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,280
And it would send out things to stimulate the vagus nerve.

313
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,560
And I was sitting on the bus with this guy from Norway.

314
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,040
And he says, I said, you're putting this in the patient?

315
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,400
Yeah, we're putting this in the patient.

316
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
How does it work?

317
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, it seems to work really good.

318
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I said, how much is it?

319
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,880
And he says, well, the operation is like $4,000.

320
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,120
But the device, it was like $15,000 or $16,000.

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,640
But they were putting them in all these epileptic patients and they're working.

322
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
I said, how does it work?

323
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
He said, I don't know, but it works.

324
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,040
So I said, I didn't know.

325
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm sitting on the bus.

326
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I don't know.

327
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,840
And they went to MGM Studios down in Florida.

328
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,520
They closed the whole place down in the middle of the week in December so that they could

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,400
attract all the epileptologists to use their device to put into these patients.

330
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
It's one of these kinds of things.

331
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,800
So anyway, comes back when we were working on ketogenic diets and calorie restriction.

332
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,760
We realized that humans have this internal system to stop calories.

333
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,960
And if you don't stop the calories, invariably, you don't get the management of the seizures.

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,640
So we in our parallel studies in epilepsy with mice and cancer and all this other stuff,

335
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,820
we started to learn what's working in the patients.

336
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,600
How do we translate what's working in the patients into the mice?

337
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,360
The mice can be another source of information that we can feed back.

338
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,720
And we published this big paper on calorie restriction and that the ketogenic diet was

339
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,200
working largely through calorie restriction.

340
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,120
And maintaining low blood sugar levels was the key to maintaining control of seizures.

341
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Now if you had a...

342
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,320
I don't know if you did this experiment, but if you took animals on an equally low caloric

343
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,120
diet that was not ketogenic, so let's just say a very high carbohydrate, low fat diet,

344
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,240
where presumably glucose levels would be higher even though they would still be calorically

345
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
restricted, would you get the same anti-seizure benefit?

346
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,520
Same results, exactly.

347
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,160
So because what was happening is that when the body is restricted of calories, you then

348
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,540
make ketones.

349
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,320
So the level of ketosis was also seen in the calor...

350
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
It would be like a human doing water-only fasting.

351
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,160
So how calorically restricted did they need to be if they were not on a ketogenic diet?

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,680
40%, 30 to 5 to 40% restriction.

353
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,280
And then we did some studies in another group.

354
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,440
We found out that 35 to 40% restriction of calories in the mouse equates to a water-only

355
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
therapeutic fasting in humans.

356
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
And that's because the...

357
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Yeah, their metabolism is...

358
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,120
Right, seven or eight times higher than that of a man.

359
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
So humans can achieve much higher ketosis than a mouse can.

360
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
And the mouse...

361
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,840
So one week, a one-day water-only fast in a mouse is like a seven-day water-only fast

362
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
in a human.

363
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,640
And the blood sugars go down, the ketones go up.

364
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,880
IRBs don't allow you to fast mice that long anymore, do they?

365
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Oh yeah.

366
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,000
As long as they're healthy.

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Calorie restriction is generally a healthy thing.

368
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,120
You don't want to over-restrict because then you put into a nutritional imbalance and you

369
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,200
don't want to go to the level of what we call starvation.

370
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,680
This is another...

371
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,400
Calorie restriction is healthy up to the point where you start breaking down muscle.

372
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
If you start breaking down muscle, then you enter into a new physiological state called

373
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,160
starvation.

374
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,300
And that's very pathological.

375
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,240
You don't ever want to go to that digression.

376
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,360
So some people, they get so carried away with water-only fasting, they can enter into starvation

377
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
mode.

378
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,040
I know this for a fact because I used to spend a lot of time with George Cahill, who used

379
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,960
to run the Joslin Diabetes Centers down here in Boston.

380
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,560
And he and I would talk for hours and hours with Bud Veach at the NIH about how long people

381
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,120
can go with this transition over from therapeutic fasting into starvation.

382
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,900
And also the body builds just like anything.

383
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,000
Your body gets accustomed.

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,640
You can go a long time without eating if you're in shape, if you've done this.

385
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,920
But it depends on what your body weight is, how old you are.

386
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,160
It depends on a lot of different things, how long you can go without eating.

387
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,680
The bottom line is that we were trying to develop a therapy and figure out the mechanisms

388
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,920
by which ketogenic diets were therapeutic.

389
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,720
Going back to the Cahill stuff for a moment before we come back to that, did you have

390
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,800
a sense or did George have a sense of when those patients are in a negative nitrogen

391
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,040
balance?

392
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,960
I assume it matters as to what their starting weight is and muscle mass and things like

393
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
that.

394
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,640
But were there general rules about once you cross over that point where you're basically

395
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,520
pulling nitrogen out of the muscle?

396
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Right.

397
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,240
And he got those data actually from the 10 guys that starved to death and mace prison

398
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
in Northern Ireland.

399
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
Bobby Sands and that group actually.

400
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,240
He was there monitoring their blood work while they were dying of starvation.

401
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,480
These were prisoners that they were fasting as a protest, correct?

402
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Yes.

403
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,520
They made a movie out of it, Every Mother's Son, about that there was 10 Irishmen that

404
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
were-

405
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,600
How long did they live on average?

406
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
I think he had the data.

407
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,000
He was never able to publish it.

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,920
The British government was on top of him about that.

409
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,360
But he was able to collect the data and shared some of that stuff.

410
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
It was very interesting.

411
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
It's a horrible thing.

412
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,440
It's like one of the worst ways to die is starvation.

413
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,640
So what happens to your diaphragm is the last muscle that will be digested.

414
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,200
And there's a momentum that starts.

415
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,600
Now you have to realize that these guys that did this-

416
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,560
So they don't die of just acidosis.

417
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
It's actually the diaphragm.

418
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,000
You drown in your own body fluids, basically.

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,720
Jesus, brutal.

420
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,400
So because what happens is once your diaphragm can't work, your lungs fill up with fluids

421
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
and you drown in your own fluids.

422
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,280
And the diaphragm presumably stops working because of either the loss of muscle or the

423
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
electrolyte imbalance.

424
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,320
Yeah, both, a combination of both.

425
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
And then there's a moment, you can't stop it.

426
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Once the momentum starts-

427
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,840
It's like these horrible hiccups, right?

428
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah.

429
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,160
Once the momentum starts, it seems like they try to do an intervention on a couple of the

430
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,960
guys and they weren't able to reverse it.

431
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,840
So it was pretty horrific.

432
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,160
Now those guys were all young Irishmen in their 20s and 30s.

433
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,120
I don't know what the oldest guy was, but they lived from, I don't know, 68 to 85, 90

434
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,480
days without any food, just water.

435
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,200
But then he subsequently fasted these very obese people-

436
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
For 40 days.

437
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,160
Longer, for six months, eight months.

438
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Oh, wow.

439
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,480
He has the data.

440
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,240
One guy, a postman, lost his job, weighed 450 pounds or something, couldn't deliver

441
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
the mail.

442
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,560
So they put him on the water only fasting for six months, I think, six or eight months.

443
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,000
Guy lost 250 pounds.

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,800
This is different from the guy who, there was a single case report of a patient who

445
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,040
weighed a little over 400 pounds and did a 382 day fast.

446
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

447
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,520
But I didn't realize that was Cahill that was over-

448
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I don't know if that was Cahill.

449
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,560
There was another, there's a couple of them.

450
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,880
And he was overseeing, he showed us the data on this one guy, the postman.

451
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,800
And the issue, of course, is I don't know if he took many supplements because your body

452
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,440
fat holds a lot of vitamins, fat soluble vitamins.

453
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,920
The minerals come from your bones, the liver controls an awful lot of B vitamins and things

454
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
like this.

455
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,240
I think there were supplements over the course, but they weren't, you don't need a lot of

456
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
supplements.

457
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Your body holds all of it.

458
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,680
We evolved as a species to starve.

459
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,080
Our existence today is dependent on our ability to go long periods of time without eating.

460
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
We don't receive that anymore.

461
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
But-

462
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Yeah.

463
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,160
And it seems that our ability to access minerals and vitamins is highly dependent on our nutritional

464
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
state.

465
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,320
In other words, your need for those things tends to go up in a fed state.

466
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,240
At least according to some research I've seen.

467
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Yeah.

468
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
You're right.

469
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,680
And our ancestors were hardened people.

470
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,320
Their bodies were already acclimated to a starvation mode.

471
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,460
So they were very efficient in maintaining mineral and nutrient balances.

472
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,240
I think in our society today, and this is purely speculation, I think a lot of the foods

473
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,040
are depleted in the kinds of nutrients that we would need.

474
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,640
Therefore, some people are almost like in a starvation mode, but they're eating food

475
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,560
that has no nutritional value.

476
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,520
And consequently, you store a lot of fat.

477
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Because the body doesn't usually get rid of sugar.

478
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,080
As I said, sugar is stored.

479
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,480
It's not, you know, pea out sugar unless you have type 1 diabetes or something.

480
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
The body has all these filtration systems to keep carbs, which is then transferred to

481
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,440
fat and stored as fat.

482
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,880
That's our energy to keep us alive when there's no food.

483
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,840
But all these ideas and things were developing when we were doing the epilepsy studies.

484
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,560
And it became clear that calorie restriction was a key form, key mechanism by which the

485
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,640
ketogenic diet was working.

486
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,920
And we have since then seen in numerous children with epilepsy that breakthrough seizures

487
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,520
will occur when blood sugar spikes.

488
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,960
Define spike in that very specific case.

489
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,840
How high does it need to be in milligrams per deciliter?

490
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
Yeah, it doesn't really...

491
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,440
For managing epilepsy, there's many cases where it just has to go a little bit above

492
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,760
the baseline.

493
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,440
So kids will have a very low 70, 68, 65 milligrams per deciliter.

494
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,260
They'll grab a cupcake at a party or whatever and spikes up to 120 or whatever.

495
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,920
And then you'll get a breakthrough seizure.

496
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,540
And do you believe that it is the absolute value of 120 in that case?

497
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,620
Or do you believe it's the D by DT, meaning the rate of change of the glucose?

498
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
We can't know that.

499
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,300
It hasn't been done effectively.

500
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,820
All we know is from the clinicians and the nurses that have told me all this information.

501
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,540
And of course, when your child has a breakthrough seizure, nobody likes to see a kid seizing.

502
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
I mean, it's very...

503
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
It's traumatic.

504
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,620
It's not a pleasant thing.

505
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,460
So once they realize that the kids have to maintain this very stable, the parents are

506
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,100
very, very restrictive of these kids.

507
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,160
Because they don't want to see their child seize.

508
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,620
So they're very restrictive.

509
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,540
So when we do the same thing for cancer, the problem with cancer is you don't see a breakthrough

510
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
seizure.

511
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,460
You don't see a group of tumor cells starting to grow faster.

512
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,260
You don't see the immediate effects, but they're there, but you just can't see them.

513
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,340
With epilepsy, you have a very visible, clear indication that something went wrong.

514
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,420
And invariably, there's a spike in glucose.

515
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,180
Now, what's very interesting is in these kids, they could be maintained for months without

516
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,740
a single seizure.

517
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,740
And then one drink of grape juice or whatever the hell, boom, breakthrough seizure within

518
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,500
sometimes minutes from the time you took the...

519
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
So it's a very...

520
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,580
They can flip back, but then they can also get back on track again.

521
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,220
They don't have a large number of seizures.

522
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
They can just...

523
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,380
They can get back on track.

524
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,460
It is a very sensitive system in our brains.

525
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,340
Then as John told me, John Freeman, he says, we don't understand that if a kid is maintained

526
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,260
seizure free or minimal seizures for long periods of time on ketogenic diets, and then

527
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,220
we remove the diet, they seem to be managed.

528
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,460
In other words, they don't return to their multiple seizures that they would have had

529
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,660
every day.

530
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,620
So he doesn't know if it was because the diet did something fundamental or they outgrew

531
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,900
the seizure or whatever.

532
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,020
Again, these are areas in epilepsy that are under active investigation by a lot of...

533
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
But it's interesting.

534
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
It's almost like a reset.

535
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,100
One of the things that impressed me about reading the case studies of these very, very

536
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,700
long fasts is that in the reports that are published several years later, many of the

537
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,820
subjects maintain their new weight reduced state, which is a bit counterintuitive based

538
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,040
on what we know today about traditional dieting approaches where everybody will return back

539
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,460
to baseline.

540
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,520
And so it begs the question, right?

541
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,340
When you starve this person for six months, do they completely change the way they eat

542
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,340
on the other side because of a behavioral shift or is it a physiologic shift?

543
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,740
Meaning their metabolism has been kind of quote unquote fixed.

544
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Yeah.

545
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Well, I think it's probably a combination of both.

546
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,860
I mean, again, these are very complicated physiological processes.

547
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,040
They call it the thrifty gene.

548
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
That was a term.

549
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
It's not one gene.

550
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,860
It's like the thrifty physiology.

551
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,000
If you do yo-yo dieting, you can be screwed up for a long period of time.

552
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,120
Those things all have loose ends.

553
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,440
There's nothing that we have found that's absolutely consistent in all patients all

554
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,500
the time when it comes to those kinds of things.

555
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,540
And that's why they're always interesting to talk about because someone always has some

556
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,100
new idea about something that they've seen.

557
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,500
Kind of fits in a little bit with what everybody else is.

558
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,740
I don't really dwell, engage in those kinds of things as far as our research is concerned.

559
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,080
We know about them.

560
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,160
We talk about them, but we don't other than the calorie restriction that we introduce

561
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,800
into the mice.

562
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,660
And then when we found out that the calorie restriction and the ketogenic diets were working,

563
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,600
so people say, well, why don't you just do calorie restriction because cancer, back to

564
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,420
cancer, we don't like to restrict the term restriction.

565
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,460
Even the term, you already got a disease now you have to be restricted.

566
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,420
So ketogenic diets are a little, takes the sting out of a therapeutic fast and they can

567
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,300
also replicate some of the same physiological changes.

568
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,160
The key is to lower the blood sugar and elevate the ketones.

569
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,360
And that's what ketogenic diets do for managing epilepsy.

570
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,260
And they do the same thing for cancer.

571
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,220
The issue, of course, is we don't know the mechanism by which lowering glucose and elevating

572
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,300
ketones is responsible for the management of the seizure.

573
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,220
This is under an active investigation by a lot of labs.

574
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220
The actual mechanism, is it the elevation of the ketones?

575
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Is it the reduction of the glucose?

576
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,500
Or is it some combination of the two?

577
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,020
But for cancer, it becomes very clear.

578
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,420
The mechanism of action is very clear for how this kills cancer cells.

579
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,580
It's based on Otto Warburg's theory.

580
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,060
So when we started to do this and realized that calorie restriction was shrinking these

581
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,900
tumors down massively, based on the drug that I told you about, because it was working through

582
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
calorie restriction.

583
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,860
Then I said, how is calorie restriction stopping tumors?

584
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,320
And then we realized that it was lowering blood sugar.

585
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,220
So we started measuring blood sugar in these calorie restricted mice and measuring ketones.

586
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,740
And we were seeing that we were getting these major shifts.

587
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,900
And then we said, then it became clear, who is the guy who did this or thought about it

588
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
was Warburg.

589
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,660
Now he wasn't doing ketogenic diets.

590
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,540
Had he done and known about that, I think he would have been able to crack this cancer

591
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,620
thing far, far earlier than it.

592
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,620
He didn't do ketogenic.

593
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,780
He didn't know anything about that.

594
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,820
So let's back up for a moment for people.

595
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,940
I think most people listening probably know what the Warburg effect is and who Warburg

596
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
was.

597
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,380
But maybe just give us a moment of setting the stage for what his observation was that

598
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
now bears his name.

599
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,380
Well, his interest was in biochemistry.

600
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,380
He was a classical chemist, biochemist in his time.

601
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,640
And he began to look at the metabolism of tumors.

602
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:19,040
So he made an observation, which was solidified that cancer cells continue to do an ancient

603
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,000
fermentation metabolism, even in the presence of oxygen.

604
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,480
So this, the Pasteur effect from Louis Pasteur with the yeast was that yeast will ferment.

605
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,820
They evolved, that organism evolved to be able to ferment, get energy in the absence

606
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,080
of oxygen.

607
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,680
But when as soon as oxygen came into the presence, they stopped fermenting and they immediately

608
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,080
started respiring.

609
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,960
They have a system that can do that.

610
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,240
So the Pasteur effect was basically the termination of fermentation in the presence of oxygen.

611
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,880
That was the Pasteur effect and it was repeated in all these yeast strains and this kind of

612
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
thing.

613
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,380
And that was a fundamental biochemical advancement, so to say.

614
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,680
But Warburg recognized, he knew Pasteur's work very, very well.

615
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,800
And then he said, geez, these cancer cells, man, they continue to throw out lactic acid,

616
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,600
even in the presence of 100% oxygen.

617
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,040
So he grew cancer cells in 100% oxygen and they were still making lactic acid.

618
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,360
So clearly the Pasteur effect wasn't working.

619
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,320
I'll just interject for a moment to explain something to the listener and we'll probably

620
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,440
have a picture of this.

621
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,520
But of course, you take glucose to pyruvate in the cytoplasm.

622
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,940
And that's a, you know, that yields a couple of units of ATP.

623
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,120
And then you have sort of a choice of what you're going to do with that pyruvate.

624
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,680
If your demand for ATP is incredibly quick, usually exceeding the capacity of oxygen to

625
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,300
get into the cell, you'll make lactate.

626
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,800
And that's also relatively inefficient, meaning you don't get that much more ATP.

627
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,240
I think you get another two molecules of ATP per unit of pyruvate, but at least you have

628
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,000
the advantage of saying, I'm not limited by oxygen.

629
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Alternatively, if oxygen is plentiful and more importantly, if the demand for ATP is

630
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,880
not excessive, you can shuttle that pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and the mitochondria and you

631
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,280
can generate over 30 units of ATP.

632
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,620
And so what you're saying is there is an observation which said, hey, if I put this

633
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,480
cell in the presence of lots of oxygen, it really shouldn't make much lactate.

634
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Right.

635
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,800
And that's what he finds when you take normal tissue like kidney slices or muscle slices

636
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,760
or liver, you grow them in 100% oxygen and they produce minimal, barely detectable lactate.

637
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,240
There's always some going to be produced in every tissue, but basically it's very minimal,

638
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,400
but the cancer cell continues to dump out massive amounts of lactic acid, even in the

639
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,880
presence of 100% oxygen.

640
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
So this was a phenomenon.

641
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,240
And he saw this over and over again.

642
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,440
It didn't make any difference whether it was a human tumor, a mouse tumor, rat tumor.

643
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,360
They were all doing this same kind of thing.

644
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,880
So what he concluded from this was that their respiratory system was defective because like

645
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,600
you just said, if pyruvate...

646
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,280
Now that's the Emden-Meierhoff pathway going from glucose to pyruvate.

647
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,700
Pyruvate is the end of that.

648
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,600
So then the opportunity is that the pyruvate would enter into the mitochondria under oxygenated

649
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,880
conditions and be fully oxidized to water and CO2.

650
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,960
And oxygen is the acceptor of the electrons to form the water.

651
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,120
And the carbons are coming from the foods that we metabolized.

652
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,920
But the cancer cell was dumping out large amounts of this lactic acid.

653
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,480
So why would a cancer cell dump out lactic acid?

654
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,920
And it became clear to Warburg through a variety of experiments that the respiratory system

655
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,840
was defective in these cells.

656
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Let's just clarify that.

657
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,880
Many people, when they hear that, will assume...

658
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,760
We think respiratory system, we think of lungs.

659
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,840
What you really mean is the mitochondrial machinery that undergoes what we call cellular

660
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
respiration.

661
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,440
The lungs are bringing in the oxygen...

662
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,600
The oxygen and getting rid of the CO2 that enables...

663
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,840
That enables all the cells, the majority of our cells in the body, to perform this

664
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,800
very efficient form of energy production, which then frees up the cells to do their

665
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,440
sophisticated behaviors.

666
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,040
Liver cells do what they do, kidney cells, brain cells.

667
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,400
They all do what they do because they have this very efficient energetic system that's

668
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
working called respiration.

669
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,680
The lungs are just the facilitators of the body to get the good air in and the bad air

670
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,020
out.

671
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:27,380
So basically, the cancer cell was continuing to produce massive amounts of lactic acid,

672
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,480
despite the fact that there was all this...

673
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,260
So he was then looking at the mitochondria, noticing that there were some defects in these

674
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
kinds of things.

675
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,860
But he wasn't at the level of electron microscopy or this.

676
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,860
He just made the...

677
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
What year?

678
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
This is in the 1920s?

679
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
Nineteen-fifties.

680
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,540
Mostly late 20s, 30s, 40s, all the way up to the 50s.

681
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,500
I think he stopped his research maybe in the early 60s.

682
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,100
Now he won a Nobel Prize, didn't he?

683
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,900
Was it for the description of this phenomenon?

684
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
No.

685
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,420
It was for the discovery of cytochrome c oxidase, which is actually one of the key enzymes in

686
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,060
the electron transport chain.

687
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,620
Cells generate energy through respiration.

688
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,380
So he was nominated other times.

689
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,060
And there's still some controversy about how many times he had been nominated for the work

690
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,340
on cancer, but never to achieve another Nobel Prize.

691
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,380
But he was considered one of the dominant biochemists in the 20th century.

692
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,820
And he had very strong ideas and very excellent quantitative measurements for this.

693
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,980
A lot of his work was reproduced by dozens and dozens of scientists.

694
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,100
So that was the fundamental observation.

695
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,060
But he then extended this to the theory that why are the cells producing all this lactic

696
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,380
acid?

697
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,000
Because the organelle that is supposed to be involved is defective.

698
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This led to a lot of controversy.

699
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What do you mean, defect?

700
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
How defective?

701
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What do you mean?

702
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,880
Much later, Pete Peterson from Johns Hopkins had done a magnificent job in collating all

703
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,520
this information.

704
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,200
And he found that in every kind of a cancer cell, no matter what kind of it is, there

705
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,240
was some defect in the number structure or function of the mitochondria.

706
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,840
And it could vary.

707
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,440
So some cancer cells have very few mitochondria, but they look normal.

708
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,640
Very few of them.

709
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,920
Other tumor cells clearly have a lot of mitochondria, but they look abnormal.

710
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,640
So whatever it was, it was something to do with an impairment of the respiratory system

711
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,080
within the cell.

712
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,320
And if the cell can't generate energy through normal respiration, then it has to ferment.

713
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,660
There's no other way they can get the energy.

714
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:30,080
So it became the Warburg effect, which everybody talks about, is one of the biggest problems

715
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,460
in this whole thing.

716
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,720
Because Warburg in his paper clearly said that aerobic glycolysis, or what they call

717
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,320
the Warburg effect, is a secondary problem that's subjected to many, many variances in

718
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
the environment.

719
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
But everybody focuses on this.

720
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
He said the real issue is the damage to the respiration.

721
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,600
And everybody says, no, respiration is normal in cancer cells.

722
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,140
And why would they say it's normal?

723
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,960
Because they started doing cells in culture rather than looking at the tissues themselves.

724
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
And once you start doing culture work, you're taking cells from a tissue and separating

725
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,760
them and growing them as if they were microorganisms in a culture dish.

726
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,040
Well, this changes everything.

727
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,600
They're no longer connected to each other.

728
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,360
They're growing in some artificial fluid.

729
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,920
And they're doing things that they sometimes do and sometimes not do in the real world.

730
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,880
So you make a lot of assumptions about things based on a system that itself is artifactual.

731
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,080
So let me ask a couple of technical questions.

732
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,720
Obviously measuring the amount of lactate or hydrogen ion that's produced is a way to

733
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,920
give us an indication of how much anaerobic metabolism is taking place.

734
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,040
If you're not in cell culture, how do you quantify the amount of aerobic respiration?

735
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,760
You look at the amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of lactic acid produced.

736
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,640
So if you're doing aerobic respiration, you're consuming a lot of oxygen and producing very

737
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,000
little lactate.

738
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,920
And then you can quantitate the amount of ATP being produced per milliliter of oxygen

739
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,520
that you consume.

740
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,600
And according to this, this can vary from anywhere from seven ATP units to nine, depending

741
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
on the system.

742
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,480
But it's, you know, Warburg used the number seven based on his data at that time.

743
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,680
So you could calculate the total amount of ATP being produced in the cell based on its

744
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,320
oxygen consumption and its lactic acid production.

745
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,800
And Warburg, did he ever do this in situ?

746
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Yes.

747
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,380
He did it in slices and then he did it in cell culture as well.

748
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,400
So he created some of his own problems as well, switching from one to the other.

749
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,320
The concern that we have now is that many cells in culture look like they're consuming

750
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,940
a lot of oxygen.

751
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,020
And they're making lactic acid, but they're consuming a lot of oxygen.

752
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,020
So like you said-

753
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,320
So suggesting that they're doing both, which is still a bit odd.

754
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Yeah, right.

755
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,700
Well, that was Sidney Winehouse's argument.

756
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,660
His argument was the cancer cell needs so much energy that respiration by itself can't

757
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
be sufficient.

758
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,680
So they have to ferment and respire at the same time.

759
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,600
And that made everybody feel that, yeah, Warburg was wrong.

760
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,700
They do have good respiration, but they just need so much more energy.

761
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,840
They need to ferment at the same time.

762
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,200
But the work from Pete Peterson showed that they have defective respiration.

763
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,700
So I mean, they have defective mitochondria, structure, number, and function, besides many

764
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,700
other studies have shown.

765
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,580
So you know that they can't be doing oxidative phosphorylation or respiration because they're

766
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,280
very organelle that is needed for that is deficient in some way.

767
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,580
And that could be many different ways.

768
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:26,340
As I said, there's no one, all cancer cells, all cancer cells have a defect in respiration.

769
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:30,720
How that defect came about can vary from one type of cancer to another.

770
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,980
So one has to recognize that.

771
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,060
So not every cancer cell will have the exact same defect in respiration in the mitochondria.

772
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,880
Some will have very few mitochondria.

773
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,380
So they just don't have quantitatively enough organelles to do respiration.

774
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,400
But what seems to be there seems to be functional, partially functional.

775
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,540
Other cells, as I said, are loaded with mitochondria.

776
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,080
But when you look at them, they're morphologically abnormal.

777
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,120
So structure dictates function.

778
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,820
In biology, we know that structure dictates function.

779
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,180
So if the structure of the organelle is abnormal, you know that the function of that organelle

780
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,460
is not going to be normal.

781
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,820
And is the idea that those mutations were acquired?

782
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,520
Oh, I wouldn't call them mutations.

783
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
They would call them defects.

784
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Now, you can have a mutation.

785
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,420
In other words, the genome is unaffected in some of those cases?

786
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,780
Yes, we've done that.

787
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,120
We sequenced the entire genome of five different independently derived cancers from mouse,

788
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,220
all derived from different origins.

789
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,020
And we didn't find a single genetic abnormality, what we call pathogenic, where the mutation

790
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,080
would actually have an effect on a function.

791
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,940
And we didn't find a single one.

792
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
So that's all.

793
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,760
So let's take, maybe take a step back and for the listener again, we'll go over some

794
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,460
of the basics of genetics.

795
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,360
Because I think that for many people, there's an understanding that, I mean, by definition,

796
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:52,940
a cancer has a mutation that renders it incapable of listening to normal cell signaling.

797
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,880
Do you have a sense broadly of what amount of human cancers arise from germline mutations

798
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,500
rather than somatic mutations?

799
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,780
It's obviously very small, but I don't know what the number is.

800
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,860
Well, they say it's about five to 6%.

801
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Oh, it's that high.

802
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Okay.

803
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,660
And you hear about them, the BRCA1, BRCA2, Lefram, NEP53.

804
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,740
Lynch syndrome, et cetera.

805
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,220
But when we looked into those so-called inherited risks, we call them inherited risk factors.

806
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,660
None of them have ever been 100% penetrant, which means that every person having that

807
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
gene must express...

808
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,980
They're not purely deterministic.

809
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
Yeah.

810
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,980
They're not deterministic.

811
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,780
And as Warburg said, there are many secondary causes of cancer, but there's only one primary

812
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
cause.

813
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,900
The primary cause is the damage to the respiratory system.

814
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,340
So if the inherited mutation damages the respiratory system of the cell, the probability of cancer

815
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,620
is a real possibility.

816
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,620
So, because everybody who has Lefram, any tumors or BRCA1 tumors or whatever, they all

817
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,980
are all fermenters.

818
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,100
So the fermentation metabolism is there in every cancer.

819
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,780
But there are some people that have the exact same mutation that the other person has, but

820
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,960
they never develop a tumor because for whatever reason, in that person, that mutation did

821
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,780
not damage the respiration.

822
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,420
That could be an environmental suppressive effect or another gene in the genome that

823
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,180
prevents the inherited mutation from damaging the respiration.

824
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,860
We don't know that.

825
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,120
So we only know that you don't get cancer if your mitochondria remain healthy.

826
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,620
That's what we know.

827
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,900
So that's an important...

828
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,740
Because that goes back to the prevention issue.

829
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,740
How do you prevent cancer?

830
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,500
You prevent cancer by keeping your mitochondria healthy.

831
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
How do you do that?

832
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Well, you avoid...

833
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:36,380
If you can avoid those risk factors, mostly from the environment, like viral infections,

834
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,180
intermittent hypoxia, radiation exposure, carcinogenic exposure, all these different

835
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,020
things, every one of those things can damage respiration in a population of cells, then

836
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,360
leading to cancer.

837
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,880
Because we know of no cancer that has normal respiration.

838
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,500
But when you grow them in culture, people say, yeah, they have normal respiration.

839
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,260
They're taken in oxygen, so therefore, a warburg is wrong.

840
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,940
But when you look at the structure in the vivo, and you look at the tissues, and you

841
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,260
look at the actual architecture of the tissue, invariably, you find damage to the respiration,

842
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,300
damage to the structure and function of mitochondria.

843
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,660
So what the field has done is put more credibility into the results from cell culture work than

844
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,260
into the actual tissues that people see and look under the microscope and look at.

845
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,700
Because the warburg effect was largely forgotten for many years after his initial observation,

846
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
right?

847
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Yeah.

848
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
A lot of what he did was forgotten.

849
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,220
And Pete Peterson was one of the few guys that kept the fire burning.

850
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Because a lot of the...

851
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,140
Because as I said, when Watson and Crick discovered the DNA as the origin of the genetic material,

852
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,140
but it wasn't only them.

853
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,500
There was a whole group of other people that were doing it.

854
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,420
They just weren't acknowledged as much.

855
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,420
Yeah.

856
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,900
And then the field ran off into that.

857
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,220
And they also knew that there were chromosomal abnormalities in some cancers.

858
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,260
So it made it clear that, hey, you know, these genomic defects in the tumor cells are

859
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,640
likely the real origin of the disease.

860
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,840
So the whole field, more or less, shifted away from the traditional biochemical analysis

861
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,020
to the more molecular biology analysis.

862
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,940
And therefore, you find more and more mutations, more and more genetic defects, and all these

863
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,900
kinds of things, leading people to believe that these were the causes of the disease.

864
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,180
And a lot of really nice experiments were done where they would introduce mutant viruses,

865
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,260
virus particles into cells, and they would integrate into the nuclear genome.

866
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,900
And then you'd see the cancer cells lose, become transformed into a neoplastic kind

867
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,860
of a cell, giving the appearance that this was a cause effect.

868
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,140
They didn't realize that those same viruses went into the mitochondria and blew out the

869
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,420
respiration.

870
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,500
So that wasn't even considered as possible.

871
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,820
If the viruses are doing that, presumably they're integrating into the genome?

872
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,820
Yeah.

873
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,820
Well, they would do it both ways.

874
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
They can do it a lot of different ways.

875
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,260
So sometimes the viruses actually infect directly into the mitochondria.

876
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,700
They produce proteins in the mitochondria that screw up the electron transport chain.

877
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,140
Other times, the virus is integrated into the nuclear genome, producing a protein product

878
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,780
that then disrupts the mitochondria.

879
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,380
Either way, the mitochondria disrupt it, whether if it's a direct effect of the virus replicating

880
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,460
inside the organelle, or it's an effect of a product produced by the virus that then

881
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,060
goes and disrupts the organelle.

882
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,620
And this is what we're finding for the majority of these situations.

883
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,220
So even the inherited mutations that we look at, they disrupt mitochondrial function.

884
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,380
And if they disrupt mitochondrial function, you are at risk for developing a neoplasm

885
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,460
in that particular population of cells.

886
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,020
There are some cancers that don't follow that, correct?

887
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,580
I mean, aren't there some cancers that have normal mitochondria?

888
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,660
We haven't found any, because the evidence for that is that they're all fermenting.

889
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,880
We haven't found the cancer that doesn't ferment.

890
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,920
So if the cancer is fermenting, it's obviously not respiring.

891
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,100
If it's respiration would be normal, it shouldn't be fermenting.

892
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,160
As a matter of fact, Dean Burke did this kind of a study way back in the 50s.

893
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,280
He went and looked at various kinds of hepatomas, because there was an article that was published

894
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,040
to say that there was this very low, slow-growing hepatoma that did not ferment, which was

895
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,160
directly related to your question.

896
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,360
But Burke, who was at the head of the NCI at the time, studied these things in massive

897
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:08,880
detail and was able to show that the slowest-growing tumor did have a significant elevation of

898
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,800
lactic acid production over a normal cell.

899
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,160
But you had to look at it really carefully and do the experiments over extended periods

900
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
of time.

901
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,240
So even the slowest of the slowest-growing tumors, guys that would be maybe considered

902
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,160
benign, were still making lactic acid.

903
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,920
Another interesting thing was the crown gall tumors in plants.

904
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,040
This is another interesting ... Plants have cancer, but they don't metastasize.

905
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,640
They just grow these tumors.

906
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,160
People back in the 30s were testing Warburg's theory in these plants, and they all had damaged

907
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,680
respiration and they were fermenting just like the mouse tumors.

908
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,280
When you say respiration, you mean photosynthetic respiration?

909
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,280
No.

910
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
No, plants have both.

911
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,000
Plants can get energy from chloroplasts to build carbohydrates, but they also have mitochondria.

912
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,240
Oh, I didn't realize that.

913
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,280
So their carbon fixation obviously comes from photosynthesis.

914
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,680
But when they make their equivalent of starch, they had an effect on-

915
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Yes.

916
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,020
So they will burn their own fuels to generate respiratory energy.

917
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,320
But they also have dysmorphic cell growth, and they've called these crown gall tumors.

918
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,920
You see them sometimes on the side of trees and things.

919
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,640
So people back in the day analyzed the biochemistry of these things, and they also found that

920
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,280
they were following Warburg's metabolic profile.

921
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,360
But they didn't metastasize.

922
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,800
The reason they don't metastasize is they don't have an immune system.

923
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,120
It turns out that from our work and the work of others, the metastatic cell is actually

924
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,800
part of our immune system.

925
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,480
So macrophages and leukocytes, these are the cells that have the genetic capabilities of

926
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,080
moving around the body, entering into tissues.

927
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,680
This is what they do.

928
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Plants don't have that.

929
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,240
Plants don't have that kind of an immune system.

930
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,140
So they don't metastasize.

931
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,600
They grow in place.

932
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,320
But humans and other animals, of course, that have these cells of the immune system, therefore

933
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,000
they can get metastatic cancer.

934
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,800
So before we get to that, because I do have a number of questions about that topic, another

935
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:06,240
argument that's been proposed for the Warburg effect is the need for cellular building blocks.

936
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:13,280
The other thing that the tumor is doing above and beyond its non-tumorous cell mate is growing.

937
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,080
And although not necessarily faster than a regular cell, it certainly grows in a less

938
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,460
regulated way, and therefore it's going to proliferate.

939
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:25,660
So van der Heiden and I think Lou Cantley and Craig Thompson wrote that paper in 2009

940
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,180
that is, I'm sure you're familiar with, there's a science paper, I believe, and they proposed

941
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,820
this other explanation, which was, look, it's not just an energetic thing.

942
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,580
In fact, I don't recall if they said it's not just or it's not even about the energetics,

943
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:43,580
but the point here was this is where you get building blocks to make cells grow.

944
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,900
Do you think it's possible that both of these are correct?

945
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Yeah.

946
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:53,120
In the process of upregulating the Enden-Meierhof pathway, you are going to get the carbons for

947
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
building blocks.

948
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,660
At the same time, you're going to get some energy.

949
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,900
Now through the Piruve-Kaines system.

950
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,820
However, this is very interesting.

951
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:08,700
But they deviate from the path from Warburg's theory in saying that respiration is normal.

952
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,020
They think there's nothing wrong with the mitochondria.

953
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,220
They've said that many times.

954
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,620
Craig Thompson has said this.

955
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,740
You have to ignore a massive amount of evidence to make those kinds of statements.

956
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,340
You just have to ignore everything that Pete Peterson has done, which is a life's work

957
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,860
showing that the mitochondria have no idea, but he doesn't mention that.

958
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,340
They don't discuss Pete Peterson's massive amount of evidence.

959
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,340
But you're right.

960
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,780
In order for a cell to grow, you need a lot of building blocks and you need carbon.

961
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,980
Where's the carbon coming from this?

962
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,740
And it's coming from both the pentose pathway and the glycolytic pathway, and it's also

963
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,340
coming from glutamine.

964
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,660
So these cancer cells are sucking down glutamine.

965
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,140
So you're getting the amide nitrogen to form the nucleotides.

966
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,580
You're getting the glutamate that then goes into anaplerosis in the TCA cycle.

967
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,340
So between glucose and glutamine, you aren't getting all of the building blocks that you

968
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,580
need for rapid cell division.

969
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,940
But where's the energy coming from?

970
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,980
Okay, without energy, nothing grows.

971
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,520
Nothing can live without ATP.

972
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,740
So where is the energy coming from?

973
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,300
And this is our thing.

974
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:12,940
So we, myself, and Christos, Chernopoulos, and Hungary, I proposed this a long time ago

975
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:19,060
on a purely theoretical basis, having been convinced that Warburg was right, that the

976
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,780
respiration of all cancer cells is damaged to some extent.

977
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,020
So if that's the case, the Warburg effect was only the glucose part of the puzzle.

978
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,280
It wasn't the glutamine part of the puzzle.

979
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,300
So now with our new information, we know that most of the ATP in the cancer is coming from

980
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:41,040
substrate-level phosphorylation in the mitochondria, which is disconnected from oxidative phosphorylation.

981
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,560
So what we have now is the missing link in Warburg's basic theory.

982
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,000
So explain what SLP is.

983
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,480
Substrate-level phosphorylation is the production of ATP when you move a phosphate group from

984
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,860
an organic substrate onto an ADP molecule.

985
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,720
So it's an ancient way of generating energy.

986
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,840
In other words, it's an organic molecule that's an electron acceptor rather than oxygen.

987
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Right.

988
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,240
So instead of going through the electron transport chain where you use NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH

989
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,920
as electron transporters.

990
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,280
Well, electron donors.

991
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,400
Electron donors.

992
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,560
You can do a very quick trick where you take an ADP and restore it, meaning it has two

993
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,480
phosphates, you restore it to an ATP by using an organic molecule to donate a phosphate.

994
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,200
Well, for substrate-level phosphorylation.

995
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Yes, yes.

996
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,780
So succinyl CoA has a phosphate group on a serine inside the protein itself, and that

997
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,420
phosphate group is then donated to ADP.

998
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,820
Use GDP, make GTP, both.

999
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,340
Depends on the situation.

1000
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,540
But in cancer cells, it's ATP.

1001
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:50,460
So you're moving phosphate groups from an organic substrate onto the ADP as the acceptor.

1002
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,860
And you can generate massive amounts of energy from that process, which can replace the level

1003
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,320
of lost energy from oxidative phosphorylation.

1004
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,100
And does that occur inside the mitochondria, inside the inner matrix?

1005
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Yes.

1006
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,980
Yeah, it's in the matrix.

1007
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,460
So you're going to be blowing out a lot of...

1008
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,460
You're going to make a lot of ATP.

1009
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,900
It's going to just replace.

1010
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,260
In the normal cell, you're making most of the ATP from oxidative phosphorylation.

1011
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,780
But in the cancer cell, you're making most of it from substrate-level phosphorylation,

1012
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,020
inside the same organelle.

1013
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,840
Why don't our cells do this under demand?

1014
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,740
So if we jumped up and down and did 25 burpees right now, we would very quickly exceed our

1015
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,900
oxidative capacity for respiration, and we'd start making a bunch of lactate.

1016
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,580
Why aren't we also undergoing SLP?

1017
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,740
Well, we do, in the heart muscles.

1018
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,740
They do.

1019
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,660
They've done various cardiac restrictions and things like that.

1020
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,620
And a lot of this has been worked out in the heart.

1021
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,540
So it does happen.

1022
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,020
We do do substrate-level phosphorylation.

1023
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,060
But it only can be done for short periods of time.

1024
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,340
It can't be done extensively.

1025
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,220
You can't replace oxidative phosphorylation under normal conditions with substrate-level

1026
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,220
phosphorylation.

1027
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,020
When you hold your breath, you're going to be able to survive for a certain period of

1028
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,020
time.

1029
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,020
Lactic acid builds up.

1030
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,000
I mean, this was shown by Hosh Kotska when he did some incredibly interesting experiments

1031
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,280
trying to hold various aquatic animals underwater and looking at the metabolic changes that

1032
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,320
occurred.

1033
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,820
So seals, porpoises, turtles, these kinds of things.

1034
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,020
He strapped them to a board, held them underwater, and then he would measure all these metabolites

1035
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
in the bloodstream.

1036
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,520
Now, these were animals that actually could live underwater.

1037
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,200
If they did it to us, we'd all be dead, right?

1038
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,680
We couldn't live that long, but five minutes at the most.

1039
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,760
But these animals could live 10, 15, 20 minutes being held underwater, and they weren't breathing.

1040
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,720
Of course, now they were stressed out because they were strapped to a board.

1041
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,240
The bottom line is he started measuring all these metabolites in the bloodstream.

1042
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,320
Lactic acid goes right through the massive amount.

1043
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,240
I'd expect that, right?

1044
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,120
And succinic acid is another...

1045
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,720
So succinic acid is part of the...in the electron...in the TCA cycle, is a powerful stimulatory towards

1046
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,720
oxidative phosphorylation.

1047
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,560
And it was being dumped out into the circulation.

1048
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,000
So it wasn't being oxidized.

1049
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,700
So he claimed that it was amino acid fermentation that was doing this.

1050
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:05,340
So the body was grabbing amino acids and metabolizing them and generating energy through

1051
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,300
substrate level phosphorylation.

1052
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,260
Well it turns out the cancer cell is doing this in a massive amount because they don't

1053
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,260
have the oxfos.

1054
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,420
So you look at cancer cells and they're dumping out succinic acid.

1055
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,780
And succinic acid stabilizes HIF1 alpha, so you can continue to up the transcription factors

1056
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,720
for driving fermentation.

1057
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,580
So this whole thing is just a massive shift from oxfos to substrate level phosphorylation.

1058
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,220
Does creatine phosphate fit into that SLP pathway or is that totally separate?

1059
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,620
No, I'm not sure about that.

1060
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,740
It could be a source of the phosphate groups, but I haven't looked into that.

1061
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,780
Dominick may know a lot more about that than I do.

1062
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,260
So when you go back to sort of...there's an undercurrent here to what we're talking about,

1063
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,980
which is the view that you hold is the minority view today.

1064
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,980
It sounds like...

1065
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,900
Just...it's only...it's just a matter of time, okay?

1066
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,180
Why do you think that is?

1067
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,020
What do you think is the...

1068
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,420
I know people want to come up with conspiracy theories and that's sort of one of the things

1069
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,380
about social media that I find frustrating is people always want a conspiracy theory

1070
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,380
to be the explanation.

1071
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,300
Like, oh, the drug companies don't want this to be true or something.

1072
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,260
I find those things hard to believe.

1073
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:17,540
Do you think there's a better explanation for why these hypotheses are not being investigated

1074
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,580
with the rigor that maybe they should be?

1075
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,980
Well, you have to look at the discipline of the individuals that are working on the project.

1076
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,980
Okay.

1077
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,420
Most of the people doing cancer research are molecular biologists, which they are.

1078
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,340
You have that perspective on the nature of the problem.

1079
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,140
So you don't look at respiration directly.

1080
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,860
You look at gene expression profiles that may be directly or indirectly related to that,

1081
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,580
and then you make claims about what's going on.

1082
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:46,380
So most of the people are of a discipline that says that genes are changed and not looking

1083
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,620
at the actual consumption of oxygen and like, production of lactic acid, not looking at

1084
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,540
what Warburg actually looked at.

1085
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,620
Then you have a very different explanation for what's happening.

1086
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,660
So a lot of people today look at, use the seahorse instrument to measure oxygen consumption.

1087
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,920
And when you put cancer cells and tumor cells, normal cells into a dish, they're all taking

1088
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,460
up oxygen similarly, and therefore Warburg must be wrong.

1089
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:15,020
Warburg also said that tumor cells and normal cells, some will take up oxygen at the same

1090
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:19,260
rate, except the tumor cell is uncoupled and the normal cell is not uncoupled, which means

1091
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,060
that the oxygen uptake in the tumor cell is not linked directly to ATP production.

1092
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,440
People ignore that.

1093
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,980
So they just don't ... And some of the most beautiful experiments ...

1094
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,860
How would one measure that?

1095
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,300
ATP is very tricky to measure, ATP production.

1096
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,140
No, ATP can be measured.

1097
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,460
The problem is that what's the origin of it?

1098
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,460
Well, that's what I mean.

1099
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,500
Isolating ... So let's say you have a tumor cell and a non-tumor cell, and they're both

1100
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:49,220
taking up lots of oxygen as measured by calorimetry, and one's producing a bunch of lactate.

1101
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:55,340
But how can you tell if the cancer cell is taking up oxygen and not making ATP?

1102
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:00,540
Well, if it's taking up oxygen ... Well, if it doesn't make ATP, it's dead.

1103
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,540
All right, so-

1104
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,540
Sorry.

1105
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,940
If it's not making ATP commensurate with its oxygen consumption.

1106
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,940
Well, sometimes you look at that and you'd say, well, look at the oxygen consumption.

1107
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,780
The ATP production is commensurate with oxygen uptake.

1108
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,780
Yes.

1109
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,780
Okay.

1110
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,780
That would be coupled, wouldn't it?

1111
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,820
As long as it's not producing lactic acid or succinic acid.

1112
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,820
Okay.

1113
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,100
So I'm a bit confused.

1114
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,700
Why couldn't it do both?

1115
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:28,940
Couldn't a cell undergo anaerobic metabolism, make ATP, that is accounted for by the amount

1116
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:34,020
of lactate that's produced, but similarly take up oxygen and in a coupled fashion make

1117
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,300
ATP there?

1118
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,020
That's an important point because a lot of people stumble on that.

1119
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:43,580
The problem with that is that when you're looking at the ATP production coming out of

1120
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:49,260
the mitochondria, it's not always easy to know whether it's from a coupled, generated

1121
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:57,860
by a coupled mechanism where the oxygen is in fact linked to the ATP through F0 ATPase,

1122
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,300
or whether it's coming from mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation.

1123
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,500
Oh, got it.

1124
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,420
It's not easy to do the mass balance of this many moles of oxygen were produced or consumed

1125
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,420
and this many moles of ATP were produced.

1126
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,940
You can't do that math.

1127
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,140
Well, Warburg did that, but he was looking at it.

1128
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,620
But he didn't know about SLP, right?

1129
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,900
Well, lactic acid production, the production of ATP at the pyruvate kinase is substrate

1130
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,940
level phosphorylation, but it's cytoplasmic.

1131
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,220
Yes, yes, it's not mitochondrial.

1132
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,220
He did not know.

1133
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,420
He couldn't have known because the very systems that were, they didn't come out until the

1134
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:41,100
50s, 60s, that we knew that there was another form of ATP production inside the mitochondria.

1135
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:46,500
What people have failed to realize is that they consider, every biochemical textbook says

1136
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,660
we only get 2% oxygen coming out of the mitochondria through a substrate level phosphorylation,

1137
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,800
just like we get from the cytoplasm.

1138
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,460
But for cancer cells, people say, oh, we can get a lot more ATP from the cytoplasm, but

1139
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,300
not thinking you can upregulate the same phenomenon inside the mitochondria.

1140
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,860
As a matter of fact, we think that substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondria

1141
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,060
is far greater than the amount of ATP produced in the cytoplasm.

1142
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:17,540
And that's because others, Cantley and others, a number of people have found that the PKM2

1143
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,660
isoform of pyruvate kinase doesn't make much ATP.

1144
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,940
It makes a buttload of lactic acid, but it's not linked to the ATP production.

1145
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,620
So therefore, they have to say respiration is normal because the cell is making so much

1146
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,780
ATP.

1147
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:37,060
But if Otto Warburg is correct and all of the structural biochemistry is correct, the

1148
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,300
cell can't be making ATP from oxfos.

1149
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,940
It can't be because the structure of the organelle is defective.

1150
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,320
So where the hell is all that damn ATP coming from inside that organelle?

1151
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,780
And then when you look at the data that we have, and glutamine is being consumed in massive

1152
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,620
amounts, so it's got to be coming from substrate level phosphorylation.

1153
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,680
What is the fundamental structural defect in the mitochondria?

1154
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,680
Which is interesting.

1155
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,920
I'd never thought until this discussion about the possibility that you could have a completely

1156
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,080
normal mitochondrial genome and just have structural defects.

1157
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,500
And then of course, obviously you can have genetic abnormalities that lead to protein

1158
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,980
productions that create structural problems.

1159
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,600
But in the case of the former, perfectly normal genome-

1160
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,560
Mitochondrial DNA genome.

1161
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Mitochondrial.

1162
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,560
That's right, mitochondrial.

1163
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,180
But you now have a defective.

1164
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,580
What is the actual physical defect?

1165
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,580
In the structure?

1166
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
The number structure?

1167
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,220
It can happen in many different ways.

1168
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:39,820
For example, if a carcinogen enters into the mitochondria, they cause a lot of oxidative

1169
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,100
stress.

1170
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,420
And what we found in our massive studies- and this is how we got onto the mitochondria,

1171
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,340
knowing that Otto Warburg was in fact correct.

1172
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:51,900
I mean, at first I didn't know what the hell was going on like everybody else.

1173
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:58,140
But when we found no mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, and we knew these cells were fermenting

1174
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,500
because they were making a lot of lactic acid.

1175
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,580
Then we started looking at the lipids inside the mitochondrial lipidome.

1176
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,660
We call it the lipidome.

1177
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,480
And we have found that cardiolipin, the signature lipid in the inner membrane, is defective

1178
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,040
in all the tumor cells that we've ever looked at.

1179
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,060
So that tells us right there that there's a problem in the function.

1180
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,020
And then we link that to abnormalities in oxfos.

1181
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,560
So clearly, lipids are abnormal.

1182
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,300
That would affect the function of the proteins of the electron transport chain.

1183
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,380
Therefore you're not going to generate the amount of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation

1184
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:37,700
because the very lipid and protein structures are abnormal.

1185
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,900
And you can't produce the amount of ATC.

1186
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:46,220
So that supports what Warburg knew that there were many problems in the mitochondrial function

1187
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,020
that would then force the cell into fermentation.

1188
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,600
So what did they ferment?

1189
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,340
They ferment lactic acid and succinic acid.

1190
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,620
What are the fuels for that?

1191
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,420
It's glucose and glutamine.

1192
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,860
So glucose and glutamine are ultimately the fuels that drive the cancer.

1193
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,900
And they drive it through a process of substrate level phosphorylation occurring in the cytoplasm

1194
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,480
where they can build a lot of metabolites for growth and also through the pathway called

1195
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,480
glutaminolysis.

1196
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:19,420
Now, one can't render glucose zero, meaning there's no dietary or pharmacologic intervention

1197
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,240
that could reduce glucose levels to zero.

1198
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,660
Are there any that could do that with glutamine?

1199
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
Or is it similar?

1200
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,740
Let me address the glucose issue.

1201
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,980
We can't get to zero, but we can get damn close to it.

1202
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,340
So we have people, published papers, people who have gone powerful therapeutic fasting

1203
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,100
only and then given large injections of insulin.

1204
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,100
Sure.

1205
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,100
And they've got to below one millimolar.

1206
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,940
Yeah, 0.5.

1207
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,980
But sustainably, it's very difficult to be below about three millimolar, right?

1208
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,980
Right.

1209
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:49,980
But here's the situation.

1210
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,020
The problem is when you do that, you go on to calorie restriction, restricted ketogenic

1211
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:58,460
cells, you already are lowering the blood sugar to a significant degree.

1212
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,940
And what we found is that glucose transporters actually get upregulated in the normal cells

1213
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,500
when you start doing this.

1214
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,140
So the normal cells become glucose hungry and they become direct competitors now with

1215
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,980
the tumor cell that absolutely needs the glucose because the normal cells can burn the ketones

1216
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,420
and stay alive.

1217
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,220
The tumor cells can't burn the ketones because they're mitochondria defective.

1218
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,700
So you need a good mitochondrial system to burn ketones for energy.

1219
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,020
So what we do by calorie restriction and restricted ketogenic diets is we make the

1220
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,420
normal cells glucose hungry and we transition them over to ketones, keep them alive, but

1221
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,340
they're still glucose hungry.

1222
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,860
And they are now competing directly with the tumor cells that absolutely have to have the

1223
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,860
glucose.

1224
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,780
It's interesting because clinically we don't see that, right?

1225
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:45,540
So clinically when we put most people on a ketogenic diet or a calorie restricted diet,

1226
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:50,660
in the short run, they actually become physiologically quite insulin resistant.

1227
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,620
Interesting when you challenge them with glucose, they have a paradoxical rise in glucose

1228
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:59,860
and insulin that's overcome by refeeding them with carbohydrates for three or four days

1229
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,740
prior to the glucose challenge.

1230
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:07,260
And the offered explanation is that during a period of starvation and or carbohydrate

1231
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:14,580
restriction, the muscles, which are obviously the dominant sink for glucose, basically become

1232
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:20,180
resistant to insulin, not in a pathologic way, but rather in a way to allow the brain

1233
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,980
to have access for the remaining glucose.

1234
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,940
Well if you do it in acute systems like that, rather than the chronic changes that we talk

1235
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:31,180
about, you can get those kinds of an effect.

1236
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,460
Generally calorie restriction makes the body super insulin sensitive.

1237
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,760
Yeah, it's interesting.

1238
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,940
This is something I've struggled with because I was on a ketogenic diet for three years

1239
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:46,700
and at the end of that period of time, I went up to Stanford and did an insulin suppression

1240
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:51,300
test, which is along with the euglycemic clamp, really the gold standard for measuring

1241
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,220
insulin sensitivity with Gerald Reven, the late Gerald Reven.

1242
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,420
And Jerry was just interested in my physiology.

1243
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,540
It was like, wow, you're kind of a weird guy.

1244
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,180
You're on this bizarre ketogenic diet, hadn't studied it.

1245
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:10,740
He did at the time have a publication of about 400 non-diabetic subjects who he had put through

1246
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,180
the insulin suppression test.

1247
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:16,580
The way this test works for the listener is you take an individual, you hook them up

1248
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:22,740
to two intravenous lines, one that puts glucose in, one that puts insulin in, and over a six

1249
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,600
hour period of time, you follow a protocol of injecting glucose and insulin.

1250
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,620
And after about six hours, the glucose level reaches a steady state level referred to as

1251
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,420
the SSP or steady state plasma glucose level.

1252
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:41,060
And the higher that is, the more insulin resistant you are said to be.

1253
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:45,020
The worse you are at glucose disposal, the lower that is, the more efficient you are

1254
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,120
able to dispose of glucose.

1255
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:53,980
And that number, the SSPG, correlates to the one over the M value, which is the Y axis

1256
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,380
intercept on the euglycemic clamp.

1257
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,300
So anyway, so I went to Stanford one day.

1258
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,040
Why would you inject glucose and insulin?

1259
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,980
If you were on a ketogenic diet, and you were to take glucose, your insulin levels would

1260
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,180
already go up to the maximum physiology.

1261
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,300
So you're actually giving too much insulin in a situation like that.

1262
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,740
Well, so this was part of the issue, right?

1263
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:18,820
We didn't know what to do because the protocol is all developed around people not on a ketogenic

1264
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,820
diet.

1265
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,900
These are all people eating a standard diet.

1266
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,940
But what you're alluding to is what we discovered very quickly.

1267
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,820
So again, this is supposed to be a six hour test.

1268
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,740
And when you looked at, and I looked at the data before we did this to get a sense of

1269
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:38,820
what the parameters were, of the 400 non-diabetics that they had done this on, the most insulin

1270
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:45,740
sensitive person ended up having an SSPG of about 79 milligrams per deciliter, meaning

1271
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:52,380
the lowest that anyone's glucose got following this protocol was 79 milligrams per deciliter,

1272
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,960
which is perfectly reasonable.

1273
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:59,340
And the highest was, I don't recall this, but we could look up the paper, but I think

1274
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,500
it was somewhere in the vicinity of 200, 300 milligrams per deciliter.

1275
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,860
So that's a person who is functionally a diabetic.

1276
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,740
And even though they're quote unquote normal, their A1C was less than 6.5, they're very

1277
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,740
soon to be a diabetic.

1278
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:14,740
And of course, when you do this on people with type two diabetes, they're all very,

1279
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,260
very high.

1280
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:21,060
So we're doing this test where they're sampling glucose levels every 30 minutes.

1281
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:26,200
And within an hour, meaning after just the first, second, third sample, it was clear

1282
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,220
my glucose was going down very quickly.

1283
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:34,980
So they said, okay, we're going to back off on the insulin to your point at 90 minutes.

1284
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,740
And I have to go back and look because I have all the data.

1285
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,740
I could be wrong.

1286
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,740
Maybe it was a little longer than that.

1287
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,740
I think it was about 90 minutes.

1288
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,900
They basically turned the insulin off.

1289
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,540
Now at this point, my ketone started to go down.

1290
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:51,740
I think between the 90 minute and the two hour mark, it got really bad, really quick.

1291
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,220
And my ketones at this point had gone from, I don't remember, somewhere between two and

1292
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:59,340
a half, maybe three millimolar down to less than one millimolar.

1293
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,860
And they said, you know, we're going to stop the test now because your glucose is in the

1294
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,860
40s.

1295
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,860
I believe I was at about 48.

1296
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:08,860
Yeah, no ketones.

1297
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,860
You're going to go unconscious.

1298
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,860
You got to be careful.

1299
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:11,860
Yeah.

1300
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:12,860
So in the end, I almost did go unconscious.

1301
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:19,340
And the last thing I sort of remember was the profound perspiration that came over me,

1302
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,540
which is very different from the perspiration you experienced on a day like today in Boston

1303
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,760
where it's hot and you're sweaty.

1304
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,980
It's not that type of a perspiration at all.

1305
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:34,540
It felt like I was in a shower and I began shaking and probably was about to have a seizure.

1306
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,460
And then they went to...

1307
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:41,500
So the last blood glucose I think they got on me was about 31 milligrams per deciliter.

1308
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:46,940
And when they were injecting the dextrose, the D50, I was conscious enough to realize

1309
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,060
the IV had infiltrated.

1310
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:54,020
So all I felt was the most ridiculous burning sensation in my anti-cubital fossa because

1311
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,420
I realized the dextrose was not getting into my vein.

1312
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,420
Why you put yourself in a situation?

1313
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,420
Yeah, no, I'm an idiot.

1314
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,580
I mean, the worst part of that story is I would never do any of that stuff.

1315
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:10,380
When I came back to life, I had a huge, huge infiltrated IV in my right, in my left anti-cub.

1316
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:14,780
I took a picture of it and I sent it to my wife who I didn't even tell that I had flown

1317
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,940
up to San Francisco that day.

1318
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:19,460
I think I was just like, I travel so much that I could be gone for a day she wouldn't

1319
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,460
even know it.

1320
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,780
And I was like, hey, check this out.

1321
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,780
And she's like, where are you?

1322
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,740
And I was like, oh, I'm up at Stanford today doing such and such.

1323
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,180
She's like, what?

1324
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,260
You just about died?

1325
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,260
And like, you got to...

1326
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,020
If you're going to die, I mean, you're an idiot.

1327
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,860
But you've got to tell me in advance where you're going to be when you die.

1328
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:38,260
Yeah, well, I mean, our goal is not to try to kill ourselves, it's to kill the tumor

1329
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,260
cells and make the rest of us...

1330
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:42,340
Okay, so my long-winded story there was to illustrate a point.

1331
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,540
I turn out to be an exception to that rule.

1332
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,500
And I did this with oral glucose tolerance tests as well.

1333
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,140
And I never had that physiologic insulin resistance.

1334
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,060
In other words, I seem to be one of the people for whom what you're saying seems to be correct

1335
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:02,380
chronically, which is whenever I'm on a ketogenic diet, my glucose disposal is remarkable.

1336
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,780
But now putting on my...

1337
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,780
Your insulin...

1338
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,940
Your very high insulin sensitive.

1339
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:12,700
My muscles become very insulin sensitive, but without the refeeding of carb.

1340
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,860
What I noticed though is clinically, I see so many patients for whom that is not the

1341
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,060
case.

1342
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,700
If I do an OGTT, an oral glucose tolerance test on a patient in a ketogenic diet, I feel

1343
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:27,420
like, and again, I think other physicians listening to this will have to weigh in with

1344
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:34,420
their opinions, I feel like 70% of them fail the OGTTs and look like they have diabetes

1345
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,300
or are very soon to.

1346
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:42,340
However, if on the repeat OGTT, you just say, look, for the three days prior to the test,

1347
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:46,100
you're gonna eat two potatoes a day, they pass with flying colors.

1348
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,140
In other words, they show that they are indeed very insulin sensitive, but they need to be

1349
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,960
primed a little bit.

1350
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,520
So my point though is, if that's the case, if the 70% of patients or whatever the number

1351
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,620
is, they wouldn't actually benefit from this effect, right?

1352
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:05,000
Because they'd be walking around and not...

1353
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,040
The muscles would be selectively not consuming that glucose.

1354
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,240
Unless you can get the blood sugar down.

1355
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,720
As I said, we're experimenting now, because don't forget, our goal is to starve the tumor

1356
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,720
cells.

1357
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,480
I mean, we're singularly focused on this.

1358
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,320
The issue here is how you starve the fermentable fuels without causing...

1359
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,240
Without starving the normal cell.

1360
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,440
Or harming at all.

1361
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,480
It sounds to me like you were brutalized in that experiment.

1362
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
That's not what we want.

1363
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
That's a not to be done at home.

1364
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,840
That's not what our goal is here.

1365
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,560
Our goal is to emerge from the therapy healthier than when you started.

1366
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,800
So the question becomes, how low can you get blood sugar without compromising the health

1367
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
status of the individual?

1368
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,640
And again, if you're in ketosis, you can push your blood sugars down really low.

1369
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,560
But you'd want to do this without insulin, because insulin itself is pro-tumorgenic.

1370
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,320
Only if the blood sugars are high enough.

1371
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,000
Once you get those blood sugars down and you take away all the glucose from the body or

1372
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,300
the majority of it, it kills the tumor cells.

1373
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,080
We have the data to support that.

1374
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,960
Insulin per se is killing the tumor cell.

1375
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,960
If you...

1376
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,960
Insulin not, no, no.

1377
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Or the reduction of glucose.

1378
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
The reduction of glucose.

1379
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
So you're saying basically...

1380
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,960
Because you can't eat insulin.

1381
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,960
Insulin is such an ATP.

1382
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,960
Exogenous.

1383
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:18,720
But you're saying insulin does not function as a growth signal outside of its anabolic

1384
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,320
activity in taking up glucose?

1385
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,440
Well, if you have high insulin, like growth factor, of course, is linked to the insulin,

1386
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,400
of course, that facilitates the uptake of glucose.

1387
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,120
If you don't have glucose, what does it make any difference?

1388
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,540
What else is going on?

1389
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,040
Because without ATP, you can't get energy anyway.

1390
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,880
So the goal is to deplete the sources of fuel to the cells.

1391
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,640
So insulin, you can't eat insulin.

1392
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,680
Now insulin drives the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which facilitates...

1393
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,160
That's why they say, oh, you can get this and that.

1394
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,120
That's only if you have a lot of glucose around.

1395
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,200
Insulin becomes pro-tumorgenic.

1396
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,960
But if you have very little glucose and you give more insulin, remove the...

1397
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,800
It doesn't stimulate tumor growth.

1398
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,080
We have direct evidence to support that.

1399
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,760
So in fact, the Germans used to do that.

1400
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,140
They used to put people into insulin comas.

1401
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,760
The problem is you don't want anybody going to an insulin coma.

1402
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,600
If they were in ketosis, you could give a shitload of insulin and you're not going to

1403
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,600
die.

1404
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,680
There's evidence in the literature to support that.

1405
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,880
So you got to keep the door shut on that insulin, on the glucose, as tight as you can

1406
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,040
without harming the rest of the body.

1407
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,760
So we use insulin and then we do hyperbaric chambers, but that comes only after you shut

1408
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,720
the door on the insulin, the glutamine.

1409
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,720
So if you...

1410
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,760
So how do you shut the door on glutamine?

1411
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,680
The glutamine door, you have to use drugs.

1412
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:35,040
And the best drug we've found so far is Don 6-Diazodiline, norlucine.

1413
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,800
It's an old drug was made years ago.

1414
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,000
They used to use it on cancer patients, but they never targeted glucose at the same time.

1415
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,360
So the tumor cells were sucking down the glucose.

1416
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,880
As a matter of fact, you can even make the more glucose sensitive if you take away the

1417
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,880
glucose.

1418
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,960
So there's no dietary strategy that could effectively reduce glutamine?

1419
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,960
No.

1420
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,720
Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid.

1421
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
We make it from...

1422
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,720
We can make glutamine from glucose.

1423
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,480
I mean, so it's why it's called non-essential.

1424
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,120
However, in physiology terms, it is essential.

1425
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,760
It plays a massive role in the gut, in the immune system, in the urea cycle.

1426
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,040
I mean, it's such an important amino acid.

1427
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
It's ubiquitous.

1428
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,960
It's the most abundant amino acid in our body.

1429
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,640
Yeah, that's a funny distinction.

1430
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,440
I'm glad you pointed that out for this is a total aside, but I'm sure that there are

1431
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,360
people listening to this who get confused by the term essential and non-essential because

1432
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,040
it's eight of them are essential and 12 are non-essential or something to that effect.

1433
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,680
But what you're pointing out is an important distinction.

1434
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,640
They're non-essential because we don't have to get them exogenously.

1435
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,920
They're still essential for our survival once produced endogenously.

1436
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,160
Yes, absolutely.

1437
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,760
In glutamine, if you look, it's the most abundant amino acid in our serum.

1438
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,760
It's everywhere.

1439
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,760
And our immune system...

1440
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,160
Yeah, so the point being, there's nothing you're going to eat or not eat that's going

1441
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,160
to change that.

1442
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
No, and people ask me that all the time.

1443
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,160
It's got to be drug.

1444
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,160
You got to do it drug.

1445
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,120
And you have to use drugs, but it has to be done strategically.

1446
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,200
And you have to have people that are knowledgeable about this.

1447
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,960
You can't just have some guy just jack you up with a drug that blocks glutamine because

1448
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,360
your immune systems will be compromised.

1449
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,800
And our immune system is needed for the health of our gut, the health of killing bacteria.

1450
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,400
And if you use, if you paralyze them too much, then you're going to get infections.

1451
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,160
You're going to have all kinds of other issues.

1452
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,140
So that's why we developed the press pulse concept.

1453
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:20,080
So you press the glucose hard with diets and drugs, and then you pulse the glutamine.

1454
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,880
So what we think is going to happen is we will target the glutamine with a drug that

1455
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,080
will selectively kill tumor cells, paralyze the immune system, but then immediately give

1456
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,240
large amounts of glutamine back.

1457
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,320
And the issue, of course, is that you're going to restore your gut and you're going to restore

1458
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,080
your immune system because they're only paralyzed.

1459
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,080
They're not killed.

1460
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:42,000
And when you say immune system, are you referring to the cellular or humoral system?

1461
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The cellular, mostly.

1462
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,920
Because you've implicated, we're going to come back to it, but you've kind of implicated

1463
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,960
the humoral system with the macrophage in terms of mutagenesis.

1464
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,520
Well, we're talking about the cellular immune system.

1465
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,920
Yeah, you're talking about the T cells.

1466
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:00,600
And B cells and macrophages and natural killer cells, leukocytes, all these kinds of things.

1467
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,720
They're all glutamine dependent.

1468
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,360
They're all heavily glutamine dependent.

1469
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,440
Okay.

1470
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,080
So if you have a patient that's burned the skin, now you open up the bacteria, you have

1471
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:14,400
to give large amounts of glutamine because the immune system is needed to kill the bacteria.

1472
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
You have to restore the gut function.

1473
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,920
A lot of the cells in the gut are glutamine dependent.

1474
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:25,240
So that's why you give large amounts of glutamine to cancer patients that have been subjected.

1475
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,800
But the problem is, of course, is the tumor cells are using the same fuel.

1476
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,360
So you have to know.

1477
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,200
And as I said, if you kill too many of the tumor cells too quickly, you've got to have

1478
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,120
a cell system to remove the corpses.

1479
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,120
You've got to have some...

1480
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,840
And that's what the macrophages do and some of these other immune cells.

1481
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,240
They'll come in and remove the corpses, the dead cells.

1482
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Otherwise, you get infections.

1483
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,640
You die from the indirect effects of these things.

1484
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,680
So you have to know how to strategically target glutamine without compromising the normal

1485
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,840
physiological systems that we have.

1486
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,920
So before we get into the therapeutic stuff, which I understand is probably what everybody

1487
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,920
wants to hear about.

1488
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,600
I still want to get back to kind of understanding some of this stuff a little bit better.

1489
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:10,120
So experimentally, I'm still struggling with this sort of chasm in belief systems between

1490
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,400
what sounds like the majority of people who take the view that says, look, the respiratory

1491
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,240
system of the cancer cell is relatively normal.

1492
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:22,240
If you're seeing an increase in fermentation, it's an artifact of a higher throughput of

1493
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,520
substrate to generate more building blocks.

1494
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,120
This strikes me as a very testable hypothesis.

1495
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,920
We shouldn't be debating this.

1496
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,240
There should be a set of experiments that could resolve that, correct?

1497
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,240
Yeah.

1498
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:38,600
And I think that diagram there on the board is the illustration of the strategy to test

1499
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,560
that hypothesis, basically, which is where are they getting their energy from?

1500
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,960
The bottom line is where are they getting their energy from?

1501
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,960
If you stop their energy...

1502
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,160
The board picture, by the way, we're looking at everything.

1503
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
We're looking at the...

1504
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:53,440
We'll put a picture of this, of course, up there, but it's basically the TCA along with

1505
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,920
everything outside of the TCA as well.

1506
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,760
It's effectively looking like...

1507
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,640
It's even metabolic pathways that I can't name at this moment.

1508
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,640
Yeah.

1509
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,360
Because you have to try to integrate, like you said, you have to try to integrate all

1510
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:09,480
of the knowledge that we have on the biochemical systems into a strategy to manage the disease.

1511
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,680
And I break it down into more simplistic things.

1512
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,200
In other words, energy.

1513
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,560
Without energy, nothing grows.

1514
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:20,880
And the evidence that I'm convinced about that I've read massive amounts of literature

1515
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,520
and looked carefully at everything, the structure and function of the mitochondria in tumor

1516
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,520
cells is compromised.

1517
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,520
All right.

1518
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520
That's a fact.

1519
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,000
That's, in my mind, that is a solid fact.

1520
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,760
And to deny that, one would have to ignore the evidence that I've looked at.

1521
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,640
You have to look at a mitochondria and say, no, that mitochondria that has no cristae

1522
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,480
and is very few in number, there's nothing wrong with it.

1523
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,480
Okay.

1524
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,880
Let's call it white, black and black, white.

1525
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:53,920
But let's go one step further because there's an objective way to assess structure, but

1526
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,040
shouldn't we just ask the functional question?

1527
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,040
Well, as I said-

1528
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
Experimentally, I mean.

1529
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,040
Yeah, of course.

1530
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,040
And we do that.

1531
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,640
So we know structure dictates function.

1532
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,560
That's a common in biology.

1533
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,200
Then if that structure looks abnormal at the electron microscopy level, at the various

1534
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:14,280
levels, why don't we look now at the activity of the proteins in the electron transport

1535
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,280
chain?

1536
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:21,120
And just as this may be a naive question, but there can be large ranges of structure

1537
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,040
that could still produce optimal function.

1538
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:27,920
And you would think that for something as important as respiration, which to your point

1539
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:33,640
might be the single most important function of a cell as evidenced by the fact that toxins

1540
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,000
like cyanide are uniformly fatal within seconds.

1541
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,320
You'd think that the structural leeway within a mitochondria would be so high that you could,

1542
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,880
let's just say you could quantify structure as a scale from one to 10.

1543
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,840
Obviously, a 10 out of 10 structure is perfectly functional.

1544
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:57,120
You'd want to believe that that thing would function good enough down to like a two out

1545
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,120
of 10.

1546
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,320
And only if you were staggeringly compromised does everything go to hell.

1547
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:06,040
So in other words, just to push back for a moment, one could argue, hey, yeah, of course

1548
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,640
there's structural changes, but they're not functionally relevant because they're within

1549
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,640
a parameter space.

1550
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,640
Yeah.

1551
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,640
No, that's an important point.

1552
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,120
And I think the normal flexibility of ourselves-

1553
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,120
Yeah, that's the better word.

1554
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,120
It's the flexibility.

1555
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,880
The normal flexibility is able to accommodate those kinds of changes over the short period

1556
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,640
of time.

1557
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,560
Mitochondria is such an incredibly vibrant system.

1558
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,240
It's a living organelle inside of our cells, right?

1559
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,040
It's a separate organism actually.

1560
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,040
Separate DNA.

1561
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,040
Yeah.

1562
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:39,760
And they've turned over all of their DNA to the nucleus except for 13 critical genes.

1563
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,480
And those 13 critical genes control the life of the cell.

1564
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:50,200
Why should I do this activity when I can get a dumb ass nucleus to do it for me?

1565
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,160
But I'm still going to hold the keys to the kingdom.

1566
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:56,080
There's still 13 genes that if anything goes wrong with them, you're dead.

1567
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,080
And this is the whole thing.

1568
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,920
Why cancer cells don't die through the apoptotic mechanism?

1569
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,240
Because the very organelle that controls the kill switch is dead.

1570
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,680
The switch doesn't work.

1571
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:11,520
So the cell bypasses the normal control of life apoptosis in the cell because the very

1572
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,680
organelle that dictates that is now defective.

1573
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:19,440
So consequently, this cell now is reverting back to the way it existed before oxygen came

1574
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,880
into the atmosphere on the planet.

1575
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,280
They were all fermenters.

1576
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:28,680
They grew with unbridled proliferation until the fermentable fuel in the environment disappeared

1577
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,080
and they all died.

1578
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,440
So it was very clear what was going on before oxygen came onto the into the atmosphere.

1579
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,440
Cells would proliferate unbridled.

1580
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,040
It's in San Gorgi, Albert San Gorgi.

1581
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,920
It was alpha period in the existence of the planet.

1582
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,120
So everything was working on substrate level phosphorylation.

1583
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,120
It was no oxidative phosphorylation.

1584
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,640
They're all doing that.

1585
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:51,280
What we have in our system today is these same capabilities, but we don't use them,

1586
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:57,240
but only for very short periods of time under various physiological stress situations.

1587
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,480
They don't become permanent.

1588
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:04,320
In the cancer cell, they have become adapted because as Warburg said, you can't get a cancer

1589
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,640
cell from a cell that cannot ferment.

1590
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,200
So neurons in the brain can't ferment for very long.

1591
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,200
You never rarely if ever get a tumor out of a neuron except neuroblastoma, which is

1592
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,680
outside the brain.

1593
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,880
So heart cardiac myocytes rarely form cancers.

1594
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,720
Even muscle cells rarely form because you lose sheets and stuff.

1595
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,280
So cells that need a lot of oxidative phosphorylation rarely can form a tumor.

1596
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:29,160
Only tumors can form in those cells that can upregulate fermentation pathways.

1597
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,520
If you can't do that, you're going to die.

1598
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,160
But wait, wouldn't skeletal muscle be one of the highest candidates to be able to upregulate

1599
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,360
fermentation given their ATP demand?

1600
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,800
Yes, but they have a syncytium of mitochondria inside the muscles and they've adapted.

1601
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,520
This is their part of the normal physiology.

1602
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,260
They can ferment for periods of time under extreme stressful conditions.

1603
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,860
They can't permanently do that.

1604
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:49,860
They die.

1605
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:51,160
The muscles will die on you.

1606
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:56,240
The cells will die if you try to force them into a long-term fermentation metabolism.

1607
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:02,400
But they have the capacity to upregate fermentation for short periods of time like many cells do.

1608
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,400
But brain can't do that.

1609
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,880
You're going to have a heart attack.

1610
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,360
This is an interesting point you bring up.

1611
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:16,640
Let's go back to a myocyte within my quadricep versus a epithelial cell in my colon.

1612
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:21,960
To your point, the probability I will get a cancer that comes from the myocyte in my

1613
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,680
quadricep is virtually zero.

1614
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,200
No, and say virtually zero.

1615
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,840
Outside of a sarcoma.

1616
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,280
Sarcoma is, well, what's the origin of the sarcoma?

1617
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,280
What kind of cell?

1618
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,280
Depends.

1619
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,280
It can be a myolio sarcoma.

1620
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,440
But just humor me for a moment.

1621
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:41,740
Probability-wise, the myocyte in my quadricep or my pecs or something forming cancer is

1622
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:45,240
so much lower than the epithelial cell in my colon, right?

1623
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,800
Yeah, or an epithelial cell in your kidney or your bladder or one of these kinds of things.

1624
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,640
I just pick colon because it's such a high cancer probability.

1625
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,640
Right, sure.

1626
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,640
Breast is another one.

1627
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,640
Yeah, right.

1628
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,240
So what is it?

1629
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:02,040
Explain to me again the difference in there because I would say the muscle cell is far

1630
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:06,680
more adaptable at making lactate when it needs to because I demand of it much more

1631
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,960
than I demand of my colonic epithelial cell.

1632
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,240
But then say what you were saying again about the toxicity of lactate to that cell versus

1633
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,720
the epithelial cell in my colon.

1634
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:20,320
Well, the epithelial cell in your colon, if it becomes, and again, it's a longer process.

1635
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,400
It's not something, you don't go from a normal cell to a cancer cell overnight in a colon.

1636
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,760
There are some situations where cancer can happen much quicker than people would normally

1637
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,760
think.

1638
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,360
It's like it's a protracted process.

1639
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:42,520
So the cell has to have the capacity to shift from an oxidative process to a fermentation

1640
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,520
process.

1641
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,180
You have to have the machinery in the cell to be a fermenter because without that capacity,

1642
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:52,620
you can never become a tumor cell because the cancer is two-fold process.

1643
01:26:52,620 --> 01:27:01,260
One is the gradual chronic interruption in respiratory function coupled with a gradual

1644
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:08,560
compensatory shift to the alternative form of energy, which is substrate level phosphorylation.

1645
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:14,380
So if the cell is incapable of making that shift, it will never become a cancer cell.

1646
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:19,280
It can't because in order to be a cancer cell, you have to be able to replace oxfos with

1647
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,280
fermentation.

1648
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,220
And if you can't do that, you're not going to become a cancer cell.

1649
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:28,220
And that's why brain neurons rarely become tumor cells because they can't do that.

1650
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,620
Brain cells die.

1651
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:34,800
So if you interrupt oxidative phosphorylation in the neurons of our brain, we call that

1652
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,720
neurodegeneration.

1653
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,120
So we don't generally get tumors.

1654
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,240
We get tumors from the glial cells and the microglia and these kinds of things.

1655
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,040
Yeah, this is an important ... I mean, I know what you're saying, but I know the listener

1656
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:48,160
will be confused by this because they're going to say, but gosh, my aunt had brain cancer.

1657
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,280
It's very important that we distinguish between the glial cells and the neurons.

1658
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,280
Right.

1659
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,280
And the microglia, there's another form of which we think are the only ones here.

1660
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,620
But when we hear about astrocytomas, which would be the most common brain tumors, they're

1661
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:02,680
not actually ... The cancer is not existing in the neuron.

1662
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,680
That's correct.

1663
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,680
They're not neuro.

1664
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,840
So these are the kinds ... Or cardiomyocytes.

1665
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,840
Yes.

1666
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,480
You generally ... Because you're going to ... They die.

1667
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,240
These ... Because you're packed with mitochondria and you start ... They start fermenting.

1668
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
They die.

1669
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,240
They can't deal with that.

1670
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
Again, see, that's the part, Tom, that just confuses me.

1671
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,560
It's so counterintuitive.

1672
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,920
I would think that if there's going to be a cell in my body that I want to be able to

1673
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:27,400
buffer lactate and specifically buffer the hydrogen ion that comes with it, that's actually

1674
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,260
what's killing the cell.

1675
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:34,060
I would want my cardiomyocyte to be the single most robust cell in the body because it has

1676
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,460
to be the last guy standing.

1677
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,460
Yeah.

1678
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:37,460
Well, this is the whole thing.

1679
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,860
When you get a heart attack, you die from brain damage.

1680
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:42,080
You don't die from ... Your liver and kidneys are fine.

1681
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,220
That's why you can donate your liver and kidneys when you have a heart attack because those

1682
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:49,140
cells are not dying because they have the ... Yeah, the brain is most susceptible to the hypoxia.

1683
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:55,580
But the point is, even at the level of the highest stress, I would want my cardiomyocytes

1684
01:28:55,580 --> 01:29:00,560
to be able to access all fuels, glucose, fatty acid, ketone, you name it.

1685
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,060
They do that with degenerative heart disease, but they don't form cancer.

1686
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,720
They have a capacity.

1687
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,520
This is where we found a lot of substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondria,

1688
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:17,160
the TCA cycle, was discovered in stressed hearts because they were saying, well, the

1689
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,160
heart should be dead, right?

1690
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,720
I mean, why is it still functioning here?

1691
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,280
Where's the ATP coming from?

1692
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,160
They found that most of the energy in the heart is coming from mitochondrial substrate

1693
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,860
level for shorter periods of time.

1694
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:31,460
I'm not saying you can't do this as a permanent shift, but the concepts were developed from

1695
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:34,500
the work in the heart, but you would expect, yeah.

1696
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,140
Well, same with my brain.

1697
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:40,060
I mean, if your brain damage, you can't function either.

1698
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:46,820
So, the two organs, heart and brain, are remarkably dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for

1699
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:51,820
function, and disruptions of oxidative phosphorylation are usually catastrophic for those cells.

1700
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,320
I mean, of course, after time.

1701
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,340
I think I understand your argument.

1702
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,360
I was thinking about it in reverse.

1703
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,480
You're saying because the brain and the cardiac myocyte have evolved to be so efficient under

1704
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:07,700
oxidative conditions, it's not so much that lactate is harmful to them.

1705
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:13,880
It's that once you start to disrupt, if the hypothesis is correct, that it's the disruption

1706
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:21,020
in the mitochondria and its capacity to carry out oxfos that's harmful, you die long before

1707
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,600
you bother getting cancer.

1708
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,980
Those cells get undergo apoptosis or just die.

1709
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,980
I understand your point.

1710
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:28,060
Yes, that's the point.

1711
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,060
That's the point.

1712
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:33,820
So, the key is that how long does it take to transition a cell from an oxidative phosphorylated

1713
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:36,740
state in a cell that can become a tumor like a colon, as you mentioned?

1714
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:40,540
So, the real problem that these other cells have where cancer is so ubiquitous, whether

1715
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:45,780
it be breast or colon, according to this hypothesis, would be their metabolic flexibility.

1716
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:51,700
It's their capacity to easily wax and wane between ... I shouldn't say it.

1717
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,720
It's not their flexibility.

1718
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,080
It's their lack of dependency on oxidative phosphorylation.

1719
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:59,640
Well, they depend ... I mean, obviously, like you said with cyanide, I mean, it shuts down.

1720
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,640
Everything's dead real quick.

1721
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,400
But that happens so quickly that they don't have the ebb and flow.

1722
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:10,520
It's their capacity to upregulate fermentation over time because it doesn't happen overnight.

1723
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,040
It's a very gradual thing.

1724
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:17,140
And heart cardiomyocytes and neurons of the brain can't do that, that these other cells

1725
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,040
are capable of doing.

1726
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:25,260
As I said, what happens is, again, you had that mitochondrial stress response.

1727
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:29,300
And this is where your oncogenes come in now because the oncogenes are transcription factors

1728
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,940
that upregulate fermentation pathways.

1729
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:40,940
So basically, when you damage the respiratory system of a cell, HIF1 alpha becomes stabilized.

1730
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:44,940
And now you can upregulate glucose transporters into the cell.

1731
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,660
Is it glutamine?

1732
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,460
They're all that overlap each other.

1733
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:54,240
Clicacid dehydrogenase, all these enzymes that are geared for maintaining a fermentation

1734
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,400
metabolism.

1735
01:31:55,400 --> 01:32:01,320
The transcription factors that make those pathways upregulated are the oncogenes, basically.

1736
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,640
So the oncogenes have to facilitate ... If you're not going to get the same level of

1737
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:11,360
energy out of your oxfos, you've got to compensate to get ... Because as I tell everybody, the

1738
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:17,920
singular most largest consumer of energy in any cell is the pumps, these pumps that are

1739
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,220
on the surface of the cells that maintain the ionic gradients that allow what we call

1740
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,220
life.

1741
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:26,080
Because once you reach equilibrium, you're dead.

1742
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:31,460
So most of the energy in any cell, cancer cell, heart cell, and it's the proton mode

1743
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:36,100
of gradient across the membrane that determines whether or not that cell is going to be alive

1744
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,100
or not.

1745
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,580
So you need ATP for that.

1746
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:41,500
If the ATP dissipates, you can just swell and die.

1747
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,120
You don't have to go apoptosis or whatever.

1748
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:47,740
So you have to then determine, where's my ATP coming from?

1749
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,680
How am I going to keep those pumps going?

1750
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:52,440
So an fermentation becomes a replacement.

1751
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:58,440
Therefore, I'm going to need a lot of extra fermentable fuels to make up the loss of the

1752
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,320
energy that I'm getting out of oxfos.

1753
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:05,240
So oncogenes have to turn on because they are the transcription factors that upregulate

1754
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:08,560
the transporters for glucose and glutamine.

1755
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,560
So you're bringing in two alternative fuels to make up the difference, and therefore the

1756
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,900
genetic behavior of the cell begins to change.

1757
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:20,780
And then because the cell is now using damaged respiration, you throw out a lot of reactive

1758
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:26,200
oxygen species from the damaged respiratory system, and they cause their mutagenic and

1759
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,560
carcinogenic.

1760
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,360
So the nuclear genome gradually collects all these different mutations and defects coming

1761
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,400
from the ROS of the mitochondria.

1762
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,320
But at the same time, the cell is not dying from this ROS because it's being protected

1763
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,960
by the fermentation pathways of glucose and glutamine.

1764
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,760
How much of that lactate is leaving the cell and going back to the liver to undergo the

1765
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,760
Corey cycle?

1766
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,760
Yes, a lot of it.

1767
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,760
A lot of it does.

1768
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,000
Has anyone ever looked at patients who have a very, very high tumor burden and seen if

1769
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,740
they appreciably have higher serum lactate levels?

1770
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,740
Yes.

1771
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:57,740
Blood cancers have been done.

1772
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:01,600
In fact, there have been some patients who have had various leukemias where they died

1773
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,420
of lactic acidosis from so much lactic acid being produced from the tumor cells.

1774
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,820
There's a couple of papers reported on that.

1775
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:12,380
Lactic acidosis from massive leukemias.

1776
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,800
So the leukemia, the same thing, it's a blood cell.

1777
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,060
They're mitochondria defective.

1778
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,220
So they're thrown out a lot of lactic acid.

1779
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,560
Although that's a confusing one because I could come up with another explanation which

1780
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:27,820
is in very, very severe leukemias, you could also create multiple end organ ischemia just

1781
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:34,180
due to the defective nature of the white blood cells could actually cause capillary damage.

1782
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:36,760
That lactic acidosis could actually be from other organs.

1783
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,760
That's true.

1784
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,760
The tumor that I read seemed to focus on the lactic acidosis from the cancer cells

1785
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,760
themselves.

1786
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,200
But it doesn't rule out what you just said.

1787
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Yeah.

1788
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,200
And I don't know how you'd quantify the distinction.

1789
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,760
No, it's another one of these things.

1790
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,080
But the question is, but you're right.

1791
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:56,820
You can't make like a solid tumor seeing a lot of lactic acid in the bloodstream.

1792
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,660
The Corey cycle clears it out pretty quick.

1793
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,520
So you're going to be taking that lactic acid and making glucose again from it, which then

1794
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,520
goes back to the...

1795
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,680
Do tumor cells up regulate the machinery?

1796
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,320
I believe MCT2 is the lactate transporter.

1797
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,360
Do they up regulate that specifically?

1798
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,360
Yeah.

1799
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:20,080
I mean, it's up regulated and so is lactic acid, LDHA, lactic acid dehydrogenase A, which

1800
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,360
converts pyruvate to lactic acid.

1801
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,360
Oh, yeah.

1802
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,560
Rather than B. See, most cancer cells do not have elevated levels.

1803
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,680
This is why some people say, oh, cancer cells can burn lactic acid.

1804
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,480
Oh, where are they burning it?

1805
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,320
Oh, well, because they're taking it back in.

1806
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,480
The cancer cells are burned.

1807
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,480
No, it's bullshit.

1808
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:40,000
If it can't put pyruvate into the mitochondria, it's pumping lactic acid, how is it possible

1809
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,740
we take lactic acid, make it back to pyruvate and put it in there?

1810
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,440
If it does that, and it's going to go up to...

1811
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,000
You're going to store it as glycogen, glycol.

1812
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's not going to be respired.

1813
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,760
But do you know if anybody's looked at that and seen if MCT2...

1814
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,760
I think it's MCT2.

1815
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,760
Yeah, they're up regulated.

1816
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,760
They're up regulated.

1817
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,760
They're up regulated.

1818
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,760
Yeah, they're up regulated.

1819
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,760
There's no question.

1820
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,760
They're up regulated.

1821
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,080
Because otherwise, the hydrogen ion would poison the cell.

1822
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,080
Yeah.

1823
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,680
So you have the whole thing is up regulated, monocarboxylic acid transporters.

1824
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,880
They dump out and they also take in ketones.

1825
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,520
Don't forget that same transporter brings in ketones.

1826
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,960
So when you go into ketogenic diets, the MCTs are up regulated as well.

1827
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,440
So you're bringing in more ketone bodies now to replace those...

1828
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,720
There's an irony for you, right?

1829
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:24,240
The thing that you use to bring in ketones is giving you the exit for lactate, which

1830
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:29,080
protects the cell from the harm of the acidosis that comes with the hydrogen ion.

1831
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,600
In the micro environment of the tumor, it's a real mess.

1832
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,840
So some of the lactic acid is persisting.

1833
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,440
The hydrogen ions are persisting until they can ooze out into the local bloodstream and

1834
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,800
get back to the liver that way.

1835
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,160
But otherwise, it's going to be a real acidic mess, which then contributes further to the

1836
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:50,040
fermentation behavior of the cells, which then they're resistant.

1837
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,440
So they're fermenting, right?

1838
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,640
So they don't need blood vessels.

1839
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,720
So this is the whole why the anti-angiogenic field has failed.

1840
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,680
They said, well, we'll target the blood vessels and therefore the cells will die because they

1841
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,680
can't get the oxygen and whatever.

1842
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,040
But the cancer cell doesn't need that.

1843
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,840
I mean, it doesn't need the blood vessels.

1844
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,840
It can ferment.

1845
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,440
Did you know Judah Falkman, by the way?

1846
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,440
You guys were basically neighbors.

1847
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,440
Yeah.

1848
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,440
Yeah.

1849
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,440
I know he came down here, he gave a talk.

1850
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,440
You know, some of his...

1851
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:20,360
He targeted some unusual kinds of cancers with his anti-angiogenic.

1852
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,960
But Napoleon Ferraro, I believe, was the guy who started taking that all off.

1853
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,600
And he even came to a meeting and said, none of this stuff is working.

1854
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,040
Well, because the...

1855
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,840
And this is why Avastin, as I wrote, you know, avoid it like the plague.

1856
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,840
It's a stupid drug.

1857
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,680
It was taken off the market for breast cancer because it was harming more people than it

1858
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,680
was helping.

1859
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,600
But they still use it for brain cancer.

1860
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,600
And I think it makes...

1861
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,480
Do they still use it for colon cancer as well?

1862
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,560
I don't know of colon cancer, but certainly for brain cancer.

1863
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,560
So what are you doing?

1864
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,160
You're targeting the blood vessels and then forcing these cells to spread throughout your

1865
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,160
whole brain.

1866
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,200
So just for the listener, right, Avastin is an anti-angiogenic drug.

1867
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,880
This was a Genentech blockbuster, right?

1868
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,200
Bevacizum is the name of the drug.

1869
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,280
And they still use it.

1870
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,760
I think it's despicable to consider anybody using it.

1871
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,640
I mean, don't they know the biology of the problem?

1872
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,160
They would never do that.

1873
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:08,120
And it's already been a bust in all the brain cancer studies that I've seen.

1874
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,800
In fact, my friends have told me that work on this.

1875
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,800
But it makes the...

1876
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,920
Well, it's generally been priced out of use.

1877
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,800
Certainly outside of the US, I don't think any third party payers would cover it.

1878
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,040
And it's a very expensive drug.

1879
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,800
It's about $100,000 a year drug.

1880
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,600
And all it does is contribute to the invasive behavior of its tumor cells.

1881
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,000
And all of these other things.

1882
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,240
You're basically driving this idea, which I haven't wrapped my head around yet, is you're

1883
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:36,160
actually enhancing the promotion of the hypoxic factors that are giving cancer some of its

1884
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,160
selective benefit.

1885
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,160
Yeah.

1886
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,160
And it's forced...

1887
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:43,080
And don't forget the cells that are invading, which are coming from disrupted microglia

1888
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,320
in the brain, macrophages, they'll invade.

1889
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,920
They already have the capacity to do this.

1890
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,160
They live without blood vessels.

1891
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,360
So you're facilitating the invasive behavior.

1892
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,800
This has been seen on histological preparations, like brains that have been looked at after

1893
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Avastin.

1894
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,720
They find tumor cells spread through everywhere in the brain, rather than clustered in one

1895
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,720
area.

1896
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,880
It's like they've just gone everywhere.

1897
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,080
But when you look at the image, the radiographic images, it looks good because you don't see

1898
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,760
the necrotic area that you would normally say, oh, it looks like it's like...

1899
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,920
The image looks a little bit better.

1900
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,760
You need to tell the patient, it looks like it's working.

1901
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,040
But the overall survival is no different.

1902
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,240
Sometimes it's even less.

1903
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,480
It's a false image of what's going on.

1904
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,760
You can't see the big central area.

1905
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,000
It looks like it's very vague and diffuse.

1906
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,680
And you look at the panel, yeah, it looks like this thing is working.

1907
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,800
It gives the guy false hope.

1908
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,720
Because the end result is look at the overall survival statistics and they're abysmal.

1909
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,800
So I want to go back to something you said a moment ago.

1910
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,520
You said macrophage, which reminded me of a point you brought up earlier, which I guess

1911
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:48,280
I'm just not really familiar with, which was the idea that the macrophage themselves may

1912
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,560
be responsible for actual metastatic behavior.

1913
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,560
Yeah.

1914
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,560
Can you say a bit more about that?

1915
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,640
Well, this is a concept that goes all the way back to Akil from 1906 in Germany, where

1916
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:04,720
he was able to show that in colon, I believe it was colon or melanoma, I can't remember

1917
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:10,760
the tissue, he was actually observing fusion behavior between the neoplastic cells and

1918
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,000
the cells of our immune system.

1919
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,760
And then claimed that he thinks after this fusion event that these cells become much

1920
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,560
more aggressive and much more dispersive than before these fusion events.

1921
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,160
This was then solidified by the work of John Pollock at Yale University, where he did some

1922
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:31,800
beautiful experiments showing that malignant melanoma is actually a macrophage disease.

1923
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,220
The resulting of fusion hybridization.

1924
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:38,880
This was then further established by Melissa Wong, her group at the Portland Medical Center

1925
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,760
there, the Health Science Center in Portland, Oregon.

1926
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:48,880
Beautiful work showing how in the colon, how macrophages were fusing with neoplastic

1927
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,920
stem cells, forming these hybrid cells.

1928
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,680
So the question, and we know that all these metastatic cancers are highly fermentative.

1929
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:00,240
We know that's a fact, they're all highly fermentative.

1930
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:05,080
And they're all very, very invasive and they spread, they migrate through the blood brain,

1931
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,440
they migrate everywhere, they just invade.

1932
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,360
And these are all behaviors of macrophages.

1933
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:16,960
When you say fusion, so you have a neoplastic cell that is above the basement membrane and

1934
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,640
you have a macrophage.

1935
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,800
And tell me what the fusion actually is.

1936
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,520
Are they fusing genetic material or are they just fusing cytoplasmic material?

1937
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,520
What's actually happening?

1938
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,360
Well, it's a combination of both actually.

1939
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,680
So macrophages, cells of our immune system are extremely fusogenic.

1940
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,320
They do this wound healing.

1941
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,080
Like you'll see multinucleated giant cells in a lot of parts of our bodies during wound

1942
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,960
healing and this kind of thing.

1943
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,940
And cancer cells, you also find a lot of these multinucleated kinds of cells.

1944
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:51,540
So our body recognizes wounding as an acute problem and the immune system will come into

1945
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:55,120
that local area to facilitate wound healing.

1946
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,240
And when the wound persists, sometimes these cells will fuse with each other and fuse with

1947
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:02,960
other cells in the microenvironment to facilitate wound healing.

1948
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,680
The problem is, is if you have an epithelial cell, like a breast cell or a colon cell,

1949
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:13,560
that is coming and becoming neoplastic, becoming dysmorphic in its growth regulatory and it's

1950
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,640
fermenting.

1951
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:18,660
But it doesn't have the capacity to grow anywhere outside of that local area.

1952
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,440
It doesn't have the capacity.

1953
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,600
So our immune cells come into this lesion, if you will, that's persisting.

1954
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,520
The immune cell throws out growth factors and cytokines to facilitate the wound, to

1955
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,880
facilitate wound healing.

1956
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:37,320
The problem is those factors are also facilitating the growth of the neoplastic cell.

1957
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:41,280
So the neoplastic cell is dysregulated, but the very cell that's coming in to try to correct

1958
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,920
the wound is now provoking the cell to grow even more.

1959
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,880
But what is the wound that the macrophage is coming in to see?

1960
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,000
Because the neoplastic cell has not yet violated the membrane beneath it.

1961
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,360
No, but it creates a, it throws out lactic acid and creates a kind of a hypoxic micro

1962
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,360
area.

1963
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,360
Okay.

1964
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,880
And it's a hypoxic because the lactic acid is a signal of hypoxia.

1965
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,560
It's a signal of some sort of damage.

1966
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:10,240
You're not supposed to have pockets of build up lactic acid in parts of your body.

1967
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:15,440
So it sends out, and normally if this does happen, if we have a contusion or a cut, cells

1968
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:20,360
of our, the monocytes mass migrate out of the bloodstream, go into the wound, clear

1969
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:25,920
up the debris, kill the bacteria, and then move out of that section, go back to local

1970
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,840
lymph nodes and sit there in the event that they need it again.

1971
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,960
Or they pass, they form pass, they're all massive numbers of white dead blood cells.

1972
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,760
So these cells are part and parcel of the correction of the wound.

1973
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,440
The problem is in that if you have a colon lesion or a breast lesion from an occluded

1974
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:44,760
milk duct or whatever, or a lesion in the colon, you have population of cells that will

1975
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,420
start to proliferate, creating a damage to the local micro environment, signaling a system

1976
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,420
that's immune.

1977
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,160
There's something going on here.

1978
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,160
Right.

1979
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:58,060
So when the monocyte gets out and differentiates become the macrophage, goes to this now poorly

1980
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:04,080
differentiated cell, why doesn't it just kill that cell non-specifically?

1981
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,840
Because this is just a macrophage.

1982
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,840
And how does that-

1983
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,620
Well, macrophages aren't designed to kill cells.

1984
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,460
They're designed to kill bacteria that may be in the micro environment.

1985
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,800
Don't forget they're a wound healing cell.

1986
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,620
But going back to the bruise example, right?

1987
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:17,620
So you get a contusion in your thigh.

1988
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,020
The macrophage does play a role in clearing that cellular debris.

1989
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:22,020
Yes.

1990
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:24,860
So why doesn't it just effectively do the same thing with the cancer cell?

1991
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,100
Or with the soon to be cancer cell?

1992
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:28,780
Yeah, because the cell is not recognized as being...

1993
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:32,300
It looks like it's a part of the local normal epithelial cells.

1994
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:33,300
Okay?

1995
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,660
It's not looking as if this is a foreign invader.

1996
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,060
This cell has all of the...

1997
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,220
It looks like a regular epithelial cell that's proliferating.

1998
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,320
Because don't forget we replace ourselves by proliferation.

1999
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,520
But the lactate secretion, which is what got it there in the first place, wouldn't that

2000
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:51,540
tell the macrophage, hey, something's still wrong here?

2001
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,540
Yes.

2002
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,500
This cell is hardwired to do what it's supposed to do.

2003
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:57,460
It's not like thinking, oh, let me problem solve.

2004
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,940
It's not a problem solving cell.

2005
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,700
It's hardwired to respond to a particular environmental issue.

2006
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:04,700
I see.

2007
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:08,620
So you're saying the lactate is the fire alarm that got it there, but then when it gets there,

2008
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,900
it doesn't see the fire?

2009
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:10,900
No.

2010
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:14,740
Well, it tries to put out the fire, but the problem is molecules that are used to put

2011
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:18,420
out the fire are actually stimulating the growth of the cell that shouldn't be grown.

2012
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,420
So it's out of context.

2013
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,420
Okay.

2014
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:23,700
So how does this facilitate metastases rather than just local advancement?

2015
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:24,700
Right.

2016
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:31,860
So at what point in this protracted process does this now spring to become a metastatic

2017
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:39,820
lesion over a controlled proliferative abnormality that's not yet breaking through the basement

2018
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:42,220
membrane or doing this, right?

2019
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,660
So we don't know.

2020
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:46,860
Sometimes this can happen very fast.

2021
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,420
Sometimes it takes a long period of time.

2022
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:52,560
Because we have these certain cancer cells called cancer of unknown primary.

2023
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,560
They're highly metastatic.

2024
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,560
No one knows where the hell they came from.

2025
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,560
All right.

2026
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,980
We don't know what's, but they're very highly invasive.

2027
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:02,980
Then we have other cells that, well, he had a lesion there a long time for several years.

2028
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,980
This thing never healed.

2029
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:04,980
It was always oozing.

2030
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:08,000
It was, and eventually explodes into a metastatic lesion.

2031
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,360
We don't know at what point it varies from one person to the next when, now what happens

2032
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,640
is when the macrophage, we know biology, there are fusogenic cells.

2033
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:22,200
There's massive amounts of biology to show that macrophages are very fusogenic cells.

2034
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,720
They can fuse with themselves or with other fibroplasts.

2035
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,800
They can fuse with a variety of different cells.

2036
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,700
Usually that's part of the wound healing process to facilitate wound healing.

2037
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:37,360
But if you fuse with a stem cell that has already defective respiratory systems, you

2038
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,600
would then dilute the cytoplasm of the cell that you fused it with.

2039
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,960
It fuses again and again.

2040
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,720
It's a process that takes place.

2041
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:49,360
You eventually dilute the normal mitochondria in the macrophage and you replace it with

2042
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,160
the abnormal mitochondria from the cells that you're fusing with, then leading to a

2043
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,960
cell with dysregulated growth properties.

2044
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:01,240
How many mutations would it take to do that?

2045
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,520
We don't know because there are some metastatic cells that don't have any mutations, if you

2046
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,520
can believe it.

2047
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,480
Deep sequencing, they haven't found any mutations in some of these cells.

2048
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,120
But they're fermenting and they're spreading.

2049
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,120
They're growth dysregulated.

2050
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:17,520
But wait, how are they growth dysregulated without a mutation?

2051
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:24,360
You have cells that are carcinogenic, that are tumor-ogenic, that have no mutations.

2052
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,600
Baker pointed this out.

2053
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,480
It's like people can't believe this.

2054
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:31,080
On the other hand, we have skin cells loaded with so-called driver mutations that never

2055
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,440
form a tumor.

2056
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:38,560
So this linkage between the number of mutations and the type of cancer is just ... There's

2057
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,720
so many flaws in this.

2058
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:48,040
So there are cancer cells that have been looked at that have highly invasive metastatic

2059
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,600
and they can't find the mutations in there.

2060
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:53,040
That's not common, but it happens.

2061
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,360
So it's a violation to the whole concept.

2062
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:01,200
In glioblastoma, there are some tumors that have been found that have none of the driver

2063
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,480
mutations, none of the abnormalities that you would have expected that are found in

2064
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,740
others.

2065
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:08,160
So there's a break linkage between mutations.

2066
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:11,960
You don't need new mutations to cause a metastatic lesion.

2067
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:15,080
That doesn't mean that a metastatic lesion has no mutations.

2068
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,480
But maybe I'm asking a different question.

2069
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:22,200
Okay, so two women have breast cancer.

2070
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:28,320
And for all intents and purposes, they have very similar patterns of mutations in their

2071
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:29,640
breast cancer.

2072
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,000
And let's just make it easy and say that they're hormonally similar.

2073
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,440
They're ERPR-positive, HER2-new negative breast cancers.

2074
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,920
Both women present as stage T2N1.

2075
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,080
So they've got whatever, a five centimeter tumor if that's still a T2, I don't even remember.

2076
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,160
And they've got two lymph nodes or one lymph node.

2077
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,640
They both have a resection.

2078
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:54,860
Ten years later, one of them is still disease free.

2079
01:48:54,860 --> 01:49:01,460
The other one has died from brain metastases, which were presumably seated before the primary

2080
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:04,000
tumor was resected 10 years earlier.

2081
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,060
It's not a sloppy surgery where they didn't get part of the cancer.

2082
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:13,600
What I'm hearing you say is, yeah, one of them could undergo metastases while the other

2083
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,400
one did not, even though their primary tumors looked very similar.

2084
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,400
Is that correct inference?

2085
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,840
Yes, yeah, I think that's correct.

2086
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:25,760
And what we find now with a number of papers is the needle biopsies that are used to diagnose

2087
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:31,960
the tumors can create a wounded, even a more aggressive wounded situation in the micro-environment

2088
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:37,180
of the tumor, leading to the phenomenon of inflammatory oncotaxis, which facilitates

2089
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:38,480
the fusion.

2090
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:43,180
And in other words, by looking at the tumor with a needle biopsy to make the diagnosis,

2091
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:47,060
you put that patient potentially at risk for causing a metastatic lesion.

2092
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:50,340
And then when you look at the profile, you say, well, this doesn't look too bad.

2093
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,940
No, not here.

2094
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:53,740
But wait, let's say we do that.

2095
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,200
We're going to immediately resect that tumor anyway.

2096
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,420
So how is that, how quickly does this process take place?

2097
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:05,820
The wound is between the outside world and the tumor, not between the tumor and the inside

2098
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:10,780
world necessarily, especially if that tumor is going to come out within a few weeks, right?

2099
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,780
Yeah.

2100
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:20,260
We know from a number of studies that needle biopsies can facilitate in some patients the

2101
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:24,260
invasion of cells into the local and spread.

2102
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:25,260
We know this.

2103
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:29,580
And reported in the literature for breast, for colon, for liver, for brain.

2104
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:33,980
The very act of stabbing this growth can...

2105
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:36,260
Well, but yeah, no, I think what's...

2106
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,140
So then you can get the cells out in a relative...

2107
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:42,020
Yeah, but I think what's known is that you can seed tumors along the tract of where you

2108
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,020
do that.

2109
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:44,020
Yes.

2110
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,020
Yes, that I understand.

2111
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,020
But maybe I misunderstood.

2112
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:49,140
You're saying that a woman who has a needle biopsy of her breast, who then goes on to

2113
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:52,860
get a lumpectomy, has that increased her risk of brain metastases?

2114
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,340
Well, it wouldn't be brain metastases right away.

2115
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:01,380
That brain metastasis, the secondary metastatic behavior, has taken a while.

2116
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:02,380
It's not just the brain.

2117
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:05,580
But how does the needle biopsy increase the risk of that?

2118
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,500
Needle biopsy creates a more inflamed condition.

2119
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,100
That's why you call it an inflammatory oncotaxis.

2120
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:14,500
And this was one of the reasons why they get rid of the morselation procedure, because

2121
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,180
this is what was happening.

2122
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:20,180
So these women were dying from metastatic cancer, from morselation.

2123
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:25,220
It's kind of a machine that used to be made by Johnson & Johnson for moving uterine polyps.

2124
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:31,580
Well, you're taking a polyp and you're grinding it up and creating inflammatory oncotaxis.

2125
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:35,620
Now, there might have been one polyp out of a thousand that would have this...

2126
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,300
Right, but that's very different from the...

2127
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,580
I'm asking a very specific question, because here's my fear.

2128
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:44,580
What I don't want is anybody listening to this who's got a breast lesion, who thinks

2129
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,580
now they can't have it biopsied.

2130
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,940
I think that's a very different case than the example of...

2131
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:52,620
Well, the evidence is clear in some cases, not all cases.

2132
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:55,820
Not everybody who goes under a needle biopsy is going to have metastatic cancer.

2133
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:56,820
No, but that's not the question.

2134
01:51:56,820 --> 01:52:02,980
I mean, what I'm asking is, is a woman, if you take a thousand women, you take...

2135
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,980
It's a thought experiment.

2136
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:10,780
You take a million women with an identical breast cancer and you take half a million

2137
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:13,500
of them and you just do the resection.

2138
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,620
And the other half a million, you do a needle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, then you

2139
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,020
do a resection.

2140
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:25,380
Are you saying in the half a million women that had a resection following a biopsy, their

2141
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:29,140
probability of metastatic cancer later on is greater?

2142
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:32,780
I think so, but I can't be sure because that experiment hasn't been done.

2143
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:37,580
I'm basing it on what has already been known about needle biopsies facilitating the spread

2144
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,580
of the tumor.

2145
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:43,320
But again, I'm just being critical of this because I feel very strongly about not causing

2146
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,320
panic in people.

2147
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,320
Well, I don't know...

2148
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,720
I mean, these data are about needle track seating.

2149
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,720
Yeah.

2150
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,720
Well, needle track...

2151
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:53,840
For example, like as you said, you have a liver biopsy, you can get cancer cells through

2152
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,280
the tract even after...

2153
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,920
But that's very different from saying...

2154
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,680
Because that can be dealt with, but this is a very different...

2155
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,760
Yeah, well, I think this is from what I'm looking at.

2156
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,000
Now, I look at the brain predominantly, right?

2157
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
How many...

2158
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,800
We have what we call secondary glioblastoma.

2159
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,520
And that is very...

2160
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:14,860
It's not uncommon that when you go in and remove a low grade tumor, that within a shorter

2161
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,900
period of time, it turns into a glioblastoma.

2162
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,740
This is the same phenomenon.

2163
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:23,820
You're just doing it on a little bit larger scale rather than just through a needle biopsy.

2164
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:27,620
So you go in and you take out a low grade tumor and all of a sudden within a year or

2165
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:30,700
something you've got glioblastoma, sometimes even less.

2166
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:32,240
And you're saying, what the hell happened here?

2167
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,240
So this is just a larger...

2168
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,620
But what's the control for that observation?

2169
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,620
Well...

2170
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:41,540
Meaning like another explanation would be the person who has the stage one astrocytoma

2171
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:45,660
is more at risk for the stage two, three or four astrocytoma.

2172
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:49,180
From the operation itself, from the provocation of the micro environment.

2173
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:50,180
But without...

2174
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:52,420
We'd have to have a group of those patients who don't undergo surgery.

2175
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:53,420
That's right.

2176
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:54,420
And you would have to...

2177
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,420
But who's doing...

2178
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:56,420
Nobody's doing these experiments.

2179
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,780
But here's the situation.

2180
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:04,180
What our philosophy is that if we shrink the tumor, whether it's a breast tumor, colon

2181
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:09,760
tumor or whatever, if we take away the fermentable fuels and shrink that tumor down, then it

2182
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:16,080
becomes a candidate for complete debulking, not diagnosing.

2183
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:20,800
When you take a needle biopsy of a breast and you look at...

2184
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,800
Why are they doing that?

2185
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,980
They're doing it for basically two reasons, to try to diagnose what level of cancer you

2186
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:27,400
have and then to give you a gene readout.

2187
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:31,440
Like these genes are going to play some role in whether or not you're going to get a treatment.

2188
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,440
Right?

2189
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,440
Well, yeah.

2190
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,440
So those are two.

2191
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:39,200
But for example, in the case of doing a biopsy before a breast resection, there's value in

2192
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:43,240
knowing if a woman might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy, for example, based on the receptor

2193
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,240
profile.

2194
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,240
Yeah, but...

2195
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,280
In other words, it might not just be the gene, right?

2196
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,280
Knowing that she's ER...

2197
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,280
That's true.

2198
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,600
Knowing that she's triple positive versus triple negative might change what you do.

2199
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,600
I guess it could.

2200
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:58,600
But the bottom line is that why don't you assume that you have a problem?

2201
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:05,000
Why don't you just put that patient on metabolic therapy and shrink that tumor down and then

2202
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,320
do a non-invasive check?

2203
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:10,660
Did the borders change at all from the metabolic?

2204
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:12,660
And then just to bulk it completely.

2205
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:19,600
The probability of cure is going to be better, in my mind, than if you do a needle biopsy

2206
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,780
without doing the bulking.

2207
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:23,200
And just to say, let's look at this.

2208
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:28,880
How long after the needle biopsy do you put that patient at risk for possibly seeding a

2209
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,760
cell that gets into a lymph node that then can spread out and later that you get brain

2210
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:38,200
metastasis, liver metastasis, or whatever else can happen from these cancers?

2211
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:41,060
So the question is, why put anybody at risk?

2212
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:46,640
If we know we have evidence from the literature to say that is a possibility, why would we

2213
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:50,580
want to put anyone at risk for that?

2214
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:55,320
Unless the information you get from the needle biopsy is going to be a curative procedure.

2215
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,480
And a lot of times it's not.

2216
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,480
Okay?

2217
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,160
It's just for diagnosis procedures.

2218
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:03,960
And now today we're using all these gene screens, $7,200 to tell somebody what kind

2219
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,320
of gene profile.

2220
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,080
And that may no longer be relevant after you've taken a needle biopsy from the very tissue

2221
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,080
you're doing.

2222
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,080
Yeah, and I think that makes sense.

2223
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:13,840
I guess I'm a bit confused by the idea.

2224
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,160
I guess I just don't see the-

2225
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,040
These are controversial issues.

2226
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:22,080
And I'm looking at it from the point of the biological processes that are taking place

2227
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,080
from these procedures.

2228
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,280
And knowing that I've seen literature on lung, I've seen liver cancer certainly for

2229
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,280
brain.

2230
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:34,320
But here's ... So, I mean, there are so many potential arguments, right?

2231
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:39,960
So you look at one of the most metastatic cancers of all time is pancreatic cancer,

2232
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,960
right?

2233
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,000
It's almost uniformly fatal.

2234
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,920
And yet up until recently, very infrequently biopsied.

2235
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,920
It's a very difficult biopsy.

2236
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:48,920
Right, right, right.

2237
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:49,920
You have to do it with an ERCP.

2238
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,920
No, that's true.

2239
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:58,400
In other words, you can still have incredibly aggressive metabolic cancers which are not

2240
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,400
biopsied often.

2241
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,600
And then conversely, you look at a GBM.

2242
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:05,640
You look at the cancer we're sitting here talking about, the brain, a very aggressive

2243
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,920
brain, the one that John McCain just passed away from.

2244
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,160
Well, that's ... I mean, that's only locally metastatic.

2245
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,280
It never leaves the CNS, does it?

2246
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,600
Oh, yeah, it does.

2247
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,600
Where does it go?

2248
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,600
It goes to bone.

2249
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,600
It goes to liver.

2250
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:18,880
It goes to ... Nobody looks at the-

2251
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,200
What percentage of patients die from ... Or-

2252
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,360
Not many, but when they look, they find.

2253
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,840
This was one of the big things.

2254
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,640
This is how we discovered the macrophage origin of the cancer.

2255
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:34,960
We started looking and saying, how many people do autopsies of organs on people who die from

2256
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,960
glioblastoma?

2257
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:36,960
And what did you find?

2258
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,880
There's 100 articles in the literature with metastatic GBM to various organs for people

2259
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:42,880
dying.

2260
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,120
People say, well, it doesn't happen that often.

2261
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:47,920
You know why they die the GBM before they start recognizing they have metastatic liver

2262
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,040
cancer?

2263
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:52,400
But when you look at livers and kidneys and these other organs from patients who have

2264
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:56,240
died from GBM, those studies that have looked have found cancer.

2265
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:59,560
So clearly, these cells are coming out of the brain and they're getting into the other

2266
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:00,560
organs.

2267
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,000
The problem is the patients aren't living long enough to have a problem.

2268
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,040
Who's worrying about the guy's liver when his brain is starting to swell up from all

2269
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,440
the treatments they're giving him?

2270
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:12,280
I mean, 12 months, most people are dead.

2271
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:19,160
But there's over 100 articles in the scientific literature showing outside, I call extracranial

2272
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,440
metastasis of glioblastoma.

2273
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,720
So it's not that it's ... And people ignore it.

2274
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:27,760
It's like knowing that the mitochondria damaged in cancer cells.

2275
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,760
People ignore it.

2276
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,840
Well, I guess that would be a more forgivable thing to ignore because I'm not convinced

2277
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:35,280
it necessarily changes the story.

2278
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,880
The mitochondrial one is a much more interesting question, right?

2279
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:41,280
I mean, that to me, of all the things we've talked about today, Tom, that's the one that

2280
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:47,960
kind of has me scratching my head the most and wondering, in 2018, how are we even having

2281
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,680
that this should be something that's not debated?

2282
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:55,840
This should be sort of like ... This would be like debating whether DNA is necessary

2283
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,200
to make RNA.

2284
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:03,720
That discussion was settled in the 50s and anyone who disputes that now is sort of disputing

2285
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,600
the shape of the earth.

2286
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:10,380
So I guess to me, given the stakes here, I would love to figure out why people aren't

2287
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:11,380
answering this question.

2288
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:16,180
Well, let's look at the situation from even a greater distance.

2289
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:20,940
In the United States, we have over 1,600 people a day dying from cancer.

2290
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:21,940
This is horrific, right?

2291
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:26,380
There's over a half a million people a year, 1,600 people a day dying from cancer.

2292
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:28,740
Obviously, there's something seriously wrong.

2293
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:32,980
There's something massively wrong with what we're doing with this disease.

2294
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:34,380
We're talking about needle biopsies.

2295
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,380
We're talking about this.

2296
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,860
We're talking about that.

2297
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:39,180
The issue is we had 1,600 people a day dying.

2298
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:41,260
Why are all these people dying from cancer?

2299
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:45,780
So it's either we have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the nature of the disease is, we're

2300
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:49,900
mistreating it, we're treating it as something other than what it actually is.

2301
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:56,660
So the debate that you mentioned now is that the results of the dead people are the consequences

2302
01:59:56,660 --> 02:00:01,860
of the fundamental misunderstanding of the process of the biology of the disease.

2303
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:07,540
What I'm arguing is that now understanding the biology of the disease, we have the potential

2304
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:10,420
to drop the death rate by more than 50% in 10 years.

2305
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:11,880
There's no question about it.

2306
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:15,580
If you stop doing half of the stuff that we're doing to these cancer patients, looking at

2307
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:19,780
the biology and the nature of the disease, how to best go about this strategically, I

2308
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:22,380
think we can drop the death rate by 50%.

2309
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,580
We're doing stupid things, right?

2310
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:29,100
Needle biopsy tumor cells for genetic profiling that has no relevance to the nature of the

2311
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,100
disease.

2312
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:31,100
That's just one.

2313
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:34,980
But just to go back to that, because I'm sorry, I just really want to make sure people aren't

2314
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,860
going to stop refusing their biopsies.

2315
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:43,220
Have we seen an increase in the rate of metastases in the era of needle biopsying for genetic

2316
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:44,220
sequencing?

2317
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:47,620
I mean, we could go back and look at the death rate from cancer 50 years ago before anybody

2318
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:49,500
was doing this, and it was the same.

2319
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,500
Yeah.

2320
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:54,980
Well, I think that we've probably ... I just want to say that every year we have more and

2321
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:56,980
more dead people.

2322
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:00,460
The increase is faster than the general population, okay?

2323
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:03,220
So we had 3.8% increase in death.

2324
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,220
I don't know.

2325
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:05,340
Is that actually true?

2326
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:11,420
Is the age-adjusted, population-adjusted mortality of cancer today higher than it was 50 years

2327
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:12,420
ago?

2328
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:14,420
I think it's about 3% or 4% lower, isn't it?

2329
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:18,860
Well, I just did the last five years, okay, from 2013 to 2017.

2330
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:23,180
But to test this hypothesis, we'd want to take an even longer time period and go more

2331
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:24,860
extreme as far as like ...

2332
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:30,300
Well, I mean, every year, there's no year that we have fewer ... They're always coming.

2333
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:32,220
The dead people are piling up.

2334
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:37,260
So when I look at the numbers and I say, okay, what was the percent of population increase

2335
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:40,100
in the United States over the last five years?

2336
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,940
And according to the demographics, it's 2.9%.

2337
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,940
Okay.

2338
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:47,020
Of the same period, how many cancer deaths ...

2339
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:51,140
Right, but again, I don't know my epidemiology well enough to make this case, but I'm going

2340
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,140
to try anyway.

2341
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:57,900
Isn't the growth in population more a function of the input of people, meaning birth rate,

2342
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:01,820
rather than the people who are getting cancer, which are the older folks?

2343
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:03,740
Well, we have younger people too, right?

2344
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,060
Right, but the majority of cancers and older folks.

2345
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,900
Yeah, the majority of cancer or older folks, for sure.

2346
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:11,140
So I'm not sure that that population argument would answer that question.

2347
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:12,140
Well, maybe.

2348
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,780
There's always a guy you can find ... I think all you have to look at is the numbers of

2349
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:18,540
people that are dying from the disease.

2350
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:19,540
I mean, that's a fact.

2351
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:22,460
No, it's a fact, and it's a tragic fact.

2352
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:30,540
I guess a 50% reduction in the mortality of this disease in 10 years is a very bold statement

2353
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:37,980
given that we've seen about a 3% reduction in cancer mortality in 50 years.

2354
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:38,980
Yeah.

2355
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:41,500
Which I think you're arguing is unacceptable and understandable.

2356
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:45,260
Well, I'm looking at it from the tragedy.

2357
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,980
In China, it's 8,100 people a day dying from cancer.

2358
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:49,340
I mean, that's the number over there.

2359
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:53,380
Maybe that's the bigger population, but the problem ... It's now surpassed heart disease

2360
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:54,380
in their country.

2361
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:56,740
Clearly, it's not whatever we're doing.

2362
02:02:56,740 --> 02:03:04,180
And yes, 50%, if you did what we think you need to do and to manage this disease, looking

2363
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:12,780
at it from the biology of the disease, I think I would not be shocked if we had a 50% reduction

2364
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,780
in 10 years.

2365
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:19,260
So normally, I ask people what their dream experiment would be, but I want to ask you

2366
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:20,260
two.

2367
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:22,540
I want to ask you this question twice.

2368
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:25,500
The first one, the first time I'll ask you this question will be the easier one, because

2369
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,660
it'll be the clinical trial.

2370
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:34,580
So what would be the dream clinical trial to test the hypothesis that says we can reduce

2371
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:37,660
the mortality of cancer by 50%?

2372
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:41,180
What would you want to put head to head to definitively ask that question?

2373
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:47,100
What we do right now is if we do metabolic therapy at all, we do it at all.

2374
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:52,420
It's either standard of care versus standard of care plus metabolic therapy.

2375
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:57,660
We're missing the critical control group, metabolic therapy without standard of care.

2376
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,060
What are we doing to these people?

2377
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:00,740
So tell me what the experiment would be.

2378
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:02,380
Let's use breast cancer as an example.

2379
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:03,380
Okay, breast cancer.

2380
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:04,860
So you have your standard, whatever you're doing today.

2381
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:08,300
You got a lot of people dying of breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer.

2382
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:12,020
So we're going to now take metabolic therapy and we're going to combine it with standard

2383
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:16,100
of care, which is what the group in Turkey is.

2384
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,020
And how would you integrate that?

2385
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:20,180
Let's talk about how you would do it, not necessarily how it's being done.

2386
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:23,500
How would you, for the purpose of the experiment, integrate standard of care.

2387
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:29,140
Okay, so we would use the chemo and we would have people on metabolic therapy, which would

2388
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:30,140
be lower.

2389
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:31,300
And you would do those in parallel?

2390
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:36,260
You would have some patients that would be treated only with the standard of care, which

2391
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,020
would be our control.

2392
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:43,140
And then we would have people treated with the standard of care plus reducing blood sugar

2393
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:47,820
elevating ketones and targeting the energy metabolism, which we can do.

2394
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:52,780
And would that include things like metformin or DCA or other things like that?

2395
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:53,780
It could include.

2396
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,780
Hyperbaric oxygen.

2397
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,780
Yes, yes.

2398
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:56,780
And that's what we're doing in Turkey.

2399
02:04:56,780 --> 02:05:00,620
So it's basically standard of, however, in Turkey we're doing the lowest dose of chemo

2400
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:05,300
that we can use to still be in compliance with the law.

2401
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,380
And if you get rid of, now the control-

2402
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,260
And now your metabolic therapy alone group.

2403
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:10,380
Metabolic therapy alone group.

2404
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:11,380
What would that group do?

2405
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,760
That group would be the press pulse concept.

2406
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,720
So we down regulate the glucose first, shrink the tumor up, make the micro environment less

2407
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,720
inflamed, less angry.

2408
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:23,040
Specifically tell me what would be in that.

2409
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,920
So these patients would be on ketogenic diets?

2410
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:30,600
First we would lower their blood sugar gradually, depending on the status of the individual.

2411
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:34,680
So you'd go into lowering their blood sugar, elevating their ketones, putting them to therapeutic

2412
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,340
ketosis essentially.

2413
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:40,240
So a lot of these people also have multiple other series of metabolic abnormalities.

2414
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:41,360
They have type 2 diabetes.

2415
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,360
They've got triglyceridemia.

2416
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:46,480
They have all kinds of other things besides having cancer.

2417
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:50,320
So basically by bringing them into a state of therapeutic ketosis-

2418
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,440
And how do you define that?

2419
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,280
Is that defined by the amount of glucose and ketones?

2420
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,440
By the glucose ketone index that we published.

2421
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:57,440
We published the paper on this.

2422
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,760
And what's the ratio that-

2423
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:03,040
It's ratio about close to 1.0 or below, if we can get it.

2424
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:07,240
This is where the millimolar of ketone and the millimolar of glucose are about the same.

2425
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:10,680
And that people hit that somewhere between three and four, I'm guessing?

2426
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:11,680
Days after?

2427
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,680
Three to four millimolars tends to be the place where they're about the same?

2428
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:15,680
It could be.

2429
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,680
It could be.

2430
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:20,400
It depends on the individual because some people have higher glucose, higher ketones, and yet

2431
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,200
they still have the same ratio.

2432
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:26,000
So some people have very low glucose and not that high of a ketone, but it gives them the

2433
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,520
same ratio.

2434
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,680
So the issue is get your ratio-

2435
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:32,800
The only time I've been able to be at one to one is when I'm not eating anything.

2436
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,800
Yeah.

2437
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,680
Well, it's variable from one person to the next.

2438
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:39,440
And then the other thing too, we have to be very careful about, is a lot of cancer patients

2439
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,800
very hard to get into one.

2440
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,360
You're a young, healthy guy.

2441
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,600
Guys that are young and healthy can get well below one.

2442
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,560
Women are better than men.

2443
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,920
We've done some studies.

2444
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:52,560
So basically, but cancer patients are freaked out because they have anxiety, and anxiety

2445
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:58,560
elevates corticosteroids, and you have a tougher time bringing your- So we also institute with

2446
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:03,720
the press, besides ketone supplementation, as Dom DiAgostino has been telling, and the

2447
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,280
ketogenic diet.

2448
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:09,600
And then we have stress management, which includes music therapy, yoga therapy.

2449
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,680
There's a variety of ways to reduce emotional stress.

2450
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:15,240
And that's a very important part of the management.

2451
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:20,100
You have to let the patient know that their disease is not terminal, that their lowering

2452
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:23,860
of the stress is going to make the medicine and the work.

2453
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:28,200
So once we get the patient into metabolic ketosis, now we have options.

2454
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:31,800
Now we can start using insulin therapy to bring the blood sugars down lower.

2455
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:36,000
We can put them into hyperbaric oxygen, which creates oxidative stress predominantly in

2456
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,320
the tumor cell and not in the normal cells.

2457
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:41,360
The normal cells are burning ketones that reduces oxidative stress.

2458
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:44,120
When you say insulin therapies, do you mean actual insulin?

2459
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:45,120
Yeah.

2460
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,120
We're testing that now.

2461
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:49,040
The Germans used to do that years ago, but we don't think we have to put people into

2462
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:50,560
metabolic comas to do this.

2463
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:52,220
We think we can do it without it.

2464
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,320
We're testing it now.

2465
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:54,600
So I'm working on it now.

2466
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:58,280
As we speak, we have these experiments going next door.

2467
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:01,520
So the question is, you don't want to use insulin therapy unless you're in therapeutic

2468
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,520
ketosis.

2469
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:05,840
You don't want to go into a hyperbaric chamber unless you're in therapeutic ketosis.

2470
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:08,600
And then we would pulse with drugs that target glutamine.

2471
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:13,300
And together, you're removing the antioxidant capacity of the tumor, making it vulnerable

2472
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,300
to hyperbaric oxygen.

2473
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:18,020
How much can these drugs lower local levels of glutamine?

2474
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:19,640
Enough to slaughter the tumor cells.

2475
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:21,120
But I don't know enough about this.

2476
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:23,960
Is that a 50% reduction that's necessary to do that?

2477
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:27,400
Because you're getting about a 50% reduction in glucose based on the therapy you've described.

2478
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:31,360
We want to lower the glucose even further because you can do that.

2479
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:35,120
And with ketones correction with targeting glutamine, it's got to be pulsed because

2480
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,320
you can't chronically reduce glutamine to the availability to the physiology.

2481
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:41,060
But acutely, how much do you lower it?

2482
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:42,680
We can lower it quite effectively.

2483
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:43,680
We can shut it.

2484
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:47,560
And well, don't forget, the cancer cell is absolutely dependent on this fuel.

2485
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:50,280
The normal cells get, they can burn the ketones also.

2486
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:53,520
So they're not going to be energy deprived completely.

2487
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,040
Whereas the tumor cell will be deprived energy completely.

2488
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:59,400
Are there some cancer cells that preferentially utilize ketones?

2489
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,860
No cancer cell can use ketones.

2490
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:02,240
You have to have a good mitochondria.

2491
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:08,000
A cancer cell that would have some oxidative capacity, a small amount of oxidative capacity

2492
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,880
could burn some ketones.

2493
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:14,440
But most of the most aggressive cancer cells can't burn ketones because they're mitochondria

2494
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,440
defective.

2495
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,440
That you need a good mitochondria.

2496
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:22,080
That's why it's a selective, it selects for enhancing the vitality of the normal cell

2497
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,760
while putting the cancer cell at a competitive disadvantage.

2498
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,080
So the ketones are not to kill cancer cells.

2499
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:32,280
They provide the normal cells with a fuel as an alternative to glucose.

2500
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,500
That the tumor cells can't use the ketones.

2501
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:38,560
And if there are many experiments like this, if you take cancer cells and grow them in

2502
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,440
a dish without glucose and glutamine, just ketones, they die.

2503
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,440
But normal cells don't.

2504
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:46,600
The normal cells can survive on the ketones without the glucose and glutamine.

2505
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:48,600
So it's very clear that the tumor cells can't use it.

2506
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,840
And as I said, you have to have a good mitochondria to do this.

2507
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:56,740
So we're selectively marginalizing these tumor cells because of their metabolic in capabilities.

2508
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:59,780
But it has to be done strategically over time.

2509
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:01,500
And where does the hyperbaric oxygen fit in?

2510
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,820
Is that part of the pulse obviously?

2511
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,420
Yeah, that's a pulse therapy.

2512
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:07,540
And how much hyperbaric?

2513
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:11,520
We want to try to replace radiation therapy with hyperbaric oxygen because the mechanisms

2514
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,820
of cell death will be very simple.

2515
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:13,980
So how many atmospheres?

2516
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:16,000
We do it at two and a half atmospheres.

2517
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
For how long?

2518
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,460
Well, we were doing it for 90 minutes every day, something like this.

2519
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:27,620
So it's designed to put oxidative stress, killing the tumor cells by oxidative stress,

2520
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:30,820
the same way a radiation therapy would work.

2521
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:34,860
Radiation a lot of times doesn't work because the cells are in a hypoxic environment.

2522
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:36,900
So why are they in such a hypoxic environment?

2523
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:37,900
Because they're fermenting.

2524
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:41,500
They're blowing out all this fermentable fuels into the waste products.

2525
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:43,620
Got to clean that all up.

2526
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:47,260
That micro environment has to be brought back to a normal state.

2527
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:54,700
And therapeutic ketosis, we published several papers showing that it's a powerful anti-inflammatory

2528
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,700
therapy.

2529
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,540
It makes the micro environment less inflamed.

2530
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,940
It's pro-apatotic.

2531
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,940
It's anti-angiogenic.

2532
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:04,300
So you're killing all these bad blood vessels and replacing them with normal blood vessels

2533
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:06,420
that the normal cells will be able to use.

2534
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:12,540
So it's reconfiguring the micro environment while putting stress and killing tumor cells.

2535
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:15,100
Now the tumor becomes more and more vulnerable.

2536
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:19,260
And now it becomes more and more damaged by drugs that are going to chip away at the

2537
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:20,780
surviving cells.

2538
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,260
It's not something we're going to go in like a bull in a china shop.

2539
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:27,080
It's going to be a gradual degrading of the tumor.

2540
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:29,060
And where does the surgery take place here?

2541
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:31,180
Is the surgery taking place before all of this happens?

2542
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:32,180
No.

2543
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:34,740
The surgery would take place at some midpoint.

2544
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:38,740
The midpoint would be where the surgeon now looks at the tumor and says, I can take care

2545
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:39,740
of this.

2546
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,380
It's not going to be a diffuse mass.

2547
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:44,820
It's not going to be an angry inflamed thing where you have to cut out half the guy's

2548
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:48,220
colon in order to get what you think is the part of the cancer that's in.

2549
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:51,100
Now this thing will be now much more shriveled.

2550
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:52,220
We've seen it.

2551
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,220
It's much less angry.

2552
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,220
It's a micro.

2553
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,340
It's more demarcated.

2554
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,940
You can see it on this in the histological slides.

2555
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,940
You can see what the hell happened to this tumor.

2556
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:01,460
How come it's smaller?

2557
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:06,820
How come it's more the margins are more sharply defined because you took away the inflammation

2558
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:10,060
that was being driven by the fermentation fuels.

2559
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,540
So you shrink in this tumor down.

2560
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:17,460
Now the surgeon comes in and can potentially cure these people that would be maybe not

2561
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:19,220
curable in the past.

2562
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:24,940
So this is why I'm saying we can reduce the death rate by 50% if you view the tumor as

2563
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:28,340
a metabolic problem rather than a genetic problem.

2564
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:30,620
The gene mutations are all downstream epiphanoma.

2565
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:31,680
They're red herrings.

2566
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:36,420
Even Vogelstein, who still claims that this is a bird Vogelstein from China, he still

2567
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:39,980
claims it's a genetic disease, but we're never going to cure the disease by targeting the

2568
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:40,980
genes.

2569
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:42,540
We're going to treat these patients, all this kind of stuff.

2570
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:44,660
But we can do that with metabolic therapy.

2571
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:48,700
We can actually eliminate the cancer based on metabolic therapy.

2572
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:49,980
It's a process.

2573
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,420
Who's trained to do this?

2574
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:52,420
No one.

2575
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:55,140
I mean, we need physicians to be trained to do this.

2576
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:59,420
They've been used to train to give high doses of radiation without killing the patient or

2577
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:03,340
poisoning these poor people with drugs that are very toxic and keeping them alive so you

2578
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,140
don't die from the treatments.

2579
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:06,300
This is absurd.

2580
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:09,220
Why are you using radiation and chemo in the first place?

2581
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:10,820
We have to stop proliferation.

2582
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,820
Okay.

2583
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:14,060
If they can't generate energy, they're going to stop proliferating.

2584
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:15,540
They're going to die.

2585
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:18,780
What is the experiment, the clinical trial that you're involved in in Turkey that you've

2586
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:19,780
alluded to?

2587
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:20,780
Yeah.

2588
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:24,940
What we do, my colleagues in Turkey do, is they use chemo, but they use the lowest possible

2589
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:25,940
dose.

2590
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:26,940
Is it for breast cancer?

2591
02:13:26,940 --> 02:13:27,940
All cancers.

2592
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:28,940
In fact, the results are the same.

2593
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:29,940
All cancers are the same disease.

2594
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:30,940
They're all fermenters.

2595
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:34,860
Once you knew that they're all dependent on these two fuels, then all you have to do is

2596
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:38,500
target the two fuels to put them at risk for elimination.

2597
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:42,220
The question is, how can you target the fuels without harming the rest of the body?

2598
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:44,000
And that's the press pulse concept.

2599
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,580
So we know we can press things constantly without harming the body, but we have the

2600
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:52,320
pulse, the glutamine issue, because we don't want to deprive our normal immune system and

2601
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:57,080
gut systems of the very fuel needed to provide normal physiology in those tissues.

2602
02:13:57,080 --> 02:14:00,000
So this is why we have to pulse the glutamine issue.

2603
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,460
How many glutamine drugs are there?

2604
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:05,860
Well, there's some coming all the time, but the one that works the best for us is Don.

2605
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:08,380
Are there any that are in clinical trials in the United States?

2606
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:09,380
Yeah, there's a couple.

2607
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:10,380
There's a name.

2608
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:11,980
There's a few names of them.

2609
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:15,340
They target various aspects of the glutaminolysis pathway.

2610
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:18,540
The problem is we have a drug that's called a dirty drug.

2611
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:23,980
It hits multiple pathways of glutamine metabolism, and it seems to work better than all the other

2612
02:14:23,980 --> 02:14:26,220
drugs, at least from our perspective so far.

2613
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,220
Which drug is that?

2614
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:29,580
This is Don, the sixth norilucine.

2615
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:33,100
It was used in clinical trials years ago, but it was partially effective.

2616
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:34,100
But they weren't targeting.

2617
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:35,940
They weren't doing the full metabolic approach.

2618
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:40,220
If you don't do all the parts of the problem, the horse is going to get out.

2619
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:42,020
It's still not going to be effective.

2620
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:46,260
And today, no one anywhere on the planet is doing the kind of a therapy that we think

2621
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:48,180
need to do to make this all work.

2622
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,460
Now, there's bits and pieces of it.

2623
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:52,740
And then what are the drugs that are in current clinical trials that are targeting glutamine?

2624
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:57,820
Well, there's a BEPTS, I believe, an acronym for another very complicated structure.

2625
02:14:57,820 --> 02:15:01,740
And then they're making Don analogs that are supposedly less toxic.

2626
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:06,100
What we find is with the ketogenic diet, Don becomes far less toxic.

2627
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:09,500
So you can actually use far lower doses.

2628
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:13,600
So I was talking to somebody the other day, is it better to wait for a pharmaceutical

2629
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:19,700
company to build a new drug to target cancer, or is it better to develop a way in which

2630
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:22,820
a previously very effective drug could be less toxic?

2631
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:24,900
And both of them, the end result is the same.

2632
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:28,020
You're going to get something that's going to work far better than what was previously

2633
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:29,020
available.

2634
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:33,740
So how many clinics in the country, in the world, are treating cancer as a metabolic

2635
02:15:33,740 --> 02:15:39,780
disease using a strategy that will take away the two prime fermentable fuels for the disorder?

2636
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:41,260
And the answer is no one.

2637
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:42,760
No one's doing this.

2638
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,060
But this trial in Turkey is doing this?

2639
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:46,900
Well, they're not targeting the glutamine.

2640
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,220
So they're doing these other processes.

2641
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:55,500
So it's the glucose, the ketones, the hyperbaric oxygen, but not pulsing with glutamine, not

2642
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:56,500
the anti-glutamine.

2643
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,500
Not doing the glutamine.

2644
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,620
Nobody's doing the glutamine.

2645
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:02,220
We tried doing that in our Egyptian patient that we published recently.

2646
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:06,540
We used chloroquine and we used EGCG, which is a green tea extract.

2647
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:09,740
But they're not as powerful in the clinic.

2648
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:11,500
Now that poor guy, he just passed away.

2649
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,620
We were devastated by this.

2650
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:14,040
We published the paper.

2651
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:17,780
He lived 30 months, which is far longer than most people with a glioblastoma.

2652
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:20,500
He was doing really well on metabolic therapy.

2653
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:23,980
We pushed off the standard of care for three months.

2654
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:30,060
So we did surgery after three weeks of therapeutic ketosis, debulked the tumor, most of it, because

2655
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:31,420
you never get all GBM.

2656
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:36,580
And then we didn't do...we were forced into the radiation therapy after three months,

2657
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:38,500
even though the guy was doing remarkably well.

2658
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,700
So this is a...so we said, why are we irradiated?

2659
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:42,260
We have to, because it's part of the standard.

2660
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:44,620
Even in...this was in Alexandria, Egypt.

2661
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:48,140
And then a year later, he starts developing...or what?

2662
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,220
Six or eight months later, he starts developing a headache.

2663
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:54,220
His head starts to swell.

2664
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:57,620
And they did the compression, the bulking, and they found, looked at the tissue.

2665
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:58,620
There weren't any tumor cells.

2666
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:02,380
He was dying from radiation necrosis that he took from the radiation.

2667
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:03,980
So this is why I'm very much against it.

2668
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:08,020
I think we're not going to make any major advance in brain cancer until we stop irradiating

2669
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:11,820
people with the brain, because you're creating a bigger problem.

2670
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:14,060
And this is leading to the demise of all these poor patients.

2671
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:17,300
The survival after radiation is almost zero.

2672
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:22,420
So and that's in my mind, it's becoming...it's doing in part to the radiation that we're

2673
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,820
given to these people.

2674
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:26,700
So whether they're dying from the tumor or radiation necrosis, they're going to be dying.

2675
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:28,540
They shouldn't be doing that in the first place.

2676
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:35,380
So the standards of care have to be dramatically changed in order to improve overall survival.

2677
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:40,060
So when I say we can drop death rates by 50 percent in 10 years, we're not only dropping

2678
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:45,700
death rates, we're massively increasing overall survival and quality of life at the same time.

2679
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:51,500
So I have a lot of anecdotal information with people who have been treated with metabolic

2680
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,260
therapy, part of it.

2681
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,540
They're living far longer.

2682
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:56,500
The quality of life is much better.

2683
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:58,620
And when they die, they die in a very peaceful way.

2684
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:01,460
And this, some of my clinician friends have been telling me this, these guys that are

2685
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:04,800
on these metabolic therapies, the quality of life is really good up until about two

2686
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,300
weeks before they die.

2687
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:09,740
Whereas the people doing standard of care never live as long, and the quality of life

2688
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,740
is horrific.

2689
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:12,220
They're living there, they're in capacity.

2690
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:18,620
So do you think that metabolic therapies offer the potential for cure or just another therapeutic

2691
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:19,620
option?

2692
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:26,500
Because if you want to reduce the death rate by 50 percent, there's no lead time bias slash

2693
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:29,420
therapeutic extension that's going to do that.

2694
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:32,740
That is a paradigm shift in cure, not treatment.

2695
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:33,740
I think it's both.

2696
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:37,820
I think you're going to be able to extend dramatically overall survival.

2697
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:41,860
You're going to improve dramatically quality of life.

2698
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:43,900
And how do we know if we're cured?

2699
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:48,740
The issue is that if you die from a heart disease at 85 and you had cancer when you

2700
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:51,700
were 50, a so-called a terminal disease.

2701
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:54,500
No, I mean, I think we could pick something simpler than that, right?

2702
02:18:54,500 --> 02:19:00,980
If you are 10 years disease free, to a first order approximation, you're cancer free, right?

2703
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:06,060
If you had colon cancer 10 years ago and 10 years later you die of a heart attack, I think

2704
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,100
it's safe to say you died of heart disease.

2705
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:12,020
Even if on an autopsy they find dormant cancer cells.

2706
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:13,540
Well, here's a situation.

2707
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:19,140
If you take standard of care and you live 10 years or like you said, and you drop dead

2708
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:24,780
of a heart attack, was that heart attack the result of the cancer or the treatment?

2709
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:30,580
You also have to put into perspective what effect does the treatments have on your overall

2710
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:32,900
long-term survival as well, right?

2711
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:36,620
So Dana Farber down here just opened up a branch of medicine called cancer survivor

2712
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:37,620
medicine.

2713
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:41,180
It appears that many people treated with standards of care are suffering horrifically from all

2714
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:44,380
these other kinds of diseases they never had, but for the fact that they were treated with

2715
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:45,900
all this toxic stuff.

2716
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:46,900
So we would eliminate that.

2717
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:50,500
Why would you, if you're in therapeutic ketosis and you're unlikely...

2718
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:56,060
But I'm still like, what's the proof of concept that the metabolic therapy can lead to a cure?

2719
02:19:56,060 --> 02:20:03,420
So is your hypothesis that this gentleman in Alexandria, if he hadn't undergone radiation

2720
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:07,820
for the GBM, your belief is he could have actually had a cure?

2721
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:13,260
I don't know because we can't know, like you said, we'd have to wait 10 years to know that.

2722
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:17,700
So if we were to institute an aggressive metabolic program for managing cancer...

2723
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:19,940
But it seems GBM would be the place to do it, right?

2724
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:24,700
Because it's, you know, it unfortunately is such a uniformly fatal cancer.

2725
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:28,660
And it's fatal because of the treatment that they're giving these, this combination of

2726
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:32,340
what they're doing to the patient as well as the tumor.

2727
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:39,260
The problem clinically, right, is that the mass effect doesn't give you a lot of flexibility

2728
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:40,900
to delay surgery.

2729
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:44,540
So between corticosteroids and radiation, when a patient...

2730
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:49,660
So most patients present with GBM, not as incidental findings, they have symptoms from

2731
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:51,180
the mass effect.

2732
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:56,020
So we have to be sympathetic to the clinicians in the conventional pathway who are saying,

2733
02:20:56,020 --> 02:21:03,740
I got Bob here, he's complaining, he's got, you know, hemiparalysis and he's got a GBM.

2734
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:07,620
The idea that we're going to wait a month to put him on a ketogenic diet when I need

2735
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:13,100
to either cut that thing out now or radiate him or put him on corticosteroids.

2736
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,660
So in other words, this is going to be a very difficult thing to study.

2737
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:18,580
Well, it's a judgment call on the part of the neurosurgeon, okay?

2738
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:22,020
So he looks at the data, do we have a watchful waiting period?

2739
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:23,020
This is...

2740
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:25,340
I've spoken to many neurosurgeons, a lot of my friends.

2741
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:26,460
I said, what's the stat?

2742
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:27,460
What do we do here?

2743
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:31,420
He said, occasionally, if you have brain herniation possibility, the patient will be dead in a

2744
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:33,180
week, we don't do debulking.

2745
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:34,500
That patient has to be debulked.

2746
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:35,500
All right.

2747
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,860
But you don't have to give them steroids.

2748
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:38,860
You can just do debulking.

2749
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:40,060
Steroids will shrink the edema.

2750
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:41,060
Yeah.

2751
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:44,140
Of the three, what would be the most evil in your mind?

2752
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:47,900
Meaning metabolically evil, the radiation, the corticosteroid or the surgery?

2753
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:50,860
Oh, clearly the steroids and the radiation.

2754
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:54,940
So then it would seem to me that every GBM patient should go and have the resection.

2755
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:59,740
And then undergo metabolic therapy, even though they're not technically going to be free of

2756
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:00,740
disease.

2757
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:01,740
Yeah.

2758
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:03,740
I think this is the strategy.

2759
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:08,300
How long the watchful waiting period is will give the neurosurgeon an opportunity to do

2760
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:10,020
a greater debulking.

2761
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:13,940
And there's a hundred articles in the literature showing that you live longer on debulking,

2762
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,860
the more you can debulk the tumor.

2763
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:18,500
So if we can shrink the tumor down, like we did to the...

2764
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:20,260
On our Egyptian patients, we waited three weeks.

2765
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:25,580
We put them under incredible therapeutic fasting, water only, 900 ketogenic diet.

2766
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:27,380
They did a very awake, good...

2767
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:28,380
900.

2768
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:30,020
900 calories, kilocalories.

2769
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:31,940
Yeah, but not water only, you said.

2770
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:33,420
Water for the first three days, water only.

2771
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,420
I see.

2772
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:36,140
And then we transitioned him.

2773
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:37,620
He did an awake cradiotomy.

2774
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:39,380
He was done very well.

2775
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:42,460
Then we pushed off the radiation therapy for three months.

2776
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:43,460
And then they did...

2777
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:46,740
And we didn't want to do that because the tumor was looking really good.

2778
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:48,620
He had a correction of the midline shift.

2779
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:50,980
He was in good shape.

2780
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:53,340
So I think he suffered from the radiation.

2781
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:56,060
I think he didn't survive because of the radiation treatment.

2782
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:59,740
Do you think that GBM would be the best histology to study this in?

2783
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:01,060
Oh, yeah, because it's the...

2784
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:03,700
As you said, the survival is...

2785
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,460
You're gonna see a signal if one's there.

2786
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:06,460
Yeah.

2787
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:11,700
And then I've spoken to a lot of my friends who think that, okay, we have to debulk immediately,

2788
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:13,900
then we're gonna go on metabolic therapy.

2789
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:16,900
We can push it off for two weeks and then do metabolic therapy.

2790
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:19,380
The thing we have to do is we have to eliminate radiation.

2791
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:22,340
I think radiation is the biggest part of the problem.

2792
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:26,220
I think if you're doing metabolic therapy, you should eliminate radiation right away.

2793
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,620
I have no doubt about this.

2794
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:30,780
It's absolutely, in my mind, a problem.

2795
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:34,460
And this is one of the reasons why there's so few people surviving.

2796
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:36,020
It's because you are radiating this.

2797
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:38,540
If you didn't irradiate, you could survive a lot longer.

2798
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:42,420
I think with metabolic therapy, you can double, triple the amount of survival.

2799
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,420
How do we know this?

2800
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:48,220
Because those patients that I know who rejected radiation and chemo, took surgery after two

2801
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:50,140
years or a year, are doing well.

2802
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:51,540
They're out four years.

2803
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:52,540
So clearly...

2804
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:53,540
With which histologies?

2805
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:54,540
GBM.

2806
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:58,140
There are GBM patients alive at four years?

2807
02:23:58,140 --> 02:23:59,140
Yes.

2808
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,140
Pablo Kelly.

2809
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:01,140
In fact, I'm gonna be there next week.

2810
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:02,140
He's gonna be sitting in the audience.

2811
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:03,140
Is this published?

2812
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:06,140
No, it's not published, but the guy has all the documentation.

2813
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:07,700
It's just that it's not yet published.

2814
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:08,700
Why?

2815
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:11,340
Because I haven't sat down and wrote it up yet.

2816
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:13,380
What would be more important than writing that up?

2817
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,780
Writing another paper up that I thought the guy was gonna live just as long, but he gets

2818
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:17,780
a radio...

2819
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:18,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2820
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,020
Look, that guy was one guy alive three years.

2821
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:24,740
If you have a cohort of patients that have been alive for four years with GBM, I don't

2822
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:26,260
know what would be more important than writing that up.

2823
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:27,260
Do I?

2824
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:28,660
I don't know of anything more important either.

2825
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:29,660
But you don't forget it.

2826
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,780
We should stop this podcast now, so you can start writing that up.

2827
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,780
Well, I'll talk to it.

2828
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:35,940
In fact, he's gonna be giving a lecture after my lecture.

2829
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:40,620
Because that's really where you wanna be able to generate interest on a clinical trial.

2830
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:41,620
So how many people?

2831
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:43,820
He's a young guy, 25 years old.

2832
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:45,420
He says, I don't want radiation.

2833
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:46,420
I don't want chemo.

2834
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:47,420
I don't want any of that stuff.

2835
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,420
I don't want surgery, he says.

2836
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,500
Oh, you're gonna be dead in three to six months.

2837
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:51,500
That's what they told him.

2838
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,500
It's all in the news.

2839
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:53,500
It was in the newspapers.

2840
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:55,420
I gave him the stuff on the metabolic therapy.

2841
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:56,820
I didn't know he was gonna live that long.

2842
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:59,420
I thought he was just gonna live a few extra months.

2843
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:01,020
He comes back and he says, I'm still alive.

2844
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:04,620
And there's a big newspaper article in the British newspapers about this guy who rejects

2845
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,620
all.

2846
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:07,580
So after two years, he decides, let me...

2847
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:13,100
He had an inoperable glioblastoma that now became operable after metabolic therapy.

2848
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,740
So they debulked it.

2849
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:19,260
And now, after another year, he doesn't have any tumor left.

2850
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:20,260
And he never had radiation.

2851
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:21,500
He never had chemo.

2852
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:23,860
He had surgery, very delayed.

2853
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:28,340
And they did a histological analysis after the debulking, said, yes, you did have a GBM.

2854
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:31,380
Because what a lot of people say, if you live that long, you never had a GBM.

2855
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:32,380
You didn't have GBM.

2856
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:33,380
That's bullshit.

2857
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:34,380
It's just not...

2858
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:41,860
I mean, you're creating a situation that leads to the demise of those very people that you

2859
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:43,980
are trying to help.

2860
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:48,540
And when you irradiate the brain, you free up massive amounts of glutamine by breaking

2861
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,300
the glutamine-glutamate cycle.

2862
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:53,380
So those tumor cells are sucking down massive amounts of glutamine.

2863
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:56,940
And then you give the steroids to reduce the edema, which then elevates the blood sugar.

2864
02:25:56,940 --> 02:26:00,300
So I was gonna give you two experiments, two dream experiments.

2865
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:05,220
So the second one would be going back to sort of the more fundamental premise of this,

2866
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:14,620
which is, if resources were no constraint, how could one unambiguously make the case

2867
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:23,260
slash test the hypothesis that despite structural abnormalities in the mitochondria, the production

2868
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:29,780
of lactate and the fermentation is not purely for respiratory compensation?

2869
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:34,280
In other words, we talked about this idea that says you can have a structural deficit

2870
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:36,980
but still be functionally good enough.

2871
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:38,780
How could that hypothesis be tested?

2872
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:42,900
Because that seems to be one of the central arguments here.

2873
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:45,600
Well, I mean, there's several ways we look at this.

2874
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:50,300
If a cell can live with ketones without glucose and glutamine, you'd obviously have some mitochondrial

2875
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:53,280
function that would keep them alive because they wouldn't be able to ferment.

2876
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,920
But let's like, we're in a resource unconstrained world.

2877
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:59,060
So what are the dream experiments that would test that in humans?

2878
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:00,060
You have to...

2879
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:06,020
I mean, in vivo, because a lot of these mechanisms would be tested in vitro because you can't

2880
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:08,520
do those kinds of experiments.

2881
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:14,660
But the metabolic therapy that we have designed, Dom the Agostino, myself, Joe Maroon, who's

2882
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:20,140
the team surgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers, neurosurgeon, George Yu, who is a prostate

2883
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:25,100
oncologist, prostate cancer oncologist, we all sat down and we built this press pulse

2884
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:26,100
therapy.

2885
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:32,240
So if you deprive the tumor cells of their fermentable fuels and you kill and you essentially

2886
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:38,080
eliminate, I can't detect any more cancer in your body, that's based on the biology

2887
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,440
of what the problem is.

2888
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:45,060
So the dream experiments are to ferret that out mechanistically in vitro.

2889
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:48,840
So to prove that this is the case, and we're doing that right now when we target these

2890
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:51,380
things, these cells die.

2891
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:54,380
So you can put them in a normal cells wouldn't die.

2892
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:55,900
So clearly what's going on here?

2893
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:58,260
I mean, it was shown in many papers.

2894
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:01,340
In fact, they're back in the thirties and forties, beautiful papers showing that the

2895
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:04,980
respiratory system of tumor cells is massively compromised.

2896
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:08,640
Okay, if that's the case, then they're surviving on fermentation.

2897
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:15,340
There's no other known biological system in the world that can provide alternative ATP.

2898
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:17,460
But yet most people don't agree with that statement.

2899
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:21,940
So that's what I'm asking is what experiment could take the debate out of that very important

2900
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:22,940
question?

2901
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:27,980
If they don't believe it, if I look at the data and you look at the data and we both

2902
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:31,780
come to the same conclusion and this other guy looks at the same data and he says, I

2903
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:32,780
don't believe it.

2904
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:36,620
Then it tells me the data are not convincing enough if everybody's acting in good faith.

2905
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:39,380
Well then do you have to ask about what's good faith?

2906
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:40,380
If I have...

2907
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,380
Or what's better data.

2908
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:43,220
Okay, look, here's the way I look at it.

2909
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:49,540
If science is a human activity, okay, there are people who say things that are not true

2910
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:51,260
and everybody believes it.

2911
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:52,260
Right?

2912
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:54,420
So I look at something and but I don't know.

2913
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:57,420
I'll refrain from making all political jokes right now.

2914
02:28:57,420 --> 02:28:58,420
Yeah, right.

2915
02:28:58,420 --> 02:28:59,420
Right.

2916
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:00,420
I understand.

2917
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:01,740
But I understand completely.

2918
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:04,940
But the issue here of course is that you have...

2919
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:12,300
It's one thing to say, okay, we had a review on a paper that we know there's a massive

2920
02:29:12,300 --> 02:29:15,740
biology on the role of cardiolipin in controlling the electron transport chain.

2921
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:18,020
I mean there's dozens and dozens of papers on this.

2922
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:20,500
A molecular biologist, I don't believe it.

2923
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:22,940
Well, what don't you believe?

2924
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:28,700
What part of this massive amount of scientific evidence that you don't believe?

2925
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:31,100
I'm unfamiliar with cardiolipin, therefore it can't be right.

2926
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,980
Well, that's not the reason to discount the right.

2927
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:38,820
And when you write the paper up, why would you not cite Pete Peterson's massive compendium

2928
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:42,980
of evidence saying mitochondria are abnormal and you say mitochondria is normal?

2929
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:49,900
Well, how does that jive with the massive amounts of evidence that say that's not...

2930
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:55,940
What I try to do in all my writings, I never try to ignore an alternative fact to what

2931
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,940
I'm saying.

2932
02:29:56,940 --> 02:30:02,780
I try to say there is a fact that I'm not yet completely clear about, but I'm not going

2933
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:04,820
to ignore it.

2934
02:30:04,820 --> 02:30:09,580
You'll find in the scientific literature today in the top journals that they're ignoring

2935
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:13,860
massive evidence that don't support their position.

2936
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:15,980
And that's one of the problems.

2937
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:21,060
And like we were saying that this problem in cancer, all these top journals, cell science,

2938
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:26,300
nature, up to 50% of the article can't be reproduced in other people's labs.

2939
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:28,320
This is a crisis in the field.

2940
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:29,660
What's going on here?

2941
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:34,940
So you're ignoring massive evidence that doesn't fit your particular mindset.

2942
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,900
So you'll just discount it.

2943
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:41,380
I don't think it's any different than the geocentric, heliocentric model of the solar

2944
02:30:41,380 --> 02:30:42,460
system.

2945
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:46,580
The Catholic Church refused to believe that the earth was not the center of the solar

2946
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:50,060
system despite all the evidence that said it was.

2947
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:51,420
They just refused to believe it.

2948
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:53,740
We have the exact same thing in the cancer field.

2949
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:57,060
You have massive evidence showing that the mitochondria are structurally and functionally

2950
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:58,060
dysfunctional.

2951
02:30:58,060 --> 02:31:02,860
I don't want to believe it.

2952
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:04,780
What can you do about that?

2953
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:09,300
What can you do about that when you have the evidence to show that and you choose to ignore

2954
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:10,300
it?

2955
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:13,620
It's slightly different than the heliocentric, geocentric system that we had.

2956
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:15,980
The difference today is that we have 1,600 people.

2957
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:17,980
Yeah, I mean it's slightly different, right?

2958
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:19,620
But I don't want to get into details.

2959
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:20,620
It's a fact.

2960
02:31:20,620 --> 02:31:21,620
You have fact.

2961
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:22,620
Yeah.

2962
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:23,620
And don't forget that you-

2963
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:28,260
Well, but I think the Catholic Church was basically relying on a religious framework

2964
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:30,500
as their counter argument.

2965
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:31,500
Of course.

2966
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,860
And so their belief system was formed by something different.

2967
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:35,660
I think in the scientific-

2968
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:40,260
Yeah, but when Galileo said, please look through the telescope to document the Copernicus

2969
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:41,300
was right.

2970
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:42,660
They didn't want to look in the telescope.

2971
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:45,060
They didn't want to look in the telescope.

2972
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:47,400
So because it would disrupt their worldview.

2973
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:48,400
If you've just put the list-

2974
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,460
No, I mean I think that's a fair statement.

2975
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:56,260
I guess, again, I come back to this through the lens of I'd love to know what the experiments

2976
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:58,900
are that could ... Because I view it as a stalemate.

2977
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:01,380
If you're looking at a body of literature and they're looking at a different body of

2978
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:04,460
literature and every time everybody looks at everybody else's body of literature, they

2979
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:09,060
say, well, there's an alternative explanation for this.

2980
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:10,060
We're making no progress.

2981
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:15,860
The answer to me is collaborate, generate new experiments where-

2982
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:20,380
That's why I think knowing the biology of the disease as well as I think I do, and we

2983
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:24,620
never can know completely everything because every human being is a different entity or

2984
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:27,180
dealing with a different entity.

2985
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:33,260
If we can increase overall survival and improve quality of life massively advanced to what

2986
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:38,700
we're doing today because of we use the strategy based on what we understand to be the biological

2987
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:43,140
problem and the results support that, then I think that's the advance.

2988
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:45,820
Glioblastoma would be a wonderful-

2989
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:50,100
Speaking of that, realistically, when do you think that case report of these four years

2990
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:51,740
surviving cohorts will be published?

2991
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:53,500
I'm going to try it when I talk to him over there.

2992
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:57,660
I'd like to speak to the very physicians that actually took the data from him, from Pablo.

2993
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:00,180
How many patients are in that cohort?

2994
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:01,180
Just him.

2995
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,540
Oh, there's just one guy who survived four years.

2996
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:03,940
Well, one guy because he rejected-

2997
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:04,940
No, I understand.

2998
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:05,940
I misunderstood.

2999
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,940
I thought there were several patients.

3000
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:10,980
Well, there's Andrew Scarborough who initiated a first couple of raids and said, no more

3001
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:11,980
of this.

3002
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:12,980
He took no radiation, no chemo.

3003
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:13,980
He's still going.

3004
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:18,340
He had a stage three astrocytoma, which is also quite lethal.

3005
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,460
Then there's Alison Gannett.

3006
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:20,780
She's on the news.

3007
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:24,580
She has a website saying that she survived GBM without this.

3008
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:28,740
I have other anecdotal reports based on what people have told me.

3009
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:35,340
One poor guy, he had no money, no insurance, so they didn't want to rate it because they

3010
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:37,780
wouldn't be able to rate any revenue from this guy.

3011
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:42,020
He just did ketogenic diets way back before even I was talking about it.

3012
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:45,180
He's still alive 16 years.

3013
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:46,180
What was the...

3014
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:49,100
Did they eventually do surgery on him?

3015
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:52,460
They did surgery, but they didn't do anything else.

3016
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:53,460
What does that say?

3017
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:55,780
Again, these are anecdotal, but with Pablo, we have data.

3018
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:58,700
We have clear data from him.

3019
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:01,500
It's not like we don't have data from him.

3020
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,080
We have a lot of these things people would say, well, you can't do this.

3021
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:11,480
You can't do what I'm asking you to do because it violates the standard of care.

3022
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:14,880
The standard of care should never have been written in granite.

3023
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:15,920
It should be flexible.

3024
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:19,340
If you have something else that comes along that might be better, you'd think there would

3025
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:21,000
be an enthusiasm.

3026
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,020
No, we have not seen that.

3027
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:26,600
We try to get this through the University of Pittsburgh to try to do this.

3028
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:28,600
The advisory board, right?

3029
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:29,600
The IRB.

3030
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:32,080
The IRB refused.

3031
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:36,360
They would only might consider metabolic therapy after standard of care fail.

3032
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,200
What's standard of care fails all the time?

3033
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:40,800
Why don't you try metabolic therapy as an alternative to standard of...

3034
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,200
No, we can't do that.

3035
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:43,200
Why?

3036
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:44,520
Well, because we can't do that.

3037
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:45,520
Why?

3038
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,720
Because we can't do that.

3039
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:48,960
That means there's inflexibility.

3040
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:54,280
We're up against firewalls after firewalls after firewalls to try to change the way we

3041
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:55,280
continue.

3042
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:59,120
We're doing all the gene screening, mounting to nothing because cancer is not a genetic

3043
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:00,120
disease.

3044
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:03,760
We have all these firewalls that are preventing us from moving forward the way I think we

3045
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,560
need to be moving forward.

3046
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:07,400
For a GBM patient, what do they have to lose?

3047
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:13,080
There was a paper that just came out the other day in from out of British Columbia, Canada,

3048
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:15,280
carefully looking at survival for GBM.

3049
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:20,280
They said it's woefully similar to the 1926 Bailey and Cushing paper for Christ's sake.

3050
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,280
What's going on here?

3051
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,880
You mean in 100, almost 100 years?

3052
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,720
John McCain's size is 12 months.

3053
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:30,000
That's no different than if he had the cancer, than if he had the tumor in 1926.

3054
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,480
That tells us we have a serious, serious problem.

3055
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:37,520
And I'm offering an alternative that might be able to change that.

3056
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,880
What is wrong with that?

3057
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:41,960
Why would I be attacked for something like this?

3058
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:42,960
Right?

3059
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:45,640
So you tell me, I have to know what's going on here.

3060
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:47,600
So I go up and I say, you can't irradiate the brain.

3061
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,280
Oh, you've got to do it.

3062
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:55,000
Here's my parting shot of advice, Tom, which is it's worth nothing, but your passion is

3063
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,000
palpable.

3064
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,340
I lost a friend to GBM.

3065
02:35:57,340 --> 02:36:00,380
So the very first person in my life that I ever knew that died of cancer, died of a

3066
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:01,660
GBM.

3067
02:36:01,660 --> 02:36:04,540
And I was with him almost until the day he died.

3068
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:08,840
And it was the saddest thing to see the last year of his, he lived 18 months and a year

3069
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:11,360
of it he couldn't see.

3070
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:17,380
So you know, talk about what is it like to be a 19 year old kid who can't see anything?

3071
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:20,220
And I look at, it's actually one of the saddest stories.

3072
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:21,220
I don't even want to tell it.

3073
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:22,220
It's so upsetting.

3074
02:36:22,220 --> 02:36:24,140
Anyway, I get it.

3075
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:26,620
I think my advice would be the following.

3076
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:30,340
Whatever you've been doing, the phone rings, what the hell, perfect time.

3077
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:33,340
Whatever you've been doing is not getting through.

3078
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,700
You got to do something different.

3079
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:37,500
So there's a quote by someone who's escaping me.

3080
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:40,460
It's like the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting

3081
02:36:40,460 --> 02:36:41,820
a different outcome.

3082
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:42,820
You got to do something different.

3083
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:44,420
I don't know what it is.

3084
02:36:44,420 --> 02:36:46,460
If I had that advice, I'd offer it.

3085
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:50,220
But I'm just saying, you've got to try a new approach to get that clinical trial done.

3086
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,220
Yeah.

3087
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:55,060
Well, don't forget, I'm a professor in an academic non-medical school environment.

3088
02:36:55,060 --> 02:37:02,140
So we designed the preclinical studies that allow the clinicians to then adapt it to

3089
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,940
their patient population.

3090
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:09,380
So this is what ... We're one of the only groups in the world that are actually doing

3091
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:14,020
bench to bedside real research because I have tentacles for all these different clinical

3092
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:15,020
things.

3093
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:16,020
I get it.

3094
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:24,260
All I'm saying is the current ... You're abutting a resistance and you've got to go around it.

3095
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:26,620
You've got to ... You've got to go around it.

3096
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:31,300
And it might be that you get enough of these case reports published that it becomes very

3097
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:36,060
difficult to ignore and people would say, look, here's a concession.

3098
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:40,420
We're going to do surgery immediately and then follow with metabolic therapy.

3099
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:45,820
Because I think we're going to have a very hard time saying no surgery, no clinical steroid,

3100
02:37:45,820 --> 02:37:46,820
no radiation.

3101
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:47,820
I think that's metaphysically not going to work.

3102
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:48,820
No, no, no.

3103
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:49,820
I didn't say that.

3104
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,820
I said, no, no.

3105
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:51,820
I know.

3106
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,820
I know.

3107
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:53,820
I know.

3108
02:37:53,820 --> 02:38:00,700
And if you're going to accept immediate surgery but delaying or postponing radiation and or

3109
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:07,020
corticosteroid therapy until they are necessary either due to medical progression and or symptom

3110
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:09,740
control, you have a chance.

3111
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:13,900
And so of course the question then is you've got to find advocates on the other side of

3112
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:18,420
this ledger, meaning ... But the ledger meaning in terms of the thinking about this disease.

3113
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:19,420
Yeah.

3114
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:20,420
Well, I agree with you.

3115
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:23,420
And so what would you suggest?

3116
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:25,020
What's the roundabout approach?

3117
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:26,020
You're in the field.

3118
02:38:26,020 --> 02:38:27,020
I mean, you're ...

3119
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:28,020
No, no.

3120
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:32,860
A great discussion over that scotch that you promised me before we started this podcast.

3121
02:38:32,860 --> 02:38:33,860
It's easy.

3122
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:34,860
No, no, no.

3123
02:38:34,860 --> 02:38:36,860
We're trying to do this, right?

3124
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:37,860
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

3125
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:38,860
I mean ...

3126
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:43,540
And we need guys like yourself and others to get the word out that there are alternatives

3127
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:45,660
and that who's going to be the bold one.

3128
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:49,260
And I know I'm speaking to now people who want to set up these special clinics, special

3129
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:53,220
kind of treatment clinics where we can bring everything under the same roof so you don't

3130
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:54,940
have to run over this place and that place.

3131
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:56,340
We take the patience.

3132
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:57,340
This will happen.

3133
02:38:57,340 --> 02:38:59,380
It will happen because people want to live.

3134
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:04,180
Yeah, look, I mean, that was going to be my ... If forced to give one idea now, because

3135
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:07,580
I don't think I know the answer, but if I were going to give you one suggestion, it

3136
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:11,740
would be do this from a position of pull, not push.

3137
02:39:11,740 --> 02:39:14,780
So right now you are pushing this idea.

3138
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:18,960
What you really want to do is take a page out of the Charlie Foundation where they're

3139
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:25,060
basically saying, look, in the end, the results were so dramatic that the parents of the children,

3140
02:39:25,060 --> 02:39:30,400
a third of whom now no longer suffer from epilepsy, another third of whom have at least

3141
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:34,760
a 50% reduction in epilepsy, they basically become the voice of reason.

3142
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:37,680
And I think that's a part of the reason today, not the only reason.

3143
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:42,360
I think the data are so good, but I think they're a part of the reason why today the

3144
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:48,160
only place in sort of the traditional medical view where a ketogenic diet is viewed as a

3145
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:54,320
legitimate first line therapy for recalcitrant disease is in epilepsy.

3146
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:57,480
Now, I think there will be a day when that expands.

3147
02:39:57,480 --> 02:40:04,320
So what I would hope is that there's a network of people, family members probably, who have

3148
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:10,040
lost people to GBM, who would become the ones that would be your mouthpiece, right?

3149
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:12,280
Would become the ones that would say, you know what?

3150
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:18,520
I'm tired of the fact that my loved one died in nine months, seemingly in vain.

3151
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:23,760
And there's this body of evidence, which look, admittedly at this point is small and is uncertain,

3152
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:27,400
but nothing in science is certain, but they're offering an alternative.

3153
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:29,720
I want to know that that could be tested.

3154
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:30,720
Yeah.

3155
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:34,440
And the thing that kills me on these private foundations and things, their advisory boards

3156
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:38,140
are made up of physicians that subscribe to the gene theory of cancer.

3157
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,800
So when the patients and their advocates hear about this-

3158
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:41,800
Here's my second piece of advice.

3159
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:43,560
I know I said I wasn't going to give you any advice.

3160
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:46,360
My second piece of advice is you're fighting an uphill battle.

3161
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:48,040
You don't need to.

3162
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:50,840
It could be a genetic disease and a metabolic disease simultaneously.

3163
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:55,040
I would argue that cancer is, when you think about the three diseases, the three disease

3164
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:59,400
processes that are going to kill all of us sitting here right now in this room, it's

3165
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:04,720
going to be atherosclerotic disease, neurodegenerative disease, or cancer.

3166
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:07,100
Statistically speaking, that's how we're going to die.

3167
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:11,820
Of those three, I don't think there's any that are more evolved and complicated than

3168
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:12,820
cancer.

3169
02:41:12,820 --> 02:41:15,260
I think cancer is by far the hardest of those.

3170
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:16,260
And therefore-

3171
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:17,460
Well, now, there's where I would disagree strongly.

3172
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:19,180
Well, but that's too long a discussion.

3173
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:23,420
The point is, whether you agree with me or not, let's argue the following, or let me

3174
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:26,820
state the following and or posit the following.

3175
02:41:26,820 --> 02:41:32,420
It's a very evolved condition, and therefore you could have genetic pressures, metabolic

3176
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:36,440
pressures, immune pressures that all predispose to it.

3177
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:38,480
So I don't think it has to be an either or.

3178
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:43,120
I think metabolic therapies could be valuable whether or not the genetic ideas of cancer

3179
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,120
are right or wrong.

3180
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:47,440
So to me, it strikes me as an unnecessary fight.

3181
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:52,440
Instead, the answer should be, look, we should have medical oncologists, radiation oncologists,

3182
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:56,080
surgical oncologists, immuno-oncologists, and metabolic oncologists.

3183
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:57,080
Period.

3184
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:00,920
Now, you might argue those radiation oncologists are causing more harm than good.

3185
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:02,180
That's beyond my pay grade.

3186
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:03,560
You might be right.

3187
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:08,520
But you're basically arguing for a fifth branch of oncology, which is the medical oncologist,

3188
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:10,720
above the three that we conventionally have.

3189
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:14,800
I think the immuno-oncologist is coming into his or her own right now.

3190
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:18,240
I don't think it's worth arguing about whether it's a genetic disease or metabolic disease.

3191
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:23,200
It's just a goddamn hard disease, and we need every therapy imaginable, and sometimes that

3192
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:26,440
will be doing things that are completely new as you've proposed.

3193
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:33,120
So anyway, on that note, I want to thank you very much for your generosity of time and just

3194
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:38,080
your passion for this and how tirelessly you've worked on this.

3195
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:41,060
This is only our first time meeting today, Tom, but I've been familiar with your work

3196
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:45,480
for probably eight years now, which is a small fraction of the amount of time you've put

3197
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:46,480
into this.

3198
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:50,880
Dom is a very close friend, and so through Dom and through Bob, I've learned a lot more

3199
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:52,600
about your work.

3200
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:56,820
I know that a lot of people listening to this are going to be rooting for you to do this.

3201
02:42:56,820 --> 02:43:02,020
Is there anything that someone who's listening to this, who's got a loved one, who's either

3202
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:09,580
died of GBM or has GBM, that they can do to increase the chances that either others

3203
02:43:09,580 --> 02:43:14,740
can get the types of therapies you're talking about in clinical trials or that their loved

3204
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:15,820
ones themselves can?

3205
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:16,820
What else can they do?

3206
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:21,820
Well, I mean, in my position as a researcher who does the preclinical studies, I mean,

3207
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:27,500
we get support from Travis from Foundation, the Metabolic Therapy Foundation, and that's

3208
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:32,740
what keeps our program going, and that's what tells us what we think should work really

3209
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:38,120
well or what might not work to help these people get the outcome that they want, which

3210
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:42,980
is high quality of life and living a lot longer.

3211
02:43:42,980 --> 02:43:48,380
My big thing is that, is we can identify those, and where do you do that?

3212
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:49,780
You need funds for that.

3213
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:52,980
The federal government is mostly like what gene is involved.

3214
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:55,060
So this is where it comes back to the same problem again.

3215
02:43:55,060 --> 02:44:00,020
You don't get funding for things that actually can really work versus studying the disease.

3216
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:02,300
Let's look at the meta ... Let's study the disease more.

3217
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:03,300
We don't need that.

3218
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:04,300
We know we have a path.

3219
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:05,300
We have a clear-

3220
02:44:05,300 --> 02:44:09,260
So is there an easy path for patients who want to make financial contributions to the

3221
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:10,260
lab?

3222
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:11,260
Is it through a foundation that is the easiest way?

3223
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:12,260
Yeah, well, there's two ways to do it.

3224
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:16,440
You could either do it through the foundation because we have a continual grant set up through

3225
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:18,140
single cost, single cure foundation.

3226
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:19,140
Okay.

3227
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:21,140
So we'll link to that to make sure that people know what that is.

3228
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:25,940
And also at Boston College, if you want to fund the work directly through the university,

3229
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:28,580
it has to be through a very specific statement.

3230
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:29,580
Okay.

3231
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:30,580
Otherwise, the university will-

3232
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:31,580
Absorb it.

3233
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:33,300
Absorb some of the other funds.

3234
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:38,580
So basically, that's the way ... Now, what we do then is our data are immediately given

3235
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:43,900
to the clinical people who then put it on their patients and then feed me back and say,

3236
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:47,220
this is working well, or we don't think this is doing as well as we should.

3237
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:49,000
Why don't you tweak it in this direction?

3238
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,560
So I work with the physicians directly and I give them the preclinical information.

3239
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:56,000
They feed me back and see how it's working.

3240
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,260
Sometimes it works a hell of a lot better in the human than the mouse.

3241
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:03,320
So let's be sure that we have from you any and all means that people who are passionate

3242
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:09,040
about this, interested in this, either personally or through indirect experience can support

3243
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:10,080
this work.

3244
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:13,960
And more importantly, I think, create maybe a bit of a groundswell that puts a little

3245
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:20,680
bit of pressure on the IRBs to say, look, this is ... GBM is as high stakes as it gets.

3246
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:23,880
It's the type of cancer that gives cancer a bad name.

3247
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:29,400
And maybe this is one area where we have to increase our appetite for risk in clinical

3248
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:30,400
trials.

3249
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:31,400
I agree with that.

3250
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:35,240
And I think that this is a disease that we think we can make major advances in and why

3251
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:37,280
not give it a shot?

3252
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:38,680
Because it's not going to hurt anybody.

3253
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:40,760
It's not going to accelerate their demise.

3254
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:41,760
It's only going to-

3255
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:45,120
I would disagree with that only in terms of a talking point to say it could.

3256
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,120
We don't know.

3257
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:48,440
But that's the point of risk, right?

3258
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:56,680
When the outcome is so asymmetrically bad, which is uniform death in an accelerated fashion,

3259
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:00,320
we have to be willing to take the risk of potentially doing worse than that.

3260
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:01,320
I don't think that's the case.

3261
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:02,320
I've never seen it.

3262
02:46:02,320 --> 02:46:03,320
I've never seen it.

3263
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:04,320
Understood.

3264
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:08,520
But I think the way we talk about this, when we talk about this as though there's no risk,

3265
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:14,080
I think that reduces our credibility with people who say, well, how can you say that?

3266
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:16,480
Any open cranial surgery produces risk.

3267
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:17,640
Yeah, that's the point.

3268
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:20,640
And that's going to be a part of all what we're doing.

3269
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:25,200
Well, the point is, Bob's heard me rail on this many a time.

3270
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:29,400
This is sort of idiotic idea of a Hippocratic oath, which is technically he didn't even

3271
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:31,200
say it and it's such a dumb thing anyway.

3272
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,200
First do no harm.

3273
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:36,280
I mean, you couldn't do any good if you weren't at least willing to do some harm.

3274
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:38,480
No one goes into it wanting to do harm.

3275
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:43,560
But anyway, this has been really exciting and I really appreciate your time and your

3276
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,320
insights and above all else the work you've done.

3277
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:46,320
So thank you, Tom.

3278
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:47,320
Thank you.
