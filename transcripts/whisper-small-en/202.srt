00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,380
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,120
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,840
today's episode. Welcome to a special episode of The Drive as we celebrate our recent 200th episode.

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
To celebrate this milestone, we want to do something a little bit different, which is

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,640
something we did after our first 100 episodes. That was a special episode called Strong Convictions

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Loosely Held. The idea of this is to basically go back and look over topics that were covered

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,120
in the last 100 episodes, which is about two years, and talk about things where I've changed

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,920
my mind or taken a stronger viewpoint. In this interview, I'm once again joined by Nick Stenson.

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Due to the timing of this episode, it's going to be audio only. We are trying to get this out on a

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,960
very quick turnaround, so this is being recorded very shortly before it's going to be released.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,560
In this episode, we talk about a number of topics. We talk about changes in my viewpoints around

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,760
things that deal with cancer, both in terms of screening and therapeutics. We talk about my

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,800
evolved thinking on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and around Alzheimer's disease genetics.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,520
The topic of nutrition, we get into some changes in my views around fasting and protein consumption.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,600
Talk a little bit about psychedelics under the molecules heading in exercise. We talk a lot

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,520
about strength training, cardio training, and I touch a little bit on my recent surgery and the

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,160
implications of that, although we're going to have a dedicated podcast on all things pertaining to that.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Talk about sleep and a supplement that I used to be very bullish on that has basically vanished,

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
and then talk about a drug that I'm very excited about right now.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,840
Let's see, what else do we talk about? I think we then turn it over to a special discussion on all

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
things Formula One. We do get a lot of questions about Formula One, and I think that there's

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,440
probably a relatively small but enthusiastic cohort of you who have a lot of questions about F1.

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,880
We end on that deliberately so that those of you who are not interested in F1 can tune out,

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,840
but I think it's actually a pretty cool discussion, and I think even people who are just

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,040
casually becoming interested in F1 will find this interesting. Hopefully that's more than six of you.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Anyway, without further delay, please enjoy this episode celebrating 200 episodes

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,160
of The Drive and specifically looking back at the last 100.

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:20,080
All right, Peter, welcome to a special episode here. This is one you and Bob did way back for

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,400
episode 103, which is kind of this concept around strong convictions loosely held, which I'll have

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,680
you explain in a second. We did this after the first 100 episodes of the podcast, and now we

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,320
just crossed episode 200. If we were a little better at planning, this would be episode 200,

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,680
but episode 200- Maybe 201, technically, right?

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,200
Maybe 201, but this kind of snuck up on us, so I think it's going to be

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,360
episode 202, so we're only off by one. This will be a little bit of a different episode in the

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,000
sense where it will kind of have an AMA feel to it where I'll be asking you some questions,

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,080
but it'll be much more laid back. The prep that usually goes into a podcast didn't really

43
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,640
go into this one because it's more so just asking you questions around looking back at the last

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,480
100 episodes, episode 100 to 200. Where has your opinion changed? Where has it maybe gotten

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,880
stronger? How has it evolved? Which I think is really important for people to understand because

46
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,240
I think sometimes they can listen to podcasts or hear people talk about things and just assume

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
they can never change their mind or assume it doesn't evolve. That's why I really like doing

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,320
these. I think this will be a good one for people, and then also for the small percentage of people

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,680
who are interested, we do get a lot of F1 questions, and at the end of this episode,

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,560
we'll dedicate a little bit of that for all those people who really want to dive into that.

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm cool with just doing this as a full F1 episode. I guess for people, we're recording

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,240
this on March 23rd, so we are now one race into the season, and I have a lot of things I'm excited

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
about, but I guess we'll refrain from that and we'll just make it a little F1 at the end.

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Yeah, a little bonus guy on there, so that will be good, but why don't we just start off by just

55
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,400
explaining this concept of strong convictions loosely held, where it came from, your thoughts

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,160
on it, and why you think it's so important, especially in the science space, the health space,

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,280
things of that nature. It's a phrase that I'm sure many people have heard before, and I certainly

58
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
wouldn't even know where to attribute it to originally, but I can tell you where I attribute

59
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,680
it to. I attribute it to a friend of mine named John Griffin, who used to run a very successful

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,520
hedge fund. I just remember John, one day we were sitting around talking about his investment

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,480
philosophy, and I just remember that expression coming up over and over again, which was,

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,520
you have to invest based on strong convictions, but they need to be loosely held, and so you have

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,720
to constantly update your assumptions with new information. I thought, wow, that's ... I mean,

64
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,920
I can see why that makes sense if you're going to be a good investor, because if you invest in

65
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,200
something based on a thesis, but you can't readjust your thesis position based on new

66
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,600
information, in other words, if you're more interested in staying with a position as opposed

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,040
to evolving your position, you're probably not going to be a very good investor. I realize that's

68
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,080
kind of the same in science, medicine, and unfortunately, I think it's probably our default

69
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,480
setting to dig our heels in on a position. Ironically, I think it's viewed as a sign of

70
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,040
weakness or being wishy-washy when you change your mind. Certainly in politics,

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,600
that's something that you get hammered for. There's no surer way to get hammered in a

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
political debate, it seems, than to have your opponent point out where you have changed your

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,560
positions. Someone who says, look, I used to be pro-choice, now I'm pro-life, or I used to be pro-life,

74
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,240
and now I'm pro-choice, or I used to oppose same-sex marriage, and now I'm in favor of it.

75
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,600
It seems like you're hosed in that position as opposed to being able to explain why you've

76
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,360
changed. I understand the skepticism around politics, it could also be that people in politics

77
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
are just changing their minds because they're following the political flavor of the day.

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
But nevertheless, I think for what we do, it's important. Truthfully, last point I'll say on

79
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,040
this, this is a big reason as for why I'm not that excited about my book. I think people listening

80
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,280
to this probably understand I'm in the final stages of trying to finish a book. This is a

81
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,400
book that started in 2016. It's a book that's been basically rewritten fully once, and it sort

82
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,320
of occurred to me a couple of months ago that this is not a great idea. Now don't worry, I'm still

83
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,040
going to do it, but it's not a great idea for the following reason. Let's say I take my hands off

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,440
the final manuscript in June of this year, and this thing gets published in February or March

85
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,520
of next year. I can promise you that there are things that I'm going to have changed my mind on

86
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
that will be in print just within that nine month period, let alone in the years that follow. This

87
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,320
is a form of communication where you're kind of locked into a point of view. You don't get to

88
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,280
really update print. There are other reasons, right? A podcast will typically reach more people

89
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
than a book. We have more weekly podcast listeners than we probably have people who are going to buy

90
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,920
a book. So it seems to me there's very little upside for me in writing a book other than maybe

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,440
it's a good excuse to just put everything in one place that's easier to digest. But nevertheless,

92
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,760
what I love about a podcast is doing exactly what we're doing now, which is being able to

93
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,120
consolidate all the changes in how I think about stuff.

94
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,760
I wasn't going to bring up the book, but now that you did, I might as well ask a few questions on

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,960
it that I'm sure people will be curious about. When you talked about it previously, the draft

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,080
was insanely long. This new manuscript, is it looking just as long? Is it going to be pretty

97
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
hefty size or you think it's going to get cut down?

98
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,840
No, it's going to be cut down and we're already doing an amazing job of that. So we have a great

99
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,960
editor at Penguin Random House. And when we first connected the manuscript, it was close to 200,000

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,240
words. She thought, well, this really ought to be 80,000 words. I said, well, it's probably not

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,160
going to be that little, but I think we're both hoping that we can converge this thing to about

102
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,120
120,000 words. That's still a pretty thick book, but I think that's manageable. And I think as Bill

103
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
Gifford, who's my co-author and I go through this, and we've been working really hard at this,

104
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,520
we're just relentlessly pushing each other. How can this be said in fewer words? Is this point,

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,280
while interesting, necessarily relevant to the broader point we're making? If yes, keep it and

106
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,840
streamline it. If no, cut it. So you've probably heard me use the expression before, kill your

107
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,360
babies. This is the perfect example of killing your babies. For the folks listening who might

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,560
not know what that is, that was also great advice to me given when I was in medical school writing

109
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,160
my first scientific paper, I'd put so much work into it and I had all of these figures and all of

110
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
these tables. One of the guys I was working with in the lab said, look, you got to learn to kill

111
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,040
your babies. You're going to do 20 experiments that are not going to make their way into the

112
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,720
paper and that's going to feel awkward. It's going to feel like, no, no, I need to show you as the

113
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,960
reader of this paper, everything I've done in every experiment, in every iteration. And similarly,

114
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,520
with a book, there's a part of me that was like, I almost want the reader to be able to see how much

115
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,600
work has gone into this. But of course, that doesn't make for a good book. Nobody needs to

116
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,280
sit through a quarter of a million words, which is what this would easily be. So there's lots of

117
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,000
baby killing going on right now. I hope that that will make it better. And the only real big stress

118
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,600
hanging over my head right now is to do the audio book or not. I would strongly prefer not to do it.

119
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,560
So I'm sort of in the process of exploring who could be a good reader for the book so I could

120
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,800
weasel out of having to do it. Yeah. Just because we're this whole podcast is on looking back at

121
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
episodes, I think of the episode with Sebastian Younger. And there was some talk on there where

122
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,640
he really talked about how he refined his writing style and the amount of work he would go into

123
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,360
to only say words that really mattered. It was really impressive. So I imagine that process,

124
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,440
especially when you're talking about such complex things is hard. And so I think I, like many people,

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,800
will be excited to read that when it comes out and just keep on keeping on and get that thing done.

126
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah. I have mixed feelings about it. I'm still probably in this state of

127
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,960
not liking it very much. It seems very boring to me. As I read it, I think, God,

128
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,520
there's nothing new here. There's nothing exciting here. But I think every author goes through that

129
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,800
when they've read the same thing 12 times. I just have to remind myself sometimes that

130
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,520
for other people reading it, it will offer something novel.

131
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,720
Yeah, for sure. And for people listening, if you have strong opinions on

132
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,520
if an audio book should be read by Peter, I know you put that poll on Twitter, which was really

133
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,040
interesting, but feel free to send us a message. Let us know how important you think that is.

134
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,680
And just so people understand, the reason I don't want to read it is there's really twofold. One,

135
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,160
a book of this duration will take two weeks to read. For me to take two weeks off, work is a

136
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,480
really big deal, especially to do something I don't enjoy. Let's be clear. I mean, I wouldn't

137
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,080
enjoy this one bit. The second reason is I'm actually not a very good reader. So I think a

138
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
lot of people have this assumption because I do a podcast and I don't mind public speaking,

139
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm a good speaker and I probably am. I'm actually a horrible reader. And I know this because

140
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I read children's books to my kids every night. And you'd think I'm an illiterate moron. Even my

141
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,080
kids catch the mistakes when I'm reading it. They're like, daddy, you missed that whole word

142
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,400
or that sentence or whatever. So I'm not a good reader, at least not an out loud reader. So this

143
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,920
will be an especially difficult challenge. I think there's a very good chance I won't add

144
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,760
much value to the reading of the book, even though I have a quote unquote familiar voice.

145
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Yeah. And you can be honest and say you didn't accidentally miss those words. You were just

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,760
trying to speed up bedtime and book reading as any parent has done. You just kind of skip a page

147
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
when they're not looking. And sometimes that book's a lot shorter than others.

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,080
That's when we discovered that Reese was rain man was when he was about three and a half years old.

149
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,360
And he had a book on the water cycle. This was the longest book ever. This was not a three-year-old

150
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,200
kids book. This was like a 13-year-old kid book because it took 10 to 12 minutes to read this

151
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,840
book, which anyone reading books to kids knows. That's a long book. And I basically would start

152
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,160
skipping paragraphs. This was only after I'd read the book four times to him in the span of,

153
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,520
I don't know, two weeks. And he would recite the paragraphs I'd missed. And that's when we knew

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,280
there was something about that kid that was not typical, to put it mildly. I actually have a video

155
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,440
where I record him reading the entire book without reading it. And he gets it almost verbatim.

156
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,640
Well, I mean, maybe he's your guest reader for the audio book. We just throw a Reese in the booth

157
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,720
and just let him go for a few weeks. He has to memorize it. Someone's going to have to read it

158
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,240
to him four times. Bob Kaplan. We'll just send Bob out there. Just let those two go at it.

159
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,040
All right. Have we wasted enough time on this? Is anybody still listening?

160
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,360
We'll make sure in the show notes, we tell people that they can skip the first

161
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,840
15 minutes of this podcast. So what we're going to do is we're just going to cover a few different

162
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,880
themes and larger themes, and then just talk about where your thoughts have maybe changed.

163
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,680
So the first theme is around diseases. So this can be anything from cardiovascular disease, cancer,

164
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Alzheimer's, dementia, things of that nature. Anything that you think is really interesting

165
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,640
there or things that you maybe change your mind on, or it's gotten sharper, kind of anything you

166
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:52,240
want to say there? Yeah, I'd say there were three things where my thinking today is either more

167
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,240
clear or just frankly more aggressive, different than it was before. So one is around cancer and

168
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,000
there are two issues specifically. One is around ASCBD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280
and one is around Alzheimer's disease. So I'll just take him in that order.

170
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,360
So in cancer, there are two issues. The first is around the promise of immunotherapy. And this

171
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,920
really came out of the research that I did to prepare for one of my favorite podcasts over the

172
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,640
past couple of years, which is the podcast with Steve Rosenberg. Folks haven't listened to that.

173
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,480
I can't recommend that highly enough. And that was something that was very personally exciting

174
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,480
for me. Steve was probably the most important mentor I've ever had professionally. And he's

175
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,880
just not only one of the most remarkable scientists, but also one of the most remarkable human beings.

176
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,360
Even though I know the field of immunotherapy quite well, because it's not something I'm in

177
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,480
day in and day out, I did a lot of work to prepare for that podcast. And we had a great discussion.

178
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,120
And I think one of the things that came out of that, that really blew my mind, was the fact that

179
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,440
80% of patients have neoantigens on their cancers that are recognized by their immune system.

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,320
I just want to explain why that's so significant for folks who might not appreciate it.

181
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,920
The holy grail of cancer therapy is undoubtedly immunotherapy. In other words,

182
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,120
anytime you can get the immune system to recognize your cancer as non-self, you're winning the game.

183
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,840
Because you get to use a cellular systemic system that could eradicate a tumor without the toxicity

184
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,320
and failures basically associated with systemic therapies like chemotherapy. Now historically

185
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,360
speaking, very, very few people, meaning it's reportable in the literature, it's so rare,

186
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,360
have a cancer where the immune system can automatically recognize it at sufficient force

187
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
to eradicate it. There are a couple of such patients like that, that Steve Rosenberg saw

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,280
during his training, that basically formed the impetus for his life's work. Now there's another

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,960
subset of patients typically with cancers like melanoma and renal cell cancer, which have a high

190
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,800
mutagenic burden, where they might not have enough immune cells to recognize and kill the cancer

191
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,720
completely without any prompting. But if you prompt them with a cytokine like interleukin 2

192
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,720
at a very high dose, that is sufficient for their T cells to go and eradicate the cancer.

193
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,320
To put that number in context, we're talking about 10 to 20% of people with metastatic melanoma

194
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,040
or renal cell cancer will respond to that. Again, these are patients who would otherwise be dead in

195
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,480
six months and they would now go on to have durable remissions. The next step would be using

196
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,280
something called a checkpoint inhibitor. So these are drugs that block the checkpoints on immune

197
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,120
cells. These are basically the breaks on the immune system and by dropping these checkpoint

198
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,160
inhibitors on patients, so things that block either CTLA-4 or PD-1 being the two most well-studied

199
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,760
of these, we have the same effect. This is an even broader subset of patients, but again,

200
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,800
it's still quite narrow in the grand scheme of things. Again, it tends to only work in patients

201
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,120
that either have specific mutations or patients that again have a very high mutagenic burden,

202
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,280
so people with mismatch repairs and things like that. But when you look at the fact that 80%

203
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,600
of patients and everything I just talked about, the spontaneous remissions, the IL-2, the checkpoint

204
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,640
inhibitors might account for 10% of that 80. What about those other call it 70% of people? Well,

205
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,560
I think what this finding gives us hope for is that we may in fact be able to use some combination

206
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,680
of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TIL, or adaptive cell therapy where you genetically

207
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,320
engineer T cells with that recognition. The reason that those patients aren't having

208
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,720
spontaneous remissions or aren't responding to interleukin-2 or even checkpoint inhibitors

209
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,680
is because they probably don't have enough of those T cells yet. This now becomes just as much

210
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,600
a bioengineering problem as it is an immunology problem. You have to be able to recognize those

211
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,920
cells. Well, it turns out that's pretty easy to do. Now you have to be able to expand them in a

212
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,320
manner where they still have the longevity necessary to go in and be infused into patients

213
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,600
and basically arrest and eradicate their tumors. All of this is a long way of saying,

214
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,520
I really think that in 10 years we're going to basically be using designer-based immunotherapies

215
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,840
to eradicate most solid organ metastatic cancers. That's a bold ass statement. Let's call us beta

216
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,200
spade. The reason I think this is so doable is historically it's the impediment to this

217
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
and then where people I think would say today there's an impediment to this is cost.

218
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,120
If every single person has to have their own TIL or adaptive cell therapy regimen created,

219
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,200
well, I mean that's obviously very costly. That could be a couple hundred thousand dollars to

220
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,840
generate. But the reality of it is when you look at the cost of cancer therapeutics today

221
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,720
and the failure rate, I actually think the cost of doing this is less, especially when you do it

222
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,800
on a quality basis, so a quality adjusted life year basis. Because today it's not uncommon to spend

223
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,080
$80,000 on a treatment that extends life by four months. Well, would you rather spend $80,000 on

224
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,880
something that's going to extend life four months or $300,000 on something that's going to extend

225
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,480
life indefinitely with respect to cancer? So to me, it's just going to require a fundamental

226
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,440
shift in how we do the actuarial science around durable remission therapies. So that's on the

227
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,160
cancer front, something I'm very excited about. Let me follow up with a few questions there,

228
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,000
because I think you'd kind of make some big statements and I think there was a few

229
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
terminology that it would be helpful to let people know what they are. So one is you mentioned solid

230
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,760
organ cancers, so maybe just run through what those are. The other is you mentioned metastatic

231
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
cancer. So maybe just define what that is, because I think that will be helpful. The other thing I

232
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,080
was going to say is for those wondering, the episode with Steve Rosenberg is number 177.

233
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,000
And it's also an amazing episode of someone who just never gave up and just was so hyper focused.

234
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
If anyone hasn't listened to it, it's very technical. But the stories he tells him,

235
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,840
the stuff he was able to do is very, very impressive. Yeah. So let me go back and answer

236
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,680
those two points. So what does metastatic mean? Metastatic means the ability of the cancer cells

237
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,240
to spread beyond their primary site of origin. And that's one of the two hallmarks of a cancer

238
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
cell. So one of the two things that defines a cancer cell and differentiates it from a normal

239
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,880
cell. So if you have somebody with colon cancer, what is it about the colon cancer cells that is

240
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,320
different from the regular colon cells? One of them is this ability to leave the colon and go

241
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,400
someplace else. So colon cancer cells could now grow in the liver, whereas regular colon cells,

242
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,880
if you put them in the liver, wouldn't grow. The second thing is basically the inability to respond

243
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,760
to cell cycle signaling. A regular cell from the colon will respond to signals that tell it to stop

244
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,520
growing. That's how it knows to stop. So if you have an injury to the colon, it will respond

245
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,360
appropriately and grow to heal, but then it will stop growing once it's told, hey, we're done. We

246
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,800
don't need you to grow anymore. That's fine. Colon cancer cells won't do that. Those are the two

247
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,000
hallmarks. It's not responding to growth signal stopping and being able to spread. To your first

248
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,080
question, what does a solid organ tumor mean? Yeah. So it's basically anything that is not a

249
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,360
leukemia and lymphoma effectively. So leukemias and lymphomas probably account for about 20%

250
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,840
of cancers and then the solid organs about 80%. That's really cancer deaths, I should say, not

251
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,000
just cancers. So almost every time we hear about somebody dying of cancer, we're usually hearing

252
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,640
people, someone dies of colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer. Those

253
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,120
are what we call epithelial tumors to be more technically correct. And you mentioned the

254
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:33,680
timeline 10 years. Is that timeline where this becomes a possibility or is that the timeline

255
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,720
where it becomes widely available to the mass public? Are those the same or would they be a

256
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,280
little different? No, they'd be different. I think 10 years might be aggressive for this to be the

257
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,040
standard of care, but I think 10 years would be the time when it's going to be out of clinical

258
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,040
trials and something that's going to be available at least to some. My guess is unfortunately,

259
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,440
in 10 years, and again, I'm just making this up, it might not be something that is covered by

260
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,920
insurance, which would then immediately limit to a fraction of the population that people that could

261
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:10,400
get this. But it's going to have to get some traction beyond clinical trials and there might

262
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,080
be a period of time before this is covered. Again, I could be wrong. It could go straight from very

263
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,080
successful clinical trials directly to something that Medicare reimburses for, but that's what has

264
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,840
to happen. Unless Medicare and Medicaid reimbursed for this type of treatment, it could never be

265
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,360
widespread regardless of how successful it is. Got it. All right. Continue on with the second

266
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,680
piece under cancer. Yeah. So the second thing on cancer is just my complete aggression when it

267
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:47,280
comes to screening for gastrointestinal cancers. Let's just put big, big things in perspective.

268
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:55,760
How many cancer deaths do we have each year? So I think for 2020, we're looking at probably 600,000

269
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:04,000
people in the US died of cancer. And how many of those were in the digestive system? 170,000

270
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,800
of the 600,000. So the GI system is a really big issue, right? And that's basically everything

271
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,200
from mouth to anus. Now, some of those things are very difficult to screen for. So pancreatic

272
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,560
cancer, we don't really have a great way to screen for it. And that's why we use things like

273
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,920
diffusion weighted image, MRIs, liquid biopsies as ways to basically pursue those things.

274
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,840
Now we have a podcast that's coming up on liquid biopsies and all things around that. So that's

275
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,480
going to be a very interesting podcast. We had a previous podcast that was probably in the first

276
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,000
100 with Raj Atarwala, where we talked about diffusion weighted imaging MRI for cancer

277
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,400
screening. So if we put those things aside, the good news is that there are a lot of cancers

278
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,880
for which we can directly take a look at the epithelial surface that is going to become

279
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:07,200
cancerous. And there is no part of that that is more important than the colon. So the esophagus,

280
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:18,400
the stomach and the colon probably represent, I don't know, 40 percent of those GI cancers.

281
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,760
So again, liver and intrahepatic bile duct and pancreas are probably also about 40 percent. And

282
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,000
those are much harder to screen. But when you look at organ specific sites, colon cancer is

283
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,440
generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women. And what I'm about to say

284
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,080
is going to sound incredibly bold and controversial. It seems increasingly true to me, which is nobody

285
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,360
should ever die from colon cancer. And I would add the same for esophageal and stomach. And the

286
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:59,840
reason for that is, especially in colon, the progression from non-cancer to cancer is visible

287
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:07,760
to the naked eye through the transition of non-malignant polyp to malignant polyp. So if you did

288
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,920
this as a thought experiment, if you did a colonoscopy on somebody every single day of their life,

289
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,680
they would never get colon cancer because at some point you would see the polyp, you would remove it

290
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,480
while it is non-cancerous and they would not get cancer. So of course, how do you turn that thought

291
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,720
experiment into a real life idea? Well, you have to ask the question, what is the shortest

292
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,480
interval of time for which a person can have a completely normal colonoscopy until they can have

293
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,120
a cancer? There's no clear answer to this question. And we've done a lot of work on it. And I've

294
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,200
spoken with a lot of gastroenterologists about it. And there are certainly some case reports that it

295
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,880
can happen in as little as six to eight months. Of course, one has to question whether in fact,

296
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,160
people had perfectly normal colonoscopies six to eight months earlier. And it's possible that

297
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,960
they did not and that something was actually missed at the time. But I think most people would

298
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,000
agree that if you had a colonoscopy every one to two years, the likelihood that you could ever

299
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,240
develop a colon cancer, while maybe not zero, is so remote that you could effectively take colon

300
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,400
cancer off the list of the top 10 reasons why someone dies of cancer. And so it's for that

301
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,720
reason that I'm very aggressive when it comes to this type of screening, which also includes upper

302
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,400
endoscopy. So you basically get for free the esophagus and stomach when you look at the entire

303
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,800
colon rectum anus. And what are your costs? Well, your costs are obviously the dollar cost,

304
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,120
which is not cheap. I can't tell you what the average cost of a colonoscopy I think when I

305
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,160
get them done because I'm getting them done outside of regular screening. So I'm paying for

306
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,040
them. They're certainly not cheap. I want to say maybe I'm paying 2000 for a colonoscopy. So that's

307
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,560
a huge cost. And then there's obviously the risk of the sedation, which again is not zero. In the

308
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,360
hands of someone who's doing this every minute of every day, it's very small. And then of course,

309
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,440
there's the risk of perforation, which again is also incredibly small, especially in healthy

310
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
individual. And even if it does happen, it's generally something that's pretty easy to manage.

311
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,560
So again, is this something that I'm taking lightly? No, it's not. And I can't tell you yet

312
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,640
what the ideal frequency is because at some point, for example, a colonoscopy every day

313
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,400
would be a silly idea on all of those metrics, right? Your risk of complication is clearly going

314
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,320
to exceed your risk of cancer, notwithstanding the cost and daily challenges of bowel preps.

315
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,840
So where is that number? I don't know, but it's much more frequently than what's being done today.

316
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,720
That's what I would propose. It's not every five to 10 years. So it's probably every one to three

317
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,720
years would be my intuition. I think the other thing there, and to follow up Raj's episode is

318
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,800
episode 61. And another good resource on this is after Chadwick Boseman passed away, we did a weekly

319
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,680
email on it. And we'll link to it in the show notes. It's called colorectal cancer screening.

320
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,320
I think the other thing that was talked about in there, which you do a little different, is not

321
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,000
only the frequency, but the age in which you start your patients for their first colonoscopy.

322
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:28,320
I think the standard is 50 or 45 now, but either way, you prefer much earlier.

323
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,120
I think they are moving it down. I mean, in our practice, we think 40 is the age at which a person

324
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,160
should have their first colonoscopy if they have no history of colon cancer. About when I had my

325
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:46,880
first one was 40 or 41. I'm 49 right now, and I'm scheduled for a colonoscopy in a month. And that

326
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,560
will probably be my fourth one. And to be clear, this requires me arguing a little bit with my

327
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,880
primary care physician who's saying, Peter, you're being a bit ridiculous. But then I say, look, I

328
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,720
want you to go and read what I've written about this. Let's hop on a call and let's discuss this.

329
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
In the end, he's like, okay. And then you could argue, well, maybe I get my way because I'm a

330
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,520
doctor and I can be more persuasive in my arguments. But I think these are the discussions

331
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,280
patients need to be having with their doctors if they're in a position that they can afford to do

332
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,160
this outside of the regular screening. And if not, I think they should push to see whatever can be

333
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,040
done with inside the bounds of their insurance as well. I realize that we're all tainted by our

334
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,320
biases, but the images of the people that I have seen who have had colon cancer before the age of

335
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,480
50, I mean, those are seared into my brain. And that's why I think those are just such asymmetric

336
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,880
benefits. Yeah, definitely. Okay. So I think that was the two things on cancer. I think you had a

337
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,600
few other things in diseases that you mentioned early on. Yeah. So on ASCBD, I've also become

338
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:59,200
far more aggressive on the timing and magnitude of ApoB reduction. So take a step back and ask,

339
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:09,520
what are the leading causes or modifiable causes of ASCBD? The big three are pretty unambiguously

340
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,480
smoking, hypertension, and hyperbeta lipoproteinemia, which is just a really fancy word for saying

341
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:26,160
too many lipoproteins that have ApoB on them. So that's LDL, IDL, VLDL, LpA. By measuring ApoB,

342
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,120
why I'm such a fan of measuring ApoB as opposed to just measuring Lp, LDL, particle number or LDL

343
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,000
cholesterol number, is we have one single number that captures the total concentration of ApoB.

344
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,960
And while that's pretty well associated with non-HDL cholesterol, which is a far better surrogate

345
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,560
than LDL cholesterol, it's still better. And that's been demonstrated. And I think we even

346
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,720
covered that in a previous podcast where we went over the discordance between

347
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,840
non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB. So now the question becomes, well, when should you start ApoB

348
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,600
reduction and how much should you lower it? And I'll tell you, I used to take a point of view that

349
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,800
if a 40-year-old had an elevated ApoB, let's just put some numbers to this, right? So the 20th

350
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:22,400
percentile of ApoB is about 80 milligrams per deciliter. I used to say that, let's say somebody

351
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,000
was at the 50th percentile, they're 40 years old, their calcium score is zero, and they were

352
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,200
ambivalent about lipid lowering therapy. And let's assume that they're not insulin resistant,

353
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,160
and you've done all of the things that you can do reasonably with nutrition. I wouldn't push that

354
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,400
hard. I've now taken a very different stand, which is I've basically taken the stand with others

355
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:51,040
that I've taken with myself, which is the evidence is overwhelming that infantile levels of ApoB

356
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,920
are not deleterious in any way. Meaning an ApoB of 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter,

357
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,640
which is the level that children would have, poses not only no risk to children as evidenced

358
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,280
by the fact that, I mean, that doesn't require an explanation, but as evidenced by what we see in

359
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,600
the literature on adults with levels that have been pharmacologically reduced,

360
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,600
tells me that we need to be lower. And the amount of time it takes to see a benefit

361
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,880
tells me we don't want to wait until there's an issue. In other words, if the reason we begin

362
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,320
therapy is because somebody has a positive calcium score, which again, we covered this in great detail

363
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,880
in, does that AMA come out yet? I was just going to say that AMA will be released two weeks after

364
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,600
this. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So for people listening, we have a dedicated ASCVD AMA, which

365
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,920
goes into heavy detail for about 90 minutes on all this stuff where if this is of interest,

366
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,800
hang on for a few weeks and we'll be diving even deeper into it. Yeah. I get a bit lost with the

367
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,920
recording cycle, but that's a great AMA that goes super deep on basically all of the reasons why I

368
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,520
think my point of view now is treat early and treat aggressively. And I will now also make a

369
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,240
very bold statement. Again, let's start with the thought experiment, right? If the thought experiment

370
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,840
for colon cancer was do a colonoscopy every day on a person's life, starting at the age of 30,

371
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,120
would you eliminate colon cancer deaths? I think the answer is yes. And similarly, I would say

372
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,920
pharmacologically lower APO B to somewhere in the 20 to 30 milligram per deciliter range

373
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,400
for everybody in the population. While someone is in their twenties, can you eliminate ASCVD? And I

374
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,760
think the answer is probably yes. In other words, I think what you're basically going to do is

375
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,800
eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes. And that would need to be started in twenties?

376
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,080
I think so, yeah. Very early on. Yeah. So again, how do you take that thought experiment and turn

377
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,440
it into a practical implication? Because I don't think it's practical to take every 20 year old

378
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,880
and obliterate their APO B. Although it's clearly something we do in the subset of patients who have

379
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,520
significant genetic abnormalities, such as the cluster of genetic abnormalities that coalesce

380
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,400
around a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. We certainly do medicate those patients,

381
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,240
usually as teenagers. So this is not some completely crazy idea. But I think practically

382
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,200
what it means is basically by the time you're in your late thirties or early forties, if you have

383
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,640
any measure of APO B that's even north of the 20th percentile, that should be completely lowered. So

384
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,280
in some ways I would view an APO B ceiling of 60 as the limit. And that's probably at about the

385
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,480
fifth percentile. You'd sort of want everybody to be below the fifth percentile. Yeah. Just because

386
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,840
I think a lot of people listening, they might know their APO B number. And I'll also say if anyone

387
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,000
can't wait two weeks for that AMA episode 185 with Alan Snyderman was just an amazing episode and

388
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,760
talking about not only APO B, but just how you think about risk. Do you know the rough numbers of

389
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:20,800
20%, 50% and 80% APO B just for people who maybe have their APO B metrics down, but they don't know

390
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,400
where it relates in the percentage? Yeah. So fifth percentile from the Framingham offspring study was

391
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,560
62. I just in my mind keep 60. 10th percentile is about 70, 20th percentile is 78. So I just think

392
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,360
of 80, 50th percentile is about 100. It's technically 97, 80th percentile 118. So I just

393
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,000
kind of think of 120, 95th percentile is 140. Yeah. I mean, we're going to see patients of all

394
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,600
these levels. I've got a new patient whose first labs I'm reviewing very soon. I just got his labs

395
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:00,960
back the other day. His APO B is, I don't know, I want to say like 171 and the 95th percentile is 140.

396
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,640
So he's in the 99.9th percentile. He almost meets diagnostic criteria for FH based on his LDL

397
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,440
cholesterol, but you're going to see the whole spectrum here. But again, going back to this point,

398
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,240
I just don't see a reason to have an APO B ever north of 60 milligrams per deciliter. And I think

399
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,240
when you look at a lot of the Mendelian randomizations plus the clinical trial data, if you have an LDL

400
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:37,520
cholesterol below 30 or an APO B below 40 milligrams per deciliter for a very long period of time,

401
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,640
I think the odds that you're going to suffer ASCVD are incredibly low. Again, the earlier you start

402
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,200
in the lower you go, the more you can make that number approximate zero. And therefore it then

403
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,000
only becomes a question of what are your therapeutic choices to get there? How do you do this in a way

404
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,960
that minimizes the side effects of that? Because for some people to lower APO B that much is trivial.

405
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,120
Like in me, it's actually really easy. I take a PCSK9 inhibitor and I take a statin and I can

406
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,280
basically eradicate it. And I don't have any issues with either of those. But for some people,

407
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,280
statins are difficult to tolerate. About 5% of the population has intractable muscle soreness.

408
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,520
And that appears to be the case regardless of which statin you use. And we tend to

409
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,040
rotate through different statins. I like to start with the brazuva statin or pravastatin.

410
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,280
And then if we have difficulties there, move to pitavastatin or libolo. But if people can't

411
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,840
tolerate any of those things, today we have so many other options. If they're a hyper absorber,

412
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,560
we would use a zetimibe. If they're a hypersynthesizer, but can't respond to statins,

413
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,160
we use mepanoic acid. So we have lots of tools up our sleeve today more than ever before. And

414
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
that's why I just think we should be more and more aggressive on this now.

415
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Yeah, I mean, you could say it's even a more bold statement too, because listening to that

416
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,920
Alan Snyderman podcast and just how many doctors, especially in the US, don't even look at APOB.

417
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,840
So the importance for people listening to this too is when they go to their doctor and they're

418
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,960
going to run their labs, just making sure to bring up, is it possible to get an APOB ran? Because if

419
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,880
they just do what a typical cholesterol panel or a typical annual exam, it might not even be looked

420
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,520
at. Anything else on diseases that we want to cover before we go to our next subject?

421
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,760
One last little thing I'll just say, and this will probably come up in a dedicated podcast

422
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,680
down the line, because there's just been so much interesting stuff going on. But I think when it

423
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:38,320
comes to Alzheimer's disease, our focus now on genes outside of APOE is pretty significant.

424
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,640
I don't think Richard and I have ever spoken about this on a podcast, Richard Isaacson,

425
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,360
but it's probably something we need to revisit. We're working on a paper right now that we'll

426
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,560
get into some of this stuff, but it turns out that there are a lot of genes that seem to modify the

427
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,880
risk of APOE. So anybody listening to this who's been regularly listening to the podcast is

428
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,320
undoubtedly familiar with APOE, and it's three subtypes, type two, three, and four. And of course,

429
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,520
you get two of each, you get two genes, so you can have the six possible combinations there.

430
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,440
The fourth isoform of that is the high risk one. So if you're a two-four, it seems to

431
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,360
more or less be a wash, maybe slight increase in risk. The three-four seems to be associated with

432
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,080
about a two to three-fold risk in Alzheimer's disease, and the four-four, probably about an

433
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,920
eight to 12-fold, or maybe eight to 10-fold increase in risk. But we also know at the individual level

434
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,800
that even though everything I just said is true at the population level, it doesn't explain what

435
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,120
happens at the individual level, because there are some individuals who walk around with four-fours

436
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,560
who don't seem to get Alzheimer's disease. Or if they do, they get it very late in life,

437
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,920
and it's indistinguishable from the population variant. So they're not getting this variant where

438
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,760
they're being taken over by this disease at the age of 61 or something horrible like that. It turns

439
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,120
out that there are a bunch of other genes that we're now starting to understand modify the risk

440
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,280
of E4. Some things make it more significant, some things make it less. So there are certain

441
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:19,920
haplotypes of the Tom40 gene that amplify risk. There are certain mitochondrial haplotypes that

442
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,920
amplify risk. One of the most exciting genes is the Clotho modifier. I think it's KLVS is the

443
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,960
modified SNP of Clotho that actually seems to erase all of the downside of ApoE4. So

444
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:44,480
ApoE4 people who have this Clotho subtype have baseline risk. So one other thing that I'm now

445
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,640
becoming really interested in, unfortunately, the ways to measure these other genes, it's very

446
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,240
challenging. And we have to do it by brute force today. So we don't yet have a standardized way to

447
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,880
do this. So it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money to take a whole genome sequence and do

448
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,400
the search for all of these other subtypes. It takes months. A big step in the right direction

449
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,200
here is going to be getting more data and getting those data for less than $20,000 per person.

450
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,720
Yeah, that was going to be my follow up question is how does someone go about

451
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,200
getting those genes tested? Do you have a rough timeline in when that might be more widely

452
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,600
available or even less cost prohibitive? Is that years down the road? Is that 10 years longer?

453
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,320
It should be sooner. This is a solvable problem. I think this is just about throwing enough dollars

454
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,280
at it. And a lot of our patients have actually expressed an interest in this. And a few of them

455
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,880
are actually kind of working with Richard Isaacson on ways to potentially speed this up and streamline

456
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,240
how it's done. But unfortunately, at this moment in time, whenever we do this, it is a brute force

457
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,480
labor intensive exercise that again, we have the technical chops to be able to do if we can

458
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,600
streamline. All right. So moving to our next category, which long time listeners will know

459
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,880
is your absolute favorite thing to talk about. If we had a choice, you would talk about this

460
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,920
every week. And we have to usually talk you off the ledge of not doing another nutrition podcast.

461
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,000
So anything on nutrition that you specifically want to bring up or talk about?

462
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,160
Yeah, I think there were two things on the nutrition front that are worth

463
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,960
talking about where I've become more pointed in my feelings over the past

464
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,680
roughly two years, which I guess would be over the last hundred episodes.

465
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,880
So the first is my view that I think most of the benefit of time restricted feeding

466
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:51,680
is accrued through caloric restriction. So I've always been a little unsure of how much of the

467
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:58,160
time restriction was exerting its benefit through factors that go beyond what is likely

468
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,000
a reduced calorie intake in someone with a smaller feeding window. So in other words,

469
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,640
was there something magical about not eating? So if you had an experiment that was done where

470
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,160
people are going to eat 3000 calories a day spread out over the course of 12 hours versus

471
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,560
people that are going to eat 3000 calories spread out over six hours, is there any difference

472
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,160
between them? And I think the answer today is no. I think the answer is nope. When people talk

473
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,960
about how time restricted feeding is helping them lose weight and manage insulin resistance and

474
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,480
things like that, I think it appears that that's all due to reduced caloric intake. It's just

475
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,040
harder to eat more during a narrower window. And at some point that window gets narrow enough that

476
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,760
it's almost impossible to eat as much as you would in the course of a day, unless you're

477
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,520
deliberately being as gluttonous as possible. And I've seen people attempt to do that for

478
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:53,440
reasons I don't understand. And I think where this gets problematic is in people who can't

479
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:01,520
really afford to lose too much muscle. And not completely atypical TRF scenario I see is in a

480
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,680
patient who becomes completely obsessed with only eating in a six hour window or even less. And

481
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,440
at the end of a year, they've lost five pounds. So they were kind of normal-ish weight to begin with.

482
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,280
They were 180 pounds to begin with and they're 511s, pretty normal. And a year later they're

483
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,880
175 and they're like, this is just amazing. I've lost five pounds. I feel like I can eat whatever

484
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:34,080
I want. Then you do a DEXA scan on them and you realize, well, you lost 10 pounds of lean tissue

485
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,320
and you gained five pounds of fat mass. So yes, you're down five pounds, but your body fat is

486
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,160
actually up, I'm making this up because I'd have to do the math, but your body fat's up 3%. Your

487
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:55,440
visceral fat is up by 500 grams. Nothing has moved in the right direction except this very, very

488
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,960
crude measurement of the number on the scale. In these individuals, I think because they're eating

489
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,400
so much less protein, they're impairing muscle protein synthesis. So they're actually losing

490
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,320
lean mass even while putting on fat mass. They're oftentimes becoming insulin resistant. I especially

491
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:19,120
see this in people who are doing one meal a day, the so-called OMAD, especially because most people

492
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:26,000
who are doing that are doing it late in the day. And so now they're having impaired glucose

493
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,160
homeostasis overnight. We're seeing high glucose levels overnight, probably high cortisol levels

494
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,120
and impaired glucose tolerance in the morning. So a lot of these things just aren't what we would

495
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:44,800
want to see. Now there are some people for whom that still works well. So I've also seen people

496
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:54,480
who lose a hundred pounds and 70 of it is fat and 30 of it is lean and their net better off

497
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,880
because they were starting at a body weight of 300 pounds and they certainly had the amount of

498
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,920
lean mass to improve. So their body fat maybe goes from 50% to 35%. I'm kind of making those

499
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,800
numbers up. So they're moving in the right direction. The point here is I think you need

500
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,040
to ask yourself before you go on an aggressive TRF regimen, how much muscle mass can you afford

501
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,600
to lose? And if the answer is none, which is it should be the answer for most people, but

502
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,960
most of us don't have the freedom to lose any lean mass, then you got to make sure you're not

503
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,000
restricting protein and that you're thinking about when you can refuel in relation to exercise.

504
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:45,280
So Peter, when people listening are kind of trying to figure out, okay, how much muscle do

505
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,280
they have? Can they get a baseline? And then if they are doing various diets or time restricted

506
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,280
feeding, things of that nature, and they want to see what actually went up and down, what's the

507
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,320
best way for them to do it? Is it a DEXA scan? Is there another way outside of that where they can

508
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,440
test this? I think DEXA is the only way to do it truthfully. I mean, obviously it's not the single

509
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,200
most accurate way to do it. There are more accurate ways to do them, but those would all be

510
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,280
done in a research setting. DEXA is relatively inexpensive, a hundred dollars in most places.

511
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,120
Maybe if you're in a place like New York, it's more, but we're talking of something in the low

512
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,680
hundreds of dollars, not something that is thousands of dollars. And the information it yields

513
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,560
is also segmental, which is really valuable. So unlike the sort of buoyancy based tests,

514
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,440
which I think are quite inaccurate anyway, you don't get the segmental information. You don't

515
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,840
get the information of visceral adipose tissue. So when we do a DEXA scan, we're looking at lots

516
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:53,360
of information. We're looking at BMD, bone mineral density, total body fat, things like that. But

517
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,960
what I'm really interested in is what's your fat free mass index. So that's the total lean tissue

518
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:05,600
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. The ALMI, which is the appendicular lean mass

519
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,120
index, which is the same as the FFMI, except it's only using the lean mass of the four limbs,

520
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,800
not including the torso. We're looking at VAT and we're putting all of these things on a nomogram

521
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,320
to see where you rank for your age and sex. And that's where I think people need to be really

522
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,520
focused. And frankly, I care much more about those metrics than I care about your total body fat

523
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:36,640
percent. Your body fat percent is at the 40th percentile, but your ALMI, FFMI are at the 90th

524
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,520
percentile and your VAT is at the 10th percentile. I mean, that's perfectly adequate. And again,

525
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,960
a lot of that total body fat in some ways comes down to a little bit of vanity once the biomarkers

526
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,680
are themselves also great. Yeah, I think that was one of the most interesting things. We had an

527
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,520
internal meeting about this other day, which is just, it surprised me how cheap a DEXA scan is.

528
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,960
And if people just search the city they're in and DEXA, I think they'd be surprised to find that

529
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,360
out. And then same thing with VO2. And I know we'll talk about an exercise here, but some of

530
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:15,760
the places that do DEXA scans can also do VO2 max tests. And so it's something that if people

531
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,440
haven't done it, it's worth looking into and making that investment in because of what you can learn

532
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,160
from there. The other thing as you were talking that I thought of was, and we'll have to link it

533
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,280
in the show notes, is maybe one of the greatest commercials ever made, which is the Taco Bell

534
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:39,920
Protein commercial and just the overall importance of protein. Before we move on, is there anything

535
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,680
else in nutrition you want to touch on? I think on the topic of protein, we're probably

536
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,760
underdoing it for most people. I don't think I was paying enough attention to it. And I think the

537
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:59,120
RDA's, the recommended daily allowances are kind of out to lunch. The RDA for protein is something

538
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:05,520
to the tune of, I want to say it's like 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight or something

539
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,720
pathetic like that. You take an 80 kilogram person, so some of the weight is about a buck 75,

540
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,200
and that person should only be eating 65 grams of protein a day or something acinine, like 0.8 to 1.

541
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,160
And the reality of it is I think the RDA is predicated on how much protein you need to live

542
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,640
versus how much protein you need to thrive. And so I think when you look at those data,

543
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:38,240
you realize it's probably closer to 2 grams per kilogram or about a gram per pound of body weight

544
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,320
and that quote unquote toxicity of too much protein, toxicity is that, well, it's generally

545
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,680
kidney toxicity. If you consume enough protein, you're going to overtax the kidneys because that's

546
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,920
how we excrete the excess nitrogen. And you're looking at some of them in the order of 3 to 4

547
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,760
grams per kilogram before you get into the places where you're going to start to challenge your

548
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,440
kidneys' abilities to take care of excess nitrogen. So this is something that we're also

549
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,200
becoming much more attuned to in our patients. It seems to be a really big problem in middle-aged

550
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,280
women. That's where we're probably seeing the biggest deficits are these women that show up with

551
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,240
no muscle mass, eating no protein, doing very little strength training. I mean, to me,

552
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:32,240
that is a recipe for a shorter life, but more importantly, a lower quality of life.

553
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,560
Not to keep plugging future episodes because I think what people may not realize is at any time

554
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:46,800
of the year, we have about 12 unreleased episodes. So we kind of bank episodes and just because of the

555
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,600
nature and we do them and release them once a week, there's a lot that are unreleased. But

556
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,720
a few weeks after this, so in late April, there's a follow-up conversation that you and Lane Norton

557
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:04,160
had, which kind of gets into a lot of this even in more detail. Everything from the time-restricted

558
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:11,200
feeding to protein and even you both getting a conversation around what Lane would do and how he

559
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,000
would prescribe a workout routine, protein routine for that person, the roughly 50-year-old woman who

560
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,240
does cardio, doesn't do a lot of strength training, but needs to build in muscle. So

561
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,720
if people want to hang on for a few more weeks too, that's coming in more detail.

562
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,800
I think it makes sense then to kind of go a little bit on the path we're going, which is exercise.

563
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,560
So I don't want to say there's a lot of things that changed with your view on exercise because

564
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,840
you've always been a big proponent of it. But from how I've even heard you talk about it,

565
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:52,800
it seems you're more so than you've ever been on the importance of exercise in someone's longevity.

566
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,400
So do you want to maybe talk about just the theme of exercise and where you've evolved,

567
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,960
what you're thinking is now and why you've even put more of an emphasis than before?

568
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,160
Yeah, you're right. It seems odd that I would even be talking about this given

569
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,400
that exercise has always been such an important part of my life personally. But I think I've now

570
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:23,360
come to appreciate the magnitude of the value that is brought to a person's lifespan and health span

571
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,440
by having higher cardiorespiratory fitness and more strength. And you can't really get more

572
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,160
strength without training. So more strength is synonymous with training, with strength training,

573
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,200
obviously. I think I posted something on this a long time ago, or not that long ago, maybe a

574
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,960
month or so ago on Instagram and Twitter where I walk through some of the data on this. We'll link

575
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:53,120
to that. But the gist of it is when you look at the improvements in all-cause mortality by moving

576
00:55:53,120 --> 00:56:00,080
up the chain of cardiorespiratory fitness, so moving from being in the bottom 25th percentile

577
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,480
to the 25th to 50th percentile, they have terminology for all of those things like low,

578
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,960
below average, above average, high, and elite, which would be bottom 25th percentile, 25th to

579
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:22,480
75th, 75th to 97.5, and then the top, call it 2, 2.5%. As you march up those strata,

580
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:31,680
your all-cause mortality drops, and it drops at levels that aren't appreciated by any other

581
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,080
intervention. Quitting smoking, going from having end-stage renal disease to not, and it's easier

582
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,360
to look at these in reverse. So comparing someone with end-stage renal disease to someone who

583
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,280
doesn't have it, a smoker to a nonsmoker, someone with type 2 diabetes to someone who does not,

584
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:52,080
those are big multipliers of risk, but they're dwarfed by the multiplier in risk that you would

585
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:59,120
go from having a very high VO2 max to a low VO2 max. Now, of course, these associations have lots of

586
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,160
interplay with other variables. There's some genetic component to this, to be sure,

587
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,400
and there's obviously a healthy user bias, so I'm not acting like those things aren't present,

588
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:18,800
but the point here is if you can get yourself to exercise versus not, that's a big driver of

589
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:27,200
mortality reduction, and the VO2 max becomes one way that we can track the progress you're making

590
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,240
on that metric, similarly with strength, similarly with muscle mass, and things like that. Turns out,

591
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,760
by the way, that strength matters more than muscle mass, but muscle mass is a very good proxy for

592
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,360
strength. You know, it's funny, I'm two days now post-op from this shoulder surgery, and it's

593
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,600
really interesting how much I've noticed my grip is weaker in my right hand, which is the side I

594
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:56,880
was operated on, than pre-op. So not being able to recruit the full musculature of my shoulder

595
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,520
and scapula on the right means I actually have slightly weaker grip in my right hand, and that's

596
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:11,360
why I think grip strength is a great proxy for longevity. It's always been known to be that way,

597
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,240
and the question is why, and I think there's lots of reasons. Among them, it's just a great proxy

598
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,840
for overall body strength and muscle mass, but I think it's also a very functional form of strength.

599
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,280
Basically, everything in your upper body is mediated through your hands, and if your grip is weak,

600
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,640
everything downstream of that is weak. When you watch someone who's got a weak grip deadlifting,

601
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,120
it's very difficult for them to deadlift correctly because they don't create a proper wedge. They

602
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,240
don't create enough tension between the bar and their torso because their grip is weak, and if

603
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,280
they don't create that tension, they're going to compromise their lift. By the way, then they're

604
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,400
more likely to get injured. How do you train for grip strength? I mean, I assume you're not just

605
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,960
doing those grip curls with dumbbells, things of that nature, but how are you training specifically

606
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,440
for grip strength? I mean, a lot of carrying things. So I'll do a lot of supersets. I'm doing

607
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,000
a farmer's carry in between other workouts. One of my favorite, I won't be doing these things for

608
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,600
quite a while, of course, as I'm recovering, but I love doing the ski erg. So I'll do a one-minute

609
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:22,080
all-out ski erg followed by a one-minute farmer's carry with, I don't know, 70 pounds in each hand.

610
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,440
So whatever that is, probably 75% of my body weight or 80% of my body weight, and just go back and

611
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,160
forth and back and forth between those types of things. But basically picking up heavy things is

612
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,880
how you train for it. You know how much I love dead hanging. So that's another great way to

613
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,560
train grip strength. What's your record for dead hang these days? Well, the last long one I did was

614
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:51,040
four minutes, 35 seconds. Which is insane. And was that pre or post workout? That was a clean day. So

615
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:58,320
I was doing some katsu training, some BFR training, but not particularly intensive on my grip. So that

616
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:04,000
was a fresh start. I'm going to ask a question, but I think we'll also have to step back and maybe

617
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,120
let people know about the shoulder surgery you just got because there's some gnarly videos you

618
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:15,440
posted on Instagram of it. So if anyone has a weak stomach, they might not want to look at it, but

619
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,600
otherwise it's pretty fascinating. So because my question was going to be, are you just going to

620
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,080
start with your shoulder in a sling, left hand, one hand dead hanging, and just really work on

621
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,800
strengthening the left side of your body, but also maybe let people know what you just did with

622
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:38,240
your shoulder. Yeah. So I just had shoulder surgery two days ago and it was to have my labrum

623
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:45,200
repaired in the right shoulder. Labrum is the fibrous tissue that forms a ring over the sort

624
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:53,040
of flat surface of the scapula called the glenoid fossa. And that ring of labrum is what creates the

625
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:01,280
socket for the ball of the humeral head to stay in that joint. And so because I've had so many

626
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:08,480
subluxations where that humeral head has popped out of that effective socket, that labrum has

627
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:15,600
become torn. And over the past 25 years, it's just been insult after insult after insult.

628
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,760
And finally, I just decided I'd had enough and it was time to have this thing fixed.

629
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:28,640
What's the recovery process? How long until you were fully lifting like you were prior with that

630
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,320
arm? I'm told probably about eight to nine months. How will your exercise change? Because clearly

631
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,840
you're not going to not exercise for eight to nine months. It'll change in different phases. I mean,

632
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,840
I think for the first four to six weeks, it's going to be really quite gentle. All I've been

633
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,040
doing is walking. I did ride today on the peloton, which I hate. You know how much I hate that piece

634
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,840
of garbage. But it turns out the peloton does have one useful adaptation, which is easier to sit

635
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,440
upright on a peloton than on my regular bike. And because I can't use my right hand to brace on the

636
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,800
handlebar, it was just easier to sit both upright on this crappy peloton today and do my zone two

637
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:14,240
ride. So I'll probably be doing that for four to six weeks before going back to my bike where I can

638
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,600
maybe hopefully touch the handlebars by then. I'll be lifting, doing a ton of lower body.

639
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,200
I'll do some left sided upper body. And then on the right side, as soon as I get the okay from

640
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:31,760
Dr. Barron, who I'm going to see in two weeks, he's a very early and aggressive mobilizer. That's

641
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,480
going to be very important for me. So the reason I was dragging my feet on this surgery was the

642
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,680
fear of immobility. I mean, I've had a very privileged, blessed life with very hypermobile

643
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,120
shoulders. On my left, I was able to have hypermobility without pathology. On the right,

644
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,440
ultimately it turned into pathology because it was too mobile. That's what the frequent

645
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,320
subluxations were all about. When you have labral surgery, you're reducing mobility. And that,

646
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,160
I've always been so afraid of that, not just because of the downstream arthritis and things

647
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,600
like that, but just because I can dead hang with no pain. Swimming, something I can do,

648
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,960
which again, people with hypermobile shoulders tend to be better at swimming.

649
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,160
We're going to be moving early and doing so smartly. I think that the blood flow restriction

650
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,080
with my katsu is going to be a very important part of that recovery and doing a lot of isometric

651
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:25,680
stuff. So for example, instead of doing bicep curls with the right, I'll do sort of isometric

652
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,040
pressure with the blood flow restriction so that I'm not putting the stress on the joint,

653
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,320
but I'm still getting the muscle to work. Yeah. You're kind of documenting everything on

654
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,280
Instagram. And so we'll include those in the show notes, but for people who kind of want to see more

655
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,840
of not only the surgery itself, which you posted, but you also posted a series of videos prior to

656
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,720
that, which was kind of walking through what your exercise routine was. And I assume you're going to

657
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,280
continue. I'm just hoping we're going to get a lot of videos of you on the Peloton because I think

658
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:01,840
it's okay for you to admit that that's just a far superior bike and mode of zone two. And maybe

659
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,400
that's the blessing in disguise that will come up. The shoulder surgery is your love of the Peloton.

660
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,160
Oh God. Like the most ergonomically inappropriate bike ever built.

661
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,440
Yeah. I mean, we just need gel to start buying you Peloton clothes. You can just replace your

662
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,120
VORI with the big P Peloton shirts that you can wear. I think that'd be perfect. In all seriousness,

663
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,480
though, the other thing that I've come to the conclusion of and just talking to you and listening

664
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,880
to podcasts and meetings and things of that nature is a lot of times the feedback we can get is when

665
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:39,840
you talk about some of this stuff, it's not widely available to all. When you look at some of the

666
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:47,440
drugs, it's either it can be cost prohibitive or really tough to access them or find doctors who

667
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,760
will prescribe them. I mean, even what we were talking about earlier with genetic testing,

668
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,000
the cost prohibitive of that, the timing of that. But the thing with exercise is

669
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:02,800
it's available to everyone. It just requires a lot of hard work. But from what I've heard you

670
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,840
saying, correct me if I'm wrong, you still think it's one of the most potent things that people can

671
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:14,960
do outside of what drugs or supplements they take outside of other things they can do is just

672
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,800
exercise and working on building that muscle strength and muscle size to this day just

673
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:27,280
can make such a difference in someone's not only health span, but also ultimately their lifespan.

674
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,920
Yeah, I mean, that's the good news. And that's the bad news. The good news is this tool called

675
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,560
exercise, which is broad, includes a lot of things. It's not just one thing. So by definition,

676
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,400
it needs to be multimodal. It has an unbelievable impact on your lifespan and health span,

677
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,760
probably bigger than anything else. And it's available to everyone. It has the least barrier

678
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,160
to entry. The drawback is it's the hardest. I think it takes the most time. That's for sure.

679
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:00,480
And it's the most uncomfortable. Yeah. Anything else on exercise before we jump to our next topic?

680
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:08,320
I don't think so. On that kind of idea of supplements and drugs, anything around

681
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,600
molecules that you want to talk about or you've maybe changed your mind about or even gotten

682
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,680
stronger about anything, whether it's supplements, prescription drugs, hormones, any of those?

683
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:28,000
Well, I remain incredibly unoptimistic. I don't know if I'd call that purely pessimistic, but

684
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:37,440
I remain quite uninspired by the entire NAD stratosphere. So again, I'll be happy to be

685
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,280
sitting here in a year or two years when we hit 300 episodes and talk about how now I'm

686
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:50,400
completely convinced that precursors to NAD are the key to longevity. But if you're asking me,

687
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,480
how do I view that science today versus two years ago? I'm far less optimistic than I was then. And

688
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,840
I wasn't really optimistic two years ago. I mean, two years ago, I was kind of like meh. And now I'm

689
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:09,840
three levels below meh. I just think that this is incredibly uninspiring data so far. So I think

690
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:16,720
there's evidence that you can take NAD precursors, NR and NMN being the two most common, and increase

691
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,920
NAD levels. I think that has been demonstrated. I think two years ago, that was not demonstrated

692
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:28,000
as clearly. I think what's not been demonstrated is there is any phenotypic benefit from doing that

693
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,520
outside of very pathological states. In other words, if you take a quote unquote normal person,

694
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:42,960
a normal aging person, and do that, is it bringing any benefit to them in terms of lifespan or

695
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,320
health span? And I would say the answer right now is no. It's very difficult for me to get excited

696
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:55,200
about this, even though it generates a tremendous amount of excitement on social media. Now again,

697
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:01,360
happy to be proven wrong, but that will require data. And it will not require bad data. It will

698
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:09,680
require good data. I'm not going to be swayed by poorly done studies where outcomes are not

699
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:16,720
preselected, but are cherry picked and not corrected for in terms of multiple looks and things like

700
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:22,560
that. So some of the common problems we see with small exploratory trials that are important to do,

701
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,560
but should never be confused with trials that convince us of what's going on.

702
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,400
Yeah. And kind of a funny turn of events is this podcast is really looking at the past hundred.

703
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,080
I feel like we're also starting to hype up all our future podcasts accidentally, because we have

704
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:46,560
a dedicated AMA we did on looking at NAD and its precursors, NR, NMN, as well as Metformin,

705
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,920
Rapamycin, combining all those questions. And then in addition to you answering questions on there,

706
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,800
we also brought back past guests, Matt Kaberwin. So that will be coming out in May, which will be a

707
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:05,280
very, very deep dive into a lot of that research and a lot of those things that you kind of just

708
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:10,960
hinted at. And going forward, I just like the idea of creating a scale of how excited you are

709
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:19,360
by how many levels up or down it is from Met. Met, the Met scale. Yeah, exactly. All right. Any

710
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,600
other things on molecules you want to touch on? Yeah, I mean, I think there is one other thing

711
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,760
there, which is, and I think I talked about this on the David Nut podcast, I believe, but it's that

712
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:40,480
I do worry a little bit about the hyper focus on psychedelics as the catch all, cure all to every

713
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:47,840
problem in isolation. So maybe it speaks to the circles I travel in, but it's hard for me to go

714
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:55,760
like a week or two without talking to somebody who is raving about this shaman in Peru or this shaman

715
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,600
here or their psychedelic experience being life changing. But a lot of times when I get under the

716
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,480
hood of that a little bit, I realized they're describing something in isolation that I don't

717
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:16,320
think is very durable. My intuition is that those types of therapies are incredible tools to create

718
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,440
the vulnerability and the environment in which you can do the really deep work. And so I think there

719
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,480
are some people who are doing really good therapy that is guided by these types of molecules.

720
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,880
Specifically, I'm really talking about psilocybin and MDMA, but I think there are a lot of people

721
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,320
who are just taking journeys on those things, but not really pairing it with the hard work that needs

722
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,520
to proceed and follow it to have the lasting benefits. So I guess I would say that's just more

723
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,800
of a cautionary tale of at the end of the day, I think psychotherapy is probably the most powerful

724
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,880
tool in different forms. There are lots of different types of psychotherapy. We're going

725
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,440
to have a podcast coming up on dialectical behavioral therapy, which I think is an amazing

726
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,440
type of therapy that's more tool oriented rather than insight oriented. So I think we want to think

727
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,400
about ways to use those molecules to prime us to be ready to do that type of therapy, as opposed to

728
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,240
just viewing the molecule as the solution. In that sense, it's very different from a traditional drug

729
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,000
or molecule where the benefit I think is directly accrued from the drug.

730
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,840
The Dave and that episode was 182. And I can't remember if you talked about it there or if it

731
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,920
was maybe on the podcast way back when with Rick Doblin. But one of the things you talked about

732
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:39,600
there was when these drugs, if they become legal eventually, is the setting in which people are

733
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,120
going to take them and the work that's going to have to go into it before and after. Is there any

734
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,720
update? I don't follow the space that closely, but is there any update in terms of where we're

735
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:57,280
at with those type of drugs, psilocybin, MDMA, getting approved more widely available for

736
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:06,320
trauma, PTSD, things of that nature? So I think that the phase three data for MDMA have been

737
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,560
marching along with a lot of promise. So these phase three trials, which are looking at the

738
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,360
efficacy of MDMA combined with psychotherapy versus placebo combined with psychotherapy,

739
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:25,440
are demonstrating pretty impressive deltas and improvements in reduction of PTSD symptoms. And

740
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,640
also I think just as importantly, there's no toxicity. I think all of this is pointing towards

741
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:37,840
a world in which we're going to see certainly MDMA and potentially eventually psilocybin being used

742
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,720
as adjuncts to that type of therapy. And one of the big challenges will just be the regulatory

743
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,400
environment in which that happens. But I see that coming to the mainstream soon.

744
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,560
Interesting. Before we move on to sleep, anything else on molecules you want to touch on?

745
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,080
I don't think so.

746
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:03,200
So let's move to our next category, which is sleep. So a topic that has been talked about a handful

747
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:09,200
of episodes. Matt Walker has been on the podcast probably more times than anyone, maybe close to

748
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:15,840
Tom Dayspring for who's made the most appearances. But anything on sleep that you've changed your

749
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,760
mind on that you've been stronger upon now based on new evidence or research?

750
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,320
Well, I mean, I think a couple of things. One, I'm probably less concerned with the light from

751
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:35,680
electronics before bed than I used to be. I think I used to view that as absolutely deadly

752
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,960
for sleep. I'm not sure that that's really true. It could be more the stimulation that often

753
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,200
accompanies blue light because blue light is often coming from electronics. It can be more the issue.

754
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:52,720
So in other words, it might not be your phone per se that is killing you. It might be what you're

755
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,880
doing on your phone. So in other words, if you were looking at your phone and watching videos

756
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,840
of puppies and kittens and bunnies hugging each other, and then you went to bed, I'm not sure that

757
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,840
would disrupt your sleep. I think what's disrupting your sleep, even if you have a blue light blocker

758
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,680
is if you're on Twitter. So in other words, I think between those two scenarios, I know which

759
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:21,120
one is going to be more detrimental to sleep. I think the other thing is as Fenebut has become

760
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:28,320
basically impossible to acquire in the US, at least legally, I've looked for what are more

761
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:35,360
appropriate sleep aids. So Fenebut is a form of GABA and it was over the counter available freely

762
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,440
until about two years ago that easily accesses the central nervous system. And I think anybody

763
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:46,320
who's tried Fenebut would tell you that this thing is an amazing sleep drug, an amazing sleep

764
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,200
supplement. And it seemed to be one that could be used frequently without any concern, unlike

765
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,600
melatonin, for example, where you really have to be limited in how much melatonin you're using and

766
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,440
how often. So when Fenebut went away, we started really paying attention to what were some other

767
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:08,320
things that we could be using. And I think what emerged as a great sleep drug for most people,

768
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,960
not as just a drug that you use in crisis. Crisis can be anything from you're having difficulty

769
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,280
sleeping because there's something stressful, jet lag or something like that. But just kind of

770
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,160
a regular maintenance sleep drug is Tracetone. Tracetone is an antidepressant, kind of an old

771
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:31,040
school antidepressant that inhibits both serotonin transporters and serotonin type two receptors.

772
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:38,960
So it's a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor. Never really took off as an antidepressant

773
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:45,840
because at the doses that one would use it as an antidepressant, it created too much drowsiness.

774
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:53,200
So in doses of 250, 300 milligrams, which produced the psychological benefits, most people just

775
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:59,520
were constantly drowsy. So it basically is a drug that went nowhere. And only recently,

776
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:06,720
maybe in the past few years, has it come to be widely accepted that this off label use for sleep

777
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,680
at much lower drugs, typically 25 to 100 milligrams nightly produces not just remarkable sleep,

778
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,440
but more importantly, preserves sleep architecture. Because again, the key with sleep medications is

779
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,880
not being unconscious. There are lots of things that can render you unconscious. Ambien renders

780
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:30,080
you unconscious. A solid right cross followed up by a left hook to the head will render you

781
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:36,240
unconscious. They're not promoting sleep architecture. In fact, if you look at Ambien,

782
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:43,120
even though it might increase total sleep time slightly, it's actually reducing slow wave or

783
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:51,440
deep sleep by, depending on the study, it can be five to 10%. You're trading good quality sleep for

784
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,880
low quality sleep. So in the one study that I'm looking at in particular, and we'll include this

785
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,760
in the show notes, you see no change in REM sleep, a reduction in non REM deep sleep,

786
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,880
with a slight increase in total sleep, suggesting all you did was add more light sleep. And of

787
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,360
course, that says nothing about the other challenges that come from drugs like Ambien,

788
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,760
which alter your memory and things like that. Meaning anyone who's taken one of those drugs

789
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:24,240
can probably tell a scary story of how they were sending text messages or sending emails that they

790
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,400
don't even remember the next day. Do you want me to tell a story about you on that? No,

791
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,400
prefer we don't. Thank you. All right. Oh, just double checking. Just double checking.

792
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,040
It's been a long time since I took one of those horrible drugs, but have the scars to remember.

793
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,960
We've been using trazodone pretty liberally with our patients. Doesn't work for everybody. There

794
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,680
are some people for whom it just doesn't work at all, meaning it doesn't produce any sedation.

795
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,440
There are others for whom we just can't get the right dose. Even at low doses,

796
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,960
it produces so much sedation that the next day they're still groggy in the morning. But for most

797
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:04,080
people, and I would say that's like north of 80%, there is a dose, typically somewhere between 25

798
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:11,440
and a hundred milligrams before bed, that produces remarkable sleep, both in quality duration and

799
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:16,960
lack of interruption. And the next morning they're fine. They don't have kind of the hangover from the

800
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,640
medication. So again, it's a very old school drug and it doesn't have the dependency issues

801
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:29,200
that other sleep drugs often have, including benzodiazepines, which aren't horrible for sleep

802
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,600
architecture, but we would never prescribe them to anybody because of the dependency issues.

803
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,560
Why did phenibute go away? I'm not familiar with that. I can be wrong on this. I believe there

804
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,840
was something in Australia where some kids took like 10 times the recommended amount and wound

805
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,960
up in an ER. And it was just basically viewed as, hey, this is unsafe. If kids can get their hands

806
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,680
on this and take too much of it, which presumably you can take too much of it, it shouldn't be

807
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:03,520
legal, which of course is sort of dumb to me because the same as two of Tylenol. If you take

808
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,240
10 times the maximum dose of Tylenol, you're not just going to wind up in an ER. You're going to

809
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,880
be dead unless they can get a liver transplant for you. If someone took 40 grams of Tylenol in a day,

810
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,480
which is 10 times the four grams that we would describe as the limit, they're going to have

811
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:26,320
liver failure. They're going to die. But nobody's talking about making Tylenol illegal. To me,

812
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,760
this was just a very bizarre decision. I think it's a shame because I think it was a really

813
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:38,960
effective sleep aid. And with Trozadone, is that becoming a little more widely available? Are there

814
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,880
a lot of doctors out there now who are understanding its potential use for sleep because

815
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,680
it's a prescription? So anyone listening to this would have to go through a doctor to get a

816
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:54,160
prescription. Is that something that's a little more widely knowledgeable or is it, if people are

817
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:59,600
going to go talk to their PCP about it due to some sleep troubles, they're going to need to go in

818
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:06,960
really prepared with information. We're seeing a pretty reasonable amount of acceptance amongst,

819
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,840
I think, doctors that are reasonably well-read. This doesn't strike me as something that's that

820
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:19,600
far outside the mainstream at this point. Got it. All right. Anything else on sleep before we get to

821
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,800
a few random subjects here? No, but we'll link to some of the Trozadone data as well so that

822
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,840
people can be armed with that. Yeah, we'll put everything in the show notes. So if people want

823
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,680
to dive deeper into that and look at that, they can. So before we get into F1, one thing we always

824
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:40,320
like to ask is if you're reading any good books lately. I'm reading a great book right now. I'm

825
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,560
almost done. I like it so much that I immediately reached out to the author to have him on the

826
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,720
podcast. So the book is called The Comfort Crisis by Michael Easter. And I knew Michael before this

827
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:55,280
book came out. I think he'd interviewed me once for a story he was doing in Men's Health some time

828
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:00,960
ago. I'm really enjoying the book. And if people haven't read it, I recommend it highly. I think

829
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,280
it'll make for an awesome podcast as well. If people are interested, can you give people just

830
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,360
a quick little blurb about what it's about? Yeah, I mean, I think the title is pretty

831
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,960
self-explanatory, but basically we are in a comfort crisis. We are way too comfortable

832
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,800
now. And this comfort, we live in a world where we're never hungry, we're never cold, we're never

833
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,560
hot, we're never bored. It's got really negative outcomes on our mental health and our physical

834
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,960
health. The question is how can you exploit that information? The suggestion here is not, well,

835
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:37,280
based on that, let's go back to being hunter-gatherers and be uncomfortable 24 seven,

836
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,360
because that came with its own problems. But the question is, what can you do in your comfortable

837
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:47,840
world to get appropriate doses of things that are uncomfortable to recoup some of the benefits?

838
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,720
So we're now at the point of the episode where 15% of people are probably very, very excited.

839
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:01,920
And 85% of people may drop off, which is totally fine. That's why we kept it till the end. But

840
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,440
we're going to talk about Formula One. So I think the best way to start this conversation is for

841
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:17,040
the people who maybe don't watch Formula One every week, haven't followed it for years.

842
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,440
Last year was obviously a very exciting ending that was all over the place. So I think everyone

843
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,720
is at least familiar with the concept that it came down to the last race. There might have been some

844
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:35,520
controversy around it, and it was all over sports side news, everything, where if people are going

845
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,360
to start watching F1 this year and don't know all the details, it can be a little bit of a tough

846
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:47,680
sport to just throw on and get into. There's on some tracks, most tracks, maybe there's not

847
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:54,400
an overtly amount of action, not a ton of passing going on. But the more you learn about the sport,

848
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,720
and I can say this because there'll be times where I'm watching it and I'll be texting you,

849
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,760
just asking you questions about it because it's like, is this a big deal or not? What would you

850
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,480
tell people who are going to maybe start watching it for the first time? Because there is so much

851
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:13,200
strategy. There's so much stuff that you just don't see where you throw on basketball and you

852
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,560
pretty much get the point. Hockey, same thing. Baseball, this seems a little bit of a different

853
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,680
sport. So what would you tell people who are like, I'm going to give Formula One a shot this year,

854
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,600
how should I think about it? What should I watch? How do I understand it?

855
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,880
I do think despite a lot of criticisms that have been levied against it, the Netflix series

856
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:41,440
Drive to Survive, which is now four seasons in, so we have one season for 2018, 19, 20, and 21.

857
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,600
I think that's a great place to start. Now, I don't think you have to go back and watch all

858
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,160
of them, but I think you pick a season and you watch it. And of the four seasons so far,

859
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,080
I don't know which one the best one was. Each one has some great episodes. Maybe season one or

860
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,160
three were probably the best, which is interesting because those weren't very interesting seasons

861
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:05,120
compared to season four covered the most interesting season we've had in Formula One in

862
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,920
a couple of decades, which was the 2021 season. But I actually don't think that the series was

863
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:15,040
very interesting. There were 10 episodes and I think four were really good and four were so,

864
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,560
so, and two were really bad in my opinion. But you get some understanding of what's going on.

865
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,720
I think the reason this sport's a bit harder to understand than basketball is there are really

866
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:31,840
four variables that determine who's going to win a race. Really five. The four things that determine

867
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:38,080
how fast a car goes plus strategy would be the five things. You can be perfect on all four of

868
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,080
those things, but if you have the wrong strategy, you're going to lose. So the four things are the

869
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:49,360
driver, the actual skill of the driver, the tires, because that's the only point of contact between

870
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:58,160
the car and the surface, the engine, which is what generates the power, and the chassis, which is

871
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:06,000
what allows that power to be transmitted to the tires and it confers the aerodynamics that are

872
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:14,800
necessary to go fast on curves, which is really what differentiates F1 from any other class of

873
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:21,200
motor racing. It's not how fast those cars can go in a straight line, although they go insanely fast

874
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:28,800
in a straight line, like 320 kph, 330 kph, depending on how they tune their downforce.

875
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:34,480
It's what they can do on curves that is literally insane. It's how much downforce they can generate.

876
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:40,640
So the engine, the chassis, the tires, the driver are the four factors that determine how fast a car

877
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:47,120
is going to go. And then the strategy for how they race is what is ultimately going to come down to

878
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:53,200
who's going to win. And now, in looking at those four things, the driver obviously is different

879
01:25:53,200 --> 01:26:00,160
for every team. Yeah. So there's 10 teams, two drivers per team. So you have 20 drivers in F1

880
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:07,200
on 10 teams. And usually each team has kind of a A and a B driver. Just like on a Tour de France

881
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,240
team, you might have 10 cyclists. One of them is the GC contender is when the race is at the highest

882
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:17,040
stakes, like it's a Tour de France or the Giro or the Vuelta, like that's the one that everyone is

883
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,600
in service of. Usually one of the two drivers is the more senior driver. Now that's not always the

884
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:27,760
case. Sometimes a team is pretty equal. I think if you look at Ferrari this year with Charles Leclerc

885
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,800
and Carlos Sainz, I would say that either one of those guys is going to win. And I don't think

886
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,240
the team would employ what's called team orders, which is when the team tells one of them to get

887
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,880
out of the way if the other one is behind. Yeah. And that's one thing you see in the drive to

888
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:49,120
survive is those team dynamics. Just because they're on the same team, they're still competition with

889
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:54,240
each other. Yeah. On some teams, it's more than others. So on some teams, that competition

890
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,760
between the drivers is the most fierce because technically that guy is in a car that is most

891
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:06,080
similar to yours, though not identical. They can be tuned separately, but you're always going to

892
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:13,360
be most compared to the driver on your team. And therefore, if that person is constantly beating

893
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,720
you, there's no ambiguity about who's a better driver. So that's the driver. So then let's look

894
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,360
at tires engine chassis with the rules and regulations around the cars. Does everyone have

895
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,680
access across teams to the same tires is the question if they're hard, medium or soft.

896
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah. So Pirelli has been the tire manufacturer in F1 for God, at least six years now. But if you

897
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,360
look at the history of F1, sometimes you've had different tire manufacturers in the same year. So

898
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:49,440
certain teams would use Bridgestone while others would use Michelin, Goodyear, all sorts of things.

899
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,680
But for the past, I don't remember how many years, but it's been at least six, maybe longer.

900
01:27:53,680 --> 01:28:00,960
Pirelli has provided five tires throughout the year plus the two wet weather ones. So there are

901
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:08,320
seven tires that you have. And then for each race, they designate a soft, medium and a hard. So the

902
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:16,080
five tire compounds are C1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in increasing hardness. And they might say C1, 2, 3

903
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,920
are the soft, medium and hard for this race, or it could be 2, 3, 4 or 4, 5, 6. And then there's

904
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:28,320
an intermediate tire. And those by the way, are always colored, red, yellow and white. So if you

905
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:33,520
look at the tire rim, you'll know it's a soft tire because it's red. The medium for that race is the

906
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,520
yellow and the hard is the white. Then the intermediate is a green tire with an intermediate

907
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,240
tread. The other ones are slick of course. And then the blue tire is the full weather tire. And

908
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,480
that has a more aggressive tread. So the more tread you have, the slower the tire is between

909
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:53,920
the intermediate and the wet. And then the soft, medium and hard are the slick tires. And basically

910
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:59,280
the trade off here is the harder the tire, the longer it lasts and the slower it is because it

911
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:05,200
has less grip. So one of the rules of F1 is unless it's a wet or intermediate tire, those

912
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,480
situations are aside. But when you're using any of the dry tire compounds, you must use at least

913
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:16,240
two tires of two different compounds in a race. So what that means is even if this were a race

914
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:22,560
that were short enough that you could get away with just the hard tire, you can't do it. You have to

915
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,880
make at least one pit stop to switch to a different tire compound. And obviously certain

916
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,480
races like Bahrain last week, you'll see multiple pit stops from the teams because the tire

917
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:40,720
degradation of that circuit is so high. And that's where the strategy then it seems like comes in.

918
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:46,160
When you watch it, you see the running order of who's in first, second, third, fourth. And then

919
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,720
you see the tire, whether it's hard, medium or soft next to it, but it's not like everyone is

920
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:55,920
100% doing the same thing. So is that where a lot of the strategy comes in on which tires are

921
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:02,080
used at which point of the race? Yes. And also when you switch and how many times you switch.

922
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,040
So for example, you could run a race on a hard and a medium and do one switch,

923
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:11,840
whereas someone else might do a soft, medium and medium and do two switches.

924
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:18,800
Now, every time you switch tires, you have a guaranteed time hit of roughly 25, 26 seconds.

925
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,720
That's about how much time is lost as you have to slow down to enter the pit,

926
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,600
have the actual tire change, which is taking a little longer this year than last year.

927
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,880
This year they're based on one race. They're probably averaging closer to three seconds. Last

928
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,800
year was just a little over two seconds. So it doesn't sound like much, but again, that's a

929
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,880
relatively small price you're paying relative to how much you have to slow down to drive into and

930
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:48,720
enter the pits. So under what scenario would you risk an extra pit stop, which costs you 25 seconds,

931
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:55,440
to do two stops when someone else is doing one? Well, the answer is if you can make up half a

932
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:00,480
second per lap on a 50 lap race with a different tire strategy, then you would stay out. And by

933
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,560
the way, there's always a risk when you do a pit stop that something goes wrong and that three

934
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:11,200
second of actual tire changing becomes 10 seconds. We see that all the time where it's so hard to

935
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:17,680
change one of these tires. And if anything goes wrong and a bolt gets wedged or something strips,

936
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:22,080
it can be the end of the race. So your anxiety always goes up when they enter the pit.

937
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah. Well, and it's interesting too, is because it seems like one of the best examples,

938
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,880
maybe it's just because I haven't watched as much of having a fresher tires. What that does is the

939
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:38,000
last race last year, because when that safety car was out for Stappen pitted, got new tires,

940
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:44,560
Hamilton didn't get new tires. And you saw what happened and whose car was fresher and whose tires

941
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:50,640
were faster on that last lap. Yeah. Okay. So that's tires. Now, engine and chassis,

942
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:58,400
is that going to be different for each team? Are there regulations around it can exceed certain

943
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,320
things, but there's still flexibility in each team? How does each team do that?

944
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:11,440
So as far as engines go, there are only a handful of engine manufacturers in F1. So last year you

945
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:16,400
had four. So you had Mercedes that made an engine and they obviously made it for their car,

946
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:22,160
but they also shared it with other teams. So McLaren, Williams, Ferrari, which obviously makes

947
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:28,720
for their team, but also for their sister team, Alfa Romeo, and also for Haas. And then Renault,

948
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:35,200
which is the Alpine team, Renault only makes for Alpine. And then Honda for Red Bull and for their

949
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:41,440
sister team, Alfa Tari. Now Honda left the sport last year, but Red Bull preserved the rights to

950
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:47,680
the engine. So Red Bull is still using a Honda engine as is Alfa Tari. And then as I said,

951
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:52,000
you have Renault making for Alpine. And then basically everybody else is using a Mercedes

952
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,880
or Ferrari engine. Now this is different from IndyCar, where in IndyCar, everybody's on the same

953
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,960
engine. Everybody's on the same chassis. In that sense, there's something that IndyCar has

954
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:07,120
that's better than Formula 1, in my opinion, which is everybody's basically in the same car.

955
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:15,760
And now the setup and the driver and the strategy play a bigger role. In F1, the engine and the

956
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:21,440
chassis, which are unique to each team, by the way, even though Mercedes makes the engine,

957
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:26,560
you can't assume that the same engine is in the Williams car. They're not getting exactly the same

958
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:33,200
engine. And the engine that the Mercedes team is using that is built by them, everything about

959
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:38,880
their car is tailored to how to use it. So Ferrari has the best Ferrari engine. Mercedes has the best

960
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,960
Mercedes engine. And of course the chassis is huge. Aston Martin has a Mercedes engine, but Aston

961
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:50,480
Martin makes the chassis. And it's hard to imagine that they could ever do as good a job as Mercedes

962
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:55,440
is doing, because Mercedes gets to design their chassis to pair it to a Mercedes engine. So you

963
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:02,480
have very different equipment in F1. And were there rule changes this year around the cars?

964
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,960
Because I feel like watching last year, there was a lot of talk. Yeah. Every few years,

965
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,520
there's a major rule change. It's usually every six or seven, sometimes every eight years. So

966
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:18,720
this was an eight year change. So the last major, I think it was a huge regime change in F1 was in

967
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:26,720
2013 to 2014. So prior to 2013, Red Bull was the most dominant team of that era. So in 2011,

968
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:36,880
12, and 13, Sebastian Vettel with Red Bull won the F1 title. And he almost won it in 2009,

969
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:42,800
actually. He was so close to winning in 2009 that for all intents and purposes, Red Bull and Vettel

970
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:49,760
dominated F1 for five consecutive years. Then what happened in 2014, the hybrid turbo era was

971
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:55,680
introduced. And then Mercedes became the most dominant team ever in the history of F1 by winning

972
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:01,920
eight out of eight constructors championships and seven out of eight drivers championships. So

973
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,640
there's basically two championships every year. There's the drivers championship, which is awarded

974
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,640
to the driver with the most points. And there's the constructors championship, which is the

975
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,640
constructor with the most points. And those are two are not always the same, meaning it's not

976
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:20,640
always that the team that the driver drives for is going to win. To do that, you would have to have

977
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,000
two relatively strong drivers, which Mercedes has historically had. Although last year, as everybody

978
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,360
knows, a Red Bull driver, Max Verstappen won the driver's championship, but Mercedes was still

979
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:38,160
hands down the best team and won the constructors championship because Max Verstappen and Sergio

980
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:44,160
Perez had fewer points for Red Bull than Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas had for Mercedes.

981
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:48,640
So now to your point, we have another regime change. So now the new rules that were introduced

982
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:55,200
for this year are going to readjust the pecking order. And the rules basically came down to how

983
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:01,680
to make the cars more competitive and how to create more wheel to wheel racing. So that basically

984
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:07,840
reduced the downforce of the cars, which means that when a car is following another car, it is

985
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:16,720
less susceptible to the dysregulation of airflow going over it. So Formula One cars are basically

986
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:25,600
like airplanes flying upside down. So an airplane flying right side up, the more speed going in front

987
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:32,720
of the airplane, the higher it goes up. That's what lift is. So the force of lift is equal to

988
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:38,160
the surface area of the wing times the velocity squared times the coefficient of lift. So that's

989
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:43,200
why when a plane reaches its terminal height and terminal velocity, it turns down the coefficient

990
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:48,720
of lift. So it doesn't just keep going up. Formula One race car is an upside down airplane. So the

991
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:55,360
faster it goes, the harder it's being pushed down. And to put this in perspective, last year's cars

992
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:03,760
had so much aerodynamics that once they hit about 70, maybe even 60 miles per hour, I think it was

993
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:10,640
actually less than 100 kph. So call it 50 to 60 miles per hour. They were generating downforce

994
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:16,480
that exceeded their weight. Think about what that means. At less than 100 kilometers per hour,

995
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:23,360
they could be driving upside down. That's how much downforce they generate. So you can imagine

996
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:29,440
if you have two cars on a straightaway at 300 kilometers per hour, they're basically stuck to

997
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,960
the ground. But if one car is behind another car, which by definition it needs to be to pass,

998
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,400
its airflow is being disrupted and it's losing downforce and therefore it's slowing down.

999
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,880
And that creates a vicious cycle that makes it difficult to pass. And so they wanted to

1000
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,000
make it more competitive. And it looks like they've succeeded. If you just look at last week's race,

1001
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,800
that race was basically down to Verstappen and Leclerc until Verstappen's engine failed.

1002
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:59,760
And you saw, I mean, I think five passes between the two of them, which just historically you

1003
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,560
wouldn't have seen. So I think that's a very good change. They've also changed the tire size.

1004
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:10,240
So the wheels are now bigger wheels. And I think it's super exciting because we're basically back

1005
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:14,480
to square one and trying to figure out tires and engines. And they did one thing that I think is

1006
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:19,040
really stupid, which is they introduced E10 fuel, which I think is just the dumbest idea ever.

1007
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,760
It's in an effort to be sustainable, which I think is so ironic for F1 to try to be sustainable.

1008
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:29,520
It's like, why not an easier way to be sustainable might be scheduling races in such a way that you

1009
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:36,160
don't have to fly across the world 27 times as opposed to dropping from proper octane to E10.

1010
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:42,080
That has like zero bearing on the outcome compared to like one cross-world flight in the

1011
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:47,040
F1 schedule. So again, I think that's just a stupid example of idiotic politics that are

1012
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:54,160
serving no actual advantage except making the cars drive worse. So based on those changes and

1013
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:59,840
based on what we saw in week one, and again, this is recorded on March 23rd. So there hasn't been a

1014
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,400
second race. Is it looking like this year is going to be not only more competitive in the races

1015
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:13,600
themselves in terms of action passing, but also is it safe to say it's going to be more competitive

1016
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:20,080
in terms of the teams that are competing? Because last year McLaren and Ferrari were

1017
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:26,240
battling a little bit fourth third in the constructors, but there wasn't a lot of competition in that.

1018
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:31,920
I mean, last year was a pretty good battle between first and second, between Mercedes and Red Bull,

1019
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,720
and then between third and fourth, as you said, although by the end it wasn't really much of a

1020
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:42,080
battle. So Mercedes pretty much pulled ahead and then Ferrari pretty much pulled ahead of McLaren.

1021
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:48,320
Although I think that was less on the basis of the cars and probably more on the basis of the

1022
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,880
performance of a couple of the drivers. I think this year is just going to be a big reshuffling.

1023
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:57,840
I mean, it's so hard to say based on preseason testing, Ferrari and Red Bull looked to be the

1024
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:04,880
strongest. McLaren looked to take a step backwards. And by the way, that all looked to be true in

1025
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:10,960
that first race. Ferrari looked incredibly strong going one, two. Hadverstappen and Perez not had

1026
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,440
a pump failure in their engine in the last three laps, the order would have been Ferrari, Red Bull,

1027
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:21,760
Ferrari, Red Bull, positions one, two, three, four, and Mercedes would have been fifth, sixth. So it

1028
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:27,040
was clearly Ferrari, Red Bull, then Mercedes. And McLaren was way at the back of the pack.

1029
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,640
So yeah, I think it's going to be really interesting. McLaren has two amazing drivers

1030
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:36,080
in Lando Norris and Daniel Riccardo. So you can't blame their performance on their drivers.

1031
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:40,480
The other thing we saw was Haas, which is historically for the last couple of years,

1032
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:45,200
the worst team in F1. They had Kevin Magnus and one of their two drivers finish fifth.

1033
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:51,280
And even without the blowup of those cars, he would have been eighth, which is kind of amazing,

1034
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,880
given that they had zero points last year. And you get points anytime you're in the top 10.

1035
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:03,840
The other thing I think people don't realize is the importance of qualifying. So the race on

1036
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,840
Saturday. And then it kind of fits into another thing, which is each of these tracks is so

1037
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:14,320
different that there's, from what I've picked up at least, it seems like there's some tracks that

1038
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:19,280
are more competitive, where if you don't qualify first, you have a chance to overtake. And there's

1039
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:25,520
other tracks where if you don't qualify first, unless the first place person just does something

1040
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:31,120
stupid or has car issues, they're probably going to win. Can you walk through how all that fits

1041
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:37,440
together and works? The schedule for an F1 weekend is, with one exception, which I'll point out in a

1042
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:43,680
second is you always start with FP1 and FP2, free practice one, free practice two are on Friday.

1043
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:49,520
Saturday morning is FP3, that's the third practice session. And then qualifying is Saturday afternoon

1044
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:56,080
and then race is Sunday. So those are your five sessions to an F1 weekend. The purpose of FP1,

1045
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:02,000
two and three is to scrub some tires. You want to get one lap on a set of tires to basically get

1046
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,120
that sheen off them so that you have a nice set of brand new tires to get ready. And you're also

1047
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:13,120
learning the track. So FP1 and FP2, it's very difficult to draw much of a conclusion for how

1048
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:19,120
people are going to perform that weekend because they're really fiddling with the setup of the car.

1049
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:24,560
Because as you said, every track is very different. There are some tracks where you want very little

1050
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:31,280
downforce. So you want little downforce on a track that is a high speed track. So Monza is the

1051
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:36,640
prototypical example. So Monza, it's called the Temple of Speed. It's the fastest track in all of

1052
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:42,320
F1. And you have very little downforce there. So meaning you can't go as fast around the corners,

1053
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:47,920
but you can go much faster in the straights. Conversely, you have tracks like Suzuka in Japan,

1054
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:54,160
which is one of my favorite tracks, which is maximum downspeed. You have so many high speed

1055
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:59,680
corners that you basically say, we're going to put all of our eggs in the downforce basket and make

1056
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,800
sure we can go as fast as possible around these high speed corners. And we'll give up 15 miles

1057
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,760
an hour of straight line speed, if not 20 miles an hour of straight line speed. Yeah, you probably

1058
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:15,520
on Suzuka are giving up 20 mile an hour straight line speed compared to Monza. And then of course,

1059
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,320
there's everything in between. So you have to fiddle with that setup as much as possible during

1060
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,680
those practice sessions, scrub your tires. And so it's really only an FP3 Saturday morning that you

1061
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:30,640
get a sense of how fast somebody can go. And then Qwally works as follows. You have what's called

1062
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:38,320
Q1, Q2, Q3. So Q1, everybody goes out. You basically have whatever, 12, 15 minutes to put

1063
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:46,160
a lap time down. And at the end of Q1, the top 15 move on and the bottom five, their place is

1064
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:51,600
determined on the grid by where they finished. And then Q2, you do the same thing again. And now it's

1065
01:43:51,600 --> 01:44:00,320
the top 10 that go forward and places 11 to 14 are set on the grid. And then Q3 is for all the

1066
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:07,600
marbles. That's where the final 10 positions are set on the grid. And so that's virtually how every

1067
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:13,040
race works. The grid is determined by Qwally. There are a couple of races last year where they

1068
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:19,680
did something called a sprint Qwally, where you do, I think they go FP1 and then Qwally on Saturday.

1069
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:27,600
And then maybe FP2, I don't remember, but somehow they insert an extra race in the schedule on

1070
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:35,760
Saturday afternoon. And that race grid is determined by your position in qualifying, but then how you

1071
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:42,000
finish the race determines how you'll finish, how you'll start the race on Sunday. So it's a short

1072
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,000
race, typically, I don't know, 16 laps or something like that. So it's about a quarter to a third,

1073
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:54,080
the length of the total race, no pit stops, just go for broke. How you finish in that race determines

1074
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:59,360
your position. And there's lots of pros and cons to that. I think it makes sense on some circuits.

1075
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,880
I think it probably doesn't on some. So we'll see. I can't remember how many races are going to have

1076
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,400
it this year. I think it'll be present again for another three or four races this year.

1077
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:13,200
With the qualifying, how many races do you think where it's more important than others? Meaning

1078
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:17,520
what percentage of the tracks are hard to pass on versus easier to pass on?

1079
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:24,160
The track that is almost impossible to pass on is Monaco. So I'd have to go back and look at the

1080
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:32,240
analysis, but the analysis you'd look to do is what percentage of races are won by pole sitters.

1081
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,760
And I think in Monaco, that's going to be the highest. And in Monaco, it's just such a narrow

1082
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:40,720
track. It's very difficult to pass. Suzuka is also a very difficult track to pass on. There were only

1083
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:45,440
a handful of places you can pass. Historically, Abu Dhabi was one of those tracks where you

1084
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,760
couldn't really pass. Now they made a lot of changes last year to change the circuit, slow

1085
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:55,120
it down a little bit and create more passing opportunities. But look, there's never a scenario

1086
01:45:55,120 --> 01:46:01,280
where you're not going to do your best in qualifying because higher grid places always

1087
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:06,640
better. And this is kind of different from the golden era of F1, which in my view was the 80s

1088
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:14,720
and early 90s when you could radically change the tuning of a car during qualifying. So if you look

1089
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:23,040
at the McLarens of the mid 80s, they could boost those things to like 1400, 1600 horsepower during

1090
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:29,840
qualifying, and they might race at 800 horsepower. So remember maybe it was like 1200, 1300 versus

1091
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,480
700 or 800. I mean a significant difference. And frankly, there were some drivers like Nikki

1092
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,440
Lauda very famously would not boost during qualifying. He was like, look, it's frigging

1093
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:43,440
dangerous. There's a good chance I'm going to kill myself or blow up the car. He was such a

1094
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:48,000
good racer that he was like, I'm fine if I'm going to be fourth on the grid. I'm going to make it up

1095
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,720
on the grid. I'm not going to risk it. Iartan Senna is the best qualifying driver of all time.

1096
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:59,040
So if you look at the statistics of how many pull positions relative to race starts,

1097
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:08,400
nobody's even close to Senna. God, he's like 63 or something, 63 pull positions out of 161 races.

1098
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,360
I mean, that's insane. Even Hamilton and Schumacher are nowhere near that. And Hamilton's

1099
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:18,320
statistically speaking by far the greatest F1 driver of all time. But on that one metric,

1100
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,920
nobody compares to Senna despite the fact that his career was cut very short.

1101
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:29,840
And on the strategy side, when people are watching on Sundays, what should they be watching for

1102
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:35,920
on that piece? We already talked about hard, soft, medium tires when you actually are pitting.

1103
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:42,080
Are there other things that people who are watching should be looking out for on that

1104
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,800
piece to kind of understand it better? And the other thing should say is, and I don't know how

1105
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:52,080
recent this is, I haven't been watching as long as you, but it is really cool to be able to hear

1106
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:57,040
drivers in real time and teams talk to drivers in real time that you don't see in any other sport.

1107
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:02,160
You don't hear Bill Belichick calling plays or talking to his quarterback throughout where you

1108
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,760
do hear it in F1. So there is that, but are there any other things that people should be looking

1109
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:13,440
out for on the strategy piece on any given race to kind of understand? It's understanding how much

1110
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:19,360
you push too. One of the things that I really enjoy in the simulator when I'm driving the most

1111
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:27,280
recent F1 cars, so the Mercedes W12, so the championship car from last year is in iRacing,

1112
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,440
which is the simulator I use, and I love driving that car. And it's given me a totally new

1113
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:37,440
appreciation for how much faster those cars can go during qualifying. And so then the question is,

1114
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:43,120
why? So a lot of things that determine speed are tires, you know, softer tires are going to generally

1115
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:48,720
be faster, especially, you know, new soft tires, but they might only be fast for 10 laps, and then

1116
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:54,320
how you discharge the battery. So remember, these are turbo hybrid cars. So they're getting probably

1117
01:48:54,320 --> 01:49:00,640
an extra 160 or 200 horsepower out of a battery. And in qualifying, the reason they're so much

1118
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:06,240
faster. So if you look at a qualifying lap, let's say you look at a qualifying lap at Interlagos,

1119
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:10,240
which is the shortest circuit on the grid, but it's also one of my favorites. So the qualifying

1120
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:15,840
lap is probably a minute and eight seconds. The fastest lap during the race might be a minute,

1121
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:23,120
11 seconds, three seconds difference on a lap, that might as well be a month. That's a huge

1122
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:30,480
difference. And the reason is the way the car is tuned for qualifying, the way that they can

1123
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:36,640
maximally discharge the battery. And so you'll hear when you're talking about the radio communications,

1124
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,000
you'll hear them say push, push. We sort of joke about that. If you watch enough drive to

1125
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,680
survive, you get used to hearing push, push, box, box, because they often repeat instructions so

1126
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:49,200
that there's no ambiguity. Box means pit, push means obviously push, drive mode, push. And that's

1127
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:54,240
the other thing is like the drivers can't go all out all the time. They have to protect their tires,

1128
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:59,440
they have to protect their batteries. And so if a driver knows he's going to go for a big pass,

1129
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:05,120
he's going to have to actually back off a little bit to recharge his battery during a lap to then

1130
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:10,320
be able to make a big mode push. And then similarly with tires, like when Verstappen and

1131
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:14,960
Leclerc were going back and forth passing each other five times in two laps, they ended up taking

1132
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:20,000
quite a bit out of their tires. In the end, I think Leclerc had so much pace that it didn't

1133
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,960
really matter, but that could have come back to haunt him. So those are other things you're

1134
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,040
watching for. And a lot of times it's easier to do that in a race when you're live. Like when I'm

1135
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:34,160
at races live, I'm usually timing their splits at a fixed point on the track so I can see what

1136
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:39,040
their time degradation looks like per lap. Yeah, I love the thought of you just with an

1137
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:44,480
Excel spreadsheet and just a stopwatch in the stands and races, just taking notes like doing

1138
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:52,560
math in real time. Love it. So to wrap up the F1 section, who is your prediction to win this year?

1139
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:58,960
Not only the driver, but the team. I mean, it's going to sound like such a cop out. I can't

1140
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:04,480
say anything yet. I mean, obviously if you were doing this, I mean, the smart answer is Ferrari.

1141
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:12,480
Ferrari looked the most dominant during the sessions, the two testing weeks, and then they

1142
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:17,920
obviously went one, two in the race. So they look pretty amazing, but look, it's a 23 race season.

1143
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,440
One of them is down and Red Bull finished with zero points, but I mean, anything can happen

1144
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,040
going forward. And if they can figure out what's wrong with these fuel lines, which I think is a

1145
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:31,360
very significant issue. I also wonder if there's an issue with their fuel, because they're using a

1146
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:38,320
different fuel from everybody else. They're using Exxon as opposed to Petronas or Shell. So it might

1147
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:44,800
be that Exxon has just shit the bed on this E10 mixture and something not working there, but three

1148
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:50,960
out of the four Honda engines failed last week. So that's got to be a what's going on question.

1149
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:57,600
It's hard to say Ferrari also has two amazing drivers. Leclerc is probably the better of the

1150
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:04,480
two. So I guess you would say based on that Leclerc would be kind of a early favorite,

1151
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:09,840
but look, it's one race. I still think if Red Bull can figure out what they're doing, I think

1152
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:15,360
Max still has a fantastic chance to win. And finally, how do you bet against Lewis Hamilton

1153
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:21,360
and Mercedes? We can't forget how much they came back last year. I mean, Red Bull had almost put

1154
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:28,240
that championship away with five races to go and Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton stormed back. So I

1155
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:33,840
would never take the bet against Mercedes. And the difference this year is now they now have two

1156
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,400
drivers that can really win this thing as opposed to just Hamilton. So you have George Russell,

1157
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:43,840
not as good as Lewis Hamilton yet, but he's viewed largely as the heir apparent within the team. And

1158
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,480
that's why they made the somewhat difficult decision of getting rid of Valtteri Bottas,

1159
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:53,920
who was an amazing wingman to Hamilton in favor of someone who's going to be nipping at his heels

1160
01:52:53,920 --> 01:53:00,080
more, but is also probably the future for Mercedes. Yeah. So all that to say, it seems like,

1161
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:06,000
at least compared to the dominance of Mercedes in the past eight years, there's a lot more intriguing

1162
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,920
storylines and competition based on this first race compared to what we've seen in the past.

1163
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,440
For sure. I think the competition between Hamilton and Russell is going to be intense.

1164
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:24,160
I think the competition between Leclerc and Saenz could become intense, even though historically

1165
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:29,440
they've been the most cordial teammates of all time. That could change here. And then obviously

1166
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:34,640
those three teams, Ferrari, Red Bull, and Mercedes at the top is going to be intense. And anybody

1167
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:40,560
who's watched Drive to Survive can appreciate the interpersonal dynamics between Toto Wolf and

1168
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:46,960
Christian Horner, the Mercedes and Red Bull team principals who I think it would be an understatement

1169
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,800
to say they can't stand each other. What was that article? Which one of the two

1170
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:56,000
at a charity auction bought a tour of the other one's facility? He had Christian Horner.

1171
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:02,080
That loved that move. Yeah. It wasn't overly expensive and just outbid everyone so he could

1172
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:06,320
get a tour of the facility. I just thought that was- Which got denied by the way. He ended up

1173
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,520
yeah. I thought that was pretty funny. Yeah, just a hilarious move.

1174
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:17,120
All right. Anything else on F1 before we wrap this entire session? No, I think for the seven

1175
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:23,120
people that are still listening to this podcast, I hope they enjoyed the little tour of F1. Yeah,

1176
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:29,120
no, for sure. Yeah, I think it was just interesting. Hopefully people enjoyed the more laid back

1177
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:35,840
conversation and just bouncing around on topics, including this F1. So let us know feedback and we

1178
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:41,760
can look at doing more of these in the future. But until then, I think we're good to go.

1179
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,640
All right, man. We'll repeat this exercise in 100 episodes.

1180
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,640
Yeah, maybe we'll hit it on time, this one. All right, we'll see you.
