00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,760
Hey everyone, welcome to the member-only podcast feed for The Drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,280
My guests this week are Drs. Joan Manick and Nir Barzillai. Joan is the co-founder and

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,120
chief medical officer of Restore Bio, and that's a play on the word Tor, T-O-R, target of rapamycin.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,720
Before joining Restore Bio, she was the executive director in the new indications discovery unit of

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,320
Novartis, which we discuss early on in this podcast. She is an MD by training or receiving

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,560
her MD from Harvard Medical School, completing her residency in internal medicine and infectious

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,680
diseases at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Nir Barzillai is making his second appearance on

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,960
podcast, so that name may sound familiar to a number of you. He is the director of the Institute

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,600
for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He has spearheaded one of

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,880
the most impressive longevity gene projects, which basically looked at more than 500 healthy people

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,440
aged 95 to north of 110, along with following their offspring, the centenarian studies and the

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,960
centenarian offspring study. Nir also has a brand new book that just came out, oh, at the time of this

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,280
recording, probably a week before, it's called Age Later, Healthspan, Lifespan, and the New Science

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,880
of Longevity. We get into a couple of funny stories about that. Okay, this episode is one I've been

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,280
looking forward to for a very long time, because we discuss the two drugs I get asked about more

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,080
than all other drugs combined, namely metformin and rapamycin, or the category of analogues to

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,440
rapamycin known as rapologues. Now, the reason we decided to do this as a podcast with both Nir

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,080
and Joan as guests was because, of course, there were many overlaps between rapamycin and metformin,

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,320
not just in terms of longevity, but also of recent note, their potential for reducing the risk of

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,000
SARS-CoV-2 infection or other infections, and of course, COVID-19 morbidity. And we speculate on

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,440
those things to a great deal. So basically, the way this podcast goes is I want to make sure

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,280
everybody has the appropriate background information on metformin or rapamycin. So coming into this

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,800
episode, you don't have to know anything about those two drugs. If you do, I think you'll follow

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,240
it a little bit better, because these are technical. And of course, the show notes will have all of the

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,880
pictures and images and things that make it a little easier to follow this. But you can come

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,360
into this not knowing a lot about them, though we have had many previous podcasts that discuss these

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,040
things. And then we get into kind of the clinical indications that focus specifically around this

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,880
issue of how would these drugs factor into the immune response, resilience, and the amelioration

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,000
of a hyperactive immune response in the presence of these diseases. So without further delay,

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:16,440
please enjoy my conversation today with Joan and Nir. Joan, Nir, this is a first for me, and it is

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,360
also very exciting. It's a first, and then it's the first time I have interviewed two people

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,320
virtually simultaneously. It is also incredibly exciting because I am just such a fan of your

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,080
work, Joan, and obviously yours, Nir. Nir, you've been a guest on this podcast before. And Joan,

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,640
I have been eagerly looking forward to having you on for probably since the moment the podcast

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,000
released. So I'm grateful to both of you for making the time. And then of course, to do this

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,400
together is something that I've been a little nervous about for the past month, because I've

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
been thinking, how do I integrate the stories of rapamycin and metform? And how do I integrate

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,560
the stories of these two incredible compounds that in their most native form came to us naturally.

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,920
And then of course, we now have evolved elaborate synthetic versions of these things that have

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,560
these sort of magical properties. So I have an idea for how these two can overlap. But before

41
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,560
we do that, I think we should assume that maybe the listener is not familiar with you, Joan, and

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,520
even you, Nir, though you've been on before. And maybe just help us understand a little bit about

43
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,760
what you do, Joan. I know you're a physician by training, and you're also one of the world's

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,720
experts on my favorite molecule. So help us understand how you got to be doing what you're

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,160
doing. Sure. So I was actually started my career in academic medicine. I trained in infectious

46
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,920
disease and ran a basic science lab. But in my basic science lab, I happened to read some papers

47
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,760
by Cynthia Kenyon that were sort of transformative for me. And I remember reading a review piece from

48
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:03,280
Cynthia where she said the genetic mutations in worms that cause doubling of lifespan, show that

49
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,720
organisms have the capacity to live longer than they normally do. And I just thought that was the

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,160
coolest piece of research and the coolest idea that sort of threw medicine on its head. And so I

51
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,360
started to do a little bit of aging research in my lab, but eventually ended up at Novartis in a

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,600
group called the new indications discovery unit. And you heard a little bit of this from Lloyd

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,960
Klickstein, but it's a unit of Novartis where they tackle areas of drug development that fall in

54
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,960
between traditional big pharma silos. So when I got there, they said, what would you like to work

55
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,720
on? And I said, I want to work on aging. And when I first said this, I was told, we understand that

56
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,720
makes sense, but everyone's going to think you're wacky. So you have to pick a different area. And

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,600
I was really disappointed. But a few months after I got there, the CEO at the time, who was Dan

58
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Vasella and the head of research was Mark Fishman decided they thought Novartis should work on aging.

59
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
What year was this, Joan?

60
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,960
This was, must've been 2012. Lloyd, who was my boss at the time said, Joan wants to work on aging. So

61
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:27,280
they said, okay, Joan, go, go do something in aging. We just had this blank slate of saying, do

62
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,200
something in a clinical trial that is targeting aging biology, and you get to pick what you want to do.

63
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,240
So Novartis had a rapamycin analog, and there was a lot of data that mTOR inhibitors have beneficial

64
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,560
effects on aging and lifespan. So I decided I would take our rapamycin analog. And I thought an organ

65
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,000
system whose function I can change in a relative short period of time is immune function. So I

66
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,680
decided let's do a trial and see if we give older adults an mTOR inhibitor, can we make their immune

67
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,000
function better? And the readout was a vaccine, the response to a flu vaccine. So that was the

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,560
beginning.

69
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,200
Couple questions going back. I know your your father was one of maybe six or seven people to hold one of the

70
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,120
most prestigious chairmanships in all of American surgery, John Manick, at the Brigham and Women's

71
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,760
Hospital. And you, of course, trained at the Brigham as well, correct?

72
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes.

73
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,160
What was your father's response to this career change, which in effect it sort of was, right, which was

74
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,840
you're trained as an infectious disease doctor at a very prestigious, you know, one of the most prestigious

75
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,440
academic institutions in the world. And not only are you leaving academia to go into industry, but you're

76
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,920
also making what sounds like a very rash change in your focus. Was that something you discussed with him?

77
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,080
And if so, what were his thoughts?

78
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:03,600
I did. Everybody in my family was in academic medicine. But as you know, academic medicine has changed a

79
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,120
lot. And I was thinking, am I going to spend the rest of my life in academia? Or do I want to do something

80
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:18,760
else? And I had some friends who had left and gone into biotech and told me how much fun it was. And so I

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,520
was starting to get called by recruiters. And I asked my dad, I said, you know, should I do this? Should I

82
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,200
leave? And he said, I was 50 at the time. And he said, Joan, at age 50, this is the last time you have to really

83
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,720
try something new with your career. So go for it. Academic medicine isn't what it used to be. This is like an

84
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,440
exciting thing you can try. And so he was supportive. It was interesting.

85
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
That's fantastic.

86
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,280
Yeah.

87
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,520
The other question I wanted to ask you going back to your first attempt at studying a rapamycin analog was you chose to go

88
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,800
after something that, as you said, could be modified in short order, which is the immune system. But of course, as you

89
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,880
knew very well and will explain to the listener, the clinical application for rapamycin was, of course, immune

90
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:16,680
suppression. So what made you think that you could actually use the same drug whose clinical indication was to

91
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,280
suppress the immune system in a transplant patient to do the opposite, which was to enhance the response to vaccine?

92
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Novartis asked me the same question. I remember presenting this proposal to the committee that approves trials and I

93
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:41,200
go, why are you doing this? Why are you taking the drug that we sell to suppress the immune system and think it's going to

94
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:51,320
enhance it? It was because of all the data that mTOR inhibition has beneficial effects on aging in every organism tested.

95
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:00,280
And so I said, someone's just got to do the trial in humans and see if this is true in humans. And we're going to dose this

96
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,160
really carefully to minimize any side effects. And either it's going to work or it's going to turn out none of this translates to

97
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,200
humans. But we got to just sort of have the guts to try it. So that's what we did.

98
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Joan, I think it's interesting the way you frame that, which is, look, we had in 2012, at least three or four years of very good

99
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,960
evidence that rapamycin could be beneficial to extend lifespan through the ITPs. So the interventions testing programs run through NIH.

100
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:45,040
There had been several indications either directly through administration of rapamycin or indirectly through genetic inhibition of mTOR that you could

101
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:54,160
extend the life of yeast, worms, flies and mice. But of course, you can't do a lifespan extension study in humans.

102
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:04,360
So your study that would be published in 2014, which any listener of this podcast knows and has heard me referred to as the manic study, the 2014

103
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:17,440
Christmas gift I still remember getting my embargoed copy the day before Christmas. That was a very important paper. And again, I, I still applaud you for the nerve

104
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:27,400
because it's one thing to say the following. We have reason to believe this could extend life on average. It's quite another thing to say it still enhances

105
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:38,600
immune function. In other words, there's a scenario under which rapamycin did extend life across all those species and would extend life in a human on average, but

106
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:51,040
still impairs the adaptive immune system so that a subset of humans are actually dying sooner due to overwhelming immune compromise. While on average, people are going to get cancer later or

107
00:11:51,040 --> 00:12:03,040
dementia later, etc. In retrospect, it worked out pretty remarkably that the thing you chose to go after, which was in many ways the riskiest thing to look at, turned out to work. Was that something that you

108
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
noodle at the time?

109
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:21,920
You sort of had to have the stomach to do it. And I really wanted to do no harm to these older people who were very bravely entering the trial, but you don't know till you do the trial, how it's going to work out. And I tried my best to again, dose very

110
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:51,880
low or intermittent dosing that wouldn't be likely to be sufficient to immunosuppress. Because figuring the only dose that will ever move forward is one that is low enough that it's safe and that it doesn't immunosuppress. And there had been data in mice, older mice given and rapamycin that vaccination response was improved. So I just said, someone's got to do this and see if this translates. Because if it does, it will be the start of really being able

111
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,760
to move medicine in new important paths forward.

112
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:15,960
Now Lloyd discussed the study in some detail, but just so that, you know, maybe someone who hasn't gone back and listened to that, can you explain somewhat briefly, you know, there were four arms in this study. What were they dosed? What was the purpose of the dosing? How was it pulsed, etc. And what were you measuring? And most of all, what did you learn from that study?

113
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:41,560
So we used very unusual dosing regimens of this rapamycin analog that we either dosed at a very low dose once daily, or once weekly. The reason we did this is we wanted to just partially inhibit mTOR, not completely inhibit mTOR, because when you completely inhibit mTOR, you stop T cells from proliferating and you'll get immunosuppressed.

114
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,360
So these were chosen purposefully to limit the amount of mTOR inhibition.

115
00:13:49,760 --> 00:14:01,160
And what we found is if you gave it one of these mTOR inhibitors for six weeks, and then gave people two week break and gave them a flu vaccination, they responded better to the flu vaccination.

116
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:16,960
What we found is the lower of the lowest two doses, either 0.5 milligrams once daily of a virelimus or 5 milligrams once weekly, were the best. And those gave less mTOR inhibition than the highest dose, which was 20 milligrams weekly.

117
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:25,760
What it looked like is just turning mTOR down in the elderly, not turning it off, is the best for enhancing immune function.

118
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:34,360
So I'm going to hit pause on that for a moment. You mentioned the name of the drug, virelimus. It also went by another name, I believe, rad001, correct?

119
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,360
Okay.

120
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Let's bring metformin up to speed for folks so they now understand why would we want to talk about these drugs together, and why are these the two drugs I get asked more questions about by my patients than all other drugs combined.

121
00:14:51,960 --> 00:15:06,460
So, Nier, take us back to the first time you started paying attention to metformin outside of its normal clinical indication, which is, of course, an early line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes.

122
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Serundipitous, when I came to the United States to do my first post-doc, which was at Yale with Ralph DeFranzo, what I did that year was to find the mechanism of action of metformin.

123
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,860
It wasn't in the United States yet.

124
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:39,460
LIFA Pharmaceutical just brought it in and commissioned some studies in order to show that metformin works in the US population as well, okay, because we didn't accept anything, still don't, from other populations.

125
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:59,060
And my study was the first to show that metformin specifically targets hepatic glucose production rather than, or let's say, the insulin sensitivity of the liver rather than the muscle, though it's doing a little bit of both.

126
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,560
So, when I did that then, and we're talking 87, 88, I was actually doing aging there.

127
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,060
I took people and did clamps, young and old people, but I never thought that metformin is coming back.

128
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Metformin started coming back when all those data appeared, whether it was with clinical studies or with association studies, that people on metformin in clinical studies will not develop diabetes.

129
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,260
The DPP, it will prevent diabetes or in people with diabetes, it will prevent cardiovascular disease.

130
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,660
That's the UKPDS.

131
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,260
The association studies with cancer, hundreds of studies on cancers and all kinds of cancers.

132
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,960
The association studies on Alzheimer and also some clinical studies on MCI.

133
00:16:50,560 --> 00:17:06,560
And the day that I knew we have to do that was when a paper from the UK underappreciated that looked at almost 180 subjects in the United States into pharmaceuticals.

134
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,660
And they looked at people who were treated by the same doctors, some were diabetic and some were not.

135
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:23,260
Some were getting sulfonylurea drugs, some metformin if they were diabetic and controls for non-diabetic people.

136
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:34,160
The people on metformin who were diabetic, were more obese, had more diseases to start with, had significantly less mortality.

137
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,260
This kind of linked all of it together.

138
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,960
If metformin targets aging, which we kind of knew from animals, okay, it increased health spend and lifespan of animals.

139
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,660
Many animals, two weeks ago killing fish, if you give killing fish metformin, they live significantly longer.

140
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
If you give it to all animals, they live longer, they live healthier.

141
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,960
And all of a sudden, we have everything.

142
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:13,360
We have all ages, age-related disease, clinical association studies would have mortality that just made metformin the perfect tool for us to push geroscience ahead.

143
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm not as familiar with the metformin results in the ITP.

144
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm very familiar with all of the RAPA studies.

145
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Did metformin show benefits in the ITP?

146
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:35,760
It's very complicated, and I get this a lot because there were, I think, 30 studies that I summarized in a paper somewhere where we're giving metformin in many animals, increased lifespan.

147
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,960
There are two stories.

148
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,260
So generally, people in ITP will say, no, we haven't shown.

149
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
We haven't shown effect on metformin.

150
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,260
But I would say there are two exceptions.

151
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:54,660
One is in male mice, ITP happens in three centers.

152
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Explain to folks what the ITP is.

153
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,960
We're going to link to it in the show notes because you're going to explain why it's so rigorous, but there are in so many cohorts.

154
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,760
I mean, I think cohort 12 will begin to we're going to start to see the results of cohort 12 this year.

155
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,460
I follow the ITPs a little more closely now than I used to because now they're looking at SGLT2 inhibitors and all sorts of other really exciting drugs.

156
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,060
But yeah, explain the rigor behind it and why people put a lot of weight into it.

157
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:38,960
Well, the intervention testing program was established in order to have like preclinical, multi-central studies of drugs that investigators could say without proving or without doing standard studies would say

158
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,860
this affects longevity.

159
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:51,060
So the idea is you have a committee, you get the drug, you have animals who are genetically heterogeneous because we want it to be aging and not genetic.

160
00:19:51,660 --> 00:20:01,960
And they're giving in the same way in three different centers around the United States so that we have a standard way to say yes or no.

161
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,860
Those are two big caveats, right?

162
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,660
I mean, lots of times things will work in one lab and then they don't go on to work in other labs.

163
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,860
So that's an important bridge to cross.

164
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:30,260
And as you said, I think the heterogeneity of the animals also adds to the rigor because these models where we have mice that are homogeneous at each and every loci, they are so genetically flawed that you run into trouble where they become so artificial in terms of their model.

165
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,960
Right. In the metformin study in males, in one center, they lived 10 percent longer.

166
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,360
In one, also 10, one was nine, one was 11 or something like that.

167
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,060
In one center, it was one percent less.

168
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,560
Okay.

169
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,260
So, you know, it's not significant.

170
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Although, by the way, there is a power for each study.

171
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,560
There's a power for each study to be significant because they're using 50 mice per arm.

172
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:10,260
Well, the second point is when they added rapamycin to metformin to rapamycin, you could say if you think metformin has no effect.

173
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,060
That was that was cohort seven.

174
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,260
That was a nine month intervention.

175
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,560
Or they were they treated the mice at nine months with metformin and rapa together.

176
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,160
The nice thing of being young like you is that you recall those numbers.

177
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,860
They're seven, eleven.

178
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,060
That's the longest living animals.

179
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,260
I think so far in this ITP, they live 24 percent longer.

180
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,760
Okay.

181
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:43,360
Right. And the rapa solo, which Joan is pretty impressive as well, was I believe 16 percent and nine percent by gender.

182
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,060
Right.

183
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,060
And I should add it wasn't studied at the same time.

184
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,560
Okay.

185
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,860
So you can say there's a cohort effect.

186
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,560
There are people in the ITP.

187
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,360
So that's what I want to warn people against.

188
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:05,160
Is the implication that two of the arms showed effectively a 10 percent increase in the lifespan with metformin and one showed effectively no change.

189
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:17,560
Are you saying it's possible there were methodologic errors in the third site that again, if you had done it across 50 sites, which as a purpose of a thought experiment, it might have shown a benefit.

190
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
But three sites with one goes wrong.

191
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,860
I want to make a bigger comment.

192
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Maybe yes.

193
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
I want to make a bigger comment.

194
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,660
It's a little bit too late to discuss mice now, right?

195
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,760
Because we have all those data in humans.

196
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:44,460
I think we have to be careful with the ITP because it's possible that, for example, in humans metformin will have better effects than in mice.

197
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Mice might have less effect in mice.

198
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:55,960
So I don't think it's of the interest of anyone to start saying, you know, some of the investors say, you know, we're not impressed with metformin.

199
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:06,760
I understand that there are other studies that Hotel have shown that there's other animal studies that have shown that there are model studies that have shown it.

200
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,060
But who cares?

201
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Yeah, your point is, which I think is a great point near, we probably have more than enough information of the power of this intervention.

202
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:25,460
And humans that it's a little bit of the tail wagging the dog if we're going to get wound up about which strain of mice does better on metformin or not.

203
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,760
And obviously, Joan, I think we're in we're long past that point as well.

204
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,260
And frankly, I think that's where the focus of the ITPs are moving to other more novel compounds.

205
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
They're looking at nicotinamide riboside.

206
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,160
They're looking at SGLT2 inhibitors.

207
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,260
They're looking at acrobose, which actually looked like it did have a positive effect.

208
00:23:45,760 --> 00:24:08,060
So let's continue with the story, which is and I remember the paper, of course, you're talking about because it's one that people still often reference, which is how is it possible that a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and all of the associated microvascular damage that would come from the hyperglycemia, the macrovascular damage that's accompanied by the hyperinsulinemia.

209
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,860
I mean, the deck is really stacked against this patient.

210
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:20,160
And yet somehow, if you give them metformin and compare them to someone who has better glycemic control, presumably less hyperinsulinemia, they somehow live longer.

211
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,960
I mean, it shouldn't be.

212
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Right.

213
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:29,560
So I want to pass forward to 2020 because we published a cell metabolism paper.

214
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:37,260
The figure is open in front of me, but I want to make sense of what we try to do and go back to aging.

215
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:45,460
You know, we, geroscientists, kind of agree that there are hallmarks of aging and we kind of agree on the hallmarks.

216
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,060
We call them sometimes different.

217
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,960
Some some people say seven and some people say nine.

218
00:24:49,960 --> 00:25:03,660
Okay. And the hallmarks are very important, mainly because once we had the hallmarks, biotechs started forming because all of a sudden there were targets.

219
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:11,560
Not only did we have the hallmarks that the hallmarks were interacting, you don't have you can target one hallmark and you affect the others.

220
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,660
You can change autophagy and improve insulin action and mitochondria function.

221
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Right.

222
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,560
So we have these hallmarks.

223
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,860
And in this paper, we try to do something very simple.

224
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:33,560
We try to say, let's look at the mechanism of action of metformin, the papers that were published, and let's see which hallmark exactly metformin.

225
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,960
Is heating and this was the great surprise.

226
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:49,960
And I'll tell you the surprise and I tell you my interpretation, but the bottom line is there is evidence that metformin hits every one of those hallmarks.

227
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:57,260
And you have a big figure there with the hallmarks on the bottom, the mechanism of action and all the papers that show.

228
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,160
Yeah, it does that.

229
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,660
It does that.

230
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,360
It does every one of them.

231
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,660
We're going to include that near in the show notes.

232
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,560
It's a great figure and we actually I believe included it from our first discussion, but it's so important that it is worth going through.

233
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Do you want to maybe talk about what you think are the three most important of the mechanisms that metformin targets and Joan, I'm going to really ask you the same question in a moment.

234
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:28,760
What do you think are the three or four most important of those pillars or hallmarks that Rapa or Rapa logs are targeting?

235
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,060
And because I think I think these are very important for people to understand where these drugs work and how I'll tell you that.

236
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:44,960
But I just before I'm telling you that I want to tell you that I don't believe for a second that metformin independently targets all of them.

237
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,460
And I think that's what we should note metformin.

238
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,960
Let's say on the cellular level, it fixes aging.

239
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,460
Okay, once it fixes aging, a lot of things improve.

240
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:10,460
Okay, maybe the fact that insulin levels go down doesn't have to do only with metformin effect on glucose, but because autophagy has increased mitochondrial function is better.

241
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,260
Genetic stability is good, you know, things like that.

242
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:21,860
I think when you do an experiment at the end of which you see so much effect and there's an argument because people say, hey, it's all epigenetic.

243
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,960
Here's the study that shows epigenetics.

244
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:30,360
Well, yes, but the question is, did metformin do it or did what metformin did on aging do that?

245
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
So for me, there are three major arms of metformin.

246
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:44,160
One of them is the metabolic, the effect that it targets complex one in the mitochondria.

247
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:52,960
And by that, and I'm skipping the stages, it increase AMP kinase and it targets mTOR.

248
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,660
Okay, and everything that metabolically happens on that side.

249
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,460
So let me ask you a question here.

250
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,660
I've never been able to get a straight answer out of anybody on this.

251
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,860
Do we have a dose equivalence?

252
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,660
Because what you just said for the listener, I want to make sure is clear.

253
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,760
Metformin is a weak mitochondrial toxin.

254
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,160
It inhibits complex one.

255
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,560
That tricks the body basically into doing something which is thinking nutrients are scarce.

256
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,760
AMP kinase goes up.

257
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,060
It thinks there's a deficiency of energy.

258
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:37,660
We know that that has a downstream effect on the inhibition of mTOR, something that we're going to talk about happening directly through the rapamycin rapalog pathway.

259
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:56,160
But what I'm trying to understand is using the cellular assays where we can read out the extent of that inhibition, do we know that five milligrams of rapamycin or everolamis is equivalent to a thousand milligrams of metformin?

260
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,860
In other words, do we have a sense of what an apples to apples mTOR inhibition looks like, even though one's direct and one is indirect?

261
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,560
It's a good question.

262
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:16,060
I can find the answer on a cellular level because Anna Maria Cuervo, our Jones and my friend, is using metformin as the positive control for autophagy.

263
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,160
Okay, she actually uses metformin and not rapamycin.

264
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,360
So she must have tried and have the dose response on a cellular level.

265
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,260
I'm not aware, John, are you aware?

266
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
I'm not aware.

267
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,960
It's a good question.

268
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
I don't know the answer for that.

269
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,060
What's also complicated because rapamycin actually isn't a good inducer of autophagy.

270
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
The catalytic inhibitors are much better.

271
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:51,360
So it's not just which dose of mTOR inhibitor, but what downstream readout of mTOR is equivalent.

272
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,060
Are you looking at autophagy or are you looking at protein synthesis, each one?

273
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,460
So you're saying, I mean, we're going to come back to this, Joan, when we talk about the difference between the allosteric and the catalytic inhibitors.

274
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:14,760
But you're saying the way you go about inhibiting mTOR will shift the lever more towards maybe inhibition of senescence versus protein synthesis versus autophagy.

275
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
So, okay, we'll come back to that.

276
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,860
But, Nira, sorry to interrupt.

277
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,160
Let's go back to what you were saying.

278
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:27,360
So big pillar one is the metabolic complex one AMPK mTOR pathway.

279
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,160
Right, which is what we just discussed.

280
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:48,460
The second is there is a decrease in oxidative stress in ROS production and therefore also on DNA damage that is the consequence of using a low dose of mitochondrial poison.

281
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:48,960
Right.

282
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,560
So there is this aspect of that.

283
00:30:52,060 --> 00:31:00,160
And the third aspect, the relation to autoimmune function and inflammation.

284
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:14,260
So those are kind of the, I think, the major effects on metformin and it is because by accident, it's kind of doing those two arms, the metabolic and the ROS inflammation.

285
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,660
You're getting a two for one there.

286
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:25,160
Can you say more about the potential immune enhancement and presumably cytokine reduction if it's cytokine that's sort of deleterious?

287
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,660
Yes, it's doing both of them.

288
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,760
I think Joan will give a good example.

289
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,560
Do you want the cellular mechanism of that?

290
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,960
Because I don't want to get into that now.

291
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,260
I think Joan has a better explanation because we don't have the same.

292
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:49,860
We have the clinical data on metformin, but I wouldn't tell you what exactly is the most relevant target in the in the whole.

293
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,660
Okay.

294
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,360
Okay.

295
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,460
So Joan, let's go back to we're still talking about either rapamycin or RAD001 or RapaLog.

296
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:08,960
What do you think are the places where it plays the greatest effect in longevity in terms of these cellular mechanisms or critical pillars?

297
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,260
Yeah, I think it's an area where we have to understand more.

298
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:31,560
But one of the things that will happen with a RapaLog is that you'll get less protein and lipid synthesis and that may decrease proteotoxic stress just by having less proteins made that your protein degradation system has to deal with.

299
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,760
Then people have assumed autophagy is another mechanism.

300
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,860
But actually, as I was just mentioning, RapaLogs don't consistently induce autophagy.

301
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,560
It's cell dependent.

302
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:50,960
So how much of a role autophagy has in the benefits of RapaLog is probably tissue dependent.

303
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,660
Where do we think it has the most effect versus the places where we think it has the least effect on autophagy?

304
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:09,260
We look in cell lines and we don't see in many cell lines any induction of autophagy, but then there'll be a few cell lines that do have induction of autophagy.

305
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:15,060
And I can't tell you is it cells from the liver versus the cells from neurons.

306
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:25,560
I don't know whether it's the tissue of origin or if it's something like the level of FKBP12 in the cell.

307
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,660
So then the third part, which is it's so it's interesting.

308
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:36,660
It's similar to what you're was saying for metformin is there is a regulation of the SASP.

309
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:47,760
So these inflammatory cytokines that are secreted by senescent cells that accumulate as we age that is regulated in part by mTOR.

310
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,360
So inhibiting mTOR will decrease SASP, which will decrease systemic inflammation.

311
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:04,060
When we think about that and go back to the results that you demonstrated in humans six years ago, how does that story make sense?

312
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:17,560
So now I want to bring both the stories of RapaMyson or RapaLogs and metformin to as Nier said to 2020 where most of us are now focusing on something new.

313
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,560
And I'll just use myself an example.

314
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,360
I mean, you guys have been focusing on this forever.

315
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:31,060
I don't think I've thought about immune enhancement as much at a clinical level as I have in the past four months.

316
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:46,960
So prior to covid, most of my interest around immune enhancement and the reason I've been so interested in RapaMyson is more in my belief around anything that you can do that's going to enhance the immune system at the adaptive level,

317
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,760
which is what you're getting out of a vaccine is going to help with cancer surveillance.

318
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:00,260
And in as much as delaying the onset of cancer is an important pillar of longevity, that's the real reason we want to have enhanced immunity.

319
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:10,660
I would say I very naively didn't pay enough attention to the mortality from even influenza, which of course is also getting more attention appropriately today.

320
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:18,360
So it's not just that coronavirus is, you know, we have a new strain of coronavirus that now adds to our burden of these.

321
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:25,060
But look, there's there's a non-trivial chance that a 75 or 85 year old person is going to die from an influenza virus.

322
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,860
And now, of course, we have another virus that's going to be probably five times more more virulent.

323
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,260
So how do you make this link?

324
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:45,560
Why is it that the T cells got better at recognizing an antigen when a patient was pulsed with a drug that is inhibiting senescent cells or at least the soluble factors of senescent cells?

325
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:52,960
Is it as you said, maybe there's some tissue specific or cell specific autophagy reduction in protein synthesis and lipid synthesis?

326
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:58,060
How does that story go from the mechanistic story to the clinical story?

327
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,760
I think it's going to be complicated.

328
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,860
But one of the factors on how you respond to a vaccine is actually innate immunity.

329
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:16,260
And you need innate immunity to bring in the adaptive T and B cells to respond to antigen.

330
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:25,060
One of the problems in the elderly is that they have a defect in type one interferon production after getting a flu vaccine.

331
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,460
That's been shown by a group from Yale.

332
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:40,160
And it's also been shown by another group from Stanford that all sorts of stimuli to the innate immune system that should induce interferon, there's a defect in immune cells from the elderly.

333
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:50,160
What we've shown is that with mTOR inhibitors, you can enhance that interferon production in interferon induced gene expression.

334
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:58,960
And so the innate immune function, enhancing that may be one of the reasons that the adaptive immune system is working better when you get vaccinated.

335
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,160
We've also shown that there's a decrease in exhausted T cells.

336
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,260
We first showed that in older humans and then Tyler Curiel showed the same thing in older mice.

337
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,460
So there's more T cell exhaustion.

338
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:19,260
And when you give it mTOR inhibitor and particularly a rapologue, that decreases and we don't know the mechanism for that yet.

339
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,560
Has anyone ever tried this is sort of off topic, but to your first point, I was actually not aware of the interferon issue.

340
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,460
That's super interesting.

341
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,860
If you vaccinate older patients with a low dose of interferon, do you get around to that?

342
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,360
Nobody's tried.

343
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,360
You have to be careful with the vaccine.

344
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,060
Yeah, interferon is pretty dangerous.

345
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,560
Yeah.

346
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,060
Right.

347
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:49,160
So I think what it looks like is that there's just enhancing kind of the response to the vaccine antigen and not sort of just dumping interferon in.

348
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,860
Yeah, it's not the interferon per se.

349
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,560
It's that the lack of interferon is a proxy for a failure to recognize in the first place.

350
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,260
Exactly.

351
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,660
In your 2014 paper, remind me, did you look only at T cell or also B cell assays?

352
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,160
Did you look at neutralizing antibodies and T cell killing?

353
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
So we only looked at hemagglutination inhibition, HI titers.

354
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,860
Didn't look at neutralizing antibody and didn't look at T cell function.

355
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:23,060
We just looked at shifts in 76 different peripheral blood subsets.

356
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,260
And it was interesting.

357
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,780
The r

358
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:35,660
except there was about a 25 to 30% decrease in the PD1 positive CD4 and CD8.

359
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,460
These are the exhausted T cells that accumulate with age.

360
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,760
I think I forgot that detail.

361
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,360
So these are cells with checkpoint inhibitors on them.

362
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,960
These are CD4, CD8 killer cells with a PD1 checkpoint inhibitor.

363
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,560
Exactly.

364
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,560
So those go down, which may be another, you know, part of the adaptive immune system

365
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,460
that's getting improved from the rappologue.

366
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,560
Yeah, which might also speak to again, if you want to shoot for the stars, you can see some cancer protection

367
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,160
benefits potentially with that application.

368
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,660
Yeah.

369
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,760
So near, explain to me the immune benefits of metformin.

370
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:18,960
I've obviously first and foremost always thought of rappologues as interfering with the immune system one way or the other, right?

371
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,360
If the dose is high and frequent enough, it's going to impair the immune system.

372
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,060
But as Joan has explained, if you learn how to thread the needle correctly, you can enhance the immune system.

373
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:34,460
When did it become apparent to you that metformin, which I mean, the metabolic benefits tend to jump out at us.

374
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,660
But when did these immune benefits start to become really apparent?

375
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,960
Their papers in the 40 and 50s on by guanids that were actually looking like metformin.

376
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,060
Remember the history of metformin.

377
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:55,160
It had a cousin, fenformin, that seems to be more active against diabetes, but it was associated with lactic acidosis.

378
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,060
So they went back to metformin.

379
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:07,260
But in the 40s and 50s and 60s, metformin was used around the world for influenza in the elderly.

380
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
And there's a lot of literature.

381
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:15,960
Unfortunately, the literature is in Czech and Swedish and Philippines.

382
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:27,760
And I'm not starting to get a lot of translation, but all of them were positive response to using metformin as an immune enhancer against the flu.

383
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,760
And by the way, against malaria and some other indications.

384
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,160
This has started really early on.

385
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:43,860
And unlike what John did to rapamycin, this didn't really come back until recently.

386
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,660
But we knew several things about metformin.

387
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:56,860
We knew that patients with type 2 diabetes, if they get metformin, they immunize better against the flu.

388
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,860
There is at least a study like that.

389
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,660
And there are studies that showed.

390
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,960
So when we talk about metformin or rapamycin, we're talking about several things.

391
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,560
We're talking about fixing the immune decline.

392
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,760
We're talking about the inflammatory response.

393
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,260
Right.

394
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:29,260
And we're talking also with both these drugs, not about their immune function, but do they help the elderly

395
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,060
body sustain a severe disease?

396
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:32,960
Right.

397
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,660
In the case of COVID, we need all those those things.

398
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,160
We need to have better immunization, not get to the Cytokon storm.

399
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,160
And if we are sick, you know, be tough.

400
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:56,360
Let's unpack that a little bit because it's a great point you raise in here, which is if you had to wave a magic wand and make someone most resistant to SARS-CoV-2,

401
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:02,060
you probably wouldn't just increase their immunity by 10 to 20 percent.

402
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,860
You would reduce their comorbidities first and foremost.

403
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,060
In other words, to use an extreme example, right?

404
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:17,060
If you take a 30-year-old with no comorbidities, their probability of succumbing to this virus is infinitesimally small.

405
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,460
It's almost unmeasurable.

406
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,160
Whereas if you take even a 40-year-old with comorbidities, the risk starts to become non-trivial.

407
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:37,260
In as much as these drugs can reduce comorbidities, they may have at least as much benefit on protecting against the mortality as they would on enhancing the immune system.

408
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,860
And I don't think those are necessarily dependent on each other, are they?

409
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,460
No, they're not.

410
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,860
Let me just say one thing.

411
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:55,060
Across the world, if you're 80 years old and older, your chances to die is 180 times more than if you're twin.

412
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,060
But let's make sure that there are young people who are dying too, okay?

413
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,360
It's just really an incredible ageism.

414
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,960
Let me not be hypothetical.

415
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,860
Let me give you an example.

416
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:14,160
There's a paper that was published in China a little bit more than a week ago,

417
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,260
where they looked at the 100 people with COVID that were treated with metformin,

418
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:29,560
comparing them to the 178 people that were diabetic and not treated with metformin.

419
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,860
And just to be clear, these were prospectively treated with metformin,

420
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,460
or this was a retrospective analysis of diabetics with and without metformin.

421
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,160
No, and it's a good point.

422
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,360
I don't think any one of us are saying, you get to the hospital, you get metformin.

423
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,160
This will be a big mistake.

424
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,860
We might kill people there in lactic acidosis anyhow.

425
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,360
I mean, we don't want to do that.

426
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,960
Those were people that were hospitalized with metformin or without metformin.

427
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,260
So those are the 278 diabetic patients in Huan that were there.

428
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,660
And you're saying for the only difference that is apparent upon admission to the hospital

429
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,560
is a group of them are on metformin and a group are not,

430
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,560
but they are otherwise as close to equal as you would find them shy of being able to randomize.

431
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,260
Absolutely.

432
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,760
The only significant difference is that actually the glucose level in hospitalization of the metformin

433
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,660
was higher than that of control.

434
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,260
But otherwise, they're the same age, gender distribution and everything.

435
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,960
Okay.

436
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,260
And they had, the people on metformin had 25% of the mortality.

437
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Let's change it around.

438
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,960
They had four times decrease in mortality.

439
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,160
But this is not what grabbed my attention.

440
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:50,360
I went to the web and tried to figure out how many diabetic patients in China are treated with metformin.

441
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
And there is an exact data.

442
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:00,460
I did get a little bit indirect data because the people who give you the exact data, you have to pay them $3,500.

443
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,260
So I wasn't ready to do that.

444
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:07,060
But the use of metformin in China is between 60 and 70%.

445
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,660
And you see the ratio of the people who were hospitalized was the opposite.

446
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:18,560
So I'm thinking less people on metformin showed up in the hospital.

447
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:26,360
And probably the mortality had to do more with the inflammatory, with the Cytokom storm,

448
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,360
or with their ability to handle severe disease than the immunization.

449
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,660
Let's think about this for a second because obviously COVID kills in several ways.

450
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,660
And again, when you contrast it with influenza, I think it's an important contrast, right?

451
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,260
Influenza is probably more dis...

452
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,260
And Joan, you should step in because I think you probably know more about influenza than I'll ever know.

453
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,860
But really the issue with influenza is that it can paralyze the immune system.

454
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,560
And it's these secondary infections that come in.

455
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,460
So obviously there are certain strains of the flu that can kill you through the Cytokom storm.

456
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:09,760
But isn't the way that the majority of older patients die of influenza is just that their immune system gets sort of whacked by this thing,

457
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,160
becomes almost somewhat paralyzed and they become more susceptible to other infections such as a bacterial infection.

458
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Isn't that a big part of the danger of influenza beyond just the virus itself?

459
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,760
Oh, you know, we used to think that, but there was a paper that came out from the CDC in New England Journal in 2015

460
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,660
that looked at what actually causes pneumonia in the elderly that gets them hospitalized.

461
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,360
And it's not a combination of virus and bacteria, that is some of it.

462
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:47,260
But the majority is a virus and the most common virus is actually rhinovirus, which is the cause of the common cold.

463
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,560
And it's that the elderly just can't handle viruses the same way as younger people do.

464
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,160
So they can actually die from the flu.

465
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,960
Just to make sure I understand what you're saying. They don't have to get bacterial super infection.

466
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:08,060
No, even with rhinovirus and the virus itself causes damage and then the immune response to the virus also causes damage.

467
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:15,060
So even with outside a kind of storm, you can kind of get immune mediated damage.

468
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,660
And I want to come back to Neur's point in a second, but I just want to go down this path a little further.

469
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,660
As you look at the damage from specifically SARS-CoV-2,

470
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,960
seems like a much worse virus in the sense that it causes much more direct damage to the pneumocyte.

471
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,260
So you now get much more direct damage to the end organ.

472
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,760
And that's not saying anything about all of the other disadvantages of it through its transmissibility.

473
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,960
Do we believe that at the immunologic response level,

474
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:56,360
it is eliciting a much more toxic autoimmune response or cytokine response than say influenza, which itself is quite nasty?

475
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:04,060
The coronavirus infects cells, including lung cells, and that causes direct damage from the virus.

476
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:09,460
But then the host response to the virus is good because it will get rid of the virus.

477
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:21,560
But if it gets excessive, you'll get cytokine storm, which will cause major life-threatening consequences independent of the virus.

478
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:30,560
But if you can enhance the ability of the host to sort of get control of the virus very quickly,

479
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:38,660
the thought will be you won't be susceptible to that cytokine storm and you'll stay with mild disease.

480
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:49,660
So based on the little bit that we know about the ability of a raphalog to enhance immunity through these early-stage clinical trials,

481
00:48:49,660 --> 00:49:04,860
and then based on what you know, based on these uncontrolled trials that have more relevant recent data because they're dealing with the virus of interest,

482
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:12,460
what are your best guesses about the particular places where each of these agents is exerting their benefits?

483
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:23,960
So starting with you, Joan, where do you think a raphalog has the greatest potential to reduce the risk of succumbing to COVID?

484
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:34,860
What we also see is that in people who get mTOR inhibitors, their innate antiviral gene expression is enhanced when they get a viral infection.

485
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:42,260
So what this suggests is early on, like as post-exposure prophylaxis or in a prevention mode,

486
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:52,260
the raphalogs or the mTOR inhibitors may have benefit by boosting the body's response that is defective as we get older to the virus

487
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,560
so we can clear it better so that we don't go on to get severe symptoms from the virus.

488
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:09,860
Okay. Does that suggest that, well, I want to come back to this because I want to talk about it in the context of RTB 101

489
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:16,060
and how you would think about, where I'm going to come back to, Joan, is going to be around how do you think about dosing this?

490
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:25,860
Is this something where we think about these as maintenance drugs that people probably ought to be on in anticipation of such a thing versus a drug that comes in from a treatment standpoint?

491
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,660
So while we park that thought near, let's go down this sort of same path on metformin.

492
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:42,360
So one thing that you suggested from the cohort that you just described in China is, first of all, the people taking metformin were disproportionately less severely ill.

493
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:49,560
So fewer people who take metformin wind up in the hospital and the ones that do end up doing better.

494
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Let me add to it that I've been looking for this literature and I've started my own study at Einstein

495
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,760
because I got emails from Spain and Italy from physicians who noticed the same on metformin.

496
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,260
So this is like January and February when they're hitting that first wave.

497
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:13,660
Right. They said, do you know, do I hear about that? And I beg them, you should publish.

498
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,160
I should say another thing and that kind of links to the mechanism.

499
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,260
There's a study that was published yesterday in MedRoxiv.

500
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:27,060
So it's study that was submitted, right, and not reviewed.

501
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:34,460
Okay. And in fact, when I'm reading this study, you can ask me questions there and I wouldn't know because they don't give enough details.

502
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:44,360
But they show two things that women on metformin have about 20, more than 20%, 21, 22% less mortality.

503
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,060
This is from Minnesota.

504
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,560
I'm sorry, this is mortality due to COVID-19 or all?

505
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:54,760
COVID-19, they had access to 6,000 patients through the University of Minnesota.

506
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,360
I'm sure they're all not all in Minnesota.

507
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,160
Access to 6,000 patients and they found that females on metformin have 21% less mortality.

508
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,660
Now, I don't know if those are only diabetic patients or it's only women on metformin.

509
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,560
I don't know what's the one here.

510
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Okay. But there was a sex-specific decrease in mortality.

511
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:26,760
But even more important, they had 80% decrease in peripheral, in plasma TNF-alpha levels.

512
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,060
That was also highly significant.

513
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:35,360
That kind of ties, I mean, I don't know why they measure only TNF-alpha or if they measured only TNF-alpha,

514
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,560
but there's a kind of a link to the inflammatory response.

515
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,260
Again, let's think about that.

516
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,460
Is there any indication, by the way, that metformin alters ACE2 expression?

517
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,360
No, there's no indication of that.

518
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,760
I actually put ACE2 and metformin to see.

519
00:52:52,760 --> 00:53:00,360
The reason early, one of the first studies that came on drug in COVID was an in silico analysis

520
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,060
that put 76 drugs or something like that, including rapamycin and metformin,

521
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:12,260
as potential interacting with the COVID ACE2 pathway.

522
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:20,660
Basically, the fact that there isn't some apparent link between metformin and its ability to alter the tissue target,

523
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:28,260
it would seem that any benefits that you're describing that turn out to be real are either based on immune enhancement or immune modulation.

524
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:35,160
Either you're turning up the immune system when you want it to be turned up or toning it down when you need it to be toned down, correct?

525
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,360
Yeah, as long as you don't say it's the same mechanism that you turn on and off.

526
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,060
I think...

527
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,360
No, no, no, no, that's my point.

528
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,460
These are different.

529
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,860
And what I'm really trying to tease out is, first of all, is that the right way to think about it?

530
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,760
That's how I would think about it.

531
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,460
Secondly, if so, which of those two do you think it's acting on?

532
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,960
Well, I think both.

533
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:01,460
That's why I made the point that at least this study and some of the things I hear from Europe suggest that less people in metformin are hospitalized.

534
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,160
So they get their immunities better, right?

535
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:11,860
And then when they're in their hospital, less of them go into an inflammatory response.

536
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,460
And the time course is different.

537
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,660
Remember, it's when you get the disease and the inflammatory thing is like five days later, right?

538
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Did the Chinese data that you referred to that were published about a week and a half ago, obviously, your analysis suggests the first part of that.

539
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:36,760
Your analysis, which is looking at the proportion of patients in China taking metformin versus those hospitalized, would suggest the immune enhanced piece of that.

540
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:47,160
Do you have data beyond the obvious, which are the survival data that suggests that you actually saw attenuation of a pathologic immune response?

541
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,260
For example, did they measure cytokines in the Chinese cohort?

542
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,160
No.

543
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,760
It was just the outcomes.

544
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,760
No, it was just the outcomes.

545
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:02,060
Again, I want to say I'm interpreting lack of data to suggest that maybe not enough for the hospital.

546
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:07,460
But I don't know that maybe in one, only 30% take metformin, right?

547
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,960
And the others do not.

548
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,360
So let's not make too much out of it.

549
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:20,560
I used it more to say that we really need to look at both issues, the immune response and the cytokines.

550
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,060
And then the third is the ability of the body to sustain severe disease.

551
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,160
You're going to say something, Joan, on that.

552
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:33,960
Oh, I was even wondering, in someone who's critically ill, would they not receive metformin anyway?

553
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,860
Would it just be DC discontinued and not see a patient?

554
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,360
I want to say about that.

555
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,860
You know, we've done this study.

556
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:49,560
We talked about it before, Miles, where we gave metformin for six weeks and then crossed over to elderly people, crossed over.

557
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,960
We were taking biopsies and we're doing transcripts two weeks off and then six weeks.

558
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,960
And there was an effect of metformin.

559
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:04,760
And those who got metformin first, on the placebo results, there was still lingering effect of metformin.

560
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,660
So I think, okay, you stop metformin and you should.

561
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:15,360
And we shouldn't say people should get metformin to prevent COVID, not to treat COVID.

562
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:22,660
But I think that when you so substantially change the aging phenotype of a cell,

563
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,160
it's not that you stop and it goes back to old.

564
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,060
So I think it's okay.

565
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,060
Five days later, it can still be effective.

566
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,960
Yeah.

567
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:47,060
So, Joan, what is your take now on basically the role that a rapologue could play in the prevention of mortality from COVID-19 along these two axes?

568
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:53,160
Let's posit that a rapologue plays no direct role in inhibiting the virus from getting into a cell.

569
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,560
It's not going to play a role on that pathway.

570
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:06,560
So instead, we focus on these two immune properties, the ability to enhance immunity, to fight the virus versus the ability to tone down the immune response when it becomes over exuberant.

571
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,160
How do you see those two playing out?

572
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:17,860
First, there is some data that mTOR inhibitors may interact directly with COVID and inhibit replication.

573
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,560
Meaning the virus, the SARS virus.

574
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,160
The virus.

575
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:34,560
There may be a direct antiviral effect that's seen with CMV and BK virus in transplant patients where they have lower CMV and BK viral infections probably because of the direct effect of mTOR inhibition because the virus needs it.

576
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,160
That's interesting.

577
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,360
Is there any evidence of that in the other four coronaviruses that commonly occur?

578
00:57:40,360 --> 00:58:00,960
No, but to Neer's point, there have been a bunch of transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, big data analyses that have identified mTOR and rapologs as potential drugs that would interfere with the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

579
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,360
Okay.

580
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,060
And Joan, in your study, you also had less coronavirus as an out-

581
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,460
Right.

582
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,360
So that's what we think is probably not a direct effect on the virus.

583
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,660
That's immune function.

584
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,260
Okay.

585
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:22,060
I was getting before in studies where we've looked at laboratory-confirmed respiratory tract infections.

586
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:30,260
In our phase two study, we looked at 17 different viruses that caused respiratory tract infections in older people.

587
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,560
And four of them were the common coronaviruses.

588
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:44,760
And what we saw was that mTOR inhibitors upregulated antiviral gene expression and reduced the incidence and severity of coronavirus infections.

589
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,160
SARS-CoV-2 wasn't circulating at that time.

590
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,660
Right.

591
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:59,860
And if I recall, Joan, and this would be just as good a time as I need to go back and talk about RTB101, which was the drug you're talking about, but it was the coronaviruses had a huge difference between drug and placebo,

592
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,460
as did the rhinovirus you've already alluded to, along with RSV.

593
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,460
And I think one of the influenza strains, right?

594
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,160
Not both.

595
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:07,660
Right.

596
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,560
So let's do that.

597
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:26,060
Let's detour back for a moment and talk about what came out of the RAD001 trial, which is the one we talked about in 2014 that showed enhancement to flu vaccination.

598
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:38,960
And then what this new compound RTB101 is, you've already made one reference to it when you casually mentioned that it's a ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor as opposed to an allosteric inhibitor.

599
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,660
You might have to explain to people what that difference is, but we've now talked about it twice.

600
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,360
So I think it is worth an explanation and I think it does become germane.

601
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,960
And then let's talk about the difference between the 2A and the 2B study.

602
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,160
Sure.

603
00:59:51,460 --> 01:00:02,460
In that first study where we just looked at raphologs to enhance flu vaccine response, we noticed in a clinical trial, you always collect adverse events reported by people.

604
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:12,760
And we noticed that the people who are getting the mTOR, the rapholog, were reporting fewer respiratory tract infection as adverse events and they weren't flu.

605
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,360
They were just all common respiratory tract infections.

606
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:23,360
So it made us think, hey, if this is enhancing immune function, it's not going to be enhancing just the response to a flu vaccine.

607
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,660
It's probably going to enhance the response to all sorts of different pathogens.

608
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:39,460
So in our phase 2, we said, let's not only look at vaccine response, but let's actually look at infections that occur to see, are we decreasing infection rates?

609
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:56,060
And in that phase 2, we also said, if mTOR inhibitors really do enhance immune function, this shouldn't be specific to a rapholog, which is a drug that changes the confirmation of mTOR and that's how it inhibits it.

610
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:09,360
And we said, other kinds of mTOR inhibitors, which block the catalytic site, mTOR is an enzyme and they block the catalytic site, they should also have benefits if this is really an mTOR-mediated effect.

611
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:17,360
So we looked at a rapholog and we looked at a catalytic inhibitor called RTB101 and we looked at the two together.

612
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,460
And we looked not only at vaccine response, but we looked at infection rates for a whole year.

613
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:31,560
Now RTB101 also has some PI3 kinase-inhabitory properties as well, doesn't it?

614
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:39,360
So in a biochemical assay with, you know, an isolated enzyme, it inhibits PI3 kinase.

615
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:45,460
And Novartis made this drug in the hopes that it would be a dual mTOR PI3 kinase inhibitor for cancer patients.

616
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:52,860
But when you bring it in cells and in humans, you need much higher concentrations of RTB to inhibit PI3 kinase.

617
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:59,260
And at the concentrations that are achievable in the clinic, it's mostly just a torque 1 inhibitor.

618
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,360
It doesn't even get concentrations easily high enough to inhibit torque 2.

619
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:12,260
So there's two mTOR complexes that contain mTOR and this is most potent inhibitor of the torque 1 complex.

620
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:21,360
Now you achieved that in the first study by using the rapholog dosed intermittently at the lower doses.

621
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:27,860
So I know the higher dose, which was 20 milligrams, you probably still get some C2 inhibition.

622
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:32,460
But at the 0.5 daily, you probably don't get much.

623
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:38,160
At the 5 weekly, you're probably mostly just hitting 1, correct, and not hitting 2.

624
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:44,660
Exactly. Like we didn't see any real hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia, which are the torque 2 side effects.

625
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:54,960
So is it safe to say that at the doses you give RTB101, it has comparable mTORC1 inhibition to RAD001 at 5 milligrams weekly?

626
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,460
Would that be the closest comparison?

627
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,260
Probably more 0.5 milligram daily because we give RTB every day.

628
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Got it. Okay.

629
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:07,860
And the reason you give it daily is of course the selectivity, the catalytic selectivity.

630
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,160
And also it has a shorter half-life. Its half-life is 4 to 6 hours.

631
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:18,960
So if you dose it once a day, it's inhibiting torque 1 for a shorter period of time than a verilimus.

632
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,860
And if you give it twice a day, it's a little bit more persistent inhibition.

633
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:35,460
Now explain, were there two studies, one that was combining these two, RAD001 plus RTB101, and then there was, was the protector study just RTB101 by itself?

634
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,660
Correct.

635
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:42,960
So we had two phase two studies looking at RTB alone and in combination with a verilimus.

636
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:47,860
In the first study, the combination looked the best when you dose it for just 6 weeks.

637
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:55,360
In the second study, when we extended dosing for 16 weeks in a sicker population, the RTB alone was better.

638
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:00,660
So in both studies, RTB alone decreased respiratory tract infections.

639
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,560
And in one, the combination did and the other, it didn't.

640
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:12,460
So the study that did not meet its hard outcome was RTB101 alone, but not for vaccine response.

641
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,060
Was it for, it was for total respiratory tract infections?

642
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:21,360
No, and that's part of the problem for our phase three study.

643
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:28,160
The FDA said we don't want an end point of laboratory confirmed respiratory tract infections where we had seen the benefit.

644
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,560
And they said people don't care.

645
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,160
This was pre-COVID-19.

646
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:39,560
If a respiratory tract infection is laboratory confirmed, all they care about is how they feel and function and that's their symptoms.

647
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:50,060
So what you have to do in the phase three is show you can decrease respiratory symptoms that are consistent with a respiratory tract infection, but don't have to be due to a respiratory tract infection.

648
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:55,060
And we couldn't decrease the total respiratory symptoms that the elderly have.

649
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,060
What it does look like we did was decrease the severity of the symptoms.

650
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,560
But you weren't powered to detect that or were you?

651
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,560
If you're looking at the laboratory confirmed infections, we were underpowered because there weren't very many.

652
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:14,560
I think what the mTOR inhibitors are doing is not stopping people from getting infected.

653
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,060
But if you get infected, there's a better immune response and your symptoms will be milder.

654
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:26,560
Yeah, I mean, Nira, I've heard you say that because I want to come back and really talk about tame in some detail.

655
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:36,560
But you know, it's a bit of a blessing in disguise that you didn't start tame a year ago because obviously it would have been interrupted as a result of this.

656
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,560
I mean, all the clinical trials that I've been following closely have been interrupted by this.

657
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:49,060
I follow very closely, for example, the clinical trials looking at liquid biopsies in cancer and all of a sudden these these trials are completely interrupted.

658
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,060
So there's that there's that component to it.

659
01:05:51,060 --> 01:06:01,060
Of course, the flip side of that is depending on how large the study is, you might have actually inadvertently got another look at an indication you weren't necessarily thinking about.

660
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:21,560
And I guess my question for you, Joan, is do you have enough subjects from the protector where there might be some lingering benefits or do you think that that window has closed and there's no benefit to going back and looking at the patients who received active drug in protector to see if they had any downstream benefits in terms of protection from SARS-CoV-2?

661
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,560
We haven't even thought about it.

662
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
You're the first person to suggest it.

663
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,560
No, it's a great thought.

664
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,560
When did those patients finish enrolling?

665
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,060
In November, last November.

666
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,060
Like November of 19.

667
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,060
November of 19.

668
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,560
And those were in New Zealand too?

669
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,060
New Zealand and Australia.

670
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:45,060
So New Zealand doesn't have the COVID yet, right?

671
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,060
No, it had it, but it...

672
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:50,060
It was pretty mild. They were very well controlled.

673
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:56,560
But we also had Australia. I don't know how things are going in Australia. So we also had sites in Australia.

674
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:18,060
I mean, I guess it would be an interesting exploration because again, this is one of those things where you now wonder if you repeat the protector study either as it was done with RTB 101 or with RAD 001 or in combination, but you now do it specifically for this virus, do you get a different outcome?

675
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,560
And I do think, you know, we're learning as we get more and more data.

676
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:28,060
I think we're actually doing a trial in nursing homes now, looking at severity and not just incidents.

677
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:37,060
Because I think what's happening is once you get infected, you're better able to upregulate that interferon induced innate immune response.

678
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:41,560
And my guess is that's why you're having less severe symptoms.

679
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,560
It's not happening before you get infected.

680
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:56,060
I want to make, I think, an important comment because we spend time and Peter, you try to really look at those drugs, apropos mechanisms of COVID-19.

681
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:04,060
But I think that what we are trying to sell out there is that we are reinforcing...

682
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,060
We're not fighting the virus. We're reinforcing the host.

683
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,060
Okay. We're defending the host.

684
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:18,560
And the claim is that what we sow to influenza is relevant to COVID because after all, what's the difference between the people who are dying?

685
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,560
It's their age, right? It's the biology of aging that is different.

686
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,560
By the way, you previously said multi-morbidity.

687
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,560
For me, multi-morbidity is how old you are biologically. That's all it is.

688
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:36,560
Okay. 65% of the people have more than two diseases and 65% have more.

689
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,060
Chronological and biological age are different.

690
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:48,560
So I really think that part of what we have to discuss is the fact that we are defending the older individual.

691
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,060
Whether there's something specific that can help is really great.

692
01:08:53,060 --> 01:09:02,060
But this goes not only to the immunity. It doesn't go to the inflammation, but goes also to how do we develop vaccines now?

693
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:09,560
Because the vaccines that I'm seeing developing are not considering the older host in several ways.

694
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,560
The New York Times today says that they even are going to test it over the age of 65.

695
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,060
Okay. I think the vaccine is going to be such a trap.

696
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:28,060
And the way to go over that is either realizing how to do it with the biology of aging and there's a way I'm ready to discuss with you some mechanisms.

697
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:34,060
Or the elderly have to be on metformin or Apolog in order to get their immunity going.

698
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:40,560
I think this is the next disaster. If we have a vaccine that doesn't protect the elderly, we did nothing.

699
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,060
Let's talk a little bit about it. This is a topic that's near and dear to my heart.

700
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:50,060
I'm getting involved in a study that's looking at a question from a slightly different angle, which is what's the durability of immune response?

701
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:57,060
Historically, as you guys probably know, coronaviruses are not exactly the most robust at inducing durable immunity.

702
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,060
In fact, if you remain immune for a year, that's considered reasonable.

703
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:14,060
This poses a huge problem, which is what if after all the trouble of getting SARS-CoV-2, getting sick with COVID-19 bouncing back, you only have a year of immunity?

704
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:24,060
The probability then that a vaccine is going to provide lifelong immunity, the way we get it from several of our most famous vaccines, seems quite low.

705
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,060
Now you're in a situation of saying, well, gosh, what is the efficacy of a vaccine going to look like?

706
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:34,060
Is this going to look like a 30% efficacious vaccine that you're going to need every year?

707
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:39,060
Is it going to need to be supplemented by monoclonal antibodies in the most high-risk populations?

708
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:44,060
I think we're all basically saying the same thing, which is there's a real risk here.

709
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,060
So taken in order, what is the probability this virus is going away?

710
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,060
Zero. I mean, it's somewhere between zero and epsilon.

711
01:10:51,060 --> 01:11:01,060
But the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 magically mutates its way out of impacting humans is so low, it would be foolish to entertain that.

712
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:08,060
So we now have a fifth coronavirus that's here to stay, except unlike its other four cousins, this one can really whack you.

713
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:13,060
And then let's assume we can make some safe and efficacious vaccines.

714
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:18,060
Are they really likely to keep you protected for five years, 10 years or more?

715
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:23,060
Even without the genetic drift, based on what we know of other coronaviruses, that seems unlikely.

716
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,060
Again, we're going to do a study to try to answer that question.

717
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:37,060
But I think we do have to get ready for something that says, oh, man, we could be in a really unpleasant place where we never really naturally acquire herd immunity.

718
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:44,060
And if that's true, not to fear monger, it means we need a better strategy around immune enhancement.

719
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:47,060
And that's sort of my general take on this.

720
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:50,060
Would you guys tone that down or ramp it up?

721
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:54,060
I think it's quite a reasonable stance.

722
01:11:54,060 --> 01:12:02,060
And I think finding things that help generate persistent immunity is going to be important.

723
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,060
Especially for the vulnerable population.

724
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:13,060
I mean, that's the part that I think is really frustrating, is you were all struggling to come to grips with, well, what is the implication of this for school kids,

725
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:18,060
where the restrictions seem so impossible to manage that it seems ridiculous, right?

726
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:26,060
Like a seventh grader shouldn't have to be completely quarantined in the manner that we would think about quarantining a 70-year-old.

727
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:33,060
So we have to be able to now think about immune-targeted therapies for the most immune vulnerable.

728
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,060
I mean, I guess, Joan, how do you now think about juggling these things?

729
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,060
Because I know that prior to COVID, you guys were already looking at an indication in Parkinson's disease, right?

730
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:46,060
Help me understand from a preclinical standpoint what that was about.

731
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:56,060
But then also, how do you now think about juggling resources, including time and just cognitive bandwidth around Parkinson's,

732
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:03,060
which was sort of the path you were on, with now something that seems even more pressing and maybe even closer.

733
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,060
I don't know if you think this is closer just based on the data.

734
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:17,060
We have just reams of data now of using mTOR inhibitors to enhance immune function and older people's safety data

735
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:24,060
and data on incidence, severity of respiratory tract infections, and a lot of biomarker data to start understanding

736
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,060
what is actually going on in the immune system.

737
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,060
So we're farthest ahead there.

738
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:36,060
When we used to go and try to raise money for doing this kind of research, investors would just,

739
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,060
we'd mentioned respiratory tract infections, and they would start to yawn.

740
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:48,060
Nobody cared. They cared about cancer, and they cared about rare diseases, but they thought respiratory tract infections were boring.

741
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:57,060
The nice thing about COVID-19 is it's making it obvious why enhancing immune function is a really important area

742
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:02,060
and giving us a little bit more bandwidth to see if we can get it right.

743
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:11,060
For the Parkinson's disease, it turns out neurodegenerative diseases, there's an accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.

744
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:17,060
And if you enhance autophagy in preclinical models, that has benefit.

745
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:21,060
I mentioned, raphologs aren't great at inducing autophagy.

746
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:27,060
RTB at high doses is very good, but it's hard to achieve those concentrations in the brain.

747
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:35,060
If you use the two of those together, you can lower the concentration of RTB that's needed to induce autophagy,

748
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,060
so you don't have to get so much across the blood-brain barrier.

749
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:44,060
And that was the reason we did the trial of that combination in Parkinson's disease.

750
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,060
Now, Matt Kaberlin wrote a really elegant piece, gosh, it's probably been a year ago now, where he said,

751
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:58,060
and I thought it was just great, but I'm obviously biased, that why in the world are we not pouring more resources into raphologs and Alzheimer's disease?

752
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:06,060
And he basically gave the argument you're giving, which is when you look at their potential to both ameliorate

753
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:15,060
and potentially clean up a lot of the protein aggregation, disaggregation that's occurring in the CNS, it seems like almost a crime.

754
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:21,060
When you look at some of the cockamamie ideas, especially that are being proposed to treat Alzheimer's disease,

755
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,060
that brings me to a question for you about this.

756
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:32,060
What is the state of the art of understanding the role of metformin in the risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease beyond the obvious?

757
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:39,060
In other words, anything that normalizes glucose and insulin is going to have a direct benefit on dementia.

758
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:50,060
And you mentioned MCI earlier, but do we have any other data that suggests that metformin should be a part of the toolkit to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease?

759
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:59,060
Not directly. There are several other funded NIH projects that will take a couple of years to look at people with MCI.

760
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:11,060
The two studies that looked at MCI metformin for six months and one for nine months had decreased deterioration in some of the domains of Alzheimer's.

761
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:17,060
For both of them, name recalls, which is a real problem for me.

762
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,060
Are you saying you're an MCI in here?

763
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,060
No, I'm on metformin.

764
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:28,060
But I think it's a common problem to some of us.

765
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:31,060
The Alzheimer's is more complicated.

766
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:37,060
The good studies all showed that people with metformin have less Alzheimer's.

767
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:44,060
There are some studies that don't show that, and there are two reasons for that, or possible explanation.

768
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,060
One, they're from China.

769
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:57,060
Either it's not similar mechanisms, genetics and environmental interaction somehow, possibly.

770
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:20,060
But more likely is that, think about it this way, you really have to do it good because if metformin delays mortality by 20%, that means you'll get more people on metformin lingering longer.

771
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:26,060
And it might be just that effect that all of a sudden the people with Alzheimer's are hanging around longer.

772
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:39,060
So those studies, it's kind of why we need clinical studies and not associate studies because they're so codependent, dependency of things that we're looking at.

773
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,060
That's a great point.

774
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:47,060
What have you two ever discussed about the combination in humans of metformin and rapulogues?

775
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,060
What are your thoughts on that?

776
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,060
Are these drugs that are accretive?

777
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,060
Are these drugs that should never be combined?

778
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,060
I mean, I'll just share personally my experience.

779
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,060
I've taken both together.

780
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,060
So, so near knows all this stuff, Jonah.

781
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
I started taking metformin in 2010.

782
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:06,060
That's when I sort of became pretty convinced about the data.

783
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:12,060
I started taking rapamycin in, I want to say 2018.

784
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,060
It's been about two years.

785
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:22,060
That was a bigger thing for me to jump, but I stopped taking metformin around the same time, though not because I thought one shouldn't be on one side.

786
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,060
One shouldn't be on one or the other.

787
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:28,060
And near, I want to come back and talk about why I stopped taking metformin.

788
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:30,060
So see if you can talk me into taking it again.

789
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,060
I don't want to give you all my reasons why I stopped.

790
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:37,060
But what are your thoughts on how these drugs would combine in humans?

791
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,060
Well, for me, it's simple.

792
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:44,060
Look, as you already know, we're trying to advance the field.

793
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,060
And the reason I chose metformin, it's not because it was the best drug.

794
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:56,060
I think rapamycin should be better drug, but it's because we didn't want to kill anyone on the road to success.

795
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,060
That's really easy.

796
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:06,060
And I think combining metformin and rapamycin is like just, I mean, the rapamycin part is the one that we want to be careful with.

797
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:10,060
But on theory, look, that's where it's going.

798
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,060
Let's say tame hands, okay?

799
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:19,060
And let's say the FDA agrees that aging can be prevented, age-related disease can be prevented.

800
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:22,060
And everybody can take metformin because it's so cheap.

801
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:30,060
I think the next stage is combination of drugs, better drugs, timeline, different timeline.

802
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,060
When is the best time to start rapamycin?

803
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,060
When is the best time to start metformin?

804
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,060
Cenolytics, we don't want to start when you're 20 years old.

805
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,060
There's not an obstinescence cell, right?

806
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,060
So there will be a lot of calculations.

807
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,060
So I'm not against that.

808
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:53,060
I'm trying, I'm focused on achieving a goal that the FDA, you know, metformin is a tool to pave the road for an indication.

809
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,060
That's all I'm trying to do.

810
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,060
In the meantime, I'm a believer in metformin.

811
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,060
Tell me where we are with tame.

812
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,060
Joan, will you remember that I want to come back and hear your opinion about the combination?

813
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,060
Because I do.

814
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:06,060
And really, I'm asking from a mechanistic question.

815
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:16,060
Nier, I appreciate your point, which I think is the voice of reason and wisdom, which says by doing them sequentially in parallel like this, we can risk stratify a bit better.

816
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:19,060
But I'm also just interested in just sort of speculating mechanistically.

817
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:28,060
But Nier, give us kind of a brief update on tame and help me understand, by the way, metformin, as you said, is a free drug effectively.

818
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,060
Who has a financial interest in this?

819
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,060
I mean, there's no drug company that could be interested in this, right?

820
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,060
It has to be sort of philanthropic or NIH driven, correct?

821
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,060
First of all, I will quote you on what you said.

822
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:44,060
I feel totally lucky now that somehow metformin was delayed.

823
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:48,060
It was very frustrating, but it's almost we get help of God.

824
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,060
The second help, I hope, is this COVID-19 story.

825
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,060
So we're lucky in a way.

826
01:20:55,060 --> 01:21:06,060
The company that's going to give us the metformin, which is cheap, and the placebo, which is expensive, is Merck Germany.

827
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:12,060
Merck Germany holds the world license for metformin.

828
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,060
So they're contributing it, which is not a simple contribution.

829
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:22,060
Part of the problem we take is that there's no commercial interest.

830
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:29,060
So nobody was going to pay for a phase three-like study, right, for five years.

831
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:36,060
And the NIH, which is a longer story, and I don't think I told all of it last time,

832
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:43,060
but the NIH bottom line found that it's too risky to do the study.

833
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:47,060
The major comment, what if it doesn't work?

834
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,060
Well, if we knew it would work, we didn't have to do the study.

835
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:57,060
Interestingly, we know it works separately for each one of the age-related diseases and mortality.

836
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,060
So I don't know what chance we were looking.

837
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,060
And there's also politics of the NIH, I have to tell you.

838
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,060
There's also politics there.

839
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,060
So this is what we're doing.

840
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:19,060
American Federation of Aging Research has nonprofit people, people from nonprofit and non-industry

841
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,060
that are supporting TAME.

842
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,060
In fact, we're expected to get the money any day now.

843
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:29,060
Sorry. What is the total budget for TAME going to be?

844
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:36,060
So we have a study, $78 million, that was our initially budget.

845
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:42,060
And now we have three pockets because we had three specific aims.

846
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,060
The primary outcome is the FDA outcome.

847
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,060
It's prevention of age-related disease and mortality.

848
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:55,060
Okay. This is about $35 million, and this is the A FAR grant.

849
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:58,060
The second part is biomarkers.

850
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:05,060
We want to make sure that we know what are the biomarkers for metformin action and for aging.

851
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:14,060
And this was funded by the NIA, and we'll get the money once the TAME is funded

852
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:19,060
in order to take plasma and blood and DNA and everything

853
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:24,060
and be able to do omics and other things and find biomarkers.

854
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:29,060
The third part could come later, and this is the geriatric part.

855
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:37,060
You know, how many hospitalizations and what's the ADL and the frailty index and things like that,

856
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:43,060
we have enough power to do it at the end of looking at people at the end

857
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:48,060
and people with metformin and without metformin, but of course, it will be better to start at baseline.

858
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:51,060
But we're not funded for that yet.

859
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,060
And how many subjects in each arm?

860
01:23:53,060 --> 01:24:00,060
Well, we are discussing now, we are planning 3,000, our power is based on 3,000 subjects,

861
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:05,060
but we might have enough money to increase to 3,500 subjects

862
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:09,060
with the hope that it might accelerate our result.

863
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,060
It's not necessarily so.

864
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:20,060
It's possible that you need the time that you need, but it's 3,000 subjects now, but could be more later.

865
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:27,060
And does your budget permit for serology testing or other things to now include potential,

866
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,060
given that your subjects, I assume, are older,

867
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:35,060
you have a beautiful population to also study the effects of metformin on immune function,

868
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,060
specifically with respect to COVID-19?

869
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:46,060
Right. So the way we organize the study, and this is also in negotiation with the NIH,

870
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:52,060
we will have ancillary studies that will be reviewed.

871
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:57,060
Sometimes you need only 250 people, so it can be in one center.

872
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,060
We have 14 centers.

873
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:03,060
And part of the examples we gave is actually immunity.

874
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,060
That was the example we had, it was against the flu.

875
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:11,060
But of course, now we're talking about if we start before immunization,

876
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:20,060
we can see the response, and then for COVID-19 the next year, and see the response.

877
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:23,060
Joan, back to you on this other question then.

878
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:30,060
What do you think about the idea of could there potentially be a benefit in combining metformin with a rappalog?

879
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,060
Knowing what we know now about the potential pillars,

880
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:38,060
there's not a huge amount of overlap, at least in the most fundamentally important pillars.

881
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:48,060
I mean, the two really clear things that rappalogs are doing is impairing synthesis and probably inhibiting SASPs.

882
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,060
I mean, those two seem undeniable.

883
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:56,060
And then there's probably some autophagy depending on the way that you inhibit and or the tissue.

884
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:01,060
So how does that fit with the double down effect of the metabolic side of metformin,

885
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:08,060
along with the potential increase of ROS and some of these other benefits around inflammation that come from metformin?

886
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:11,060
Is there a synergy with these things?

887
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,060
Yeah, I don't think we know enough.

888
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:19,060
As I recall from the ITP study where they use both, the effect was driven by one center,

889
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:25,060
but I had seen that data early before the whole study was finished.

890
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:33,060
I have done analyses of people who are getting the rappalogs or RTP who are on or off metformin just to see if I could see a difference,

891
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:37,060
but we're way underpowered, so I can't say anything yet.

892
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:44,060
And you may understand the biochemical rationale for using the two together.

893
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:50,060
But I do think, to Neer's point, every drug that has a biologic effect has a side effect.

894
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:55,060
And so if you use two drugs that have a biologic effect, you're just going to get more side effects.

895
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:59,060
So you've got to make sure that the benefits outweigh the risks.

896
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,060
Let me give you an example.

897
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:13,060
If both of them are enhancing autophagy, which is good and it's synergistic, but the patient has cancer, then it's when we want to stop autophagy.

898
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,060
But Peter, can I ask you a question?

899
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,060
I love hearing people are taking rappalogs or metformin.

900
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,060
What did you notice on each of them?

901
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,060
Yeah. Why did you stop?

902
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,060
Sure, sure.

903
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:30,060
So, well, as I said, I started metformin in 2010, the spring of 2010, May of 2010.

904
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,060
I remember it very well, actually.

905
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:37,060
And I stupidly just started at 2,000 milligrams a day.

906
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,060
I didn't escalate the dose.

907
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:44,060
So I remember having lots of nausea for about two months.

908
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:48,060
And again, some people, if they just go straight to a high dose, they do feel nauseous.

909
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,060
Others, usually when I put patients on it now, we titrate them.

910
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:57,060
We go 500 at night, then 500 BID, 1,000 at night, 500 in the morning, et cetera.

911
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,060
So that was my first.

912
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,060
Beyond that, I didn't even notice I was taking it.

913
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,060
So never a side effect again.

914
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,060
So why did I stop it in 2018?

915
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:12,060
In 2018, I started to very, very closely track my lactate levels during exercise.

916
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:19,060
And in particular, I was tracking my lactate levels during a type of exercise called zone 2 exercise,

917
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:27,060
which is when you're basically trying to see how much work you can do under purely aerobic conditions.

918
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:34,060
The definition of this is actually how much work you can do while keeping lactate below 2 millimole.

919
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:38,060
I used to do a lot of lactate testing on myself when I was an athlete.

920
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,060
So I was familiar with what these levels looked like.

921
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:44,060
And I was kind of surprised at how high my lactate levels were, even at baseline.

922
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:48,060
I was walking around at a lactate level of 1.6 millimole.

923
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:51,060
Now it would dip a little bit when I would start exercising.

924
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:58,060
But I was realizing that I just had higher lactate levels than I wanted to.

925
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,060
And I thought about it, and I was like, wait, this is obvious.

926
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,060
I'm taking a mitochondrial toxin.

927
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,060
Of course my lactate levels are going to be higher.

928
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:07,060
So then I did the experiment.

929
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,060
And I did all this sort of talking with a friend of mine, Inigo Sanmalan,

930
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:15,060
who's also been on the podcast of stopping metformin and starting it again

931
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,060
just to see if we could reproduce the effect.

932
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:22,060
And sure enough, it was clearly the metformin that was allowing my lactate levels.

933
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,060
And you do this at a fixed power level.

934
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:31,060
So on an ergometer, you would just say, look, at this many watts or this many miles per hour on a treadmill,

935
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:36,060
you could watch your lactate level go up and down as a function of metformin.

936
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:41,060
And then we looked at a couple of studies, and you saw that, look,

937
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:46,060
there were some things that metformin was blunting with respect to exercise.

938
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:49,060
Some things I didn't care much about, but you could certainly see, I think,

939
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:53,060
in the master's trial you saw, and I'd love for you to talk about this trial a bit,

940
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:57,060
some blunting of hypertrophy, so muscle mass,

941
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,060
though I don't think they looked at muscle function.

942
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:03,060
So maybe it wasn't having any impact on muscle function.

943
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,060
They looked. They hid it well.

944
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,060
Did they look?

945
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:10,060
Yeah. So we have a paper in review now that, by the way,

946
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:16,060
it took us a lot of time because the authors disagreed on the interpretation of the same data.

947
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Joan, it was everybody exercised, half of them with metformin and half without.

948
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:25,060
And they got a grant because they said, it's going to be synergistic.

949
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,060
You know, through AMP kinase, we're going to have better effect.

950
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:32,060
The people with metformin and exercise are going to do better.

951
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:38,060
And what happened, the people that were exercising with metformin had significantly not...

952
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:43,060
They all increased muscle mass, but they had less muscle mass.

953
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:50,060
In the supplement, they show you that the function was actually the same.

954
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:57,060
In other words, gram of muscle, when you're on metformin, is doing better work

955
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,060
than gram of muscle when you exercise only. It was a little bit hidden.

956
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:07,060
And that's why I took this study and I said, I want to see the transcript.

957
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:12,060
And the transcript all showed what you kind of missed in this whole idea.

958
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:17,060
Metformin is decreasing AMP tour and exercise is increasing AMP tour.

959
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:26,060
So all the AMP tour transcripts were higher in the exercise only group and were blunted by metformin.

960
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:29,060
And were these elderly or young?

961
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,060
75 years old.

962
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,060
75.

963
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,060
Yeah, all elderly.

964
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:37,060
Because there's other papers where AMP tour inhibitors don't decrease muscle mass in older people.

965
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:40,060
So that's, you know, it doesn't seem to...

966
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,060
Just a minute. Let me just tell you the main result.

967
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:49,060
516 of the transcript were different between them. They were only a metformin group.

968
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:57,060
And those were the transcripts that we want to see with aging, such as transcripts for autophagy.

969
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:08,060
So basically what I'm saying in this elderly population, what metformin did is kept the young profile of the muscle.

970
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:14,060
And at the end, yeah, maybe you had less muscle, but the same function.

971
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:22,060
But you gained by metformin protecting 500 transcripts that are aging transcripts.

972
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:27,060
And then what do you make of the changes in aerobic efficiency?

973
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:33,060
Wasn't there another study? And I was thinking while you were talking, I could find it and I just can't find it.

974
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,060
I think it's the Canopka, right?

975
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:38,060
From Colorado, a group in Colorado. I forgot their name.

976
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:44,060
But what you said about lactic acid, I saw it in my first study with defronzo.

977
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:51,060
All our patients increased their lactic acid. Some of them above two, some of them below two, all of them increased.

978
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:56,060
And the increase in lactic acid was associated with better glucose control.

979
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,060
Interesting, yeah.

980
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
It's one thing to have lactic acidosis.

981
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:05,060
And to be clear, my concern was not at all lactic acidosis.

982
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:11,060
It was, are my mitochondria less efficient as someone who is exercising so much?

983
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:14,060
So it was really my concern was this.

984
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:17,060
I still have many patients who are taking metformin.

985
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:24,060
My thinking became, if you are metabolically healthy and if you are exercising to a maximum degree,

986
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:30,060
if you are maximizing the dose of exercise, is there additional benefit that comes from metformin?

987
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:37,060
Or is this a drug that is better reserved for people who are not taking the maximum dose of the drug known as exercise?

988
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:39,060
That basically is my question.

989
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:47,060
My answer is there is an independent effect of metformin when you're exercising, at least if you're those people.

990
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:51,060
And that's why I'm taking metformin and I'm exercising daily.

991
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:55,060
And when you say those people near you mean people above a certain age?

992
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:59,060
Yeah, those were a group that were above 70 years old.

993
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:03,060
The study that I'm telling you, I don't know it 40, 50 and stuff.

994
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:06,060
And I don't know about maximal exercising, right?

995
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:12,060
I didn't describe a study that you were the example of the patient.

996
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:16,060
And what dose is tame going to be testing one gram twice a day?

997
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:19,060
1500 milligram of extended release.

998
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:24,060
They'll get three tablets every morning or every night, whatever they choose.

999
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:27,060
300, 500 milligram extended release pills.

1000
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,060
And is that what you take personally as 1500 milligrams?

1001
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:31,060
Yes.

1002
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,060
Okay.

1003
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:41,060
So then going back to your question, Joan, when I started Rapa Mice and I think I've talked about this maybe even with Lloyd on that podcast.

1004
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:47,060
I knew I wanted to take Rapa Mice and going back to 2011, 2012.

1005
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:56,060
Again, based on just the data in the mice, the yeast, the flies, the worms, my biggest fear was immune suppression.

1006
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:59,060
Your paper comes along in 2014.

1007
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,060
Now all of a sudden I'm feeling much more emboldened.

1008
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,060
Still not sure how to dose it.

1009
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:11,060
But again, if your paper suggested anything, five milligrams once a week was a pretty good place to start.

1010
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:19,060
Then triangulating from some of the data in Matt Caberlin's dogs and some other folks, I sort of arrived at,

1011
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:23,060
I think I arrived at six milligrams once a week was the right place to go.

1012
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,060
What wasn't clear to me and still probably remains unclear to me is how to cycle it.

1013
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:35,060
I mean, I have a protocol where I sort of go on for eight weeks and off for six or I think it's on for eight, off for five.

1014
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,060
So it works out to be exactly a quarter.

1015
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:42,060
But truthfully, you know, without more advanced testing, I'm really making it up.

1016
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,060
And therefore I don't like talking about it.

1017
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,060
I just did.

1018
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:51,060
But, you know, I don't want to suggest that I know anything more than I'm extrapolating.

1019
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:54,060
That said, I definitely do get side effects from it.

1020
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,060
I get apthas ulcers, not as many as I used to.

1021
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,060
So there must be some acclimation I'm having.

1022
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:04,060
But I remember I used to get apthas ulcers in residency all the time.

1023
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:11,060
I mean, I don't think I went more than two weeks without a horrible apthas ulcer in my mouth during my residency.

1024
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:19,060
And I remember the day I walked out of the hospital for the last time, never getting one again until I started rapamycin, you know,

1025
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,060
12, 14 years later.

1026
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,060
That's been the only thing I've noticed.

1027
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:28,060
One other little thing I've noticed, which is really odd, is when I'm on it, it's not surprising.

1028
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:31,060
My fingernails grow slower.

1029
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:34,060
For example, I'm not taking it right now and this is going to sound dumb.

1030
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:37,060
I feel like I have to cut my fingernails like every four or five days.

1031
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:42,060
Do you feel any benefits from either of them when you were on them or not really?

1032
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,060
Nope.

1033
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,060
I don't feel anything that I can comment on.

1034
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:50,060
Joan, you didn't see him before, but he looks so much older these days.

1035
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:55,060
I bet you he looks younger.

1036
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,060
I look like a spring chicken until I started taking it.

1037
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:01,060
Nierd, talk to us a little bit about your book.

1038
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,060
I want to kind of go back and talk about a couple of things.

1039
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:09,060
There was some funny stories in there that I was unaware of, and I want to at least have you tell one of them.

1040
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:16,060
I had no idea that you were one of the reviewers on the University of Wisconsin program.

1041
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:24,060
I'm writing about this experiment in great detail for my book that will hopefully be out in the next 10 years.

1042
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:28,060
I talk about the NIH monkeys and the Wisconsin monkeys, et cetera.

1043
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:31,060
But talk to us about, I don't know if you know this story, Joan.

1044
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:34,060
Do you know the story about what Nierd found when he was doing this?

1045
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,060
No.

1046
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:41,060
I think this is the biggest experiment ever on caloric restriction.

1047
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,060
Right.

1048
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:48,060
We couldn't do longevity in humans, so let's do it in primate and make sure that we're making progress.

1049
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,060
So Wisconsin set up their experiment.

1050
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:55,060
They go for I think it's already 10 years, actually.

1051
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:59,060
I'm not sure it was five years or 10 years, but there's the renewal.

1052
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,060
OK.

1053
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:05,060
And they write the renewal and the committee meets in Wisconsin the night before.

1054
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:09,060
And we go first over our comments.

1055
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:15,060
I'm reading their preliminary data, and I see something very interesting.

1056
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:22,060
The elderly animals are before the body weight were separated and parallel.

1057
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:28,060
And all of a sudden, the monkeys are older, but they're starting to weigh the same.

1058
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:35,060
Although they're calorically restricted supposedly, there's a disappearance of the delta weight.

1059
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:42,060
And I'm thinking first, maybe it has to do with aging.

1060
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,060
It just doesn't work as well.

1061
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,060
Metabolic rates are slowing.

1062
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,060
Right.

1063
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,060
Something is slowing, I don't know.

1064
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:55,060
But then I'm noticing that those cohorts were started at different times.

1065
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,060
They had like three cohorts.

1066
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:01,060
I don't remember exactly, but three cohorts that were started at different times.

1067
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,060
So there were different ages.

1068
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,060
But all of them in the last year, their weight disappeared.

1069
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:15,060
And I'm sitting in the committee and I said, there's only one possibility that I can think of that all cohorts are doing that,

1070
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,060
and that somebody is feeding the monkeys.

1071
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,060
OK.

1072
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:21,060
And not noticing them.

1073
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:24,060
And indeed, they're coming with those guys in the morning.

1074
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:32,060
And they say, before we start, we want to tell you somebody was feeding the monkeys extra food out of compassion.

1075
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,060
Oh, my gosh.

1076
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:42,060
And basically ruining this study, the Wisconsin monkeys took a year break.

1077
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,060
And we're at living in bed.

1078
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,060
But nobody talks about this and the difference between the NIA and the Wisconsin.

1079
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:50,060
I know.

1080
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,060
And maybe there's no difference.

1081
01:39:52,060 --> 01:40:03,060
But I'm telling this story for another reason because you realize I have all those monkey, all those rats that are caloric restriction because that's my positive control.

1082
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,060
Right.

1083
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:09,060
So I'm going to I'm saying I said, I want you know, you're you're meeting the animal caretaker.

1084
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,060
Are they meeting?

1085
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:12,060
He said, yeah. I said, I'd love to talk with them.

1086
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:18,060
And very simply, I'm telling you, you know, we're looking at aging, caloric restriction extends lifespan.

1087
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,060
And we were doing it in animals.

1088
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:24,060
And I'm telling them the story of Wisconsin.

1089
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:28,060
And since then, they were I mean, nobody did anything wrong.

1090
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,060
But I knew that those guys are with me.

1091
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:35,060
But I said, it's better for those who are caloric restricted.

1092
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,060
They are less sick.

1093
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,060
They live longer. Don't feed them.

1094
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,060
Right.

1095
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:43,060
I love that story, by the way, because it speaks to the human nature of science.

1096
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,060
Right.

1097
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:48,060
And at the end of the day, science is still an operational discipline.

1098
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,060
And you can have the most perfect idea imaginable.

1099
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:57,060
You can have the most beautiful theory imaginable, but it is so difficult to do clinical trials.

1100
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:04,060
And even though that was a trial in primates and not in humans, it's as complicated as any human trial imaginable.

1101
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:13,060
And whether it's that study or any of these studies we're talking about, the decisions you make can come back to haunt you forever.

1102
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,060
And I'm not going to say that.

1103
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:19,060
I'm going to say that you can't pick the wrong patient in which to study this if you pick the wrong indication.

1104
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:26,060
I mean, I'm constantly amazed at how often science actually works out when you consider all of the permutations in which it could go wrong.

1105
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,060
Absolutely.

1106
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:31,060
All the washout periods that you wash out long enough that you not wash out long enough.

1107
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:33,060
These things amaze me.

1108
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:36,060
Let's pivot a little bit to talk about epigenetic clocks.

1109
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,060
They're getting a lot of attention lately.

1110
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:45,060
To probably three weeks ago, looking at some changes in methylation.

1111
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:53,060
Do either of you want to just take a stab at sort of explaining to the listener what an epigenetic clock is, given that we're talking about aging and then maybe we could talk about about them?

1112
01:41:53,060 --> 01:42:00,060
With aging, their epigenetic changes would mean it's not the sequence of the DNA, right?

1113
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:06,060
But on top of the DNA, there is a way to control whether gene is activated or not.

1114
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:11,060
One of the ways to control that is methylation, which is a relatively simple reaction.

1115
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:17,060
And methylation is one way where the environment interacts with our genome.

1116
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:21,060
And the methylation with aging are either increasing or decreasing.

1117
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,060
Both of them happens.

1118
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:28,060
And they very often, the consequences change in gene activity.

1119
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:34,060
David Sinclair, in his book, you can see that I'm seeing it as one of the hallmarks of aging.

1120
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:42,060
David Sinclair really thinks that that's not only the major cause of aging, but also the major way we change that.

1121
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:53,060
Anyhow, Horvat and Morgan Levine and some other people around the world have looked at methylation sites and tried to correlate them to chronological age.

1122
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Okay?

1123
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:57,060
And it's a big process.

1124
01:42:57,060 --> 01:42:59,060
It's also with artificial intelligence.

1125
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:01,060
You have to take lots of methylation sites.

1126
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:06,060
You have to do and see the chronological age, but more important.

1127
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:11,060
And the most important thing is to distinguish between biological age and chronological age.

1128
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:19,060
And there's a huge body of work that really showed that methylation clocks, and they're in development.

1129
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,060
There's newer and better.

1130
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,060
That methylation clocks are good.

1131
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:27,060
They're really good clocks of biological age.

1132
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:38,060
In particular, when you see if they predict mortality, for example, but also predictions of a lot of diseases, not all of them.

1133
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:49,060
And so all of a sudden, this methylation became not only an important biology, a predictive biology, a biomarker, but also became a business.

1134
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:52,060
And this is kind of available out there.

1135
01:43:53,060 --> 01:44:02,060
I mean, I think what's interesting to me is, are these changes all pathologic, or are some of them compensatory and actually good?

1136
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:10,060
And so is reversing a biologic clock going to mean you're in a better state or not?

1137
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:13,060
So it's independent things.

1138
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:20,060
And I would add to that, I think, Nir, you and I have maybe even talked about this, or I feel like I've talked about it with somebody, so I don't know if it was you.

1139
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:29,060
But we don't know if a person has a, let's just say a person shows up at time t naught and they have methylation status m naught.

1140
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:32,060
You then apply an intervention that is beneficial.

1141
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:35,060
You give them apomycin, you give them metformin.

1142
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,060
You go down to another time point.

1143
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:46,060
Even if you have not undone methylation, how do you know you haven't done good that is proactive as opposed to retroactive?

1144
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,060
Exactly.

1145
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:55,060
So we, it's one thing to have a biomarker that predict biological age, but we want much more than that.

1146
01:44:55,060 --> 01:45:00,060
We want biomarkers to predict if we're targeting aging, right?

1147
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:09,060
We don't want to do phase three studies for every drug that we have and spend billions of dollars over five years to find that it doesn't work.

1148
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:13,060
We need something that will show it in weeks or months that it's doing that.

1149
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:22,060
My fear, though, I just want to insert my concern on this is every time I've looked at one of these, I have found the data to be somewhat unhelpful because I don't know what to make of them.

1150
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:27,060
So I just had a patient use one of the very famous clocks.

1151
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:33,060
So he's a healthy guy, you know, so his baseline test said he was 34.

1152
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:37,060
His biologic age was 34, which was younger than his chronologic age.

1153
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:38,060
So you are to the gate.

1154
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,060
You're thinking, well, that's already great news.

1155
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:44,060
So then we put him through a five day water only fast.

1156
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,060
It's a pretty extreme measure.

1157
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:54,060
And then we check the blood test immediately after and sure enough on the same biologic clock, his age went down to 27.

1158
01:45:54,060 --> 01:46:02,060
So does that really mean that in five days of water only fasting, he got seven years younger?

1159
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:06,060
I mean, it's nonsensical to me, truthfully.

1160
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:20,060
And I find it a little bit annoying that people look to these clocks as though there's some, you know, stone that comes from a deity that tells us something like, you know, you can reverse engineer these things in any way you want, actually.

1161
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:22,060
Right. And I think that's the problem.

1162
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:26,060
I think that metallations are kind of stable.

1163
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:33,060
So what we've been doing, we had a nature medicine paper at the end of last year with Tony Weiss.

1164
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:39,060
I don't know if you know Tony Weiss Corey from Stanford, but and we had a paper just accepted to.

1165
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:46,060
But we were looking for proteomic and doing a clock from proteomic.

1166
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:54,060
So I have a study where I have I took thousand patients between the age 65 and 95.

1167
01:46:54,060 --> 01:47:01,060
And by Optima technology, we looked at each one of the thousand patients on 5000 proteins.

1168
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:06,060
And we asked what does change between age 65 and 95.

1169
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,060
And we got hundreds of proteins.

1170
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:16,060
The most important thing about the proteins, there were a bunch of proteins that were breakdowns.

1171
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:23,060
OK, breakdowns of collagen, of metrics, of granular of granular sites, of platelets.

1172
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:28,060
And initially I said, oh, give me a break. That's, you know, what do I do with that?

1173
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:37,060
Coming to realize that that's possibly the best biomarker that we have, because no matter what we're going to do,

1174
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:44,060
whether it's with rapamycin or metformin or autophagy, what we're going to do is stop the breakdown that is typical to aging.

1175
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:50,060
And also proteomics are much more reactive than methylation, I think.

1176
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:54,060
Although Peter just said in five days, the methylation responded.

1177
01:47:54,060 --> 01:48:00,060
Well, and in fairness, I don't know how much of that clock response was methylation versus the other biomarkers.

1178
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:09,060
So these commercial tests are using methylation is one thing, but they're using glucose level, insulin level.

1179
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:19,060
They're using a whole bunch of biomarkers. And again, I just know from having looked at the inputs, you never know what the algorithm is, but you know what some of the inputs are.

1180
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:24,060
You know, vitamin D level is one of them. Well, you take somebody whose vitamin D level is 20, which is low.

1181
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:38,060
You could give them 5000 units a day and normalize it. And that change alone improves biologic age in a manner that's simply inconsistent with a single clinical trial that has ever suggested you can extend life with vitamin D.

1182
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:54,060
And so these are the problems I have with these things. But I agree. Like to me, the really interesting stuff is that the metabolomic, proteomic, transcriptomic level of which maybe methylation becomes an additional thing that matters.

1183
01:48:54,060 --> 01:49:01,060
But I think I just struggle with any one of these things being a magic bullet. But again, I might just be too jaded on this one.

1184
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:12,060
Well, there is an aging cell paper where somebody tried to rejuvenate the thymus and they took patients and gave them growth hormone, right?

1185
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:14,060
Growth hormone, metformin and DHE.

1186
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:24,060
Yeah, I was hiding that. I think it's a metformin effect, but they showed methylation reversal. So I don't want to say that methylation doesn't go back.

1187
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:38,060
I don't know this biochemistry to be like that. And I'm doing lots of methylation on my centenarians and their children. And so I'm like you, I'm excited of other omics and their potential biomarkers that change with aging.

1188
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:52,060
And I'll just say we've done some of this at Novartis with proteomics and aging. And the problem is some of the proteins that go up with age are actually they've been shown in the Framingham Heart Study to be beneficial.

1189
01:49:52,060 --> 01:50:05,060
Like it is a compensatory good thing. So saying, oh, I'm moving my proteome to a younger age can sometimes actually be bad clinically. So that is part of the mix.

1190
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:19,060
Absolutely. When we get the proton, that's why I looked at the breakdown. When you look at the proteome, you don't know what's in fact, a lot of them we know are compensatory like a GDF 15 MIC, right?

1191
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:32,060
There's a lot that are obviously are beneficial and we don't want to take them down, but we need to find the ones that are moving most. I want to say two more things about the proteomic data.

1192
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:40,060
Of those thousand people, 500 are children of centenarians that we know are slowing much, much later. And we published about them.

1193
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:58,060
They had about a third of the proteome of the 500 that are just usual people who are aging. So we have some relationship to longevity. Also really interesting. And I think, Peter, this is worth the whole program.

1194
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:17,060
The gender effects of aging are so incredible and we've missed them in every model in mice, in rats, in humans. But while in men, there are 700 proteins that are changing. Actually, 560 that are changing.

1195
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:36,060
In women, there are only 200 that are changing. The proteome of women is much more stable. So we'll need to think of different biomarkers that are gender, are sex dependent, not only common to all aging.

1196
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,060
Why do you think that is, Nir?

1197
01:51:38,060 --> 01:52:02,060
Well, we don't know. It's not as simple as saying sex chromosomes. It's much more complicated and I can get you to people who have NIH grant with lots of innovative ID to do that. You know from the ITP that it's all sex dependent. Thanks God that they did it. There was a discussion whether we should do it at all, but it's different.

1198
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:19,060
Could it be possible if it's not sex chromosomes that it's endocrine related? And because women go through menopause, older women have a more homogeneous, no, because even with HRT you'd think that would mess that up. That's interesting.

1199
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:24,060
I wouldn't have guessed that, by the way. If you'd turn that into a multiple choice question, I would have got that one wrong.

1200
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:43,060
Well, I feel food, the idea that women live two and a half years long, was like a fact that I didn't go on and thought that, you know, even if we hear heart disease today, we're not going to get two years back, you know, that this is huge.

1201
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:59,060
And we said, yeah, but they live longer and they are sick and there's some truth to that, but I think there's the rate of aging itself is actually different. And a lot of the ITP, what they do in male, they get them to the lifespan of women, of females, right in the mice.

1202
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:14,060
Going back to the idea of aging more broadly, bringing it back to your centenarians. I think there is, you know, I think some people talk about centenarians as being escapers versus survivors, as you put them.

1203
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:24,060
I talk about this with my patients a lot. I talk about centenarians having a superpower. And our goal is to understand the superpower and try to emulate the superpower.

1204
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:38,060
And the way I describe it to patients, which is based very much on your work near, is that their superpower is not that they survive better when they get diseases. It's just that they phase shift when those diseases hit them.

1205
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:50,060
They just, you know, when they're 80, they're just acting like physiologically 60 year olds. But, you know, once they get cancer and once they get heart disease and once they get Alzheimer's disease, they're not bulletproof.

1206
01:53:50,060 --> 01:54:01,060
They just happen to be able to dodge bullets better. So then I invoke images of, you know, Neo and the matrix and things like that. Do you think, I mean, do you think I'm interpreting your research correctly?

1207
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:08,060
Or do you think that they are super survivors and who actually can take bullets on the chest and have them bounce off?

1208
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:21,060
No, look, their aging is slowed. And when I'm saying they're aging from an age-related disease perspective, they leave 30 years longer than a cohort that's 20 years younger than them.

1209
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:31,060
I mean, their friends died when they were between 40 and 60. So they already more than doubled life expectancy, right? Their aging has been delayed.

1210
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:44,060
What happens though, their aging has been delayed enough to prevent major age-related diseases, but it's not obviously that they didn't age.

1211
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:55,060
So when they get to their end of life, they are just almost frail enough that whenever disease they get, it kills them.

1212
01:54:56,060 --> 01:55:06,060
I don't know that I want it out like that, because they still live longer, still live healthier and still have a contraction of morbidity.

1213
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:24,060
But why does it happen? Because they're old. I have always this argument, like with Tom Pearls, who's doing Centenarian study, I said, I don't care how they look when they're 100 years old, because now 30% of them will die next year.

1214
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:32,060
So no matter what I measure, it will either be the predictive of their death next year or they're predictive of their longevity before.

1215
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:38,060
Right. The better thing is when they were 80, how do they look compared to their 80-year-old non-Centenarian peers?

1216
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:50,060
Right. And so we have their offspring who are now becoming 80. And it's really interesting because the offspring inherited only half of their genetic makeup, right?

1217
01:55:51,060 --> 01:56:08,060
But they're so much healthier than control. I think our best paper was in the American Journal of Cardiology when we showed their habits, well, their BMI and their food intake and social economy and everything like that.

1218
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:22,060
But they had 40% of the heart disease, of the control. Okay. So genetics plays a major role here. And it's slower their age-related diseases.

1219
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:35,060
Neil, you were quoted in an article, maybe you was taken out of context, but it was very recent. And the quote is something to the effect of rapamycin could reduce the morbidity of COVID-19 by 50%.

1220
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:46,060
Maybe it's out of context. I'm referring to Jones' phase 2B study where severe disease was decreased by 52%. Am I right, Joan?

1221
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:47,060
You are right.

1222
01:56:48,060 --> 01:57:04,060
With that, Joan, what is your dream experiment right now? If you could go right back to Restore Bio tomorrow and say, guys, we just got an unlimited amount of funding to do the definitive experiment.

1223
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:22,060
And the FDA came in and said, guys, the stakes are high enough with the appropriate monitoring in place. We're going to let you go right to a phase 3 trial. What experiment do you want to do right now to test the hypothesis of this agent with respect to immune function?

1224
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:40,060
Yeah, I would do the phase 2B as a phase 3. I would do lab confirmed respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, and just show that elderly people who take RTB 101 have decreased severity of illness.

1225
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:45,060
You would not include RAD 001. You would just do RTB 101 versus placebo?

1226
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:54,060
So in our phase 2A, we saw that the benefit for RTB was better than for a varalimus. But yeah, we're not.

1227
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:56,060
It's a dream experiment. You could have three arms.

1228
01:57:56,060 --> 01:58:13,060
You could add a raphalog tube. Add a varalimus. Add RTB 101. I wouldn't add the combo because that gives you—that didn't work as well in our phase 2B. So I'd use those head-to-head and just show we could decrease the severity of illness.

1229
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:36,060
And now to the point that says these are things that presumably have to be in the system before you encounter—these aren't drugs you start giving patients who show up sick. How would you then think about the on versus off cycle of the drug specifically? Would you dose it as eight weeks on, four weeks off? I mean, what would these patients be enrolled to take?

1230
01:58:36,060 --> 01:59:00,060
So there's a peak of hospitalizations and deaths in people, particularly 70 and older, right during four months of winter cold and flu season. So that's when I would give it to them where there's the peak incidence and peak healthcare resource utilization. Take it during that period and show that we have decreased hospitalization, decreased severe symptoms.

1231
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:06,060
So your view is that the benefit is coming when they're on drug, not post-washout.

1232
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:23,060
Exactly. There may be some benefit post-washout, but we saw that in the phase 2A. In the phase 2B, we didn't have enough events after they stopped taking drugs because the season was over. So where I'm most confident is while they're on drug.

1233
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:25,060
Okay. That's interesting. So that's a big deal.

1234
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:46,060
I had a webinar that I called To Be or Not to Be, and the two was the number two. And it's an ethical dilemma. We are at war now. Okay. This is not normal times. And we're at war. Like when we went to Iraq, we chased Saddam Hussein, we chased the terrorists.

1235
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:57,060
But in the meantime, we had to also build better Humvees, right, to defend the soldiers, right? We have to attack the virus and we have to defend the host.

1236
01:59:57,060 --> 02:00:15,060
And you have Joan, who's telling you very convincingly of many studies that showed that immunity was improved. And the price from a matter of side effects, the safety was actually the safety profile were better because it was treating their aging too.

1237
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:41,060
And you have metformin that's been in so many years out there, we know that it's safe. So should we actually come and say, you know, it's a war. You cannot stop the deaths of the elderly. Why don't we do those studies and monitor them? It's not going to be controlled. But is there something that we lose? Are we putting them in enough danger?

1238
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:47,060
Tell me, you're a clinician. You're such a thoughtful guy. What would you think we should do?

1239
02:00:47,060 --> 02:01:09,060
Well, first of all, you give me far too much credit, but I understand your question. And I think it's, you know, a question of risk versus reward. And those are not static. And what you're basically saying is, when you ask this question in the summer of 2020, it's a very different question from what it was in the summer of 2018.

1240
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:24,060
And as such, our regulatory environment and our appetite for risk had better have changed in those two years, or else we live in a static risk environment and we're not adaptable. And therefore, we're really ineffective.

1241
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:53,060
So in many ways, I struggle with this all the time, guys, because I don't prescribe rapamycin to my patients, though a number of them have asked. I prescribe metformin to my patients, some who need it for the standard indication of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, but a number who say, look, Peter, I've read enough of your stuff. I've listened to enough of your podcasts. I want to, you know, I want to take metformin for these other benefits. And look, I think it's completely ethical to do so.

1242
02:01:53,060 --> 02:02:22,060
They're paying for it out of their own pocket. It's not like we're asking an insurance company to buy it for them. So that's fine. I don't know what it is with rapamycin that has me hesitating a little bit more, though I would completely concur. It is probably as safe as any other. I mean, I feel less nervous taking rapamycin personally than an antibiotic. You know, every time, I mean, I had to take a cephalosporin a year ago. I mean, I was like, God, oh, I just don't want to take this drug. You know, I mean, so we know that these drugs are safe, but you know, we're not going to do it.

1243
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:52,060
And yet there is still some hesitation in me. And that waffling speaks to, I think, a broader issue. Now, of course, that's at the personal level as a clinician who has to make that decision with each and every patient. I do think that what we have talked about today, I think it needs to be on the radar of whatever entity is going to be self-appointed as the czar of getting us through this mess and all subsequent messes.

1244
02:02:52,060 --> 02:03:06,060
You know, I was on a podcast with Stanley Perlman recently, and we talked about how do you think about the no-regret moves that need to always be in place for the subsequent pandemics?

1245
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:19,060
Like, there are just certain things that we should always have in place, right? We should always have a national stockpile of PPE. We should have a national stockpile of every reagent you would ever want to do PCR.

1246
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:42,060
We should have a national stockpile of any form of, you know, antiviral therapy or immune modulating therapy that could be effective. And then, of course, the moment we find out about viruses and we sequence a new virus, we should have the infrastructure in place that we can rapidly test and have the electronic infrastructure to do the appropriate amount of contact tracing and surveillance.

1247
02:03:42,060 --> 02:04:00,060
But somewhere along that way is why wouldn't we also, in parallel, have an enormous path around doing rigorous research around immune enhancement? So I'll give you an example. Why hasn't someone done the definitive study to test the effect of sleep on immune function?

1248
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:09,060
I mean, really, let's put this to rest and be done with it. Does it matter if you get eight hours versus six hours of sleep? And if so, how much does it matter?

1249
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:25,060
Does vitamin D matter? Does it matter if you get it from the sun or does it matter if you supplement it? Does vitamin C matter? I mean, you can say, oh, but Peter, each of those studies would cost tens of millions of dollars, to which I say, and shutting down the economy of this country costs how much?

1250
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:26,060
I know, it's such a good time.

1251
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:46,060
It's such a good time. Yep. Right. So I completely agree with you and I would love to see a full out scientific assault on these questions. And obviously, my view is that there are agents like metformin and rapamycin that could play a significant role in preparedness.

1252
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:58,060
And basically what it really comes down to is resilience. I mean, that's really what you're talking about is host resilience. These are not drugs, as you say, that you want people taking in the ER when they're already sick.

1253
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:10,060
These are drugs that you should have taken long before that so that A, you don't get sick, or if you do get sick, it's less severe as the Chinese data that were published a week and a half ago suggest.

1254
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:25,060
Before you immunize when you'll have the... That's right. I keep talking about this stuff forever. Anything else that you guys want to talk about with respect to this particular subject matter? I want to be kind of mindful of our time. I know we've been chatting for quite a while here.

1255
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:45,060
I was thinking the dose response to... You had asked me, would you use a rapalogue early or late in the disease? Low doses you'd use to prevent high doses that... Immutosuppressive doses actually might have benefit for that overreaction of the immune system.

1256
02:05:45,060 --> 02:06:06,060
That's really, really interesting. Has anybody talked about that? Which is, when you have that patient who is now in the second wave where the immune response is what's going to kill them, you hammer them with 20 milligrams of Evrolimus on three consecutive days or something. Anybody discussing that?

1257
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:27,060
There was a small study showing, I think it was out of Hong Kong, showing there was a benefit in patients with severe influenza. I think there's one trial looking at Rapamycin in hospitalized patients with COVID. I think the jury's out. People are thinking about it, but whether it's going to work or not, nobody knows.

1258
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:49,060
But the other thing I wanted to bring up to your point, Peter, is I do think these shouldn't be used until we prove that they have benefit. I think NIRS is going to get some really important data from metformin. Hopefully, Restrobio or someone will start getting placebo controlled, really compelling data showing where there is and isn't benefit of these drugs.

1259
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,060
Yeah, you don't personally take these agents yet, I guess.

1260
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:53,060
No.

1261
02:06:53,060 --> 02:07:04,060
And that says something, right? Do you think of yourself as a particularly risk averse individual or is that just sort of the way you think about things and unintended consequences?

1262
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:17,060
I like data. I want the data to decide what I'm going to do. I want to generate the data. I would want to be in a clinical trial where there's data generated to say, what is this doing so that we learn?

1263
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:38,060
I want to say two things. I think for metformin, what needs to be considered is that TAME will answer some of the questions. Let's say we decide it's we don't know what to do. We're going to give metformin now, because people are dying.

1264
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:54,060
The TAME study will provide maybe later, but will provide some more evidence. It could be a little bit different, but I actually want to say something else to the scientists, to Joan and the scientists.

1265
02:07:54,060 --> 02:08:05,060
We, no matter how it's going to turn out, I believe that we won. Science won here. The scientists have been much more popular than the president or other things.

1266
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:17,060
Science has won. You could see that the pope is asking people not to go to church, right? And rabbis are asking people not to go to synagogues. And Ramadan was not in mosques.

1267
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:29,060
So there was an influence. And the influence was because they saw that we know and that we are responsible. And I certainly don't want to change that.

1268
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:40,060
That's why what I'm saying is an ethical dilemma. But as a physician, I don't want to see studies that are not clinical studies, right? That's my whole shtick here.

1269
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:52,060
So I think we won and we need to find how we do things effectively as fast as possible and that it's still led by science.

1270
02:08:52,060 --> 02:09:05,060
The last point I'd add to that, Nir, is it has to do also with, I think, how you get to the stage 2B, right? Which is, if you look at oncology, I mean, why does oncology have such an abysmal track record in clinical trials?

1271
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:18,060
Well, it might be that a lot of the preclinical work is subpar. It's being done in animal models that are not particularly representative. It's being done in cell lines that are not particularly helpful.

1272
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:27,060
And so it's really less about what are we doing in phase 3 versus how efficient is the pipeline to get an agent into phase 3.

1273
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:44,060
And so I guess, to go back to your question of me a minute ago, I would say that the other thing to be thinking about is how much more efficiently can drugs be scrutinized in the pre-phase 2 so that you're taking better things into phase 3.

1274
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:56,060
Because there, everybody wins. The investor wins because you just have a much more efficient ROI. The patient wins because the probability of success to failure goes up.

1275
02:09:56,060 --> 02:10:04,060
And then society wins because you're basically improving outcomes broadly, not just at the individual level.

1276
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:14,060
And again, I think it speaks to all these challenges we've talked about, which is what's the right question to ask? What is the right outcome? What is the right indication?

1277
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:24,060
And how, you alluded to something earlier, which is, look, the ITP is early enough figured out, you better be really clear on which animals you're studying this in or you will miss effects.

1278
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:33,060
And so I don't know, I just think I don't know if enough time in science goes to this type of question because it's not a very sexy question, right?

1279
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:46,060
Like if you're myopically focused as a scientist on your problem, well, then that's all you want to think about. You don't really want to think about these broad structural things of reproducibility and blind spots and things like that.

1280
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:56,060
But I think you have to start thinking about, when I say you, I don't mean you individually. I mean, we collectively have to be thinking about those things if we want to accelerate therapies to the clinic safely.

1281
02:10:56,060 --> 02:11:07,060
I think the other thing, Peter, that people don't oftentimes think about is there is the issue of regulatory authorities. You're absolutely right. You have to get the phase to be right.

1282
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:17,060
But the FDA has never had a drug to give immuno resilience and decrease all sorts of infections. So they have to figure it out.

1283
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:26,060
And I think we also have to have a little bit of willingness to have a learning curve here to figure all this stuff out with the regulatory authorities.

1284
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:37,060
And we don't always have complete control over these designs. And we're going to have to just educate us. We educate them and have an iterative process.

1285
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:49,060
And I think your phase three demonstrates that, you know, I'm joking always that geriatricians are telling their patients, if you wake up in the morning and you have no pain, you're dead, right?

1286
02:11:49,060 --> 02:12:02,060
So this idea that the FDA decided to take 70, I don't know, 75 year old people and have a subjective assessment of how they are, it's crazy.

1287
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:13,060
It works. If you're young and have arthritis, you will say if it's gone or not. But to elderly people about their health, they'll complain no matter what or they'll shut up no matter what.

1288
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:24,060
You're not going to get a signal like that. So it's just crazy sometimes what the loops that you have to go through and they lead you terribly.

1289
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:36,060
And it's just life. I mean, the FDA admitted they're trying to learn too. But I think there's this perception that, oh my God, a phase three failed.

1290
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:44,060
It was because it's, you know, people don't know what they're doing or the mTOR doesn't work. It's so much more complicated than that.

1291
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:55,060
As Peter, you were referring to, there are so many ways for things to go wrong that sometimes you can control and sometimes you can't.

1292
02:12:55,060 --> 02:13:02,060
But we have to have the perseverance to go, hey, you know, let's look through this and see what's there and what isn't.

1293
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:15,060
If there's a silver lining in the last four months, then I think there are a couple, right? If we're going to be brutally honest, I think, you know, for example, many more people have figured out you don't have to get on airplanes nearly as much.

1294
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:25,060
I don't exactly have any love lost for the airlines. So that's certainly a win. But I think to your point near, I think biomedical research has been elevated a notch.

1295
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:35,060
And look, if the right studies can be done, and that, by the way, it goes back to something that we haven't discussed or you discussed earlier, but I think we should bring back to your question, which is better biomarkers.

1296
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:45,060
Better biomarkers is going to allow for better studies. Bottom line. And right now, our biomarkers are so crude as to border on unhelpful at times.

1297
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:55,060
So imagine you could three months into a study, have a biomarker that tells you you're on the wrong direction, you're on the right direction, you need to pivot.

1298
02:13:55,060 --> 02:14:04,060
You have a phase three design that is flexible enough to allow you to make the dose change or take a certain patient out of the study.

1299
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:08,060
And, you know, these things matter because of the cost and logistics of doing this study.

1300
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:14,060
So look, a lot of those things, again, they're not that interesting to people who wants to study biomarkers.

1301
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:17,060
It's not that fun, but they think we are in a new environment.

1302
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:26,060
And I think people are going to say, wow, we really need to invest in biomedical research, even for something that's not an immediate threat, like immune enhancement.

1303
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:34,060
