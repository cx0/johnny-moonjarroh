00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
at the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,400
today's episode. I guess this week is Richard Miller. Rich is a professor of pathology at the

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,520
University of Michigan and the director of Michigan's Paul F. Glenn Center for Aging

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Research. He served on a variety of editorial and advisory positions on behalf of the American

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,840
Federation for Aging Research, AFAR, and the National Institutes of Aging, NIA, which we

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,320
talk about a little bit. He's also served as the editor-in-chief of Aging Cell. He's the recipient

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,560
of the Nathan Schock Award and the Allied Signal Award, the Irving Wright Award, and an award from

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
the Glenn Foundation, along with a number of other awards for aging research. Dr. Miller's

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,320
research focuses on the problems of the basic biologies of aging, mostly in mice, but sometimes

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,040
using other cell lines. Though we speak in this podcast almost exclusively about one of the amazing

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:50,040
products of his life's work called the NIA-funded interventions testing programs, the ITPs. Now,

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,320
over time, you'll probably hear me or you have heard me talk about the ITPs on various podcasts,

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,000
certainly with respect to the podcasts around rapamycin and metformin. The ITPs are a set of

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,760
studies that are done concurrently in the three labs, the Jackson Labs, Rich Miller's lab in

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,560
Michigan, and Randy Strong's lab in UT San Antonio. We go into great detail about what the

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,680
criteria are and how these are done, but suffice it to say that based on the types of mice that

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,600
are used and the rigor with which these are done statistically and otherwise, the ITPs represent

25
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:39,640
effectively the gold standard of testing molecules for longevity in arguably the most important

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,080
subset of mice we could study. Basically, what we do in this podcast is go through the long list

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,280
of molecules that have been tested, what the results were, a number of these are quite

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,200
surprising. They're all very interesting, both in positive and negative findings. I've been looking

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,080
forward to speaking with Rich for about a year, but the reason we delayed this until now is I

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,880
wanted to make sure that a couple of the findings that were in the pipeline were close enough to

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,800
publication that we could speak about them confidently and this podcast can now be released

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,800
as soon as those manuscripts have been accepted, in particular one around an SGLT2 inhibitor and

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,480
another one around nicotinamide riboside, which is a very popular supplement that many people ask

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,680
about as a precursor to NAD. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Rich Miller.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,680
Rich, thank you so much for making time to chat today. I've been looking forward to this one for

36
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,960
almost a year now, but we wanted to wait until some of these exciting results we're going to get

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,640
to were far enough outside the pipeline that we could speak about them. Good to chat with you.

38
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,320
But I think before we get to the most recent findings of the ITP and even explaining what

39
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,800
an ITP is, I want to give people a bit of a sense of who you are and how you've played kind of an

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,720
amazing role in the field of longevity along with a couple of your colleagues. So where'd you grow

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,920
up by the way? I was born in Philadelphia and when we were five, my mom and dad moved me and

42
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,520
my two brothers to the northern suburbs of Philadelphia, Cheltenham Township. I went to

43
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,080
high school with Ben Nataniahu of all people who joined our soccer team as a sophomore.

44
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,200
I was just born slightly too late. If I'd been born three years earlier, I would have had Reggie

45
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,680
Jackson as a teammate. Wow, interesting. Split your loyalties there between what city you're

46
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,040
going to choose for sports. So when did you take an interest in science growing up? When I was about

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,640
five. That's pretty unusual for a five-year-old, right? Well, I really liked science. I was decent

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,680
at school and I always liked getting good grades and stuff like that. And I decided early on that

49
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,880
aging was bad for you. It made people sick and then die. I was kind of against that. And the best

50
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,840
way to fight against that was to learn something about aging and to develop ways of slowing the

51
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,640
aging process down. So you can't do that unless you're a scientist. So you end up doing your MD

52
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:28,680
and PhD degrees at Yale in the 1970s. At that time, I think you went off and did a postdoc at MSK.

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,880
Is that correct? Memorial Sloan Kettering? Yes, that's exactly right. I actually did a postdoc

54
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,760
for three years first at Harvard, which did not work out at all. And then I was rescued by a

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,160
mentor at Sloan Kettering. Tell me more about what you mean that it didn't work out at all,

56
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,200
the first part. I don't want to be sued for slander, but let's just say that my postdoctoral

57
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,080
mentor had some defects as a mentor and I wasn't very productive and he wasn't very happy with me

58
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,360
and I wasn't very happy with him. So as a beginning postdoc, you're always scared of offending the

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,320
big boss and you tend to put off the decision to leave as long as you possibly can. And eventually

60
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,120
we both got fed up with one another. And so I moved to Sloan Kettering where things went better.

61
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,480
Did your field of study change when you made that switch?

62
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,520
It changed not at that point, but at the beginning of my postdoc, I knew I'd always wanted to work on

63
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,080
aging. And the PhD project that I worked on was involved somatic cell hybridization. I wanted to

64
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,560
mix together two kinds of cells, one that could divide and one that couldn't divide

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,000
and immortalize the one, the T lymphocytes that couldn't divide. And that project went well,

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,960
but the more I learned about the Hayflick hypothesis and all of that cells and essence stuff,

67
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,840
the more convinced I was that it wasn't going to teach me anything I wanted to learn about aging.

68
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,240
And so I decided as a postdoc to become an immunologist. The lab I worked at at Harvard

69
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
was an immunology lab and the one at Sloan Kettering was an immunology lab too. Then when

70
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,800
I set up my own lab at Boston University, it was principally to study immunology and how aging

71
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,560
modified the immune system. When I came to Michigan in 1990, I was still mostly an immunologist

72
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,440
focusing on aging and writing book chapters on how aging modified immunity and the like.

73
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,440
Over the next decade or so, I switched gradually into focusing on aging more broadly with

74
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,040
immunology, becoming only a minor interest. And now we do very little immunology. It's nearly all

75
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,160
the kind of work that is focused on what is controlling the aging process and how you can

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,720
use that to develop interventions. Give folks a little bit of the history around Hayflick and

77
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,240
the division of cells and some of these observations. These are kind of some of the foundational things

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,720
in aging, right? Unfortunately, yes. I don't know whether you want the two minute or the 20 minute

79
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,120
or the three hour rant about this, but the phenomenon that Hayflick more or less discovered

80
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,320
was that if you take normal human cells, which are not cancer cells, and you let them grow in tissue

81
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,960
culture, they're divide, but only a limited number of times, about 50 times, and then they stop. And

82
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,080
if you listen to Hayflick, he then decided that was sort of like aging. He had sort of found a way

83
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,480
to study aging in culture. Now that's nuts. It's nothing like aging in the slightest,

84
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,680
but he thought it might be like aging. So at that time, people were really excited by tissue culture.

85
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,360
It was the brand new thing. Everybody wanted to work on tissue culture and it seemed like a

86
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,440
wonderful, exciting opportunity to be able to use tissue culture to study aging. So they bought this

87
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,320
idea and a whole generation of superb cell biologists spent their life investigating the

88
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Hayflick system under the illusion that they were studying aging. Parenthetically, I, about 15 or 20

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,840
years later, when I was just beginning to become well known, I was invited to give a talk at New

90
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,320
York University, whose chair of pathology was Vittorio Defendi. And Defendi had been a colleague

91
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,440
of Hayflick when Hayflick was making these discoveries. And Defendi told me that he and

92
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,560
Hayflick had had lunch over and over again. And Hayflick had been a kind of a grump and had said

93
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,960
over and over again, oh, my cells, they just won't grow. Oh, I tried them. I thought them out only two

94
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,920
weeks ago and they already stopped growing. And Defendi, if you believe his story, which I do,

95
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,760
told Hayflick, well, Len, maybe they're just getting old. And Hayflick, who, whose sense of humor is

96
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,320
notoriously absent, did not understand he was being joshed. He thought it was a hypothesis,

97
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,080
a scientific hypothesis. And after a while, he persuaded himself that it was his hypothesis

98
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,400
and then that it was the correct hypothesis. So he's a persuasive fellow. And many people

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,720
bought into the notion that the idea that when cells stop growing in culture, it's sort of like

100
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,680
or caused by or something related to aging. Too many people, in my view, accepted that as the

101
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,720
truth of the matter. And then when it later became established that the limitation of growth, the

102
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,760
Hayflick limit was actually due to the shortening of telomeres, a very important finding and

103
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,400
certainly true, people convinced themselves because they thought it was like aging, that

104
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,720
telomeres were something to do with aging too. And it was that way in which a whole new generation

105
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,560
of people sort of bought into the Hayflick and the telomeres thing as a central cause of the aging

106
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,440
process, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Well, it's interesting you bring this up, of course,

107
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,720
because at least at the time that we sit here recording this, it's only been about a week since

108
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,760
a story came out of Israel, which I'm sure you've been emailed about as many times as I have.

109
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,880
Nope. You haven't. Okay, well, consider yourself lucky because I've only been emailed at about 57

110
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:04,120
times, which is apparently the most rigorous study in the history of humans demonstrating the

111
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,800
anti-aging benefits of hyperbaric oxygen. So you see, Rich, in this amazing study done in Israel,

112
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,800
a group of volunteers were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen and wouldn't you know it, their telomeres

113
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,200
lengthened a bit. And so as a result of that, I've had, I don't know, I probably need scientific

114
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,160
notation to count the number of people that have emailed me that story to tell me why are we not

115
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,080
doing hyperbaric oxygen? You see this is the fountain of youth. And I think I forwarded it to

116
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,880
Joan Manick and Matt Caberlein because the three of us have a grumpy old men women club where we

117
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,240
groan on about the idea of until you have really good biomarkers for aging, it's really hard to

118
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,080
study aging and we can't use telomere length as a biomarker of aging. But nobody really wants to

119
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,960
listen to this. I agree with all three of you. Yeah, and you know, it's funny, it's entirely

120
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,200
possible that hyperbaric oxygen could well have health benefits under certain circumstances,

121
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,160
certainly I'm not endorsing it, there's no evidence that that statement is true. But it's not silly,

122
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,560
there are certainly oxygen sensing circuits in multiple cells, which at least in worms can trigger

123
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,520
anti-aging programs, pro longevity programs. So it's not a dumb idea. And there's some really

124
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,400
good labs pursuing it. The weakness, I haven't read the paper, but from what you've told me,

125
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,400
the weakness is just the one you've cited. Aging and telomere length are not the same thing.

126
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,120
And if you want to prove that hyperbaric conditions, suitable doses and suitable time intervals, etc,

127
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,880
might be good for you, that's a very plausible idea. Well worth testing. It's just that you

128
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,000
don't test it by measuring telomeres. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. Obviously, I think that

129
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,640
the telomere, I don't want to say story, I would say the telomere concept or notion as a biomarker,

130
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,120
even though it's not really a biomarker, I think gets a lot of credibility based on the fact that

131
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,240
a Nobel Prize was awarded for its elucidation. So it's interesting, I've heard people say, look,

132
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,200
and I think this is the most accurate thing I've heard stated, which is, look, the work that

133
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,840
Blackburn did is really amazing biology, and it's worthy of a Nobel Prize, but it doesn't really

134
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,200
explain aging. And those two statements can coexist. Oh, sure. And but you've left out a third

135
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,840
important statement. Telomere biology is a critical element in cancer biology. And the amazing work

136
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,840
that several people, including Blackburn did to work out the telomere story is, I think, really a

137
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,080
fundamental advance in our understanding of cancer in people. And it may also have an interesting

138
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,920
sidelight in evolutionary biology. There are some species, mice, for instance, with extremely long

139
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,160
telomeres that if they need an ant, they don't need much anti cancer defense at all, they're going to

140
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,560
get eaten in six months. Vera Gorbunova at Rochester has done some lovely work on the ways in which

141
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,600
different species with different body size and different life spans differ in their ways of

142
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,840
stopping the cancer process. Some relying like people do on the telomere alarm clock, where the

143
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,000
telers get too short that this puts a whole lot of anti cancer defenses into play. And others like

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,240
mice, where this does not happen, the mice have very long telomeres, they don't need telomeres to

145
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,840
tell them when their cells are getting cancerous as a fundamental step in our understanding of

146
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,640
cancer biology in people. And the way in which anti cancer defenses evolve, it's great stuff.

147
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,960
It's just the notion that it's sort of a shortcut for actually working on aging, in my view, does

148
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,080
that hold up very well? Yeah, well, I think I couldn't agree with you more. And it's certainly

149
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,080
on the short list of frustrations I have in this space where people very quickly revert to, well,

150
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,000
but look, but intervention acts shortened, or, you know, lengthen telomeres. Therefore, it's

151
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,440
somehow a cure for longevity and they're a cure for aging. And despite all evidence to the contrary.

152
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,760
So what prompted the move from BU to Michigan in 1990?

153
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,320
My wife got a job as a professor of English at the University of Michigan. And she said,

154
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,600
would you like to move with me to Michigan? Why don't you look for a job? So that worked out

155
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,640
pretty well. I mean, I'm being a little coy, I had always wanted to move to Michigan, Michigan was

156
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,680
very strong university and very strong in aging research. And I had said to her, you know, she

157
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,840
was coming up for tenure at Harvard. Harvard had never tenured a woman in 372 years in English,

158
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,960
they had never found a competent woman who could be an English professor. So we know they were not

159
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,200
going to start with Patsy. And I said, Hey, why don't you apply to Michigan? I love to move to

160
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Michigan. And it worked out for both of us. Excellent. So what is it that brought to your

161
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:56,600
mind this idea of the ITP? This is partly your brainchild, right? I was the midwife or something.

162
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,320
So the National Aging Institute in its division of aging biology at that time was headed by a

163
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,720
visionary guy named Huber Warner. And Huber thought it would be a great idea for the aging

164
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:16,600
research community generally, to have a program in which drugs were tried on mice or mice and

165
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,120
worms or mice worms and flies and dogs or something. So he commissioned a committee of

166
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,200
eight or 10 or 12 of us to sit down with him and Nancy Naidon, who was his deputy at the time.

167
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,360
And we spent a day or two talking about what the NIA might do to develop a program in which

168
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,480
interventions, potential interventions were tested directly. And after the first night,

169
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,680
I went to a room with Arlen Richardson, who at the time was at Texas and is now at Oklahoma.

170
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,080
And Arlen and I put together what we viewed would be the best way to do this,

171
00:16:51,080 --> 00:17:00,040
focusing on mice. And we sold it to Huber. So Huber then asked me to write down a more formal

172
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,440
plan, which he and I wrote up as an article for mechanisms in aging and development.

173
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,640
And when it was time for the NIA to formulate the rules for the program and to start saying,

174
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,520
would you please everybody apply for this program? We have some money.

175
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,600
The program that Arlen and I had sketched out in which Huber helped to refine and had by then

176
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,040
been through three or four versions became the sort of foundation on which the program was

177
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,480
developed. And then three grants were awarded, my own, David Harrison's at the Jackson Labs and

178
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,960
Randy Strong at Texas. So the three of us, it took us a while, sort of get to the point where we all

179
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,000
agreed as to what should be done and how it should be done. But the foundation of the program is one

180
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,080
that Huber and Dorson, which Arlen and I had helped to develop by now, it's about 18 years ago.

181
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,520
This is around the time you wrote a paper, extending life, scientific prospects and

182
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,640
political obstacles, right? That paper coincides almost with when you and Strong and Harrison kind

183
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,240
of came up with what the principles of the ITP would be, right?

184
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Yes. I mean, the two events were not really related in any cause and effect fashion,

185
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,800
but it's about the same time. I had been asked to give a talk at the law school at the University

186
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,320
of Michigan. They were putting a seminar together, an all day symposium in the end of life and the

187
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,520
other people chatting. One was how to take care of old people. One was how to make decisions,

188
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,240
triage decisions at the end of life. And I was the only biologist on the program. So I gave them

189
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,240
the talk, which then became that article in the Milbank quarterly that you've been mentioning.

190
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,600
Now you make three big points in this article that I think are worth spending a minute on before we

191
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,480
jump into the ITP because I think it really sets an adequate stage, right? So again,

192
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,320
keeping in mind, this is an article written about 18 years ago, and it's important, I think,

193
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,040
for people to realize that the world we live in today is much more open to the discussion we're

194
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,200
going to have than it was, I think, 20 years ago. That's for sure. So you said, look, discussions

195
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,120
of anti-aging medicine aren't silly. The development of an anti-aging strategy is starting to make

196
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,800
headway and further work here would be worthwhile. That was basically the thesis of your paper. Yes?

197
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,960
I agree. And it's, I think, a really important point that deserves stress. It's still an evolving

198
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,920
process. We're not there yet, but 18 years ago, we certainly weren't even close to there.

199
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,320
Around that time, the Gordon Research Conference on Aging, which is an invitation-only conference,

200
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,800
about 120 more or less distinguished researchers, I got into a fight with my friend George Martin

201
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,040
as to whether aging could be considered a single process. A drug might slow that process down,

202
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,800
or whether it was a very complex spaghetti bowl filled with 30 or 40 or 50 different processes,

203
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,160
each one of which had its own independent control. And George and I did not agree about that. So,

204
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,160
as a game, he asked the assembled conferees to vote, and you could vote zero to 10, zero if you

205
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,880
agree that there were too many processes ever to be controlled together, and 10 if you happen to

206
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,040
take my position. The average score was about two or three. Very few people at that time, even among

207
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,040
the sophisticated, best-educated professional aging researchers, would check the box that said,

208
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,520
yeah, there's a single aging process. And until you check that box, the notion that you could

209
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,880
interrupt the process makes no sense, because if there is no process, then interrupting it is

210
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,800
a hopeless goal. I think you really sort of need to see it as a unitary process in order to devote

211
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,520
much time to trying to slow that process down. It's confusing, because there are dozens and

212
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,680
hundreds of things that go wrong in old age, and learning about any one of them can be very

213
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,520
productive. It's just that, in addition to looking at any one of them individually, the one that leads

214
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,360
to cataracts, the one that leads to muscle failure, etc., the concept that there's some underlying

215
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:00,120
mechanism that speeds them up a lot in mice, or a little bit in horses, or slows them down a lot

216
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,040
in people, or an awful lot in whales. Once you get that idea in your head, then suddenly it becomes

217
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,480
permissible to think about ways to slow it down. Now, there were a couple of things that we already

218
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,880
quote unquote, knew at this time that had to give you some hope. Obviously, there was the vast

219
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,880
literature on caloric restriction. So, almost without exception, and there are some very notable

220
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,320
exceptions, but almost without exception, some form of caloric restriction, and we could get

221
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,440
into all the details of different species, and when it's applied during life, and to what extent,

222
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,120
and wild types versus not. But there was clearly a path towards extending life with caloric

223
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,880
restriction. And then, of course, we had the DAF mutants in C. elegans, Cynthia Kenyon's work,

224
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,880
which I think was probably early 90s, right? That was 1993. And if I recall her first,

225
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,480
god, it's been a while since I've looked at this, her first observation was with,

226
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,600
was it DAF 16 was the first one, or was it DAF 16? The first paper, the critical paper,

227
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,280
made two big discoveries. One was that mutants of DAF 2 extended lifespan,

228
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,000
and that mutants of DAF 16 blocked. When combined, yeah, and now you could combine with CR,

229
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,320
and then get a better outcome, but yes. And DAF 2 ended up being the analog of the IGF receptor,

230
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,640
and I think DAF 16 was basically an analog of FOXO 3A or 3B, I can't recall.

231
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,920
Yeah, it wasn't quite the receptor. It was the thing that the receptor turned on,

232
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,280
but it's one step downstream. One step downstream inside, yeah.

233
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,800
So explain to folks why that was relevant, as a proof of principle, at least.

234
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Well, first of all, it's just the point you were making. Those of us who knew the caloric restriction

235
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,400
literature were screaming our heads off saying, see, look, you can slow the whole thing down.

236
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,720
And no one quite bought into that. Cynthia's demonstration, which was also, you know,

237
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,440
pioneered by other people like Tom Johnson and Gary Ruffkin and some others at the same time,

238
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,640
pointed out that a single gene mutation could extend longevity dramatically in a worm.

239
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:15,080
The funny thing is, you know, Nature early in 1993 published a very early date detailed six-page

240
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,800
paper by Linda Partridge and her colleagues proving that there could never be a single gene

241
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,040
mutation that extended lifespan. Aging was too complicated, too many feedback circuits.

242
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,840
It could never, ever be done. And Linda's paper was a statement of any species.

243
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,920
It wasn't explicitly stated, but it was the theoretical proof that you could never have a

244
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,520
single gene mutation that extended lifespan. Absolute mathematical proof, lots of equations.

245
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,200
I couldn't follow that. It can't follow now. So about six months later, Cynthia's paper came out

246
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,360
saying, hey, look, here's a gene that does that. So that same issue, Linda was asked to comment on

247
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Linda Partridge, and she wrote a paper saying, well, of course, C. elegans is different. C. elegans

248
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,360
has dour mutants. They're very, very special. But there could never, ever be in any other species

249
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,600
a gene that does this. Trust me on that. So it took three more years for the second shoe to drop,

250
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,560
so to speak, which is Anjay Bartke's paper with Holly Brownborg and two other colleagues,

251
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,760
showing that the Ames-Dwarf mutation could extend lifespan by about 40% in a mouse.

252
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,880
Once it was true for mice and true for worms, the idea that, you know, there might be something to

253
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:30,520
this became defensible. One of my favorite conference stories, about a year or two after

254
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,440
the Ames-Dwarf paper came out, also in nature, I was at a conference, and Robin Holiday, an

255
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,800
Australian scientist who was very well respected, gave a keynote lecture explaining why you could

256
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:48,520
never have a gene that had slowed the aging process and extended longevity. And I raised my hand to

257
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,760
say, but you know, there are two papers here, one in worms, one in mice, saying that there are single

258
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,520
gene mutations that extend longevity, and that's not compatible with your theory. And he said, yeah,

259
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,880
but there could never be a single gene mutation that could extend longevity. And so we went through

260
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,240
that loop about twice, and then I went out to get a cup of coffee. It's an ocean, a zombie notion,

261
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,960
that sort of was hard to kill. And many scientists still are distinctly uncomfortable with the notion,

262
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,840
not all of them anymore. I think our team is winning, but many people still are reluctant,

263
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,160
even if they're sophisticated and know the literature, to accept the general principle

264
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:34,280
that there are aging processes which can be slowed down if you consider them as a unitary

265
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,880
group of changes with a common controlling factor. And I always think that part of the debate is

266
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,160
fixating on the wrong point, right? I mean, whether or not it's a single gene or multiple

267
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,320
genes is probably less the point. The bigger point, at least for me as an outsider, is aging

268
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:58,760
malleable, yes or no. To me, that's the question that matters. And if prior to the 1990s, if the

269
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,000
answer was believed, no, aging is not malleable, it is what it is, then it's a very uninteresting

270
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,680
field to be in. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think you're right on point here. I would add

271
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,800
one more fill up to that. The question everybody was asking and which I used to think was pertinent

272
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,800
is what causes aging? What is the cause of aging? And now I don't think that anymore. I think the

273
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,880
real question that we're all trying to answer or ought to be trying to answer is what is it that

274
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,440
can slow aging? My own current sort of philosophical framework is that aging is caused by an awful lot

275
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,080
of different things. Some cells die, some cells become mutant, some tissue structures get crosslinked

276
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,400
or heavy metals accumulate in a key cell. All of those are really bad for you. And as they accumulate

277
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,560
and accumulate and accumulate, you start to feel older and then more diseased. But the key point,

278
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,440
I think, is that there are biological processes that can postpone all of that stuff together

279
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:07,320
that can postpone it for five decades in people or almost a year in a mouse or 25 years in a chimp.

280
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:14,600
So I don't really care what causes aging. What I care about is what is the process that can postpone

281
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,760
all the different aspects of aging? I think once you rephrase the question in that way, you're well

282
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,240
on the way towards designing experimental paradigms to address the serious question, which is the

283
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,680
coordination and eventually the postponement of these multiple aspects of the aging process.

284
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,880
I think it's worth restating that, Rich, because that might be one of the most important teaching

285
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,880
points, I think, for anybody who thinks about science. And certainly my mentor in the lab,

286
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,480
I also studied immunology, would constantly make this point, which is if you don't ask the right

287
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,800
question, you are guaranteed to flail. You might get lucky, but you're going to flail.

288
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,320
Now, if you ask the right question, you may still fail, but you really, it's the difference

289
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,320
between starting on your own 20-yard line and the other guy's 20-yard line.

290
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,840
Yeah, I agree. And I agree. It's a really critical point. A lot of the time at an aging meeting,

291
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,600
somebody, usually someone fairly new to the field, will say, oh, well, you don't understand what

292
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,120
aging is. Let me explain to you what aging is. And everybody who's heard this line of argument

293
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,160
40 or 50 or 60 times will sigh. Sometimes we'll go out and get another cup of coffee

294
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,560
and say, well, let's talk about that at the break or at the bar after the meeting.

295
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,240
But they're wrong. The answer is you have to think about it just as you were saying. You have

296
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,320
to think about these fundamental issues. What is the best way to frame this question? And it can

297
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,760
be tricky if the world is filled with people, including myself, who are convinced we're right,

298
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,840
that you're surrounded by people who aren't right. They're wrong, but they're convinced they're

299
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,680
right. And sort of talking them into viewing the matter from another framework takes a while.

300
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Let's dive into the ITP, the Interventions Testing Program, this amazing, amazing scientific

301
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,800
framework. Think of it as a program. I don't know. How do you describe it to people? I sort of think

302
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:26,280
of it as a gold standard by which we test single drug often, but sometimes not just single drug

303
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:35,320
interventions in a robust, rigorous manner. And when things pass the ITP test, we take them really

304
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,680
seriously when things fail in an ITP, even if they've succeeded elsewhere, we look at them very

305
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,760
closely. So what's the word you would use to describe the ITP to somebody on the outside?

306
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,040
Well, I agree with most of what you've said, and I'm certainly very flattered to hear you describe

307
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:00,280
it in that way, although I think you're being a little too optimistic and a little kind. So let me

308
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:06,280
sort of go back over what you said. The goal of the ITP, and we've tried our best to meet this goal,

309
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,680
is to develop a fundamentally sound way of testing one question. Does this drug extend mass lifespan?

310
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:19,720
And we do our best by designing the program in ways so that our answers will be reliable and to the

311
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,200
best we can, reproducible and believable. For example, we use an awful lot of mice because

312
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,120
that gives us a lot of statistical power. We want to be sure that we will have enough mice present

313
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,400
that if a particular drug extends lifespan by 8 or 10%, we'll pick it up almost all the time, 80%

314
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,480
and 90% of the time. That's sort of an ambitious thing to do. To give you an example, Jay Olshansky

315
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,760
and Bruce Karnes and their colleagues demonstrated years ago that if you abolish cancer in people,

316
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:57,720
nobody ever gets cancer again, human lifespan goes up by only 3%. So the drugs that we are

317
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,000
interested in by designing our program are drugs that are designed to win at our program. You've

318
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,120
got to be at least three times better than a complete cog quest of cancer. I'd like to come

319
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,240
back to Jay's methodology on that because I've never fully understood that calculation because

320
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,120
I know he's also made the claim that if you completely abolish atherosclerosis, it's about

321
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,160
a 3% bump and if it's cancer and atherosclerosis, it's like a 7% bump. If you got rid of cancer,

322
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:31,560
heart disease, stroke and diabetes, it's about an 18% bump. We'll revisit that. But let's go back

323
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,000
to these principles because there really are four remarkable principles of the ITP and that's what

324
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,480
it is that for me personally gets me excited. You alluded to one already, which is from a

325
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:53,000
statistical standpoint, you power to 80% for an 8 to 10% detection rate. And to put that in English,

326
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,920
it means you need an awful lot of animals. Yes, each year each of the three sites will have 50

327
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:07,240
males and 50 females on each drug and also 100 male controls and 100 female controls. We double

328
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,240
the number of controls because it gives us a lot better statistical power at relatively little cost

329
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,600
then we pull all the data from all three sites together for our analysis. And then you've alluded

330
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,120
to now the second feature of the ITP, which is they are run in parallel at three sites.

331
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,880
So the Miller lab is doing this at Michigan, the Strong lab is doing this in San Antonio at UT,

332
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,040
and Harrison is doing this at Jackson Labs, correct? Yeah, that's right. Okay, the next point

333
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,360
that makes this pretty special is you are using genetically heterogeneous mice. These are not

334
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:50,120
homogeneous. So explain to folks why using these genetically heterogeneous mice is an important

335
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,840
feature of the ITPs. Yeah, I will. Let me just say one more point about that second point you raised.

336
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,200
Doing it at all three sites not only gives us power, but it also tells us we're getting an effect that

337
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,080
is reproducible at three sites. If for instance, and we've certainly seen this, we get a drug that

338
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,440
does just terrific at one of the sites, but not at all at the other two, something may have gone

339
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,920
wrong. That's right. That's a methodologic issue right there potentially. Yeah, if you get a drug

340
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,720
that works pretty darn well at all three sites, people have very good reason for believing it

341
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,000
could work at their site too. That sort of instantaneous reproducibility is a major reason

342
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,360
for doing it at three sites. The literature is filled with reports of a drug that did something

343
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,840
good to a mouse at one site, and then no one wants to wait four years to test it out. Doing

344
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,840
three tests at the same time gets us around that. Then the question you asked is why use

345
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,800
the genetically heterogeneous mice? About 90% of the work in aging with mice and actually of medical

346
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,680
research with mice uses a single inbred genotype where every mouse is the same. There's no variation

347
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,880
from mouse to mouse in their genetics. In addition, it's inbred and everybody knows if you have a

348
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,080
choice, you'd rather not be inbred. That's why we don't allow people to get married to their

349
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,640
brothers and sisters because it tends to produce weak offspring. Every one of the inbred strains

350
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,840
has its own set of bizarre peculiarities. Many of them are blind by the time they're growing up.

351
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,600
Most of them are deaf, etc., etc. What we wanted to do in developing a genetically heterogeneous

352
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,840
stock was avoid that. We did not want to trick ourselves into picking a drug that only worked

353
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,680
on black six mice. Conversely, we did not want to miss a really good drug that just happened not

354
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:44,200
to work on black six mice. What we do is we obtain from the Jackson Laboratories two different kinds

355
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,640
of mice which have represent four different grandparents, inbred grandparents. When we cross

356
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,160
them together, just like when your mother and father produce offspring, each one of those

357
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,920
children is genetically unique, but each one will share half of its genes with all the others

358
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,440
at random, a random half. All of the mice we've produced for the IDP, of which there are now more

359
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:14,520
than 20,000, have that in common. No two mice are ever the same, but any two mice share half their

360
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,040
genes. The other advantage of doing it this way is that the Jackson Labs, sort of the gold standard

361
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,640
in inbred stocks, they're black six this year and they're black six 10 years from now and they're

362
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:33,480
black six 10 years ago, are as close to the identical as science can guarantee. What that means is that

363
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,120
the four-way cross mice we use, the Het 3 mice, are the same year after year after year. We can make

364
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,560
100 or 1000 or 10,000 of them with the same characteristics. Anyone else, anywhere in the

365
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,320
world that wants to make them, can do so very inexpensively and be sure that their population

366
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,040
characteristics, the average numbers of mice that have this gene or this pair of genes or this

367
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,600
triplet of genes, will be the same as the ones that we are using. It gives a sort of reproducible

368
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:11,400
heterogeneity, which I wish almost everyone would adopt. I think that's the way to do science and

369
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,400
people who are at the origins of the IDP agreed with me about that. That's why the IDP does it

370
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:26,120
that way. Do you have a sense of what fraction of research is done in mice utilizing genetically

371
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,120
heterogeneous mice in the fashion you describe? Are we talking less than 10%? Oh yeah, much less

372
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,400
than 10%. The reason is that when people want to work in aging, they call the NIA, the National

373
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,120
Aging Institute, and they say, can I please have some old mice? And the NIA does not have

374
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,840
genetically heterogeneous mice. They had them for, I begged and pleaded and kicked and screamed,

375
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,360
as did some colleagues. And they set up a colony of genetically heterogeneous mice. And after three

376
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,120
or four years, they were not receiving many requests. Everybody was saying, I want black

377
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,000
six mice. My scientific parents use black six mice and everybody always uses black six mice. I need

378
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,440
black six mice. So the NIA, for lack of demand, folded up the colony. And now that I think largely

379
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:19,320
because the IDP people are beginning to realize the folly of using black six mice and the good

380
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,480
reasons for using genetically heterogeneous mice. And the NIA keeps getting a sprinkling of phone

381
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,120
calls every now and then saying, please, please can you carry these genetically heterogeneous mice?

382
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,080
But it's momentum. They have contracts with their mouse producers and it would take

383
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,120
at least Richard Hodes, the director of the NIA, at two or three or four of his trusted associates

384
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:48,200
to say, oh yeah, we should do that. And so far they haven't. All right. So there's one more feature

385
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,360
of the IDP, which is that basically anybody can make a suggestion for a molecule, right? Yeah.

386
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:02,520
So what was the first candidate molecule in terms of the first pool that was suggested?

387
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't know. I have to go back and check my notes. And the reason I'm a little foggy on this

388
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,120
is that actually we had a sort of a proto embryonic IDP at the University of Michigan only,

389
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,600
a single site for about two years. At that time we had a Nathan Schock Center funded by NIA. And

390
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,040
I devoted my chunk of the nation's Schock Center to testing four or five or six drugs over a period

391
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,240
of two years. None of them worked. And then the IDP got formally funded. It became a

392
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,280
multi-institutional program. That first year there were four suggestions that we accepted.

393
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,320
One of them was aspirin. One of them was a molecule called NDGA, which is noradihydro

394
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,560
guyeretic acid, which actually does work. It's worked three times in a row, although it works

395
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,720
only in males. One of them was nitrofloroboprofen. And I forgot the fourth. I'd have to check my

396
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,160
notes. But those were the first four that were accepted for the initial round of the IDP.

397
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,840
Now aspirin's interesting because it initially showed that it worked in males, but this is one

398
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,640
of the examples of something that didn't replicate after the IDP. Is that correct?

399
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,960
Yeah, it was not actually a formal attempt at replication. The initial dose of aspirin was very

400
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,400
low. That is one one hundredth of the dose a person would take, even if adjusted for mouse body weight.

401
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,600
And it gave only an eight or 10% increase, and it was in males only.

402
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Why the decision to use such a low dose?

403
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,920
The sponsor, that is the person who says, please use this drug,

404
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,880
we take his or her suggestion very seriously. And the sponsor of this was a guy named Christian

405
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:44,360
von Leuvenberg, who's now at the University of Florida. And he gave a strong rationale for why

406
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,640
he thought this dose was appropriate, and we accepted his suggestion. And it seemed to be a

407
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,440
fairly good suggestion in the sense that it worked. But then several years later, we said,

408
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,440
maybe it would have worked even better if we'd used a higher dose. Maybe it would have worked

409
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,320
even better, maybe even in females, if we used a dose that approximates the sort of 83 milligrams

410
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,800
a day thing that I used to take to prevent heart attacks, that a lot of people take to prevent

411
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,680
heart attacks. So we tried it at two doses higher than the one we had originally evaluated,

412
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,240
and it did not extend longevity. So it was not an exact replication, it was a replication at

413
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,200
higher dose. It succeeded the first time, sort of, it did not succeed the second time. And by

414
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,600
that point, we had enough things that really worked great, that we weren't about to devote

415
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,240
additional time and energy to trying intermediate doses or something like that. To give you a sense

416
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:48,920
of the budgetary commitment, the total program budget each year, in direct costs, is about a

417
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:56,120
million bucks. So if we test six drugs a year, something like that, $3 million divided by six,

418
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:02,760
about a half a million buck investment for each drug accepted for an initial test into the program,

419
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,760
crudely speaking. So we have enough money now, because the NIA has been extremely generous to

420
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,000
us, that we can test five or six or seven drugs each year for the first time, and also go back

421
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,760
and recheck one or two of these a year. But we can't go much above that without running out of

422
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,240
money. So if we were to decide to triasperate a few more doses, we'd be eliminating from our

423
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,520
program some other drugs that have never been tested, but look really promising. So we make

424
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,360
that decision each year as a group with the help of five other scientists who are not part of the

425
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,440
ITP, but give us advice on what drugs to pick. Is part of your decision to include a drug or

426
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:52,040
not include a drug at all based on clinical data in humans? Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, we know that

427
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,520
mice are not humans, and the things that work in mice might not work in humans, and vice versa.

428
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,560
But if someone says, see, this drug shows potential for helping to solve, prevent cancer in humans,

429
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,520
or to prevent some aspects of neurological decline in humans, that's very strong argument

430
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,280
as to why it might well be worth testing in mice. Testing a drug in humans with lifespan as an

431
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:24,360
endpoint is almost hopelessly slow and almost hopelessly expensive. The ideal animal for making

432
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,360
a test of that is the mouse. So whenever we have a suggestion, we consider a wide range of different

433
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,840
kinds of evidence, and clinical evidence about a health effect in people can be given a very high

434
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:44,120
weight. In addition, even if a drug is used in humans for something that's not arguably unrelated

435
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,080
to the aging process, the fact that it's FDA approved also is a big selling point because

436
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,920
if one of our drugs works in mice, and it's already FDA approved, then the barriers towards

437
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:03,000
evaluating it in human clinical situations become much easier to get over because of the safety

438
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,840
tests that have already gone into obtaining FDA approval for some other indication, like

439
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,560
metformin, for instance. Yeah, we'll come to metformin because there's a few drugs on the

440
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,640
ITP hit list. I want to really spend some time on metformin is one of them, of course,

441
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,280
rapamycin another. But I'm curious, like using aspirin as an example, if you were today going

442
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,160
to study aspirin for the first time, would you be swayed by the fact that the evidence for use of

443
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,440
aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease is quite weak? Or would you chalk that up to, hey,

444
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,360
maybe for that indication it is, but nobody's really evaluated all cause mortality over a long

445
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,520
enough period of time in humans, we think it's still worth studying. You're thinking about this

446
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,760
in a very good sophisticated way, you could join our compound review committee.

447
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,480
So all of these points can and do come up in the discussion of which drugs to give highest

448
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,560
priority to the fact that something might or might not modulate longevity or cause mortality

449
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:07,960
in people is worth knowing. But there are lots of things that test interesting ideas in mice

450
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,000
that may not be of primary relevance in the human clinical setting. Aspirin, for instance,

451
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,160
is a famous anti-inflammatory and there are lots of good reasons, which I'm sure you know,

452
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,400
suggesting inflammation as may go up as you get older and it's probably bad for you and may

453
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,640
contribute to lots of diseases. So it was a very strong argument for saying, let's test some

454
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:34,440
anti-inflammatory drugs in the mice. We're not testing aspirin in mice to prevent heart attacks,

455
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,720
mice don't get heart attacks, but the notion that it's a strong anti-inflammatory and that

456
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,560
the processes of inflammation contribute to aging in both species. That makes some sense.

457
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,800
And that's a good reason to test it. Yeah. Let's move to your second cohort here.

458
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Cause this is where you sort of hit one out of the park, right? So in cohort two in 2005,

459
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,240
started in 2005, Rapa Mison is one of the candidate drugs. Who brought that to the committee?

460
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,480
Dave Sharp. Dave Sharp was a colleague of Randy Strong's at Texas. He's an expert on Tor,

461
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:16,120
the target of Rapa Mison. He was aware of invertebrate data in worms and in flies,

462
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,080
saying that if you had a mutant that inhibited the function of the enzyme,

463
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:27,960
that led to longevity increases in these two invertebrate species. And so he said,

464
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,480
look, I've got a drug that can inhibit the enzyme. Why don't you give the drug to mice?

465
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,280
Rapa Mison is that drug and it's actually safe enough that you can use it in certain high risk

466
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:45,720
situations in people. So Dave Sharp suggested it and we tried it. Randy Strong noticed first of all,

467
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,240
that when you gave it to mice in the usual form, 90, 95% of it was eaten up in the stomach. So

468
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:59,640
Randy and Dave and their collaborators then spent a year trying to successfully trying to reformulate

469
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,760
the Rapa Mison by coating it in a kind of a shell that would get it through the stomach into the

470
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,800
small intestine where it would be absorbed. That's why for the first time around, instead of starting

471
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,000
at four months, which was our goal, we could only start at 19 months of age or 20 months of age. It

472
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,240
took us that long, took Randy that long to get the drug into a form which was effective when given by

473
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:28,040
mouth. But yes, then that was the first drug that gave a very strong signal in both males and females.

474
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,160
And it's still the only drug that we've tested so far which gives a very strong signal in females.

475
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:40,120
We have two others that work repeatedly in females, but they're not as strong in terms of the size of

476
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:46,200
the effect as Rapa Mison in females. The other thing that's really noteworthy about this is what

477
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:53,080
you just alluded to, which is based on the need to reformulate Rapa Mison to improve its bioavailability.

478
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:00,280
Without planning it this way, effectively we're giving Rapa Mison to 60-year-old mice.

479
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,800
Yep, 20-month-old mice, which are sort of roughly the equivalent of a 60-year-old person.

480
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:13,720
So this is actually very interesting because the gold standard intervention for treating mice,

481
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,520
which is caloric restriction, typically only works when initiated earlier in life. And so typically

482
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,760
when you wait until a mouse is two years old to begin calorically restricting it, it's too little,

483
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,360
too late. That's right. Richard Weindrich found that it works great, and calorically restriction

484
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,840
works great at sort of four or five months of age, 12 to 14 months of age. It still works,

485
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:42,600
but not so great. And then Weindrich found that if you start as late as 19 or 20 months in his hand,

486
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,840
it failed, just as you were saying. So how do you put the Rapa Mison finding in...

487
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:55,160
So one way that you can think about this, I guess, is to think of it as here's a 50-year-old person,

488
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:03,320
how many years do they have left in life? And if you do nothing, we would say the average 50-year-old

489
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,360
person has 30 years left. Yes, is that about the right number? If she's a white woman, yes.

490
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,800
And a man wouldn't be too far off from that, right?

491
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,600
Five years less, but yes, that's right. That's generally correct.

492
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,440
So what did the Rapa Mison data suggest if they were to translate to humans, which is a big if?

493
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,760
The point you're making is exactly on point. I bet that it was a waste of time and money

494
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,120
to give Rapa Mison to 20-month-old mice, to middle-aged mice. I said, this can't possibly work. Look,

495
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,440
calorically restriction doesn't work at this age, just as you were saying. And so it's a waste of

496
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,640
time. And somebody said, yeah, we've already got the mice. We've already paid for them. Let's try

497
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,360
it. They were right, of course, and I was completely wrong. And that's a big surprise.

498
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,600
That, I think, is the reason why the paper was attractive enough to be published in nature.

499
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,520
The notion is, and here this becomes hand waving because we don't have a molecular explanation,

500
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,360
but the notion is that there are some processes really bad for you when you're a 20-month-old

501
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:09,400
mouse or 60-65-year-old person that are still not irreversible, that can be reversed, and that that

502
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:17,880
reversing can be dependent upon inhibition of Tor signals. So giving Rapa Mison to a 20-month-old

503
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,320
mouse extends longevity dramatically, just as dramatically as if you had started the Rapa Mison

504
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:30,520
at a much younger age. That's a fundamental, I think, reformulation of how we thought aging worked

505
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,800
and independent of the notion that, say, you can take a drug and it can make you live a long time,

506
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,000
the observation that some, though not all of the drugs that work for us, are fully effective when

507
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,320
started late in life suggests two things. One is the theoretical thing. Some things are going on

508
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,120
late in life, which are still reversible and have a major effect on your health. And secondly, of

509
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,240
course, if you have any friends who are 50 and 60 and 70-year-old, and they would like to take a drug

510
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,480
that makes them live longer, that's fairly good news. So let's explain a slight semantic point

511
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,560
that's going to be interesting or, I guess, relevant as we kind of go through these things.

512
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,760
Can you explain to folks the difference between increasing median survival and maximum survival?

513
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,440
Like, how do you think about it? What moves the needle for you when you're thinking about something?

514
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,200
Yeah, I mean, just technically, median survival is the age at which half of them have died and

515
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,920
half of them haven't died yet. Okay. Maximum survival is a folk notion. It's basically how

516
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,440
long is the oldest mouse or person who's ever lived. And that's a value with very limited

517
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,040
statistical appeal because the oldest person in a group of 100 people is not going to live as long

518
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:46,360
as the oldest person in a group of a million people or 100 million people or 10 billion people. So

519
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:53,160
the statistic that is probably intuitive and a best substitute for that is what is the age at

520
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:00,360
which 90% of the people have lived. We crudely refer to that as maximum lifespan, though it's

521
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,880
really not maximum lifespan. The reason it's an important concept in terms of understanding

522
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,920
how to interpret survival statistics and survival curves is that if you happen to have, let's say,

523
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,880
a group of animals, many of which are dying, let's talk about in terms of human years,

524
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,840
most of them are dying in their 30s and 40s and 50s or something, and you have something

525
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:30,280
that extends their median lifespan up to 60. You can see as a public health benefit, that's why a

526
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,000
lot of people get immunized and don't want to have their kids smoke, et cetera, but it hasn't worked

527
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,480
on the aging process. It hasn't in particular had any real effect on how much longer you're going

528
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:50,360
to live when you're 70. But if you had a drug or a diet or some intervention that authentically

529
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:57,960
slowed the aging process, then it would extend expectancy of additional healthy years of life,

530
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,200
even for those who are already quite old in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, and that will modify the

531
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:11,880
age of death at the 90th percentile. So drugs that only extend the median and don't affect

532
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:20,760
the age of death of the longest live, five or 10%, they might be interesting in some ways,

533
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,720
but they are considered less plausible as candidates for anti-aging drugs. If you have

534
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,560
a drug that's authentically slowing aging, one of the things you most want to see is that the very

535
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:39,240
oldest animals in this drug treated group are living longer than the very oldest animals

536
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,200
in the untreated control group. And so when you look at the rapamycin data, they were very

537
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,360
interesting. The median extension, which we've already said, not as interesting. That's just

538
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:57,240
saying what's the age at which half the animals have died. And the males went up 20%. In the

539
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,280
females, it went up 13%. These are huge numbers. I think you may have the numbers backwards. In

540
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,120
the females, the median goes up more than in the males. Oh, I thought that was for the 90th

541
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,120
percentile. It went up more in the females. Well, for both of them, it's a technical

542
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,040
artifact because when you give the same dose of rapamycin in chow, the blood levels in the females

543
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,920
are three times higher than the males. So we don't know why. I'd like to come back to that in a second.

544
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,400
The numbers I've always remembered are actually not the median ones. I could be out to lunch on

545
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,400
those. The ones I've had ingrained in my head and maybe I hope I have them right is the P90

546
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:41,160
lifespan extension, which in males was 9% and females was 14%. Do those sound right to you?

547
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,560
I'd have to look it up, but that sounds plausible. Yep.

548
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,600
Actually, that's a big deal because that's total lifespan, isn't it? That's not incremental above

549
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,840
the point where they are. We don't cheat. We don't calculate incremental lifespan.

550
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,720
So let's explain to people what that means because these are huge numbers.

551
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,840
Yeah.

552
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,720
So explain to people why that basically translates to

553
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:14,520
25% more life once you've reached midlife versus 9% or 14% more life. This is a subtle way of doing

554
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,800
the math more rigorously. Yeah. The editors of nature insisted that we do that calculation.

555
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:25,960
That is the number of additional years or months of life after you give the drug. They thought that

556
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,360
would sex up the paper and kicking and screaming, we put it into the paper. But it's not, I think,

557
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,640
terribly informative. There's an easy to imagine thought experiment. You've got someone on a

558
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:44,280
ventilator. He or she is on death's doorstep. They're going to die today. And you leave them

559
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,600
on the ventilator for one more day and then you give up and they die. So you've extended,

560
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:54,920
you've doubled their lifespan, right? You've gone from one day to two days. That's 100% increase

561
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:01,160
in lifespan. So when I put it that way, you can see that that's not a very useful statistic to

562
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:06,520
calculate. If you're an insurance agent, it's nice to know at the time you sell the insurance policy,

563
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,880
what the life extension will be from the time the person buys the insurance policy. But in terms of

564
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,800
biology and pathobiology and being able to compare lab A to lab B, drug A to drug B, I think keeping

565
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,040
it on the level of what is the change in the overall median is important. There's one exception

566
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,560
to that. And that's the fairly obvious one. If you start a drug really, really late, you know,

567
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:38,280
if you start a drug at an age when 35 or 40% of the animals have already died, you're asking a lot

568
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,320
of that drug to extend the median lifespan. So if you start rabamycin at 19 or 20 months of age,

569
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,960
in males at 20 months of age, 15 or 20% of the mice have already died, depending on what site

570
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,960
you're talking about. So if you get any extension of the median lifespan, it sort of had to start

571
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:03,640
working immediately. Nobody could die for the next few months. That's the situation where the

572
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:10,600
statistics on how many of them make it to the 90th percentile become more informative than a percentage

573
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:18,200
change in median. And to my eye, rapamycin is the only drug you've started at 20 months.

574
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,320
I know you repeated it once at 20, but that's a big ask of a drug, right?

575
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,400
Well, I'm pleased that it worked. It's not the only drug that works.

576
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,560
Well, I'm saying starting at 20 months of life.

577
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,720
I know. And that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, we've used Acarbose starting at 20 months of age.

578
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,920
Well, you did. Okay. I thought Acarbose started earlier. Okay.

579
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,800
Yes, you're right. The initial paper was Acarbose at four or five months. Yeah. But then we repeated

580
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,400
it and that's published too, where we started Acarbose at, I believe, 20 months of age.

581
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,200
And it worked half as well as Acarbose started in youth. That is, we got a statistically significant

582
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,440
change in the maximum lifespan by our statistical procedure in both sexes and a statistically

583
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,880
significant change in the males, even in the median lifespan. In the females, the p-value

584
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:14,680
for median was 0.07 if memory serves. So Acarbose started in late middle age, is effective in both

585
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:22,840
sexes, not as effective as if you started in youth. And by the time this podcast airs, our paper on

586
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:31,000
17 alpha estradiol late start will have appeared. And 17 alpha estradiol, which only works in males,

587
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,560
the new paper just now at the last stages of revision, show that if you started at 16 months

588
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,880
of age in males, it's just as good as if you started at an earlier age. Even if you started

589
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:50,280
as late as 20 months of age, it works great. Just as much, it's not statistically distinguishable

590
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:57,480
from the 16 months start. So that means of the drugs that we've tested for late start,

591
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:05,400
rapamycin works perfectly, Acarbose works about half, half as well as an early start,

592
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,360
and 17 alpha estradiol seems to work just as well in late middle age. A former student of mine,

593
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,520
now an independent researcher named Mike Garrett, together with his colleagues Charlene Day and John

594
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,720
Herrera have already published a paper using these same mice treated with 17 alpha estradiol

595
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,360
where they started at 16 months or 20 months of age. And they found that the muscles got stronger,

596
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:36,760
their glucose tolerance got better, muscle structure changed for the better. So they published

597
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,360
that before we could publish our lifespan data, but it's quite consistent. Even late start for 17

598
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,640
alpha estradiol seems to have highly beneficial effects of just as good and it's something even

599
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,560
a little better than if you start in earlier ages. Now, I definitely want to spend some time on

600
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:55,880
Acarbose and 17 alpha estradiol along with a few others, but I want to go back to something

601
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:02,280
in rapamycin. So we've talked about the first experiment. Tell me about the dosing. Was the

602
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,400
dosing done daily for rapamycin? Yes, in that first experiment. Sure. It's in the food. They eat

603
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:13,320
all they want every single day. So this is interesting, right? Because what we've learned

604
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:21,480
about rapamycin since that time is it inhibits two complexes of Tor, complex one and complex two,

605
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:27,720
now today we believe most of the longevity benefits of rapamycin come from the inhibition

606
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,840
of complex one, not complex two. And furthermore, we believe that some of the negative consequences

607
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:42,760
of constitutive use of rapamycin come from its inhibition of complex two. And so when you look

608
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,800
at some of the more recent human data using rapologs such as Evrolimus, they seem to favor

609
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:57,480
an intermittent strategy. So dosing rapamycin say weekly, which is enough to inhibit. If you

610
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,440
give a big enough dose, it's enough to inhibit complex one, but not enough to inhibit complex

611
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,480
two. And then by the time you come back to redose, you're in this situation of you're just knocking

612
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:15,800
down one, but never two. So of course, I've always found it just interesting that the study even

613
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,840
worked with daily dosing of rapamycin. What are your thoughts on that? You raised five or six or

614
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:28,200
seven or eight really interesting points there. So let's go back and do them one at a time.

615
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,960
Rapamycin does not directly inhibit mTOR complex two. What it does is it leads to feedback circuits,

616
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,520
which destabilize mTOR complex two and eventually cause it to be degraded. So the subtleties of the

617
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,960
kinetics of when to start it, when to start it, when to get it once. And it may well differ from

618
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,720
cell type to cell type. So those are things that pharmacologists need to work out carefully.

619
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,480
The second thing to point out is that a guy in my lab, Gonzalo Garcia, has very carefully looked at

620
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:03,400
TOR complex one and TOR complex two activity for the last three or four years in not in these drug

621
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,080
treated mice, but in mutant mice that have one of two mutations, the Snell growth mutation and the

622
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,120
growth hormone receptor knockout mutation that extend longevity by 30 percent. And Gonzalo found

623
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:20,840
something very interesting. Both of those mutations move TOR complex one down. That's good. But they

624
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:27,320
move TOR complex two up in the opposite direction. So this raises the possibility that it is actually

625
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,640
the elevation of TOR complex two in these mutant mice. It's good for them. And Gonzalo has found

626
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,240
several examples of mice, whereas there's a mutation that blocks the mTOR complex two

627
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:45,240
elevation. They do not live a long time. So most recently, and this is a paper that's just submitted,

628
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:51,400
it's not published yet, Gonzalo has taken these drug treated mice, rapamycin or acarbos or 17

629
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:57,960
alfestridiol, and looked to see what's happening there with mTOR complex one and mTOR complex two.

630
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:04,920
There are changes with rapamycin, both males and females. There are changes with acarbos,

631
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,760
both males and females, and there are changes with 17 alfestridiol, but it's the males only.

632
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:17,080
And that's really cool because it's the males only that get a lifespan benefit from 17 alfestridiol.

633
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:23,400
So to summarize all of that, it's going to be really complicated. The basic idea that knocking

634
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,960
down TOR complex one might be a good thing, and that knocking down TOR complex two might be a bad

635
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,240
thing. That was the premise of your question. I think that's a good initial sound foundation

636
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:41,000
for further work, but the interactions between them, the ways in which different cell types

637
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,640
may have different responses, it's going to be much more complicated than that. The last complication

638
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:52,520
I'll point out is that Gonzalo has also found that mTOR complex two has four different substrates.

639
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,360
That was widely known before he began this work. What he found is that the good stuff turns on

640
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:04,440
three of these targets for mTOR complex two and turns the other one off. So it's really, if he's

641
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,840
right, it's really a change not so much in the amount of TOR complex two, but in its targets

642
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:16,760
specificity, which particular substrates it modifies and which ones it stops modifying. That's

643
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:24,440
a subtlety that may be the whole story there as to why changes in mTOR complex two should be a part

644
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:30,680
of any sophisticated study of this drug and other drugs. When you repeated the Rapamycin study one

645
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:37,480
year later in cohort three, obviously having worked out the delivery system, the average age

646
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:43,800
of treatment was now nine months instead of 12 months. Obviously this was interesting because-

647
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,680
Nine instead of 20. Sorry, nine instead of 20. So now this is interesting in that A, you're going

648
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:54,040
to repeat a very important finding and two, you're going to see if the age effect was significant and

649
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:59,880
it's kind of remarkable. Both groups got a little bit better, which I guess you would expect, but

650
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:06,760
it's worth noting you still see these remarkable effects, right? You saw a lower median extension

651
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,440
because of the point that you mentioned earlier, but the maximum extension in males went from nine

652
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:20,040
to 11% and in females it went from 14 to 16%. So again, females had an advantage with Rapamycin,

653
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,920
but both of these numbers are really quite impressive. I mean, these are pretty significant

654
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:31,560
increases in lifespan and you're now functionally starting this in people in their early 30s,

655
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:37,000
basically. Yeah. So there are two things to say. One is that the curves for the early start,

656
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,400
nine months or late start, 20 months, were compared very carefully by Scott Fletcher,

657
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:48,200
who's a mathematical demographer, biodemographer, and they're indistinguishable. That is, there's no

658
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,160
statistical difference between the early start mice and the late start mice. Small differences like

659
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:01,960
9% versus 11% or 9% versus 12%. There's a lot of variance from mouse to mouse and group to group.

660
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:07,400
You don't want to take minor changes like that with put too much weight on them. They're more

661
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,080
or less the same thing from the point of view of replicability. The other point you made that we

662
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,960
referred to a moment ago had to do with the male versus female differences for Rapamycin response.

663
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:24,520
Randy Strong and Marty Javerz and their colleagues at the University of Texas did a really useful

664
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,080
study. They gave Rapamycin for a short period of time to male and female mice and then took blood

665
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:36,040
samples every, I don't know, every hour, every two hours or something. And the Rapamycin blood content

666
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,240
in the female mice was two or three times higher than it was in the male mice. So it was higher and

667
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:48,040
it stayed up longer. We don't know why Rapamycin in the blood of female mice is greatly elevated

668
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,840
compared to Rapamycin in the blood of male mice. But when you're comparing two curves at the same

669
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,760
dose in food, and the females do a bit longer than the males, get a bigger benefit than the males,

670
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:03,080
it's hard to know how that comparison would come out if you're actually adjusting them to the same

671
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:09,400
blood level. Have you seen that with any other drug rich where going into the food, same quantity

672
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:18,200
going in, you see a 3x difference in plasma level? No, we haven't looked very carefully. I mean, we did

673
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,000
it for Rapamycin because we were so surprised that the females were doing better than the males.

674
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:30,040
And it's a difficult and expensive study to do. I think we should do it for other drugs as well.

675
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,680
We, Marty and Randy, do check the drug concentration as a part of a pilot project

676
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,600
of mice given any one of our drugs. They're given the drug for eight weeks of age, then Marty and

677
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,960
Randy get blood samples. But that gives you just a sort of a steady state dose. What if you're eating

678
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,600
it every single day for eight weeks? What is the blood level? The study that was most informative

679
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:58,920
for Rapamycin was to take fresh virgin mice and give them the drug at a defined date, at a defined

680
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,120
amount, and then quickly measure the blood levels after that. That has to be set up with a separate

681
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,960
cohort of mice. If you want to be obsessive as you should, you have to do it at young mice, middle-aged

682
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,440
mice, old mice. It becomes kind of involved and we don't do it on a routine basis. So the next drug

683
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,680
I want to talk about, well, actually let's go to Acarbose. You brought it up. So let's go to that

684
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:26,760
before we get to resveratrol. I mean, it's amazing. Like, Rich, we could sit here and talk for the next

685
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:32,680
month and go through every single drug in the ITP history because there's not one of these that

686
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,640
isn't interesting, both in its success and failures. Obviously, we don't have the time for that. We're

687
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:42,760
going to, in the show notes to this, put out a spreadsheet that covers every single result.

688
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,760
But nevertheless, it's just an amazing body of work. So let's talk about Acarbose. Now,

689
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,000
was David Allison one of the first people involved in that? I know David very well and I know that

690
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,800
David's been involved in a number of suggestions around the ITPs. He sponsored some. Was he

691
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,840
originally involved in the Acarbose work? Yeah, the Acarbose application came in from David Allison

692
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:08,440
and a colleague of his, Daniel Smith. Okay. This is an off-the-shelf drug typically used in people

693
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,880
with diabetes and it basically blocks the absorption of glucose in the gut, more or less

694
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,200
well tolerated unless you take too much of it and in which case, you know, you're going to get some

695
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:24,120
GI distress, but it works well. I've certainly taken it a number of times. I've got bottles of

696
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,920
it laying around the house. I probably haven't taken it in a couple of years, but it, you know,

697
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,920
I used to use it as kind of my cheat meal drug. If I wanted to have like a pizza, I'd take, you know,

698
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:41,080
100 milligrams of Acarbose and it would manage to, you know, prevent my glucose from spiking.

699
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,680
They should give it away with every pizza. I agree. That's a good marketing strategy.

700
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,480
There you go. Take your Acarbose with your carb junk food. Sprinkle it all the pepperoni.

701
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,960
Now, of course, what you guys were saying is, hey, we're not just giving the mice the Acarbose with

702
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,520
their pizzas. They're going to eat this stuff every day, right? It's part of the chow. Yep. Okay. So

703
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,640
what was your thinking? What was going to happen here? Well, Daniel and David said caloric

704
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,200
restriction is good for you. Acarbose is sort of like caloric restriction and it doesn't block

705
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:15,400
glucose absorption, but it does block the digestion of starches to sugars. And so glucose

706
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,160
wouldn't go up so much. That would be good for you just like caloric restriction in their view.

707
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,200
And that was their rationale. Sorry, just to be clear, I understand that there's two

708
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:30,680
different hypotheses that you could be testing here. One hypothesis is you will functionally

709
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,160
consume or absorb fewer calories and therefore this will be a CR play. The other is no, the animal

710
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,880
will continue to eat. They'll make up for it with more calories, but they will have lower glucose.

711
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:47,080
Which of those two was the thinking here? I don't think Daniel and David did a particularly

712
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:53,160
compelling job of discriminating those two ideas, the sort of framework for that application, which

713
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,720
I haven't read for what, 12 or 13 years now, I'd have to go back to see exactly what they argued.

714
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:02,120
But they were saying it's sort of like caloric restriction. Why don't we try it? Now, it's not

715
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,640
like as it happens, it's not like caloric restriction. There are a lot of reasons for saying

716
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,040
it's not reproducing caloric restriction. But anyway, that was the original rationale.

717
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:17,080
My current interpretation is that it probably is operating by blocking very highest levels of

718
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:25,560
glucose. It in the mice did not lead to a change in the integrated glucose level. There's a clinically

719
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:31,880
useful measure, which is used in human diabetics too, hemoglobin A1c, which gives you a measure of

720
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:38,520
over the last few weeks how much average glucose has been in the serum. If a person with diabetes

721
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,480
takes a carvos, that hemoglobin A1c goes down. That's one of the ways in which you know it's

722
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,120
working in a person. Now in mice, it turns out it doesn't go down. We've done this twice now.

723
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:54,680
So it's probably not an overall change in the amount of glucose that gets in, but a change

724
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:00,600
in the kinetics. If I eat five slices of pizza, my blood glucose is going to shoot way up and then

725
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:06,760
come down. But if I've taken a lot of a carvos first, blood glucose will go up. It'll just go up

726
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:14,520
slow. It won't reach that big peak. It'll stay up longer overall, but it won't hit the big peak.

727
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:21,080
And so currently, our guess was, mine and the other colleagues, was that it was working by

728
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:26,600
blocking the peak glucose. And now we think the evidence for that is quite good because of a drug

729
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,640
you haven't mentioned yet, cnagliflozin, which was just published a few weeks ago. Cnagliflozin,

730
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:38,440
which is also used for diabetes in people, also blocks peak glucose in mice and in people. And it

731
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:44,600
also extends lifespan. And it also works preferentially in males. So it's a reasonable guess

732
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:53,080
that both a carvos and cnagliflozin are working by eliminating the huge peak of glucose you get

733
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:58,200
after you eat a meal with a lot of starch in it. And of course, David also was part of the

734
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:03,000
suggestion team for Cana. So I know that David and I have spoken at length about SGLT2 inhibitors

735
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,280
for quite some time. And we are absolutely going to get to that. So did the mice experience any

736
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,680
GI distress in any way that you could assess that? None that they complained about.

737
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,120
They didn't fill out the questionnaire. So we don't have any way of detecting how the mice

738
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:27,320
are feeling. They didn't stop eating or show obvious signs of distress. You know, their GI

739
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:33,880
tract and our GI tract are very different. We're omnivores, grew up as scavengers 200,000 years ago.

740
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,120
We'll eat almost anything, animal or vegetable. And mice are evolved to be interested in mostly

741
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:46,360
a grain diet. So direct one-to-one comparisons for what our GI tract can handle and theirs

742
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:53,320
may be kind of tricky. Did those animals, both the treatment and the control groups,

743
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,240
weigh the same? No, acarbose led to weight loss or a lack of weight gain. We don't understand it.

744
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:06,120
We see that in some populations, but not all. In the original ITP paper, the acarbose treated mice

745
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:12,200
were lower in weight than the control mice. But then my own lab made a whole batch of acarbose

746
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,600
treated mice for another purpose. And we didn't see a dramatic change in weight and we really

747
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,760
don't know why. So it's a little bit frustrating and a little bit mysterious and embarrassing. We

748
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,360
don't always see the same weight change. I assume the rapamycin treated and controls

749
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,840
did not have a difference in weight. It's complicated and it depends on the age at which

750
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:39,800
you start. If you start in youth, then when the mice are still gaining weight, the mice on

751
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,200
rapamycin do not gain weight as much as the control mice, which does not surprise me because

752
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:53,480
rapamycin stops or slows cell growth and cell division, etc. If you start in late age, like 20

753
01:13:53,480 --> 01:14:00,440
months of age, you have a whole series of factors going on. Mice, when they get old, they often get

754
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:05,480
sick. When they get sick, they often lose weight. And if rapamycin is extending their lifespan,

755
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:11,080
then they're getting sick later. So they're not losing weight because they're healthier.

756
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,560
There's several different things going on in old age, 20 months of age, where rapamycin in

757
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,080
principles would increase some of them, decrease some of them. It's harder to interpret whatever

758
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:30,200
you see. Before we leave acarbose, I mean, one really important point that I'm sure you're aware

759
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,640
of, but I think deserves some emphasis. Since acarbose is FDA approved and has a long safety

760
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:41,320
history, hundreds of thousands of people take it, particularly in Asia and in some parts of Europe.

761
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:49,160
It's an obvious candidate for human clinical trial. The safety profile is quite good. It's very

762
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:55,480
well documented, with many cases having been evaluated for safety. So if one was thinking

763
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:01,080
about what drug that works pretty well in mice would be safe for a human clinical trial,

764
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:07,400
acarbose has to be on that list. I've been arguing with my friend too, Matt Kaberlein.

765
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:12,280
He's giving rapamycin to dogs, as you know. That's a very important, very interesting,

766
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,920
excellent study. And I've been trying desperately to get him to give acarbose to dogs too.

767
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,960
We're still not yet having reached a consensus on that point.

768
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:28,280
Let's come back to this point specifically, Rich, when we get to metformin. Because to me,

769
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:36,200
the metformin acarbose story is a very interesting one, as we suss out the difference between very

770
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:46,040
compelling human data and failures in the ITP versus successes in the ITP absent the out of the

771
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:52,760
ballpark human data. And I think that the acarbose metformin story is a great example of that. So

772
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:58,680
let's park that. But let's visit now Rispheratrol. So for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me,

773
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:06,120
I mean, I suppose it's because of the relationship between Rispheratrol and grapes and wine. This just

774
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:12,120
was one of those things that caught the world by storm, and it's never really gone away. So

775
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,040
if I had a dollar for every time I got some stupid Google alert telling me to drink more wine,

776
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,920
because of its anti-aging benefits, I'd have a lot of dollars. So David Sinclair,

777
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:29,480
I don't remember the original paper would have been 0304 ish. You probably know this better than

778
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:34,280
I do. But that sounds about right. Yeah. So, you know, less than 20 years ago, basically,

779
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,760
David's lab at Harvard published work showing that when Rispheratrol was given to

780
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:50,120
metabolically ill mice that were being basically overfed, it produced a longevity benefit.

781
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,520
Sort of. We can come back and examine that. Clay, in more detail if you wish.

782
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah. Well, let's do that now. And then let's talk about how it informed your design.

783
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:08,760
Yeah. So the mice in question were being given a diet consisting of 60% coconut oil. They were

784
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,520
being poisoned. The original paper did not mention what they died of. They did mention this

785
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:19,960
in a subsequent paper published in cell about two or three years later. The mice that were dying

786
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:25,480
because they were on 60% coconut oil were dying because their livers got so big, so filled with

787
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:31,000
fat that it compresses the chest cavity and crushes the lungs and the mice cannot breathe.

788
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:37,400
That's the cause of death in mice in this particular study that are given a 60%

789
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:43,320
high fat diet, so to speak, that was used in the original Rispheratrol paper. So understand,

790
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,760
they're not really studying aging. They're studying a bizarre pathological process where

791
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:54,520
the liver gets so fat that it crushes the lungs, preventing breathing. And then in addition,

792
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:00,760
the paper that they published reported median lifespan. There was a statistically significant

793
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:07,960
increase in median lifespan, but only in the animals that were on this highly toxic diet.

794
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:15,000
Now, it turns out that when you have the whole curve and you look at other indices of maximum

795
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,840
lifespan, the Rispheratrol was not a benefit. And when you look at the lifespan effects in the mice

796
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:27,240
that were not on this toxic diet, there weren't any. So paper in nature, which was widely

797
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:32,760
misinterpreted, over interpreted as a demonstration of a drug that slowed aging,

798
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,960
was a drug that did not extend maximum lifespan except in mice that were dying of this extremely

799
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:47,480
unusual lipid specific poisoning. So the second part of your question was, how did this influence

800
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:52,520
our decision to test Rispheratrol? And the answer, this is behind the scenes gossip,

801
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:57,400
but it's completely true, is that we were ordered to test it. Richard Hodes,

802
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,520
the director of the National Institute on Aging, was very impressed with Rispheratrol. And like

803
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,720
you, he was getting, I'm sure, hundreds or thousands of questions a year request, say,

804
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:13,960
why don't you guys test Rispheratrol? So Rispheratrol did not go through our usual screening process.

805
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,720
This was a directive from the top.

806
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:21,320
This was the only time this has happened. We were instructed, you will be testing Rispheratrol.

807
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,400
And I called David Sinclair and said, what dose should we use? The same dose that you used in

808
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,200
your paper? And he said, no, no, no, no, no, that's much too low. Use at least five times,

809
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:39,240
10 times, 20 times higher. So we followed David's advice and also checked with his close friend and

810
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:46,280
colleague, Rafa DiCavo, to get advice on dose. So the two doses that we used for Rispheratrol were,

811
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,800
I'd have to look it up either three times and 10 times higher than in the

812
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,760
original Sinclair paper, maybe it was 10 and 30 times. I have to check my notes to get that

813
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,960
exactly right. But we use both doses, both high. And then we started at two different ages because

814
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,640
we were told to do start some of the mice in youth and others of the mice in middle age. And

815
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:11,400
we did that and it had no effect on longevity. And we were, I think, the first of three or four groups,

816
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:18,840
including Sinclair and DiCavo later on, to show that Rispheratrol given to mice on a normal diet

817
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:25,000
does not extend their lifespan. Yeah. So you, in cohort three, you started at 12 months of age. So

818
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,120
functionally these are mice in their thirties to forties. And then you had a cohort that started

819
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:38,360
at four months of age. You're starting these, you know, in teenagers, no change in median or maximum

820
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:45,080
lifespan. Although I believe you had a small statistically significant increase in maximum

821
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:50,040
extension and maximum lifespan expansion in the late onset Rispheratrol by 3%. Does that sound

822
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,880
about right? I don't think any of them were statistically significant. Again, I'd have,

823
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,600
I don't want to put my hand in the Bible until I've reread the paper, but I think there was no

824
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:06,280
change in any of the statistics. It clearly speaks to the point earlier, which is in the spirit of

825
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,680
looking at this through the lens of studying longevity, as opposed to studying protection

826
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:19,400
from a sort of artifactual diet. This appeared to be pretty clear. What was the response like to that?

827
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:26,600
There are people who were making a living by selling stuff that was related to Rispheratrol.

828
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:33,320
There was a company actually, Sertris, that was sold to Glaxo for 600 million bucks for pushing

829
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:38,760
sirtuin inhibitors. So the reaction from people who had just sold the company was probably,

830
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,280
I don't care, I've got the money. The reaction from people who sell things in health food stores,

831
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:50,040
which are guaranteed to raise your Rispheratrol levels or have purple grapes on their cover,

832
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,880
they were raking in money hand over fist. They don't really care who reads

833
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,960
papers failing to show unaffected bites. It's not going to be a problem for their bottom line.

834
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:05,640
You know, I was always very irritated over and over again. Pretty good scientists whom I really

835
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,360
respected. The first slide was a bottle of wine. The second slide was some nice grapes. The third

836
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:17,160
slide was a picture of Rispheratrol. Now by that time they knew that Rispheratrol was not an

837
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:22,360
important component of wine. Sinclair had written a beautiful review article showing that if you

838
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:28,120
really want to eat Rispheratrol, it's easy. You eat rhubarb. Rhubarb is where all the Rispheratrol is at.

839
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:33,800
And red wine has got so little that to get the mouse dose of Rispheratrol, you'd have to drink

840
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:40,120
600 bottles of wine a day. Even Andre the Giant couldn't have done that. The beautiful satirical

841
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:45,560
article in the New Yorker about what it's like to be a mouse drinking 600 bottles of really good

842
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:51,960
French champagne a day that I said to friends when they asked about Rispheratrol. So I think

843
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,920
eventually there's been a lot of controversy as to whether the sirtuins are important or not in the

844
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,800
aging process. There's a big fight between two worm groups, one of which said mutants

845
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:08,280
that modified the activity were highly effective and others said, well, maybe just a little bit.

846
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:13,400
And leaving all that stuff aside, I don't think there's any evidence yet that Rispheratrol

847
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:19,560
is good for you or that sirtuin activator slow the aging process. I was invited to give a talk

848
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,960
at Sertris. Interesting. At the height of all of this, David Stipp, who's a wonderful science

849
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:29,000
journalist, has written a wonderful book about the whole Sertris-Rispheratrol story.

850
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,880
The Youth Pill or the Youth Fountain or the Youth Pill or something like that.

851
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,720
That's about right. Yeah, it's a great book. David's a fine writer. So I went to Sertris,

852
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:41,400
I gave my talk on Rapamycin, which is what they wanted to hear. And at the end, I went to talk to

853
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:47,720
their director and I said, so what are you guys doing for Rispheratrol? Is this going to work?

854
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,640
And he said, oh, well, no, I'm leaving the company. I'm going to work for a company that works on it.

855
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,280
He named another chemical, totally different. He was going to work on Torrid Hibbers. He wasn't

856
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,760
going to work on Rispheratrol. They'd already sold the thing or about to sell the thing to Glaxo.

857
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,520
And he knew that it was tied to move up to inhibitors or compounds that had a greater

858
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,120
likelihood of actually working. Well, we're going to come to one of those in a little while,

859
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:18,040
which is basically things that provide substrates for Sertuins as opposed to activators. But

860
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:22,840
nevertheless, one of the other ones that I thought was interesting that you studied,

861
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,520
not that you shouldn't have in the spirit of this being kind of a community effort, was

862
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,640
green tea extract. Do you remember that one at all? I sure do. Tell me a little bit about that.

863
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:37,000
What was your expectation going into that ITP? Well, anybody in the world can suggest a compound

864
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,080
or a group of compounds or a mixture of compounds. You realize I'm going to be doing this now. You're

865
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:46,440
going to be getting these suggestions from me. Oh, good. Yeah, that's good news. F4, I'm sorry,

866
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:52,040
in advance. Each of these suggestions is evaluated by a group of five scientists initially,

867
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:57,080
our Access Committee. And then secondly, following their advice, the Steering Committee,

868
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:03,560
which I'm on, makes the final cut. So when people are recommending green tea extract, they say

869
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,480
there's a central compound that's probably the main player in green tea extract.

870
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,360
Many people have said it's good for you, traditional Chinese medicine, et cetera.

871
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:19,240
Please test it. And so when we evaluate this, there are all sorts of pros and cons. We strongly

872
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:25,400
prefer single compounds, purified synthetic compounds to complex mixtures. But we can see

873
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:31,000
sometimes a ground for testing a complex mixture. It may be that five or six or seven things in

874
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,440
balanced amounts might together be good for you, even if no one of them used singly might be

875
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:44,120
beneficial. We also like to test things that have acquired a popular reputation for being

876
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:49,560
helpful. If the popular reputation is, even if it's based on a, you know, a thousand year old

877
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:56,600
tradition of traditional medicine, it still might be right. And so some of the time, if we stumble

878
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,600
on something that will work, that would be great news. And if it doesn't work, then we feel we've

879
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:07,080
done a public service. We certainly have not proven that green tea extract might not be good

880
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:13,480
for people, but it will, we hope, slightly take the wind out of the sails of that discussion if

881
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,160
we demonstrate that when we give it to animals, it didn't do any good to them.

882
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,280
The other one that caught my eye, by the way, on the list of, on the much longer list of failed

883
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:26,760
compounds. And you made a good point, right? Which is the failures are just as important as the

884
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,920
successes, right? I mean, some of the most important insights are these things that don't

885
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,960
work that we've long held beliefs around. Methylene blue caught my eye. I was sort of

886
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:41,160
interested to see methylene blue curcumin, many of these other things that have been tested.

887
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,200
You go back and revisit rapamycin again through a high, medium, low dose. I mean,

888
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,200
you really put the screws to rapamycin to continue to demonstrate its efficacy. Really,

889
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,960
rapamycin is in some ways probably one of the three poster children of the ITP.

890
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,120
For now, counting kinagaflozin.

891
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:03,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Let's talk about 17 alpha estradiol.

892
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:03,800
Yeah.

893
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:08,840
I know more about the estrogens than the average person. I got to be honest with you. I don't have

894
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:18,120
a clue what 17 alpha estradiol is. I'm very familiar with two, four, and 16 hydroxy estradiol

895
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,520
and estron and all these other things. I can't for the life of me figure out what 17 alpha. Can you

896
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:28,600
help me understand where this shows up? Is there an actual molecule? Is there a drug that we have?

897
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,920
What was the genesis behind this plan?

898
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:36,200
Yeah, the genesis was a guy named Jim Simpkins. He's a pharmacologist. He's always interested in

899
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:43,240
estrogen receptors. He tried to make a compound that was like estrogen that is 17 beta estradiol,

900
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:49,160
generically crudely referred to as estrogen, 17 beta estradiol, but which had much lower affinity

901
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:56,280
for the classical receptors for the estrogens, ER, alpha, and beta. He synthesized 17 alpha estradiol,

902
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:01,320
which is very much the same compound except for one of the bonds tilts up instead of tilting down.

903
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:08,360
In Jim's work, mostly in tissue culture cells, he found that yes, it was tenfold less active at least

904
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:14,520
than 17 beta estradiol. In fact, whatever activities it was having on his cells and culture,

905
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:18,680
it worked just as well if you deleted the classical estrogen receptors.

906
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,960
When he gave it to mice, he found it was non-feminizing. When you give it to male mice,

907
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:29,000
it did not induce the secondary sexual characteristics that the stronger estrogens,

908
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:36,440
like 17 beta estradiol, estrogen, would do. His idea, and I'm not endorsing this,

909
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:43,560
I'm just reporting it, is that giving an estrogen to male mice might make them live as long as

910
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,600
female mice. The female mice live five or ten percent longer than males. He said maybe it will

911
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,400
turn them into females, but it would be a much better compound for people because no man wants

912
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:59,480
to look feminine. So if it works, people will give it to men and they'll live as long as women,

913
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,680
but they won't be embarrassed by looking like a girl. That was enough to get it through the

914
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:10,760
steering committee, and when we gave it to mice, it indeed had a terrific effect on male lifespan.

915
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:18,680
It had no effect whatever. Now in three separate studies in female lifespan, in fact, the males,

916
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:26,120
given the drug, live not only longer than regular old males, they live longer than regular females.

917
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:33,000
It's not merely moving the male curve to be coincident with the female curve. It's moving

918
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,520
it way past where the normal females live. So why it works only in males, we have a clue, but we

919
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:47,080
don't know for sure, and we certainly want to know why the effect is so dramatically sex-specific

920
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:52,520
so that we can try to figure out a way to get around that obstacle and to get it to work in

921
01:29:52,520 --> 01:30:01,240
females as well. Now if I'm looking at my table correctly, the 17 alpha estradiol in cohort five

922
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:06,440
extended median survival in males but not maximum, and of course... No, it does. Well,

923
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:13,080
that was used at a low dose. I see. At a low dose. When we went back and we did it at a three times

924
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:18,600
higher dose, it extends our measure of maximum longevity as well as median longevity and at all

925
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:24,680
three sites. Yeah, I see. Okay, so that's the difference. Is the at the 14.4 parts per million

926
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:29,720
versus the lower dose. Yeah, when we got that first the first result, somebody said quite plausibly,

927
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:34,520
hey, I'll bet it would work better at a higher dose. So we tried that. Now again, I just don't

928
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:41,720
know enough about mice, but what's the menopausal situation of mice? How long are the female mice

929
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:49,880
exposed to estrogen to 17 beta estradiol? I don't know about when the estrous cycle ceases in mice.

930
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:55,560
It depends a lot on the strain. As you know, dozens to hundreds of inbred strains and they each

931
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:02,600
have slightly different characteristics. In general, production of new healthy pups tends to

932
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:09,240
slow down when the females are eight or nine or 10 or 11 months of age and the cycles start to get

933
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:14,440
irregular and then to stretch out and then to cease altogether. But this is something I don't

934
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:20,120
know very much about. And to quote details, I'd have to talk to somebody who actually knows a

935
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:24,840
lot more than I do about mouse reproductive endocrinology. Is there an actual molecule of

936
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:30,840
17 alpha estradiol? Is there an IND for this? Very good question. And the answer is not really

937
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:39,320
well known. There is one obscure paper by a Swedish or Finnish group maybe 15 years ago

938
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:45,960
that said they had detected 17 alpha estradiol but only in the brain. And in fact, they said that

939
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:53,480
they had isolated in the brain a receptor, which they called the estrogen X receptor, that was

940
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:00,680
relatively specific for 17 alpha estradiol, the one that's working in our tests. But I have

941
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:07,480
never seen that repeated. I actually, following up sort of your line of thinking, corresponded

942
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:12,840
a little bit with two or three of the American scientists who are authentically steroid chemists

943
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:18,280
and who spend their whole life synthesizing various derivatives. And I asked them,

944
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:23,560
what is 17 alpha estradiol? Is it anywhere? Does it do anything? And they all said, good question.

945
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,640
I don't know. So I know nothing about it, but they should know something about it. And apparently,

946
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:35,560
it's distinctly under investigated. So even after your findings, which are quite impressive,

947
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:42,440
it hasn't been pursued as an investigational new drug. I'm over my head here. I don't know

948
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:48,280
the answer to that question. Certainly nothing has come to my attention about its being investigated,

949
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:55,320
but I could well have missed something. There is an awful lot of attention to developing novel

950
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:01,160
estrogenic compounds, really good academic labs. And I'm sure 10 times that much work

951
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:07,080
in pharmaceutical firms. There are major papers in important journals about here are 30 or 40

952
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:13,800
different steroid compounds that do not have that side effect or do not bind to this receptor,

953
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:20,120
et cetera. I don't know that literature very well. And I'll bet a great chunk of it is kept quiet by

954
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:25,800
pharmaceutical firms. So I'm not confident that anyone outside those firms really knows the answer

955
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,280
to your question. Interesting. Do you remember the rationale for your solid acid?

956
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,640
I will have to double check. I believe it feels almost exactly like my qualifying exam. Sorry.

957
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:43,640
Our solid acid, I think is the one that changed retinoid receptor activation. There was a claim

958
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:49,800
from Gretchen Darlington and some of her colleagues saying that the long live mice,

959
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,920
the Ames dwarf mice, had turned on a whole bunch of genes that related to bile acids and the bile

960
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:01,720
acids work through some molecules related to the retinoid acid receptor or something like that.

961
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:07,640
Her solid acid was proposed as a way of getting at the bile acid issue. But the chances that I'm

962
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:12,440
right on this point are only about 50-50. I'd have to check my notes to be sure.

963
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:17,000
The reason I ask is there was a human-based supplement for this that was all predicated

964
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,960
around improving body composition. But my one recollection of it was it was not orally bio

965
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:28,040
available. It was only you had to use it in sort of a topical fashion, which sort of rendered it

966
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:31,720
not particularly helpful. Rich, can you tell me a little bit about the work being done on hydrogen

967
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:36,520
sulfide? There's a colleague of mine who died recently, a guy named Jay Mitchell, a wonderful

968
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:42,760
scientist. Jay was really interested in the idea that hydrogen sulfide might be an important

969
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:48,440
controlling element in the aging process and had published a long and really impressive series of

970
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:56,200
papers on that. So he suggested that we give to mice a drug that would break down to produce

971
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:05,720
hydrogen sulfide, a drug called SG1002. So we tried it and we messed up. We had control mice

972
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:13,560
that were on the wrong control food. And the mice given Jay's drug did better than the mice

973
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:18,600
or the wrong control food. But we didn't publish that because we were not sure what would have

974
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:25,160
happened if we'd used the right control food. So we're repeating that now. We've fixed our mistake

975
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:33,000
and we don't have data yet. In about a year, we'll know whether Jay's hunch that giving mice a drug

976
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,120
that would increase their internal generation of hydrogen sulfide will be good for them. I'm

977
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:43,400
certainly hoping it's correct. When we did it wrong, the drug seemed to work. So I'm hoping

978
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,240
that when we do it right, the drug will continue to work, but we don't know yet.

979
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:53,800
Okay. So let's go to one of your more recent findings. This SGLT2 inhibitor can't.

980
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:02,040
Canagloflozin, yeah. Yeah. So this is a drug which is widely available. This class of drug has been

981
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,000
around for what? Probably a decade, right? I think that's right. Yeah. Used pretty readily

982
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,240
in patients with type two diabetes, blocks the reuptake of glucose so that more glucose is

983
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:19,240
excreted in the urine. Yes. But only when you're hyperglycemic. One of the nice things about it

984
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:25,400
in clinical practice is you can't make somebody hypoglycemic and put them at risk that way. So

985
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:31,480
it affects the process in the kidney that deals with very high glucose levels without having much

986
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:39,320
scope for causing toxicity. Now, this increased median lifespan in the male mice by 14% maximum

987
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:45,080
extension of 9%. It had no effect on the females. That's right. Is this another one of those drugs

988
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:49,560
where you have any insight into differential plasma levels between the males and females?

989
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,840
We actually did measure that and it's in the paper. The females, if I recall, actually had

990
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,600
higher levels, slightly higher levels than the males. The absence of an effect in females is

991
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:06,600
not explicable on the idea that they don't get the drug into their blood. What do you think could

992
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:13,000
explain the difference in the effect here? Gosh, I wish I knew. When you take this together with

993
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,160
the acarvos results, you're led to the inference, and this is only a tiny baby step forward.

994
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:24,440
There's something about aging in the male mice depends a lot on staying away from really high

995
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:31,880
glucose levels. Now, whether that means that high glucose in the males triggers a circuit in the

996
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,760
hypothalamus, which is bad for you, or something, I mean, from here on in, it's all hand waving.

997
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:43,240
The mice are mostly dying of cancer. Both the males and females, about 80% of the deaths are

998
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:48,120
due to some form of cancer, a wide range of different kinds of cancers, but cancer in these

999
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:54,040
mice and most mice is the predominant cause of death. So you could probably start to think about

1000
01:37:54,040 --> 01:38:01,560
why is it if you want to avoid all sorts of cancers, high glucose is a really bad thing for

1001
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:07,720
you. If you're a male, that's the sort of line of argumentation you'd want to consider, but that's

1002
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:13,400
certainly unsatisfying. We don't know. We would love to know that. Well, to me, why high glucose

1003
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:19,480
is bad for cancer is a relatively straightforward question, at least compared to why disproportionately

1004
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:26,920
for males and females. So let me start by asking another question. If you do nothing and just

1005
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:34,360
observe these animals as though you were an actuary, what is the distribution of death for

1006
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:41,720
females versus males? You mean the age of death? No, the cause of death. Yeah, about 80% cancers

1007
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:46,760
in both. Oh, it's 80% in both. Yeah, it's a different, different kinds of cancer. Both,

1008
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:52,040
the leading cause for both males and females is hematopoietic cancers of one sort or another,

1009
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:57,000
lymphomas or related histiocytic sarcomas and other sorts of lymphoid tumors.

1010
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:05,000
Then in the females, the next leading cause is mammary cancer. And the third leading cause is

1011
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:12,360
either liver cancer or a fibrosarcoma. In the males, the second is lung cancer and then liver

1012
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:18,360
cancer or fibrosarcoma. So all of them, it's cancers, cancers, cancers. And how much is

1013
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:26,200
hematopoietic in each? About 30% of the deaths. Okay. So that's hard to make sense of, I guess.

1014
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,960
Are there enough data on the glucose and insulin sensitivity of each of those relative types of

1015
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:36,280
cancer that you could make the case that, I mean, I got to be honest with you, that's a little

1016
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:41,240
counterintuitive based on human data because obviously in humans, the mammary cancers would

1017
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:46,120
be quite glucose and insulin sensitive, whereas the lung would not be. So you would actually

1018
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:51,160
expect the opposite if that were true in mice that you would expect the females to disproportionately

1019
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:56,200
have the benefit. But I mean, that's a lot of hand waving, right? So I'm just curious if we have,

1020
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:04,360
you know, more molecular data about PI3K activity or other activity, IGF activity in these animals

1021
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,680
as it pertains to their cancer risk. These are really good questions that I've been trying to

1022
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:15,000
urge my cancer biology friends to start digging in and answering those questions. As a sort of

1023
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,840
the framework, you can think as you were thinking, maybe the glucose thingy works on the cancers,

1024
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:27,080
but it's also possible that the glucose excursions are working on an anti-cancer defense, some aspect

1025
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:34,040
of immune defenses, or it could be, and this is my hope, but it's only a hope, it could be that the

1026
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:41,720
glucose specific excursions are modifying some fundamental, still undiscovered element of the

1027
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:47,800
aging process in the hypothalamus. Maybe it has to do with the susceptibility of the hypothalamus

1028
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,840
to inflammatory change or something like that, differentially in males and in females, and that

1029
01:40:52,840 --> 01:41:00,200
this nebulous sort of change has an impact on the cancer or an impact on anti-cancer defenses or

1030
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:05,080
something. Any of that is, in my view, about equally likely to be true, but at present,

1031
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:11,000
none of it gives us much of a hint as to why these drugs have a much more striking effect in the male

1032
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:17,080
mice. Did you see the same effect here that you did with Acarbose in that the hemoglobin A1c was

1033
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:25,160
unaffected? I'm not sure. I'd have to go back and check the paper. My memory, which may be incorrect,

1034
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:33,080
is that there was a figure showing no difference, no effect on hemoglobin A1c in the canagl flows

1035
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:39,080
in paper, which is surprising because it is affected in human diabetics. You can really move

1036
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:45,720
hemoglobin A1c down into the healthy direction by canagl flows and the other different SGLT2

1037
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:52,040
inhibitors, but if I recall, it did not produce that effect in the mice. We don't know whether

1038
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,400
the canagl flows in effect is on glucose. We don't know whether it's on SGLT2. It also has an

1039
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:05,240
effect on SGLT1, and there are now reports appearing in the literature, quite striking ones,

1040
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:11,720
some of them in clinical settings, showing effect on tumors specifically, on other aspects,

1041
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:16,520
other kinds of disease, human effects on heart attacks, independent of whatever's happening in

1042
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:23,400
terms of glycemic control. The shortest, simplest explanation, it's effecting glucose may not be

1043
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:29,560
right. There are other ideas that deserve a lot of exploration. Yeah, we are very excited about

1044
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:35,560
this class of drugs clinically in our practice. The cardio protection, renal protection, obviously

1045
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:40,920
the glycemic benefits are all pretty exciting. Of course, this brings us to an interesting contrast.

1046
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:50,520
I think if rapamycin is one of the most remarkable success stories of the ITP in terms of its

1047
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:58,280
consistency, personally for me, the biggest surprise of the ITP is the failure of metformin.

1048
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,400
Can you say a little bit about that? How was the study done? What are the possible blind spots?

1049
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:08,760
I mean, obviously metformin succeeded when paired with rapamycin, but you could argue that's just

1050
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:17,160
rapamycin, but metformin alone did not succeed. And has it only been run by itself once or twice?

1051
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:26,360
So I'm not surprised. There are all sorts of reasons in which metformin failure is unsurprising.

1052
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:31,880
One is it might be really good for people and not good for mice. Mice and people are organized very

1053
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:36,600
differently. It's also possible that we use the wrong dose. If we use a dose that was two-fold

1054
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:41,720
lower or two-fold higher, it might have been great. Or if we had given it for a few months

1055
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:45,960
and then taken it away for a month and then given it for a few months, that might have worked as

1056
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:52,760
well. We tried it at one dose with one continuous dosing schedule. It did not produce a significant

1057
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:58,600
effect, but that's not to say that it could not work in mice. And even if it could not work in

1058
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:03,080
mice, that's not to say that it might not be good for people. So there are all sorts of ways in which

1059
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,320
you might get a disparity. You asked how many times metformin has been tried. It's been published

1060
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:15,080
twice, once by Rafa Takaba, once by us. In our study, it led to no significant lifespan extension

1061
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:22,840
in either males or in females. In Rafa's study, which I'm about to be critical of, it produced

1062
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:28,760
no effect in females, and Rafa alleged that it produced a significant effect in the males.

1063
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:36,920
Now, the p-value was 0.046, so it was really close. And it was not the test that he ordinarily uses.

1064
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:43,640
Our lab and almost everybody, including Rafa, always uses the log-rank test. And he didn't

1065
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:50,200
use the log-rank test. Instead, he picked another test which gives special weight to early deaths.

1066
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:57,080
And if you use that special specific test, then it is statistically significant.

1067
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:01,480
At a p-value of 0.046, my hunch is...

1068
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,560
It didn't work with the log-rank.

1069
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:10,040
Yeah, it tried. It failed. So they went, statistics shopping, found one where it got to 0.046 and

1070
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:16,680
published that. I have asked Rafa for the data privately two or three times. He's always agreed

1071
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,760
to send it to me over the last three or four years, but it hasn't actually arrived yet.

1072
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,240
Well, maybe this podcast will help speed that up.

1073
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:28,840
I hope so. In any case, whether or not his was just over or just under the border of statistical

1074
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:35,320
significance, it was a small effect at best. And in ITP, it didn't work at all. But it might work,

1075
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,200
might be good for people.

1076
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,960
Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess that's the challenge here, right? Is you've got these agents that

1077
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:48,200
work under so many different circumstances. And again, you can probably tell, Rich, my bias is...

1078
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:54,120
I think Rapamycin is an amazing agent here. And I think it's one that warrants lots of investigation

1079
01:45:54,120 --> 01:46:00,200
in humans, because I think that the non-human literature are so compelling, right? Both in terms

1080
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:05,320
of the actual drug use and also the mechanism of action and the genetic manipulation all the way

1081
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:14,040
from worms, fruit flies, obviously, mice, yeast, Matt Kaberlin's dogs. It just over and over and

1082
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:20,680
over again demonstrates efficacy. And even when you look at the softer endpoints in humans,

1083
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,840
softer is maybe the wrong word, but less longevity specific, but things like immune

1084
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,720
function and things like that, it always seems to be pointing in the right direction.

1085
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:33,640
Now, in metformin, we have this undeniable data of diabetics that take it versus diabetics that

1086
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:39,480
don't. And you can slice that 10 ways to Sunday. It always seems to favor metformin in that diabetic

1087
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:44,520
group. But as Nir Barzilai and many others are interested in, what does that tell us about

1088
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:51,880
non-diabetics? Is there a way we can better get at that answer while we await the results of a TAME

1089
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:57,240
study to get funded and executed? Is there another ITP we should be doing?

1090
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:02,360
Well, the principle stimulus for, at least for me, and I assume for those who've

1091
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:08,840
been spending their time developing this test of metformin in aging people, the TAME study,

1092
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,880
was a paper doubtless familiar to you, an epidemiological paper. The point of the paper

1093
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,560
was not so much that metformin was good for diabetics, which everybody knew it was.

1094
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:24,680
It was that the mortality risk of diabetics on metformin was actually better than non-diabetics

1095
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:31,080
of the same age and sex. So that doesn't prove that metformin is good for non-diabetics,

1096
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:37,320
but it's certainly a hint in that direction. Now, it was an observational study, not a controlled,

1097
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:43,560
randomized clinical trial, of course, so it might not be right. But that was a really big hint that

1098
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:51,480
if you're a person non-diabetic and you're not taking metformin, your chances of death over a

1099
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:56,920
wide range of ages are actually worse than a diabetic person as long as a diabetic person

1100
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:03,880
is being protected by metformin. So my view, even though it's a single study and others now need to

1101
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:09,560
be done and all sorts of caveats need to be kept in mind during the interpretation, that's a hint

1102
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:17,000
that metformin may well be pretty good for non-diabetic people as well. And studying that in

1103
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:24,280
terms of a randomized clinical trial strikes me as justified. It's very expensive, it's very ambitious

1104
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:32,760
to meet the FDA criteria, and in order to try to get results before they all become emeritus or retire,

1105
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:38,520
they need to have endpoints that can be measured five to, oh gosh, as many as seven years in the

1106
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:46,520
future. So for human lifespan, it's kind of a short term, but it may work and it's not my money and I

1107
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:51,240
can't wait to see what they come up with. So there's one more compound I want to talk about,

1108
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:57,480
which by the time this podcast will come out will be at least in a preprint, and that's nicotinamide

1109
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:08,680
riboside. So I guess it's safe to say that if resveratrol was the in molecule of the early 2000s,

1110
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:16,360
the next big in molecule has been anything that points to NAD. Again, I don't know how many times

1111
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:22,200
I have to get an email or a text message saying, hey, what do you think about these NAD IV clinics?

1112
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:28,120
I really have heard great things about this, and what do you think about NR and NMN and these

1113
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:36,520
sorts of things? So I guess I'll give a really, really, really fast explanation of what NAD is,

1114
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:43,480
why it might matter, and why we give NR orally as a precursor to it. I'll be glad to. I feel a little

1115
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:49,320
embarrassed because you know 10 times more than I do about this, particularly in a clinical context.

1116
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:55,240
If you had to make a list of the 10 or 15 or 20 molecules that are part of intermediate

1117
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:03,160
or metabolism that may well be really important elements in the control of aging rate, NAD and its

1118
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:09,560
chemical derivatives would surely be on that list. It's at the top of your list. For some people,

1119
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:14,280
it's sort of in the middle for others at the bottom, but it deserves a lot of attention.

1120
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:20,120
There's a great deal of pretty strong data suggesting that aspects of aging and age-sensitive

1121
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:27,080
diseases, age-associated diseases, can be altered by making NAD more or less available. One of the

1122
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:32,360
reasons it's gotten so much attention is because of clever marketing. There are scientists who have

1123
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:39,320
made a great deal of money by making more or less unsupported. You can't sue them. They're not lying

1124
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:45,720
exactly, but they're sort of winking and nodding, saying, hey, take this formulation. It'll sort of

1125
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:51,160
do some goodish stuff to your NAD. We're not allowed to say, well, treat any disease because

1126
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:56,760
we would run afoul of the FDA, but wink, wink, try it. It's a nutritional supplement, and they've made

1127
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:01,000
a lot of money and gotten a lot of attention, some of it positive and some of it negative.

1128
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:08,760
The reason that NR, nicotinamide riboside, was recommended to us by a company that wants to sell

1129
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:14,200
it is that it's orally bioavailable and more stable than some of the other ways that have

1130
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:19,400
been proposed by Mal. Can you disclose which company asked? There's probably only two or three.

1131
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:23,800
I think it's public. I think it's Chemidex. I think it's public knowledges who suggest things

1132
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:28,840
to the ITP. They said, well, we'll provide it to you. You guys test it. You can publish results

1133
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:33,640
positive or negative, just in the interest of science. Let's find out. That's a highly honorable

1134
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:40,920
and sensible thing for them to have done. We tested it. It's a bioavailable form. We used a

1135
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:47,480
dose that they suggested, and the paper that will have come out by the time this podcast becomes

1136
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:54,760
available suggested that NR did not extend lifespan in our mice. There are all the usual caveats.

1137
01:51:54,760 --> 01:52:00,760
Maybe it would have if we'd given it at a higher dose or at a lower dose. In addition, we tried

1138
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:06,440
a little bit to detect it in various tissues. There's a collaborator who looked at the brains

1139
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:14,680
and the muscles and the hearts. We were not able to demonstrate a consistent major change in NAD

1140
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:20,760
levels in these tissues. NAD is a highly active molecule, as of course you know, that turns over

1141
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:27,640
constantly. With a time scale of a few seconds to a few minutes can go way up or way down in given

1142
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:32,200
cells depending on how stressed one is or how high the glucose is or whether you're exercising,

1143
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:39,560
all that stuff. It's possible that we fail to measure major changes in NAD in our treated mice

1144
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:44,600
because we should have fasted them or we should have let them rest for a few hours or we should

1145
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:49,640
have gotten the blood out in a different way or something like that. In any case, the observations

1146
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,760
that we're confident of, at the dose we used, it did not produce a lifespan effect.

1147
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:59,720
Did it produce any benefit? Well, we would have to go and check for other things. The first time we

1148
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:05,640
do a study with a new drug, lifespan is the only thing we measure. We would love to be able to

1149
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:11,640
measure immune function and vision and hearing and cardiovascular function, etc. But those are

1150
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:17,160
expensive and if we did those, we would have to spend money on them and cut back by a factor of

1151
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:21,800
whatever, two or three or five, the number of drugs we test. We generally reserve those health

1152
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:27,560
outcomes only for those drugs that give a lifespan benefit and NR did not in our hands

1153
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:32,520
give a lifespan benefit. You started the NR at about eight months of age. Again, this is a

1154
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:38,200
reasonably young man animal in its 20s, the equivalent of a human. Do you have a sense of

1155
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:45,000
what the dose was on the scale of where humans are taking this commercially? I believe humans are

1156
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,760
typically, oh God, I don't even know, taking probably a couple of grams of this stuff a day?

1157
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:57,400
I do not know. I'd have to look it up. But the company basically had you utilizing a dose that

1158
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:01,960
they felt was consistent with what humans are being encouraged to take? We followed their

1159
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:07,080
recommendations. We picked a dose that they said would be an appropriate good starting dose for

1160
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:11,720
our tests and we followed their guidance on this. It's a little tricky when you're going to give

1161
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:17,160
something for lifespan. If there are doses that are often of drug X, I'm not talking about NR,

1162
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:22,120
but doses of drug X that are typically given to people for a month or two and it's really good

1163
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:26,200
and doesn't produce side effects, you still worry that might not work for mice because if you're

1164
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:32,280
going to give it to them the whole lifespan, side effects may accrue. So if there is an ambiguity,

1165
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:37,160
we want to start usually with a pretty low dose because if they're going to be on it from

1166
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:44,040
four months of age until death, keeping the dose nice and low is probably an important precaution

1167
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:48,680
against unanticipated side effects that might not be seen in an acute treatment.

1168
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:54,280
How often do you guys see unanticipated consequences of exactly what you describe,

1169
01:54:54,280 --> 01:55:00,360
where side effects don't show up in the first year of the mouse receiving the drug but show up later?

1170
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:06,120
Well, we have not yet. This surprised me somewhat. We have not yet found any drugs suggested to us

1171
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:13,160
that caused a shortening of the lifespan. None of the drugs that we've used has caused a significant

1172
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:16,920
decline in lifespan. There were one or two where the lifespan went down 5% or 8%,

1173
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:21,720
but it didn't achieve statistical significance. Now, there could be some side effects that we

1174
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:28,280
don't look for. Maybe the mice have problems with hearing or sight or memory or muscle function or

1175
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,240
something like that, which we would never see unless we look for them.

1176
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:39,560
It really seems that there are three really important takeaways from, what are you at now,

1177
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:47,480
1820 cohorts of ITPs? Almost 100 studies here, basically, or 100 experiments, which is

1178
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:56,280
mTOR matters, less glucose is better than more, and sex-specific steroid hormones probably do

1179
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:01,640
something relevant. If you were at a dinner party and someone asked you to give them

1180
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:09,000
the most salient findings of the last two decades, would that be a fair assessment?

1181
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:13,320
I think the points you're making are really good ones, but it's not quite the way I would put it

1182
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:19,160
if I were allowed to pick only three. Okay, give me your three. The first point I'd make is the one

1183
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:24,280
we began at the beginning of this conversation, which is that by gosh, you actually can put

1184
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:29,480
something in the food that extends healthy lifespan, and it's an enormous effect, 10 times

1185
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:36,600
better than a cure for cancer. In terms of the fundamental imagining of where medical research

1186
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:42,680
ought to go and what people who want to make their friends stay alive and healthy longer should

1187
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:48,040
think about, our program shows that what they should think about is finding drugs that slow aging.

1188
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,680
It seems obvious, you know, you and I are talking about it because we sort of believe that, we sort

1189
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:57,320
of think it's cool and interesting and important, but that's most of my friends, scientific and

1190
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:02,920
non-scientific, they haven't decided that that's the case. So I would take that as the first,

1191
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:09,800
most important take-home message. The second take-home message would be, to my mind, the really

1192
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:16,280
surprising finding that some of the time, maybe even most of the time, these drugs work even when

1193
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:21,560
you start them in middle age. I would have guessed against that when we started. I would have said

1194
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:27,400
you have to start in youth, period, but that was a bad guess, and two drugs that we've tested so far

1195
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:31,960
work just as well in middle age, and one works half as well. So that was a bad guess, and that's

1196
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:37,480
really important too in terms of both the understanding of aging and also thinking about

1197
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:44,840
transition to human usage. The third point I would make of broad genital applicability, I would have

1198
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:50,360
guessed any drug that works is going to work in both sexes, and that's mostly wrong. We have two

1199
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:55,400
drugs, rapamycin and one we didn't mention, the amino acid glycine, which have equally strong

1200
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:00,680
effects in males and females. We didn't talk about glycine because it works in males and females,

1201
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:05,880
significant, but it's a really tiny effect, and so it's sort of fallen by the wise side as we've

1202
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:11,400
moved on to drugs with greater effectiveness. But the sex specificity and the ability to start in

1203
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:19,480
late life were both surprises and open up new ideas about how can you discover why it's working

1204
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:25,560
in old age, and how can you discover why it's working in one sex but not both. Those are important

1205
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:31,080
research questions, and we could easily take three or four or five times as many really good

1206
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:37,240
new labs in aging and devote them to trying to tease out those puzzles. And then the fourth set

1207
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:43,240
of questions would be the ones you brought up. You're pointing to specific molecular clues. Is

1208
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:50,120
it TOR? Is it glucose? Are there sex-specific hormone receptors in the brain that are important?

1209
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:56,200
I think those are really interesting as well, and in fact any postdoc or grad student who comes into

1210
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:02,200
my lab, they get one of those to work on. That's the cutting edge of turning this into a molecular

1211
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:08,120
and cellular understanding of what slows the aging process and where we ought to pay attention when

1212
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:13,480
we want to find new drugs that will work in just the same way. So the points you've made strike me

1213
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:19,240
as highly pertinent, very important for anyone who wants to work on something in this area,

1214
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:23,800
but the three more general points that it works at all, that it can work late in life,

1215
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:28,360
and that it's often sex-specific, I don't want those to get lost in the shuffle because they

1216
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:34,280
fundamentally rearrange our ideas about aging, about late life disease, and about what one ought

1217
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:40,200
to do if one was, say, in charge of America or the universe's medical research apparatus.

1218
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:47,880
On that point, Rich, if money were absolutely no object, and the reality of it is it doesn't need

1219
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,440
to be as extreme as one thinks. But let's just say that the NIH came along and said, look,

1220
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:03,720
we are going to give you the budget you need to study these questions in any animal. What would

1221
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:12,760
you choose as the best model organism that would give you the trade-off of duration and closeness

1222
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:17,880
to humans? Would it be staying where you are, where you have an advantage that you get answers

1223
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:22,760
quickly, but the disadvantage is you're quite far from humans? Or would you move more towards

1224
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:30,120
what we saw in the very famous caloric restriction experiments at Wisconsin and NIA in the 80s and

1225
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:37,000
90s, or sort of 90s through 2000s, where you were very close to humans, but obviously it took a long

1226
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,560
time to get the answer. So I have two answers for you. The first is the mouse, and the other is

1227
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:48,760
it's a bad question. If you ask a carpenter, what is the most important tool, you'll get the same

1228
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:53,880
sort of answer, because the answer is the tool that I select depends upon the problem I have to

1229
02:00:53,880 --> 02:01:00,360
solve. I think that each of the major experimental animals that is currently receiving a lot of

1230
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:05,240
attention is doing something good. They're molecular and genetic questions that are best

1231
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:10,600
addressed by flies and worms, even though they don't resemble me and my mouse in more than

1232
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:18,360
cellular aspects. But they're things that they can only solve, that we can't solve, and that's an

1233
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:23,640
important thing to understand. In primates, I think there are a few people who are starting to

1234
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:28,840
understand that rhesus is not where it's at. Marmoset is where it's at, because marmosets

1235
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:34,760
are primates. They are organized much like humans, but they have a lifespan, an average lifespan,

1236
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:40,600
maybe eight or ten years, something like that. So like dogs, they have the advantage of a lifespan

1237
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:45,960
which is longer than we'd like, but short enough that you can think about doing an experiment and

1238
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,400
completing it within about a decade. Some of the work has to be done in humans, too, for reasons I

1239
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:56,600
don't think I need to convince you of. The mouse is the correct answer. If you have to pick what,

1240
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:01,240
it's got to be the mouse. You said they're not much like people, but of course they're extremely

1241
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:05,080
like people. They have the hypothalamus, they have the pancreas, they have the beta cells.

1242
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:12,280
There are very few things, organs or cells or circuits or hormones or whatever, that mice have

1243
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:18,360
that people don't have or vice versa. There's important subtleties. Yeah, I guess I'd push back

1244
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:24,600
a little bit in terms of some of the differences are profound, right? So one profound difference

1245
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:32,040
is herbivores versus omnivores. Now that might pose a lot less of a difference for the ITPs than

1246
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:36,760
it does for one of my pet peeves, which is the never-ending nutritional studies of mice,

1247
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:42,920
which I find generally unhelpful for that reason. And we've even discussed it today in the context

1248
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:48,840
of looking at acarbose, right? That's a nutritional intervention in some ways and it might be a little

1249
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:54,280
bit difficult to extrapolate. But I think the other area where we do need to be a little bit

1250
02:02:54,280 --> 02:03:00,840
circumspect with the use of mice is that 80% of them die of cancers, a third of which are

1251
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:09,640
hematologic. Whereas when you look at us, all humans die with atherosclerosis, about a third die from

1252
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:16,680
it. And I think that is an important distinction that basically says, this is just my own personal

1253
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:24,760
philosophy. Any effort to thwart human aging must be able to punch atherosclerosis squarely

1254
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,920
between the eyes. So let me give you a different way of thinking about this. Let me try to change

1255
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:34,280
your personal philosophy here. We gave a lot of mice some rapamycin and then instead of letting

1256
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:38,680
them die, we euthanized them at 22 months of age when most of them were still alive and fairly

1257
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:43,960
healthy. And then with the aid of a pathologist, J. Irby Wilkinson, Irby looked at dozens of

1258
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:50,680
different organs and Sue Brooks also looked at their tendons. So their tendons were youthful,

1259
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:55,880
their kidneys were youthful. They did not have changes in the heart. They did not have changes

1260
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:01,080
in the endometrium. They did not have changes in the liver. They did not have changes in the

1261
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:06,840
adrenal that were characteristic of 22 month old control mice. So the implication here is

1262
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:13,320
that even though the leading cause of death was cancer, the rapamycin was actually slowing a very

1263
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:20,600
wide range of age associated changes. Now some changes, and we don't know which ones they are,

1264
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:27,320
produce cancer in mice and in people. Some changes, and we don't know which they are,

1265
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:33,400
produce atherosclerosis or strokes or diabetes in people and in a small fraction of mice.

1266
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:40,200
So from my perspective, the details of what you're going to die of, whether it's mostly a stroke,

1267
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:46,680
mostly atherosclerotic in nature, or mostly neoplastic, they're certainly important if you're

1268
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,840
if you've got a patient, if you want to help that patient, or if you're looking for disease specific

1269
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:56,600
drugs. But my interest is not related to that. It's to what can we do to slow the aging process?

1270
02:04:56,600 --> 02:05:02,760
And I think it's a very plausible, at least plausible idea that when you slow the aging,

1271
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:08,840
whatever diseases afflict the members of that species will be slowed down as well. Alzheimer's

1272
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:13,880
disease, for instance, does not ordinarily occur in mice. It's obviously a major hassle for people.

1273
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:18,840
Yet if you make a mouse that has some aspects of Alzheimer's disease and you're given these drugs,

1274
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:26,840
the disease is postponed. And so that's consistent with the notion that whatever diseases aging

1275
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:36,200
leads to in either species, anti-aging medications will help retard. Cause of death is an important

1276
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:43,080
wrinkle, but only an elaboration of the aging process in a species specific way.

1277
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:48,760
And I think this also speaks to the importance of whenever possible starting younger, although again,

1278
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:54,120
rapamycin almost flies in the face of that. But the earlier you would start, the more opportunity

1279
02:05:54,120 --> 02:06:00,440
you would have to beneficially impact those tendons, those nephrons, those cardiac myocytes,

1280
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:05,240
and those neurons. That's a really good general point. I used to agree with that completely.

1281
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:11,960
And now I think one has to answer that question directly point by point by point. The fact that

1282
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:17,880
giving 17 alphestridiol or acarvos or rapamycin to middle aged mice, and you still get a nice

1283
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:24,600
postponement of whatever the lethal process is, that argues against the notion that many, many

1284
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:30,280
things have to start early. In addition, this is again published now. This is Mike Garrett's paper

1285
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:37,800
with John Herrera and Charlene Day. When they started treating some old mice with 17 alphestridiol,

1286
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:45,000
they postponed or reversed. It's hard to tell. Muscle changes, muscle grip strength changes,

1287
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,880
rotor rod ability, the ability to stand on a rotating rod and changes in old age and glucose

1288
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:57,000
tolerance. So it may be that despite my personal intuition, which is similar to the intuition that

1289
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:04,200
you just expressed, the evidence starts to suggest some aspects of aging can be reversed or

1290
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:08,840
prevented even if you're starting in late middle age. That would be cool if it was true. I would

1291
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:14,440
have bet against it, but I may be wrong. Has your conviction about any of the molecules you've

1292
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:20,360
tested in the ITP led to you taking any? I prefer not to answer that because I'm not a doctor and I

1293
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:25,880
would never, ever wish to recommend drugs to someone else, take them too seriously. I wasn't

1294
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:30,200
going to ask you which, but we'll leave it at that. We'll leave it at that. Rich, this has been

1295
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:34,440
an awesome discussion. I mean, I was really looking forward to this and I honestly think

1296
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:40,680
you have one of the coolest jobs in the world because you get to basically hear from anybody

1297
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:47,640
and everybody who has an idea about something that might extend life in a very straightforward

1298
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:54,280
intervention, which is if a person, if a person in this case, if a mouse takes this drug, will it

1299
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:59,720
extend their life? And you get to test this in a highly reproducible manner with two great

1300
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:06,920
colleagues. And you've basically got this well-oiled machine that produces these fantastic studies,

1301
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:12,280
which both positive and negative continue to add to the body of knowledge we have. I want to close

1302
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:16,920
with something really funny and you probably don't want me to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway.

1303
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:22,760
So in 15 years ago, you wrote something really hilarious at the MIT technology review. Do you

1304
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:27,160
know where I'm going with this? I remember the piece pretty well. Yes, I wrote it right here at

1305
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:33,240
this desk. Okay. So early morning, it was six in the morning. I couldn't sleep. I had an hour.

1306
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:39,880
I just felt in the mood to be mean. So I wrote the piece. Yeah. So Aubrey De Grey must have done

1307
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:46,200
something on television that you must have watched. Had he basically gone on TV and said,

1308
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:52,600
no, I made that part up. I'd been hearing Aubrey speak over and over and over and over again

1309
02:08:53,160 --> 02:09:00,040
for many years. I fantasized that he had made a television appearance and I wanted to enlist his

1310
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:04,840
help. And basically what you said is I'm going to read just the first part of this to Aubrey.

1311
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:11,240
So the MIT tech review published this. I saw you on TV the other day and I was hoping that now that

1312
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:17,480
the aging problem has been solved, you might have time to help me in my publicity campaign to solve

1313
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:23,240
a similar engineering challenge, one that has been too long ignored by the ultra conservative

1314
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:30,200
fraidy cat mainstream scientific community. The problem of producing flying pigs, a theoretical

1315
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:37,160
analysis of the problem using the fastest available modern computers shows that there are a mere

1316
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:45,800
seven reasons why pigs cannot at present fly. One, they do not have wings. Two, they are too

1317
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:54,280
heavy to get off the ground. Three, the so-called law of gravity. Four, they cannot climb trees.

1318
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:04,840
Five, hair instead of feathers. Six, they do not wish to fly. And seven, they do not tweet. Now

1319
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:10,360
this is really funny because you wrote this prior to Twitter. When I read this, I was like, what does

1320
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:14,680
tweeting have to do with anything? And of course, I had to remind myself Twitter didn't even exist in

1321
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:19,400
2005. I'm not going to read the rest of this, but we're going to link to it in the show notes

1322
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:24,440
because it is a brilliant, you go into great detail elaborating on each of your points.

1323
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:32,120
But this is to me really a great example of who you are, right? Which is you're grounded in reality

1324
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:38,360
and you don't buy into this idea that immortality is in our future. And you view it as an enormous

1325
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:45,000
win if there's a drug out there that can extend human life by 25%. I'm in your camp, Rich. I'm

1326
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,280
highly biased and I've seen nothing to suggest that immortality is in our future. And frankly,

1327
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:57,400
I'm not sure it should be even if we were ever given the choice. But boy, 10 to 15% improvement

1328
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:01,320
in our lifespan and health span would be a remarkable achievement. And if there are

1329
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:06,280
molecules that can do that, I'm glad you're working on them. Well, I'm delighted to have

1330
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:11,480
been invited. A friend of mine said that he'd been on your podcast a number of times and had a

1331
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:16,120
wonderful, wonderful time and told me if I ever got a chance, I would enjoy it too. And this is a

1332
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:21,480
very good prediction. It's a real treat to be interviewed by someone who really knows the stuff

1333
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:28,280
and also asks the very best question. So I'm honored to have been added to your roster of guests.

1334
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:33,000
This has been a great pleasure for me. Rich, thank you for taking the leap of faith and sharing
