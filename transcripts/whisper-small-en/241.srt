00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,240
Rick, great to have you back and great to be spending time with you. Obviously, we had

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,940
dinner last night, which was wonderful. Thanks for coming to Austin.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,680
That was such a treat last night, getting to see you in full dad mode and beautiful

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,240
family and great meal and lots of protein.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Indeed, lots of protein. Although we're in touch constantly from the standpoint of the

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,980
listeners, the last time they got to interact with you was probably almost exactly three

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,760
years ago, 2019. Sometimes when I have folks back on, especially if it's a technical podcast,

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,520
I want to talk about, okay, well, what's new information since that time? Well, this obviously

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,600
isn't very technical. Hopefully, folks remember a lot of the story that we talked about.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,080
But nevertheless, what do you think of as the highs and lows for you of the last three

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,960
years? Because I know there have been both. Gosh, Peter, go back to that time. We had

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,080
a specific conversation about leadership. We were talking about leaders are only leaders

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,760
in a time of crisis. We had talked about how the last decade had been super benign and

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,920
how do we show up in crisis? And then 60 days later, 90 days later, boom, COVID hits.

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,840
So a lot of change, if you think about it, the last three years have been the most tumultuous

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,720
three years, no matter where you are in the world, not in any one country. And then you

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,360
layer that with lots and lots of changes. My kids have gone to college. My mother, which

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
we talked a lot about in the podcast, and my father-in-law and my aunt, which was, I

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,400
guess, like a mom all passed in that window. Our business went aggressively into offense

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,880
when the market changed because we saw some opportunities. We bought some very meaningful

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,160
businesses and then everything kind of further imploded in one way. And then now we're living

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,480
in the middle of a war, in the middle of uncertainty and all of that. But so the world always keeps

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,360
changing and surprising us. We tend to project kind of today's reality into the future, but

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:30,680
it's always changing. And how much of your even keel around all of these events, personal and

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:39,560
professional, do you attribute to what happened in January of 2009? In terms of perspective, I mean.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:47,720
Yeah, yeah. A lot. You know, I really, I don't have a lot of lows. I, you know, I don't have a

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,840
lot of high highs. I just, to me, it's this understanding that this too shall pass and

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,320
really doing what you can in the moment when you can is all that you really can do. And if you

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,360
don't tie yourself up to the outcome as much and you're just really trying to stay in the process,

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,080
I really am able to navigate this in great part because of that experience.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,920
One of the things we spoke about in the first podcast that, you know, you always have these

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,920
moments of podcasts that sort of stick with you. And that's probably true for a listener. It's

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,200
certainly true for the person doing the interview. There were handful of moments. One of them was

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,240
this image of raising children is playing a game of tug of war that you eventually lose. Now, you

36
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,280
can't lose it immediately, right? You can't just say, ready, go, let go of the rope. Right.

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,000
But by the time they're, you know, off to college, they've pulled you over the line metaphorically.

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,680
At the time we had that discussion, you were still engaged in that tug of war that your kids

39
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,080
were not yet in college. Now they are. I'm in the middle of that game. But I think about that

40
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:03,000
constantly. Maybe start by retelling a little bit of that and explaining kind of if at all

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,320
your thinking has evolved or what you've learned about that game in the last few years. Yeah. So

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:15,320
that was probably the last meaningful lesson I got from my mom. She had, you know, onset of

43
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Alzheimer's and, you know, we would have moments of that. And I came and I was having coffee with

44
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,400
her and I asked her some advice about our daughter who was in plenty teenagerhood. And what she said

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,480
was she said she looked at me and said, my son raising teenagers is a tug of war. And then there

46
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,600
was this silence. And then she says that you ultimately must lose. And it is, you know, like

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,560
you said, you know, such a such an insightful, you know, all encompassing statement about parenting.

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,400
And it's really the transition from really being there will always be your kid, but you will not

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,760
always be their parent. And is that transition from no longer being their parent and maybe being more

50
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,400
of a coach, maybe being more of an advisor, a friend, all of that, they'll all you will always

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,000
treat them like your kid. So in our example, we're on the other side of this. I don't think of myself

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,760
anymore as, you know, the parent. I will always be that, but I'm not the parent. So the conversations

53
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,160
are very different and I love it. There have been times where both of our kids have looked at us

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,640
and said, I really appreciate your opinion, but this is what I'm choosing to do. And to me, that's

55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,440
a sign of, you know, really good kind of sense of your own decisions. And we disagree with them,

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,160
but it is like good to see them in their journey of, of adulting now on their own.

57
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,960
Yeah. I don't know why I'm not looking forward to it, but it's one of those things that you know

58
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,400
is healthy, good, important, but, you know, but have you noticed a difference in teenagerhood and

59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,440
how they start pushing away? Oh yeah. And I've always believed that the reason why teenagers are

60
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,400
such a pain is so that you don't miss them when they leave. And I tell you, we love our kids and

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,120
we're lucky that our kids love us back, but we were, we high fived each other when we dropped them off.

62
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,920
We did not cry. We were like, you know what, they're ready. We're ready. And, and empty nesting is,

63
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,240
it's a beautiful thing. You know, you still talk to them all the time and you still see them and all

64
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,320
that. So nothing, you know, but it's a, then the funny part is that they're doing the same things

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,080
that drove you crazy. You just don't see it. So it doesn't feel as, as intense.

66
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,800
So let's talk a little bit about, well, I want to bring up something that, that happened kind of

67
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,520
recently over the summer that I thought was spectacular. So early summer you, you, you call

68
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:45,160
me and said, Hey, I'm, I'm having a get together in July, you know, a couple of days and I'm inviting,

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,920
you know, you gave me a bunch of details, none of which meant anything to me, right? What I took

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,440
away from it was you wanted me to come out for a couple of days to your home. And there was going

71
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,800
to be a bunch of other guys there, at least one of whom I knew, but most of whom I did not. And

72
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,520
you, you prefaced it by saying, look, I know it's a big ask. I know how much you hate to travel. I know.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,600
And you will have, I had just come back from traveling. I was just leaving the next day. I

74
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,120
would have to fly back and then hop right on a plane. But you really urged me to come. And

75
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:24,200
interestingly, I thought it was a birthday. Yeah. And so I sort of committed that I would think about

76
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,480
it and then talked about it with my wife and said, you know, I think this is special to Rick. I'm

77
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,560
going to go because I have a feeling it's one of those things where I'll spend the entire flight

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,760
there kicking myself for going. But if I don't go, I suspect months later I'll kick myself for not

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,760
going. So there's an asymmetry and regret. Yeah. So I ended up going and it had nothing to do with

80
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,080
your birthday, which I think was like five months earlier. So I don't know where I got that from.

81
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,480
Tell us about kind of what was the motivation for that and why do you think that ended up being

82
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,400
a really special time for, were there 40 of us there or something? About 30. Yeah. Okay.

83
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,880
You know, when you go back through your year and you go back and ask yourself what was truly

84
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:20,040
memorable of the year, at least in my case, there may be eight or 10 things that you will remember,

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,760
you know, well into the future. And what is universal about those things is they're usually

86
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,320
experiences and their experiences with people that you have a deep connection with. So I have

87
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,040
become very, very focused on creating experiences with people that I love as a way to create

88
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,640
memorable moments of the year. Because I think that really is what we grow old with is the

89
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,120
memories. But the memories alone are not enough is the memories with people and the more that kind

90
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,200
of the richer. So I wanted to experiment with the concept of, you know, let's create a friend summit.

91
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,720
Let's bring 30 super interesting friends. The uniqueness of it is everybody's been curated by

92
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,160
me. Everybody there was a friend. So I think immediately everybody showed up with like, okay,

93
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,600
if they're Rick's friends, I'm going to be open-minded. I'm not there kind of doing like, what do

94
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,560
you do? Who do you are? Is more around how do you know Rick and then what is interesting about each

95
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,680
other. And then, you know, we had a lot of the same participants speak and, you know, that we curated

96
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,640
the that we don't over-orchestrated, but we curated the agenda. And then we had all sorts of things

97
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,000
around food and magician and all this other stuff. And the greatest thing happened, which is one of

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,880
the things that I love most is when my good friends become great friends. And I know for a fact,

99
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,800
because I was with Rick Hendrick a week ago and we spent 15 minutes talking about you, about Matt

100
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,720
Walker, about other people that you guys all have become friends. And what greater currency in life

101
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,280
than, you know, spreading love through friendship. And it was a huge home run because everybody there,

102
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,560
even those who came as a gift to me, I think left with the gift of new friends. And at our age,

103
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,120
it's not easy to make good new friends. And it is something that we can do by leveraging our

104
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,520
own friendships. And you've been good to me in this regard. I asked you when I heard, you know,

105
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,280
your interview with Matt, I say, hey, would you introduce me? And we had, we become dear, dear

106
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,080
friends. Like I talk to him all the time. So I don't know, it's all around this currency that

107
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,000
friendships really matter in life, memories, you know, memorable moments really matter. And how do

108
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,880
you bring all that together? Yeah, no, I was surprised by the number of guys I walked away

109
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,240
from that meeting with who I couldn't wait to see again. And, you know, it's like, hey, look,

110
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,160
when I'm in LA, I'll give you a call when you're in Austin. You give me a call. What, what did you

111
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,880
learn that, that during that summit, because there were, you know, there was some structure to it as

112
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
well, where there were folks that, you know, it was kind of like a bunch of fireside chats, effectively.

113
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,520
Did anything surprise you? Did you learn anything?

114
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,600
I learned don't schedule something like that right after a vacation, because I spent my whole

115
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,040
vacation thinking about, because I, in essence, kind of interview most people, including you.

116
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,920
So that was a lesson, which is, you know, create some gap between something in your relaxing time.

117
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:38,360
I learned that, you know, I think all of us, no matter what, need moments like that, were

118
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,240
no matter who you are to the outside world, you are, you know, you're the one and the same in that

119
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,960
group. So, you know, there were professional athletes, there were governors, there were CEOs,

120
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,000
there were, you know, true people, like, are exceptional in their field like you, but everybody

121
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,560
there was the same. So I think that this knows, this essence of like, you know, the guard can be

122
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,080
down from everybody. And never be, I got to like hang out with 30 of my best friends and give lots

123
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,360
of hugs and catch up and have moments and create memories. And, you know, relationships take a lot

124
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,920
of effort. And that was a really efficient way to like, make huge deposits into a bunch of important

125
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,400
accounts. I'm blanking on his name, but he was the older gentleman on the very last day that spoke.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah. Walter Green. No, no, no, no, I remember Walter. Marshall Rush. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,920
Walter was amazing in his own right. And actually, Walter's someone I want to have on the podcast.

128
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,480
You should. Yeah. So, so we know it's really funny. We used to be neighbors in San Diego and

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,960
didn't even know it. Oh my goodness. Lived in the same neighborhood, like lived a mile from each

130
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,160
other. I love Walter Green. You know, Walter mentors, I don't know, a hundred people like us

131
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,960
and we're all better because of it. Yeah. So, so that's, that's someone on our, on our, on our hit

132
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,000
list for, for podcast guests. But yeah. So Marshall, who's like, I don't know, I guess 200

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,960
years old. 99 actually. Yeah. And I think from Marshall came one of the most interesting lessons

134
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:19,160
that you drew out and it's a lesson about looking forward versus looking backward and how that ties

135
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,720
to age. Do you want to, do you want to recount that story? Yeah. So I've known Marshall about 20 years.

136
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:32,600
I've had, I don't know, a hundred lunches with Marshall. And so when I met him, he was probably

137
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,840
81, 82, and he was still driving and he'll come in and, and there was something about Marshall.

138
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,440
There is something about Marshall that is incredibly appealing and attractive. And is that

139
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,200
every time you see him once a month, every other month, he has a list of things that he has learned

140
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,960
that he wants to talk about. He has ideas about things he wants to do. He's constantly evolving

141
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,280
and thinking. And what I've learned from Marshall is that your age really can be told by what you

142
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,840
think about aging of our spirit, not of our bodies, not of our mind, but of our spirit.

143
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,400
It's really about which mirror you're using. Are you using the rear view mirror or the windshield?

144
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,120
And he is like, you know, I told a story there, right, where he's like completely worried about

145
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,200
one of his kids and really thinking about giving them a tough lesson because it is time. And,

146
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,480
you know, he's asking for my opinion. I said, Mark, I said, Marshall, how old is your son? And he goes,

147
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,520
72. So it was a point of like, you know, he never stopped thinking in doing that. And that's how he

148
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,640
leaves. Listen, he turns 100 in February and we're going to do something super special, I hope.

149
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,360
The other story I like about him was I think when he was 96, he came to you with a with a

150
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,440
pretty serious business idea. And it was really predicated on trends over the next 10 years.

151
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,000
Correct.

152
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,440
And it was like, look, today, this isn't necessarily an enormous opportunity, but

153
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,520
here's all the data for why 10 years from now, this is a home run. We need to act now and make

154
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,800
sure we build this business. And you're sort of thinking, you're 96 years old. Why are you

155
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,080
thinking about a business opportunity that's going to, you know, mushroom in the next 10 years?

156
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,680
You know, and he was a senator for North Carolina for 26 years. There's a highway name after him.

157
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,280
His uniqueness, he's Jewish, but he made all his money selling Christmas ornaments,

158
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,200
like all the things that are so unique about him. And he's incredibly close to his kids and

159
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,560
his grandkids. And, you know, he sees the world so clearly, even when you talk about current events

160
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,120
and politics today, he has a wisdom about, you know, he literally played basketball at Duke in

161
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,200
1939, I believe. Right. And, you know, he went to World War II, like this guy and all of that,

162
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,480
you know, and he's had tremendous hardships. He lost his wife. He's lost some kids. And, you know,

163
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,440
he's the dignity by which he handles it is just distilled in a wisdom of life that I find super

164
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,320
attractive. I really think, and again, this is one of those, there's like the soft science and

165
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,240
there's the hard science, you know, I spent most of my life thinking about the hard science of

166
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,120
living longer, the things that we can measure, the metrics we can measure, the biomarkers we can

167
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,520
measure, how we can predicate our assumptions of risk based on X, Y, and Z. But there's simply no

168
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,520
question that there are these soft metrics that we can't quantify, but they must matter. And I look

169
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,280
at my dad as an example of this. So my dad, who is 85 years old, not the healthiest guy in the world,

170
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,680
but he has outlived everybody in his completely unhealthy family by more than two decades. And

171
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,920
this is a guy who came from a family where there were, you know, nine kids, one died as a child,

172
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,760
the other seven have all died. Again, nobody came close to his longevity. And to be clear,

173
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,320
he's not remotely a beacon of health. Like, even as your dad, huh? No, no, no. I wouldn't listen to

174
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,680
a thing I've said if my life depended on it, nevermind the fact that his life depends on it.

175
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:25,880
And look, he probably doesn't have that many years left on this planet. But I deep down believe that

176
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,000
his relatively modest longevity, again, relative to what I think his genetic capacity comes down to

177
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,040
exactly this phenomenon, is everything he never is looking back. He is planning, he is planning,

178
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:48,520
he's got an idea. I mean, you know, when he should have been retiring, he was

179
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:57,000
you know, he bought quarries, he bought like swaths of undeveloped limestone land, you know,

180
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,200
in his sixties with the idea that this is going to be, you know, there will be a demand for high

181
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,840
quality limestone dolomite and granite in the next 30 years. And that's what he's out there in

182
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,960
a quarry every day, barely able to walk because his knees are so, you know, messed up. And I'm

183
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,480
convinced to my greatest sadness that one day he's going to fall on these rocks and smash his

184
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,080
head or something. But it's like the idea of just sitting around couldn't possibly occur to him,

185
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,880
let alone, you know, relaxing. Now, again, we could talk about whether I think there's some,

186
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,920
maybe one should enjoy life a little bit more. But for him, I think enjoyment is building and

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,960
is thinking about opportunity like, well, you know, there's this niche for this market of

188
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,200
limestone that nobody has really appreciated the value of, and that's where he's going to

189
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,960
pour himself into. And that reminded me of that story with Marshall.

190
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,920
Yeah. And I have, I've studied a lot of people that are finishing life well,

191
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,400
seventies and eighties, because I think we're all pretty predictable. We just got to find patterns

192
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,840
that we relate to that relate to us. And I have lots of friends like, you know, Henry Kravis

193
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,680
is a very, very good friend. Henry's in his, you know, mid to late seventies. And you know what,

194
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:24,200
he is a complete stud. And I'm sure he's changed and evolved a lot as, you know, as one of the great

195
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,880
leaders in Wall Street. But he is, you sit down with him and he has more energy and more passion

196
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,720
and he's thinking more about the future. And I think there's something to be said by staying

197
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,600
in the arena. You know, even if you downshift, I think there's something to be said to,

198
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,040
you know, your brain stays connected, you stay relevant, you don't feel old because you don't

199
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,160
feel irrelevant. Have you read Arthur Brooks's book, From Strength to Strength?

200
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,120
I've read experts and experts. I listened to your podcast. I talked to him. Okay.

201
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,320
I don't know him as well as you do, but we know each other. But, you know, I think a lot of what

202
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,920
he says is it's around this and this crystallized intelligence that he talks about. I think it's

203
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,320
interesting because I am definitely, I lack about 30 points of IQ vis-a-vis the two of you.

204
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,560
Like literally I listened to the podcast and I'm like, all right, I had to pause and go look at

205
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,440
some stuff in the dictionary. But I wonder if the, you know, to me, the crystallized intelligence

206
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,240
is more to me of the evolution of our brain and the aging of our brain, but a way that we stay

207
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:36,520
productive for the tribe, for the society, more than a elevation of. It is an evolutionary of.

208
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,960
But that notwithstanding, I thought your podcast with him was tremendous.

209
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,680
Thank you. I really enjoyed speaking with Arthur. I enjoyed his book. I read it twice. And I really,

210
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:59,240
it hit home a lot because even though, you know, I'm not yet 50, there's simply no question. I don't

211
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,160
have the horsepower I had when I was 20. I mean, it's, or 25, like where I feel like I was really

212
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:13,400
at my cerebral peak. And I think, you know, as he talked about and wrote about the transition

213
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,680
from fluid to crystallize intelligence, it really gave me some comfort in accepting this transition.

214
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,200
So that to your point and why I brought this up is, yeah, I think it is important to stay on the

215
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,680
field, but I also think it's important to understand that it's okay to move to a different position.

216
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,640
Well said. Well said. And I think that replacing this notion of like, I don't have the horsepower,

217
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,280
is redefining what that horsepower is. And that gives us continued feeling of growth. I think the

218
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,720
importance of life is really not necessarily the looking forward is constantly growing.

219
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,000
I think the day that you stop growing is the day you age.

220
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,440
Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that completely. And, you know, this kind of brings it back to what we

221
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:11,000
talked about a minute ago, which is, I mean, I am sad when I think about my kids not being little,

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,520
and I'm not sure what that's about. But, you know, we talked about it very briefly at dinner yesterday,

223
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:23,080
because you got to see both my boys in complete action, which we're not shy about, right? Like,

224
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,200
we don't make any apology for the fact that they are high energy and we totally love it.

225
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:38,520
You were so physical. I really was so reminded me of my relationship, but I also felt your joy

226
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,480
and love. But what Jill and I often say to each other, and this is it, you have to say this in

227
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,200
the bad times. So yesterday they were well behaved, but, you know, there's equal number of times when,

228
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,600
I mean, you'd think that they're psychotic. I mean, you can't believe how poorly they behave,

229
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,920
you know, like, literally, Jill will kill me for even telling this publicly. Like the other day,

230
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,560
she walked by the youngest one and out of nowhere, he just took his pencil and stabbed her in the butt.

231
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,600
Unprovoked. It's not like she said, go to your room. So it's like, but in those moments I say,

232
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,600
I know it can be really hard. I will be, I would, if I could freeze time, I would, which is a totally

233
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,400
irrational thing to say. Why do you think that is? Why did you feel that way when you and your

234
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,600
kids were at this stage, which is you are their world. You're still daddy, not dad.

235
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,200
I think this is an amazing stage and I feel fortunate to be going through it a little later

236
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,960
in life when I think I can appreciate it. I think had I been presented with this 20 years earlier,

237
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:51,720
I wouldn't have had the maturity to embrace it as much maybe. No, I think that's right. You may not

238
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,560
have the same energy you would have had, but you have plenty. And especially, you know, and I think

239
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:03,160
that's straight up that we have when we have kids younger or older. You know, I think the great thing

240
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,360
about having kids is we get to kind of almost relive life. And I think there's something very

241
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,400
subconscious about, you know, rediscovering things or seeing things through their eyes

242
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,720
that brings the child back in us. You know, I think that child is a safe place in all of our

243
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:27,400
kind of personas. I also think that there's this notion of this is how we are relevant in the world.

244
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,720
This is how we are going to stay here when we're no longer here is through them.

245
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Because a lot of us will live through them. And that's why we are so committed to it. I just

246
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:46,120
think that it's and it's such a powerful job to have and responsibility that is heightened in

247
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,480
every sense and the good and the bad. And the reality is that, you know, all the things that

248
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,720
they're doing are just normally growth moments of, you know, their own brain development and all that

249
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,320
good stuff. And, you know, we talked a lot about it the last time in the podcast, but, you know,

250
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,760
and I think we weigh over parents.

251
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,520
Eric, the youngest is he's just obsessed with math right now. You know, he's five. He's starting

252
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,560
to learn how to add. And the other day we were sitting there and he he's he's sitting with me on

253
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,640
the couch. Reese is who's three years older is sitting at his desk doing some coloring. And he

254
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:30,360
goes, you know, when I'm 100, Reese is going to be 103. And then he looks at me and he goes,

255
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:38,920
how old are you going to be? Wait, 70? Then I go, no, I wish, buddy, I'm going to be long dead when

256
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:46,520
you're 100. But if I were alive, I'd be, you know, 140, whatever. But it's just first of all, that's

257
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,520
an amazing thought to me, because I do think that kids today will quite easily be 100 years old.

258
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,000
Right. Like I don't, you know, today to be 100 to make it to 100 right now is a pretty remarkable

259
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,080
feat. You know, centenarians are exceedingly rare, about 0.004 percent of the population.

260
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,840
I tend to think that kids that are born now will reach that level at a far greater frequency.

261
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,880
And so it was a bit of a sobering thought. Right. It's like I'm looking at this little chubby,

262
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,680
cute kid that I can't stop wanting to squeeze and hug and kiss and realizing he's going to be a

263
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:30,120
hundred year old man one day and I'll be probably long gone. It's all of that stuff is sobering.

264
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,040
I guess it brings me to the to the idea of how do you I mean, you strike me as a person for whom a

265
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,560
lot of purpose came from your kids. Yeah. And so as your kids are older, do you feel less of that?

266
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,160
And has that caused you to put more of your sense of purpose into something we'll talk about later,

267
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,200
like philanthropy, which is also very important to you? I know I actually I'm very challenged by

268
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,000
this notion of how do I help evolve our relationship into more of a coaching relationship

269
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,520
in a way that, you know, I can be still their father, but also be a sounding board amongst,

270
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,400
you know, many others. And this morning I had a conversation with my son, a lot around something

271
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,600
he's dealing with. And I said, I'm going to talk to you as if you were a mentee of mine. And I gave

272
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,880
him what I thought as an advice. I said, you got to do whatever you want, but I want you to know

273
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,800
that I am a resource for you. And then you're not alone in solving these problems. And just like you

274
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,520
have other people. And I've really enjoyed kind of this this morphing of the relationship. It's early

275
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:42,840
for us. So I don't I, but by the way, I think that's why people enjoy grandkids so much. It's not that

276
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,400
I can give them back when all that. Yeah, yeah, that kind of really matters. It's a chance to

277
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,720
almost do it again. Right. And do it again with lower expectations of like, oh, is it reflecting

278
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,480
on me as a parent or is it all this stuff is just, you know, we have this innate desire

279
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,800
to perpetuate ourselves and we do that through our kids. Yeah, you've probably heard me talk about

280
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:12,120
the centenary in Decathlon. And for me, one of the greatest motivations personally, and I do

281
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,440
find that for many of my patients, because we talk about this in such detail,

282
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,960
I think it's true for them also is what they want to be able to do with offspring and more

283
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,760
importantly, the children of their offspring. And you've probably seen me do this, but we do an

284
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,120
exercise where you kind of build a timeline. So you'll, you know, you put your age down and, you

285
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,600
know, you're you're these are your kids. And then you start to estimate the bracket, you know,

286
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,800
my kids will likely have kids when they are this age, this age, this age, I will therefore be this

287
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:52,760
age. And you don't need to spend too long doing this to come to the realization that the things

288
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,960
that you want to be able to enjoy doing with your grandkids will will range from kind of the really

289
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,760
extravagant, like I want to take them on the greatest vacation. We're going to go to Egypt and

290
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,480
we're going to scale, you know, the great pyramids and go down the Nile. Okay, well, that's great.

291
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Alternatively, it's going to be the really mundane. Like I want to be able to play catch.

292
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,240
You know, it's interesting. I wanted to share with you a story that I haven't sure yet,

293
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,440
which is, you know, in the end, the after the plane crash couple of weeks later, I was watching

294
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,520
my daughter perform in kindergarten. It was a really important moment of the realization of like,

295
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,880
for now, this is my most important purpose, which is to really kind of help my kids become adults.

296
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,160
And it came full circle without me knowing it. I was at her graduation from high school.

297
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,560
She's a sophomore now in college and they're coming down and it was outside because of COVID.

298
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:56,200
And they're coming down this kind of hallway in the same emotion that had not happened for,

299
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:03,640
I don't know, 11 years happened. I started bowling uncontrollably as I saw her. I didn't expect it.

300
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,600
It came out of nowhere. I'm not a crier. I'm not afraid to cry, but I'm not walking around.

301
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,040
And it was a realization that I had lived to the moment where she had become her own person.

302
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,600
And the graduation from high school was a lot more meaningful than just the graduation,

303
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,440
at least in my experience. It was a realization that she can fly on her own now. And it was

304
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,480
a moment. It was a moment for me and that realization, but then also realizing that,

305
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,160
I now have more capacity to broaden purpose. I think we're all seeking purpose. So it's not like

306
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:44,680
you finish it. It's just you evolve it. And I was very grateful to have had that experience because

307
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:51,800
seldomly in life do you get to see the end of the circle come back. It's usually a line that goes

308
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:59,160
somewhere or nowhere. So when we last spoke, I think you talked a little bit about

309
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,480
any follow up or interactions you've had with either the crew from that flight or

310
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,160
Captain Sullenberger himself. What's the latest on that? I imagine that that's it. I don't remember

311
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,960
how many people were on that flight, 150 plus the crew, 158. So there's 158 of you that

312
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm sure some people have passed away due to natural causes since, but that's a very tight-knit

313
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,560
group. I'm guessing. Do you all collectively celebrate that anniversary together?

314
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,160
Yeah, there's always something and there's Facebook groups and all that stuff. I've been more on the

315
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,400
fringe. I've participated in a couple of things. It's just time for me. And I got a lot of what I

316
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,800
needed, especially at the time from my closest friends and family. But you asked me at the last

317
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,000
podcast because we were presenting him that award at the points guy event that I had,

318
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,000
I had, you know, have I seen him enough and why not? And I told you that I was planning to do

319
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,560
something. Well, it is happening. And I don't know if you know this, but the plane itself, which

320
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:15,240
it's worth seeing because it is banged up like a plane will be banged up if it hit a wall at 150

321
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,560
some miles an hour. So it really is not the plane. It's just a shell of the plane sits in Charlotte.

322
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,840
And for a bunch of different reasons, the all hangar and museum, we lost all the facilities.

323
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,280
So the airport, they were going to move the plane to Dallas because it ended up in Charlotte because

324
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,600
that's where US air was based on. So just by total coincidence in your backyard.

325
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,240
And then there was a lot of risk that we were going to lose. And there's a bunch of other planes

326
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,120
there, but that's the anchor plane. So a number of us rally in the community. Is that normal,

327
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,080
by the way, after a plane wreck that I would have guessed that they normally scrapped planes.

328
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,800
I think this one because they wanted to keep because of the significance.

329
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:04,680
Right. And so a group of people in Charlotte rally and I made a donation with, you know, asking for

330
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,040
the naming rights. So the thing that I'm going to do to honor Sully and the crew and perpetuate,

331
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,160
you know, kind of this notion I was doing my job, remember that statement, is we're going to name

332
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,280
the museum after him and the museum will be in Charlotte in Charlotte. So we the Sullenberger

333
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,760
Aviation Museum of the Carolinas or something like that, but it will be his name. And I called him

334
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,600
to ask for his permission. And he was interesting, hesitant at first. And then he called me back and

335
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,880
you know, said, OK, let's do it. And the the naming and all of that will happen in January.

336
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,240
So we'll be a big 14th anniversary. Yeah. And it'll be a beautiful day. But, you know, I just

337
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,960
I wanted to find something that, you know, will outlast both of us as a way to

338
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,840
honor his commitment to doing his craft and to saving our lives.

339
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Yeah, it's by this point in the podcast, I think most people, if they haven't familiarized

340
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,560
yourself themselves with this story, should probably go back and listen to that. That section

341
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,720
of our podcast is the way I think you you tell that story. It's probably the longest version

342
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,840
you've told of it, because obviously you have a TED talk where you go through it in

343
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,920
in some detail, which is really moving. But I think also just the

344
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,480
you know, I'm still. So remember how I said from our first meeting, there are a couple of things

345
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,560
that stand out. The other thing that really stands out from our first podcast, which is something you

346
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,600
sort of said in almost passing. Do you know what I'm about to say? No, because I've shared this

347
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:36,280
with you. But it's when the plane is coming down and you're going once you realize there's about

348
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,960
10 seconds until you're going to die. You said a couple of things. One, it's very calm. Like it's

349
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:53,960
you weren't scared. You were sad. You're very sad. And you put your hand on your leg or on your other

350
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,320
hand on your arm and said, I love you. That's the last thing you said yourself before you would have

351
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,400
died. Close my eyes. Yeah. And I was and I just couldn't believe that. I was like, that's the last

352
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:12,840
thing I'd ever think to say. What would you have said? I don't know that I probably would have said

353
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:23,160
nothing. I probably would have just been very sad and and and yeah, I don't think there would have

354
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,400
been any gratitude or anything like that in me. Have you have you actually asked any of the other

355
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:39,400
people on the flight what they did said thought in the last 10 seconds? No, but I have and and

356
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,680
and I will because I think it would be interesting. I would mean there's a whole book there. Yeah. Like

357
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:52,360
that is for sure. And remember that we had no suffering. I imagine if you're dying, you know,

358
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,560
in some level of distress, it's a different, you know, your mind is in a very different place.

359
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,880
But that's what makes this such an interesting quote unquote control experiment is yeah, you weren't

360
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,080
on fire. And it's 90 seconds. So it's not all it's not it's not it's not a lot of people have near

361
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:14,520
death experience. It lasts a second or two seconds. Right. But I've reflected a lot, Peter, on kind of

362
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,680
the the TED talk was, you know, a moment in time and it was all around, OK, here's kind of the three

363
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,480
regrets I felt as as the plane was coming down. And we talked a lot about them in the other podcast

364
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,520
but, you know, we should revisit them, by the way, just so that folks can see it all in one place.

365
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:40,040
So it was this notion that everything changes in an instant. So time really, really matters.

366
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:47,800
It was this notion that relationships are the core of the richness of life. But yet we spent a lot

367
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,600
of time with our ego, you know, kind of leading the charge. And then this notion with around my kids,

368
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:01,000
which is I wasn't living true to kind of what I, you know, discover was my true purpose at the time

369
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,760
or my main main purpose, which is seeing my kids. And it was the regret that I felt at the time of my

370
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,880
look like death to have missed it, to have not being clear that that really was the I don't know,

371
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,720
the map or the or the or the you know, the key to living a better life.

372
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,320
You know, as I reflected all of that, what's interesting is nothing has really changed,

373
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,120
but it's not around regrets. You know, I think more. Yeah. So, you know, for example,

374
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:42,280
I think instead of it being around everything changes in an instant. So, you know, living the

375
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:49,400
moment, it is that but it's wrapped around around a notion of having true intentionality

376
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,920
about how we live our life and true intentionality about how we live a lot of life is a really big,

377
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,240
deep bucket that I've spent lots and lots of time thinking about. It has a lot to do with time.

378
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,760
Right. And the reality with time and I've heard this and I love it is like the problem with time

379
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,800
is the same problem that we have most things that are free. We don't value it.

380
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,360
Right. If we like how to get up and like really spend real money on time,

381
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,520
I bet you we will behave differently. Right. And the problem with time is, as we have learned about

382
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,840
sleep, is you have to do a lot of things to extend your time, some so that you're more productive

383
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,400
the next day, like sleep and some like nutrition and exercise so that you have more time. Right.

384
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,880
So a lot of what you are really trying to do is, you know, convince people that there are things

385
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:45,080
they can do to have more quality and meaningful time. But it is a lot more than that. You know,

386
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:54,200
to me, to live with intentionality is around kind of combining a lot of things into where we spend

387
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,720
our energy and what the things that we stop doing and how do we kind of reverse things that we don't

388
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:08,760
want to do. So I really think that this notion of having complete intention is really a decor of

389
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,960
living a more rich life. So I feel my life to be very rich because I do I have like, for example,

390
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:23,480
I have two hundred and forty two weeks left until I turn 60. And, you know, I have all this little

391
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,240
exercises where I'll say, OK, you know, what are my big intentions this week? Because, you know,

392
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,280
at 60, I'm in a different energy level. I'm probably paying a bunch of physical debts back.

393
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,120
Like there's a lot that will come back. And, you know, and I live in chunks of my life with just

394
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,520
great intention. It is because of that, because I realize that everything really is, you know,

395
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,360
fleeting, but it's not just around time and time only. And that manifests itself in the second one,

396
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:58,600
when you talk about when I will you talked about relationships. What I realize is that, you know,

397
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:05,000
a little bit of the event that we were talking about. I. I want to continue to meet new people

398
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,200
that I can learn from. I am addicted to learning and growth. And the best way to do that is through

399
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,760
other people. So the amount of energy I put into friendships, because it's not relationships. You

400
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,840
know, the good news is when you're in business, you have a lot of deal friends. The key is how do

401
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,160
you convert them into real friends? Who do you want to convert into real friends? And to be a real

402
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,760
friend, talk about a skill to be learned. Like talk about it being a never ending journey. And then

403
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,680
how do you approach that? So I'm really, really, I have an enormous amount of great friends more than

404
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,400
most because I spent the bulk of my time on that. Now, if you go back to time, there's only three

405
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,960
things you can do with it. You can waste it, which a lot of teenagers do. You can use it in things

406
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,000
that are, you know, value, and then you can invest it. There's nothing else you can do with time.

407
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,200
So the ratio of what you do with those three components has a lot to do with it. So guys,

408
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,720
like you and I, at least we don't waste a lot of time. The question is, how much are you using it

409
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,120
for things that gives you pleasure or things that you want to do and how much are you investing?

410
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,840
And that will ultimately continue to pay dividends in life. So like, if you look at your time, you'll

411
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,520
know how much of that it is. And if you're using too much in something, at some point becomes

412
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,920
wasteful, if you may. So relationships are super rich. And then the last thing is, you know,

413
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,240
this notion of purpose is how do you kind of expand it? So I spent a lot of time trying to

414
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,200
continue to evolve the gift and not look at it as a moment in time, but as a some level of a map

415
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:44,920
into the future and as I continue to age. What do you think the next decade holds for you in terms

416
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,440
of Red Ventures? So maybe give us a bit of an update on, well, maybe again, remind people what

417
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,000
Red Ventures is because it's not an easy thing to explain. It's not like we make a widget.

418
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,640
No, you know, it's funny because I explained it in the last podcast three years ago differently

419
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,800
that I'm going to explain it now. It really is basically a private equity platform of companies

420
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,840
that we control. So instead of investing as a passive investor, we control a bunch of companies.

421
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:21,480
And we have about 17 companies. But, you know, those companies, the fact is we don't own 100%

422
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,200
of them, but we control all of them. And they're all over the place. They're in Europe, in Brazil,

423
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,720
we're starting the first bank in Puerto Rico in 26 years. And then we own a bunch of brands in the US,

424
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:38,360
mostly digital brands. We own services companies. So it's just really a platform of kind of tech

425
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,840
and data and digital and a really, really strong culture and a purposeful place to work.

426
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,720
How many employees do you have now? We are up to 4,500 employees.

427
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:59,480
And when I came out to visit you for a business review circa 2014, 2015, how big were you then?

428
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,000
1200. 1200. Yeah. Beautiful campus. Thank you. It's still the same? It's still beautiful. It's

429
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,680
just people are not going in as often. The world has really changed. Our relationship with world,

430
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:20,520
with work has really changed. And for both, like anything in life, everything has pros and cons.

431
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,760
I think COVID did a lot of good for society. I think COVID realized that this fixed way that

432
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,200
we thought about our relationship with work didn't have to be, and that those rules got established

433
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,760
way early in the industrial age for control. And control is a false premise in every regard.

434
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,440
But at the same time, I'll tell you my reflection on this and what I worry about a little bit,

435
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,400
and I know a little bit of a different topic. But I think that one of the unique things about the US,

436
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,640
and you don't see this in a lot of other countries, having studied a lot of Latin American countries,

437
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,920
is that the decade between 20 and 30 is a decade of true apprenticeship. And that all these

438
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,160
companies and corporations and hospital systems, they're really training people into their second

439
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,880
third of life. So you spend the first decade of your life. Hopefully, if you're lucky, you have

440
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,040
good enough parents where you learn a lot, then school becomes a place you work, and then whatever

441
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,480
your profession is, that third decade of life is incredibly important. And that's where you really

442
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,960
built a lot of depth and learn on someone else's nickel and all this stuff. And I worry that we're

443
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,240
going to look back in 10 years in the US will have lost a sense of competitiveness, because a lot of

444
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,400
these people coming into the workforce are getting a fraction of the tutoring and coaching and

445
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,160
experiences and intuition that they would have had. And 30, 40 years from now, we will have lost

446
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,680
a lot of our edge because we stopped investing in the people and their creativity and their skill.

447
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,720
Meaning that's a downside of not being in an immersive culture.

448
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,960
At least for that segment of that age of the population. Now, I would argue that, I think

449
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,920
what we learned in COVID is flexibility is king, and we should celebrate and look for flexibility.

450
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,600
And we shouldn't be able to sacrifice raising kids if you're a working mother or working father,

451
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,400
to the sacrifices that we made, or we don't have to travel crazy like we were traveling. So a lot

452
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:31,480
of that is baked into changes in the rules of engagement. But this is all a moment in time.

453
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,880
If we go into a recession, some of these habits may return. I hope we never lose the flexibility

454
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,040
we gain. I don't love going to work every day at the same time and leaving at the end of the day.

455
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,480
I love having a lot more freedom. And I think most people do.

456
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:52,920
Do we know if, I mean, presumably there are certain jobs that work really well remotely versus not,

457
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,320
and there are presumably certain types of people who work really well remotely versus not.

458
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,400
I don't have, haven't spent much time sort of looking at any of this, but I imagine given

459
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,560
size of your company and the footprint of Red Ventures, do you have any insights into that?

460
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,960
I think there's two components to that. One is productivity, which is,

461
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,400
at least in some functions, fairly easy measured. And so we have lots of editors that write

462
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,880
real content. They are as productive or more. If they don't have to commute and do lots and lots

463
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:31,240
of things that are distracting in the office. There are some places in engineering where that

464
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,280
is also true. Maybe some of the places in the back-end engineering where you're not doing a lot

465
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:43,880
of collaboration. But by and large, and those people, net-net, you would argue that remote,

466
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,680
not hybrid, very different things, you know, net-net may be more positive. Now, the second side of that

467
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:58,600
equation, I think being alone or being in your home every day has a real tax on mental health.

468
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:06,440
I think we are, we're designed to be with others. And I don't think we know the real

469
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,920
value or tax on that. Now, a lot of the other jobs, hybrid in my opinion,

470
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,040
you're collaborating with people where you're learning experientially, where you're building

471
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,720
intuition. It's a healthier way to gain expertise on something.

472
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,240
Do you mean hybrid, like you come in sometimes and you work remote sometimes?

473
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,920
Yeah. And there's a lot of things we do during the week that you don't need to be in a place.

474
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:41,320
My hope is that ultimately work evolves into what are the things that require people to be together

475
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,960
versus what are not. And then depending on where you are in your career and your, you know,

476
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,920
your proficiency, you have even more flexibility.

477
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,440
How long do you think you'll be doing Red Ventures as your quote unquote day job versus

478
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,720
working on some of the many things that seemingly are of just as much interest to you,

479
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,400
but are more on the nonprofit side?

480
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:14,280
You know, I feel super healthy in great part. Thanks to you. I literally, I feel like I've

481
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:23,720
at least slowed down a lot of the aging and I'm really grateful. So as long as I feel healthy,

482
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,320
I love this perch. I don't, back to the Marshall conversation, I don't intend to, you know, I never

483
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,600
want to replace happy with happier in anything in life. And I'm happy as can be, you know, and,

484
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,160
you know, and, you know, would it continue to evolve? Yes. Would it continue to, you know,

485
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,400
change? And, you know, the one of the big ahas in COVID, you know, COVID to me was unique in so many

486
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,760
ways. When I got to do something for a second time, which we usually don't do in life, when something

487
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,480
kind of goes away, goes away, the fact that we got our kids home for like a year and a half,

488
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,200
it was, it was, it was wonderful. But, you know, I think the,

489
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,440
the, the, for me, Red Ventures will continue to evolve. But what will happen is a lot of our

490
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,160
companies will kind of gain independence. So instead of Red Ventures being one thing,

491
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:18,520
we will find the right outcomes and, you know, in marriages of a lot of our businesses with the

492
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,400
right partners and allow those people to become CEOs of their own businesses and will create

493
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,760
monetization and return for our investors. But our ability to stay private and stay independent

494
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,880
and stay away from all the other stuff that public companies have to deal with, it's non-negotiable.

495
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:40,040
So I see Red Ventures in a bizarre way, returning to its roots in the next 25 years to a much simpler

496
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,880
thing where most of our businesses will evolve out. We'll continue to buy businesses in the next

497
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:52,040
10 years. But my guess is when I turn 80, I'll have 15 people and we will be hoping to give all

498
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,560
our money away. Speaking of giving money away, you've reached a point where you've

499
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,960
recently signed the Giving Pledge. Yeah, about a year and a half ago.

500
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,840
So tell us a bit about that. I mean, I think people have heard of the Giving Pledge, but what,

501
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,440
what does it mean and what type of people can sign it and what are the implications of it?

502
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:21,160
You know, it was, it was not something that we did without a lot of trepidation. You know, we had,

503
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,880
it's something that really Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett started. And it was

504
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,560
around creating consciousness of the people that have had more luck than others in creating real

505
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:37,560
wealth to create a commitment and responsibility that you will give at least 50% of that wealth

506
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,680
back. That's what the pledge is about. And that's, that's during your lifetime as well, correct?

507
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,720
Yeah. Or, or when you die, it doesn't matter. But you are committing, that's, that's the pledge you

508
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,280
sign. And there's hundreds of people that have signed it all over the world. So it's a bit of

509
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,520
a community too, where you learn how to give it in ways that reflect what you want to do and all

510
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,120
of that. So there's real value to being part of the community. When we first, you know, met and we,

511
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,000
we had, we had the privilege of having dinner in Omaha with Warren Buffett and they were trying to

512
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,600
convince people at the time, our kids were still in high school and we didn't want this burn because

513
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,560
it does create negative energy around it. And there, you know, it gives a lot of people.

514
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,280
Meaning because it makes public the amount of wealth that you have.

515
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah, it is a threshold, which at the time we were, we were a private company, so no one had

516
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,680
known, but when the New York Times wrote an article and all this stuff, it kind of became public what

517
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,040
it was, but it's just more, I wanted to shelter them from anything that negative that may come

518
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,320
out of that. And it's just not, it's just, we're too young. So we waited until they went to college.

519
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,240
So when they went to college, they called back and said, Hey, you said when your kids work out of

520
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:52,840
college, you do it. And so we, when we did, and we're grateful we did, but you know, we, we plan,

521
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,600
we were planning to do this anyway. And we do it more as a, you know, as a, as a pledge that

522
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,880
hopefully others realize that this only works if it works for everybody. It doesn't work if it works

523
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,320
only for a few and, you know, putting it back into the system in the core, that's what you're hoping

524
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:15,560
to do. Did you ever hear the podcast I did with John Arnold? I did not. Okay. So definitely one

525
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,200
you'll want to listen to. So John and Laura Arnold, who've also signed the giving pledge

526
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:26,600
are probably two of the most deliberate philanthropists I've ever met. John was,

527
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,720
I think you could say hands down the most successful energy trader in the history of energy

528
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:41,000
trading. And he, he was a, he was a trader at Enron right out of college and became their most

529
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
successful trader. In fact, I, if I'm not mistaken, I think his personal book of business was

530
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,160
generating a billion dollars a year for Enron, just his own personal trades. When Enron imploded,

531
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,600
you know, he was handed a severance check of something like $5 million and he took every

532
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,720
penny of it, put it into his fund and went on a 10 year tear of unparalleled returns, something

533
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:13,960
like 30% per month, per month. Okay. So, you know, at the time that John shut his fund down,

534
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:23,320
which I think was 2011 or 2012 before the age of 40, he basically completely turned himself to what

535
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,800
he's been doing for the last 10 years, which is just philanthropy, but doing it with a level of

536
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:34,360
rigor and analytics that, in other words, he's done something that I think is really interesting

537
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:40,280
and highlights something really hard, which is it's actually not that easy to give away billions

538
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,800
of dollars. I mean, if you want to do it intelligently, I mean, you can obviously

539
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:53,880
give money to entities that, you know, build buildings, you know, build a hospital. Those

540
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,040
things are, those things are great. But, you know, when you look at the sort of projects that John is

541
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:06,760
interested in, it takes time. And I think John and his wife correctly came to the realization

542
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,640
that they can't wait until they're, you know, 65 to start doing this. They will run out of time

543
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:20,520
because they have too much money. How do you think about that balance? Because I know there are things

544
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,560
that you are really committed to. Maybe we can talk about some of those things. The two that jump

545
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:32,680
to mind, of course, are the children, you know, sort of, I forget the exact name for undocumented

546
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:39,400
kids who are born here, not born here, but brought here, young, educated here, and then can't work.

547
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,680
And then, of course, a lot of disaster relief in Puerto Rico, but also just infrastructure and

548
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:51,640
building up there. So let's talk a bit about these things. So first, I really think that only

549
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,920
governments have the muscle to really solve problems. And I think even people with the wealth

550
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,040
of Bill and Melinda Gates have come to a lot of that conclusion. You can attack singular problems

551
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,440
and maybe, you know, eradicate a disease or something like that. If you have billions and

552
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,800
billions of dollars, but through systemic issues, I think the role of any, you know, non-profit is

553
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,240
to gain momentum, to create a roadmap, to create the case for governments to really put real funding

554
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:24,600
behind things or create the systemic changes to change it. So I don't think that the illusion of

555
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,120
like, we're going to fix a real issue. To me, this is more around. But there is something you,

556
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,960
or when I say you, I don't just mean you personally, but I mean, there is something

557
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,880
that the philanthropist can do that the government won't do, which is you can take a risk financially

558
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,920
that a government can't do. You can demonstrate a proof of principle that, as you said, then becomes

559
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,280
a template or roadmap for a policymaker to say, well, here's a pilot study that was done that

560
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,840
demonstrated X, Y, and Z. This was very high risk. We never would have done it, but oh my God, look

561
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:00,600
what we learned. This is now something that could be replicated at scale and you bring in. So in other

562
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,440
words, the private, the philanthropist can effectively function as the angel investor or

563
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:13,800
the early stage VC and the government comes in as the PE investor. Yeah. And in that regard, I think

564
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,000
bringing an entrepreneurial spirit and putting real kind of business savviness behind it is

565
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,160
really important. So I do believe that, but I love the, I think it was Jeff Bezos a long time ago.

566
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:33,560
He said something around, you know, in philanthropy, you're not really necessarily

567
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,480
looking for the perfect business plan. You know, if you're helping somebody, you're doing good.

568
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,280
And then that's a little of my approach, like do things that are good for the world and good,

569
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,600
and it's good for one person, then you're doing something and trying to do it in scale and with

570
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:54,440
purpose and all of that. As it relates to what we're doing, Peter, it's, you know, it keeps evolving.

571
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:03,080
You know, we've now, we're really focused on this, you know, 16 to 24. That's our concentration on

572
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,640
people that are under-resourced and it is more than undocumented kids, although we just close

573
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,480
our applications again. And these kids are still in limbo, meaning, you know, there's still, there's

574
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:20,280
no path to anything. They just have this basically a permit that gets renewed, but no one can get the

575
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,800
permit anymore. So every year, about 80,000 kids are graduating high school that, you know, have

576
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,320
no ability to get a work permit. It's just insane. It is insane. So just so people understand, these

577
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,400
are kids that came here undocumented. So they're born in another country. They've come here.

578
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,440
They've grown up here though. They've gone to high school here. They could go to college,

579
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:46,040
but they wouldn't get financial aid because of course they're not residents. So tell me what

580
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,160
actually happens. What, how many of them say I have to go back to the country I was born in versus

581
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:56,040
I'm going to get in college and somehow take a bunch of debt without any financial aid? Like,

582
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:03,000
my guess is that 95% of them end up taking minimum wage shops or kind of

583
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,320
you know, jobs that are, you know, underground and stuff like that. Like where, where, where,

584
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,040
where, because you really, you know, now there was a process there where you can get a DACA permit

585
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,440
and there's, there's 650,000 of these kids that have DACA permits. So you can, you can work.

586
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,760
Unfortunately about that, you know, in the last administration, DACA got rescinded. So there's no

587
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:31,480
new DACA. So if you're a high school student and you're 17, you know, you can't get a work permit.

588
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,840
So at that point you were, you grew up here, your family's now here going back to your original

589
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,160
country, country at origin may happen, but it's really, really hard. You have no roots there.

590
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,400
You have no resources. You may not even know the language for that matter. Right. So I think that

591
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,040
that's the, that's the craziness of this. We, we're, what's the distribution of where these kids

592
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,040
are from? Do we have a sense? Probably 90% Latin America, probably two thirds of those Mexico,

593
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,160
just because of how they're, I mean illegally, but, but you see them a lot from Southeast Asia.

594
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,880
And other places we just, our, our yearly scholarship grant, we just got 1200 applicants,

595
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,880
literally close last week. I believe over 300 of them have close to a 4.0.

596
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,320
You're providing scholarships for these kids to go to college because they don't need to be

597
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,720
residents to go to college. They just need the funding.

598
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,400
The funding. Yeah. So you don't get in, you don't get federal financial aid and about half the

599
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,560
states don't get you in state tuition. So it's almost like you would have to go to school as a,

600
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,640
you know, to a private school and pay 60, 70 grand a year.

601
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,920
And is the investment you're making, Rick, that if these kids crush it in college,

602
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,080
they're going to get an H-1B visa on the back end, or they're going to, they're going to land in

603
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:48,520
some legitimate dual intent visa with a path to citizenship based on their education.

604
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:54,280
Well, until three years ago, because the world DACA, they had a path to getting jobs. And there's

605
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,320
many now that have jobs, right? We, we put, we have 520 kids in the program, about half of them

606
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:04,840
are graduating, but we keep thinking this is the last year. This is the last year because Congress,

607
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,880
Congress just needs to pass a law, right? And, you know, they, there's plenty of reasons why it

608
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,120
hasn't happened. But now the kids that are going to start graduating next year, they're literally

609
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,560
in limbo because they can't get a work permit. So the H-1B visa and all of that can't do it.

610
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,280
You can figure out a way to marry and then take that route. You can look for asylum, but those

611
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,680
are all really, really hard paths. I didn't realize that. So you're telling me that if a

612
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:37,560
kid goes through a scholarship, oh, because they're not doing it on an F1.

613
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:44,440
They're not DACA, right? DACA was, yeah, that, that expires. That's the argument now is like,

614
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,360
not only do you have the DACA kids in limbo, but now you're like, you know, this 80,000 kids every

615
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,000
year that we're, and the crazy thing is we invest in them in primary school and secondary school.

616
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,480
We don't ask the question when they go to our school systems, but then, you know, we invest all

617
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:06,680
that money. Why don't we make them taxpayers? You know, we have an issue. There's like this massive

618
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,160
decline of kids applying to college. We have all this college infrastructure with not enough

619
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:17,640
students today. Why not educate them and make them pay taxes and give them a path, whatever that is,

620
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,560
to citizenship. So to me, this is one of those things that makes absolutely no sense. But to,

621
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:28,520
what we did is we expanded that to, you know, after the George Floyd event, we, we as a company

622
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:33,960
kind of rally around, we have to find opportunities into our inner cities and have used a lot of the

623
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,320
same platform to broaden it. It's called Road to Hire, where Golden Door Scholars is a part of it.

624
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:47,080
But here's something really cool. We, we start teaching coding in North Carolina, mostly Black

625
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,400
and Brown students, mostly from Title I schools. We're going to the high schools and start teaching

626
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,520
there. And then we do an apprenticeship program and then we partner up with all the corporations

627
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:03,720
in Charlotte. We are graduating more Black and Brown kids with computer science expertise than

628
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:10,920
the whole North Carolina system is now. This year, we have over 220 of these kids graduating and they

629
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,080
all have jobs on the other end. So we give them an apprenticeship and then we have a whole of the

630
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,480
Sorry, these are high school or college? No, these are, these are, they're not going to,

631
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,200
these are kids that are 22, 23, 24, mostly Black and Brown kids that we're teaching them how to

632
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,360
code. We pay them to teach. So they're high school grads that didn't go to college. We give them a two

633
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,040
year apprenticeship where we're paying them on behalf of all this corporation. It's working

634
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,160
tremendously. Here's the crazy thing. This 21 year old kid who was driving over after two years of

635
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,040
the apprenticeship, they are as competent in technology as someone who graduated from NC State.

636
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:53,560
Now, how do you think that can be scaled? What do you think is the magic in that? That, because

637
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,960
to your, this is a great example of what we said earlier, you can't solve that problem across the

638
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,160
country, but can you provide a roadmap for that? Well, there's like, you start with the jobs,

639
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,840
like, and at the end of the day, there's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs that are

640
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,440
unfilled because they don't have the skills. So pick this, by the way, it's the same thing with

641
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:20,600
high school teachers today. There's a shortage of like, I believe is 350,000 teaching, you know,

642
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:26,920
vacancies that is projected to be, but we get, we pay 42,000 in most States and you can't, it's crazy,

643
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:33,480
right? But, but keep on technology where there's, there's a big gap. The reason our system, our

644
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,640
model works in Charlotte and North Carolina is because it rides on the rails of the system.

645
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:45,160
It literally partners with the county and with the city. It partners with the schools, with the

646
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:51,240
high school systems, all title one, it connects to the, to the public school. So like, there is a

647
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:56,120
lot here and then the corporations all basically offer a job on the other end. The key to this is

648
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:01,640
to start with the job and then train into the job versus start with education and hope they get a

649
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:07,320
job. So go fill the job that is not getting filled. And by the way, solve the diversity

650
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,000
challenge that all these corporations have, solve a lot of the other issues, but don't show up into

651
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,760
the, you know, into, into the nonprofit arm of a corporation, solve a problem that they really have.

652
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,320
And that's the connection. So I think it will have to happen more at the city level. So there's a big

653
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:30,200
initiative, call 110 that a number of like high profile CEOs have built to try to do this. It just

654
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,320
takes a long, long time. And my concern is when the economy turns, these are the kinds of things

655
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:41,720
that get scrapped. These are the kinds of things that people stop giving that job for or investing

656
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:50,200
in. Yet we go back to this, you know, negative spiral that we tend to have. Obviously you and I

657
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:57,160
both are kind of cut from the same cloth, which is that of immigrants. And I think with that comes

658
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:04,600
a little bit of disbelief as to why the U.S. would not as a country want to embrace an amazing asset.

659
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,120
Do you see this changing? Do you see this as just being a season?

660
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,640
I do. You know, I am super optimistic on our country, you know, and that, you know, for as

661
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:23,000
flawed as we are, I would rather be nowhere else. Yeah, I agree with that. And, you know, there's

662
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,320
just things, unfortunately, take time. You know, I'm reading a book called Brothers about, you know,

663
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:36,120
the Kennedys. And you realize that there were real serious issues there around, you know, the mob and

664
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:41,400
like all these things that, you know, we don't hear about today. So I do believe that the trend line

665
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:49,000
is up. It's just not linear and it's not fast enough. So, you know, I think we just have more

666
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:54,920
information, much of which, if not all of most of which is noise that distracts us a little bit.

667
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,560
So I think back in the 60s, there was no question it was a more tumultuous era. I mean,

668
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:08,680
there were political assassinations on U.S. soil, right? Like we don't have anything like that today.

669
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:17,880
But the noise today is unbearable. It's right. The never ending cycle of nonsense, news, cable,

670
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:27,560
social media, I think makes it feel more dramatic. But that could also be the undoing, right?

671
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,640
I mean, you know, and these are pendulums. I think we're at a pendulum right now where

672
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,800
the country is super divided. I am super, I believe that there will be a series of leaders

673
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:44,200
in our future that will bring us back together. We need a common enemy. And, you know, maybe it is

674
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:51,400
this risk of China that becomes our galvanizing thing. You know, I find it super interesting when

675
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:58,200
there's a real crisis in our country, 9-11 or even, you know, COVID at the beginning, like we all kind

676
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,280
of are behave like Americans. And then, you know, we need something that brings us back to being

677
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,360
Americans and not Republicans or Democrats or black or white and all that stuff. And the common

678
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,560
enemy tends to do that. And I think this, these peaceful times have allowed for a lot of room for

679
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:21,880
us to subdivide. So, Rick, let's pivot a little bit to talk about health, which is, you know,

680
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:28,840
you're a very health conscious guy. But there's also been some changes, I think, in your life

681
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:35,640
over the past, I don't know, I think I've known you now for nine years. Basketball used to be

682
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,960
kind of the only thing you did for exercise, which was great because it kept you running around a

683
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:46,040
court. But, you know, you can get be prone to injuries and things like that. How would you

684
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:54,040
describe overall kind of your mentality towards your health, your longevity? What changes have you

685
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:58,440
made? One of my favorites, which I'm sure you'll get to is your approach to your body weight,

686
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:05,080
which cracks me up. It is. You know, I've realized that I want to be here for as long as I can and

687
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:13,400
I want to be here in as, you know, active of a way as I can. So I really am committed to that,

688
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,160
you know, it's this notion of time, but it's time on the other way. So for the first time ever in

689
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:24,120
the last, you know, especially in the last four years, I've gotten into the gym and I have a

690
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:29,880
trainer and we go through it. I don't do the crazy stuff you do, but I would argue that I am so much

691
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,960
stronger from grip to balance to all the things. And, you know, I try my version of it because I

692
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,400
don't consider myself to be an elite kind of athlete in that regard, but I feel so much better.

693
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,640
I transitioned from basketball. So I play my last official pickup game about three months ago and

694
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,520
I had a bunch of pros come and it was great because it's been such a great language for me.

695
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,720
And so many relationships came through basketball, so much self learning and self awareness. And

696
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,600
I now picked up tennis and, you know, you know, now why did you do that? I mean, why,

697
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:09,400
why did you completely stop playing your favorite sport? Because I watch a lot of people my age,

698
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:15,080
just blowing Achilles and a knee and all of that. And you know what, those are all signals that we

699
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,480
should listen to. I didn't want to get to that place. And now the more I play, the more my knees

700
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:25,160
were sore and, you know, my body's talking to me. It actually talks to us all the time. And I wanted

701
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:30,840
to leave on my terms and I wanted to leave knowing that, you know, it served its purpose.

702
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:36,200
It doesn't control me. And I love, I picked up tennis in the pandemic and it's something that

703
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:41,480
we're doing more as a family, but I love the apprenticeship, the struggle. So I have a coach,

704
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,880
I go twice a week. It's a great workout. I get my high rate to 130 again to zone two. I stay there

705
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:51,960
for an hour. So I get a lot of, you know, multiple values and I'm really not good. And, you know,

706
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,320
footwork is different. Everything is different. And I love the grinding of, you know, things. And

707
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,560
it's a reminder of humility. Like, you know, everything that we now take for granted that

708
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:06,760
we think we're so good at, at some point was really, really hard. So I have now a list of things I

709
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:13,320
got, you know, it's embarrassing. I'm Puerto Rican. I don't know how to dance salsa. Like, I can't die

710
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:19,160
as the only Puerto Rican who can't die. But dance salsa. So I have a list. I want to, you know,

711
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,840
even last night you were grilling and I'm like, I used to grill a lot more. And so I have this

712
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,760
notion now that I want to keep learning things. I have a list of about eight or nine things.

713
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,720
And eventually if we end up living part of the years in another country, that language I want to

714
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:36,360
try to engage in. And it's just this notion that I don't want to get old, but I want to get, don't

715
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:41,960
want to get old, not by my age, but I don't want to get old by stuff. So I want to talk about that

716
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:48,600
last game of pickup basketball. How sad was that? Zero. Really? No, I'm grateful for what I had now

717
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:56,200
because it ended its life. You know, I don't, you know, it kind of leads to the biggest self growth

718
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:04,520
I've had since the plane was in that middle bucket of like relationships. And what I realized,

719
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:12,920
Peter, is that the most important relationship we have, the most important friend we have is ourselves.

720
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:21,960
And that unless we get that right, everything else will have a lot of friction. Everything else will

721
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:28,920
be a version of a worse version of what it can be. And what I've realized as I study this is that

722
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:35,160
we in society, and it's, I think it's almost every religion, I want to say almost all,

723
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:41,880
all because I don't know, but most religions that I know are anchoring some level of guilt.

724
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:49,320
And guilt as a way of teaching us or as keeping us connected to something. And I've realized that

725
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:57,000
guilt is the most useless emotion one can have. And I have spent the last five years just basically

726
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,080
getting rid of guilt to the point that I joke that it's a complex I no longer suffer from.

727
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:08,760
I still have others, but I feel no guilt. And when you feel no guilt, what you realize is that you

728
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:15,800
can change the dialogue that you have with yourself. I am super kind to myself. I constantly

729
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,760
make mistakes. I constantly do things and I'm like, Oh gosh, that wasn't right. Or I don't show up the

730
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,680
way I need to show up. But I have, I have, I have nothing but love for myself. I would say things,

731
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:33,720
yeah, that wasn't your best. Okay. What next? Help me understand that. So, so you, it's hard for me to

732
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,640
imagine you showing up as poorly as I can, but let's say you, you're in sort of a pissy mood.

733
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,920
You come home. You had asked your wife to do something earlier. It's not done. Instead of

734
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,960
saying, Hey, sweetie, did you, did you have a chance to do that thing I asked you to do before

735
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,440
you sort of snippet her? I don't know if you've ever done that. It happens. Okay. How do you,

736
01:12:53,240 --> 01:13:00,280
cause it's, I think it's really easy to feel bad and feel shame for snapping at her. And then that

737
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,680
actually impairs your next interaction. So how, but how do you break that cycle?

738
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,920
I own it. I, because it just takes a little bit of time. It's like, I'm sorry. I just took out

739
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,520
something on you that it was not on you. That was unfair. I hope you forgive me.

740
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:20,840
How long does it take you to man up to that? It's not long, you know, maybe 20 minutes,

741
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,480
30 minutes, like, like, like, like you're very self-aware and you can read body language,

742
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:29,960
you know, like, you know, you can see that what you just said kind of cut through in a way. And

743
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:35,560
then you're like, huh, what did I do? But, but more importantly is I don't, I don't feel bad.

744
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,560
Like I don't, I don't carry this notion of like, Oh my goodness. I just did this. Even like,

745
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,520
even if I do something that I didn't want to do, I just said, okay, just part of being human is part

746
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,000
of growing up as part of learning as part of your humanity. But do you think that that can only

747
01:13:51,080 --> 01:14:00,280
happen because you're able to immediately make amends? I think it's a habit. I think we, we,

748
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:06,120
we walk around. So how do you break that habit then? I mean, guilt is a pretty strong habit for

749
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:12,840
a number of people, I'm sure. Yeah. It's like any habit. It may be worse than smoking. Smoking is

750
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,680
hard. I never smoke, but it's a really habit. But if you want to break it, you break it, you know,

751
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:22,440
you're 98% of your thoughts are with yourself. So first of all, you got to be very aware of all

752
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,920
your thoughts and you got to be able to objectivize what you're hearing and you have to be able to

753
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,840
evaluate and say, you know what, is this productive? Is this helping me? Or am I doing this because

754
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:38,840
I've always done it or because this is how my parents kind of relate it to it. And I think the

755
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:45,480
more we move away from the emotion of guilt and become, it becomes self-love. It becomes, you know,

756
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,240
a notion like the safest place for us to be is with ourselves. And the kindest place to be is in

757
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:56,200
our own heads. And there's no judgment. There's no anything like life becomes so much simpler.

758
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,800
And then that that you give yourself, you can give to others. Because, you know, when we talk about

759
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,120
purpose, you know, we're very lucky that we can impact people through your platform. You're

760
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,360
impacting lots of us. And, you know, I'm lucky that in my platform, I can impact people. But you

761
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:15,560
impact people every day with little things. How you show up to the coffee shop in the morning,

762
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:22,040
the type of connection that you make, the taking time, like all of that is making an impact. And

763
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:28,440
the more that you feel a piece inside, the more you want to give it. So I am now addicted really

764
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:34,680
to like good energy. And that doesn't mean it's maybe 95% of the time, but oh, I love that place.

765
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:39,720
And I give it and I give it freely. And I give it with, you know, not expecting nothing in return.

766
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,800
And to me, this is like the happy place. I live in a happy place.

767
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,520
What do you think is the relationship between happiness and wealth? Do you think they're

768
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,920
uncoupled? Do you think they're correlated positively? Do you think they're correlated

769
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:00,680
negatively? I think we decide what they are. You know, I think, you know, some of the happiest

770
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:07,400
people in the world have no wealth. So they cannot be coupled. Now, wealth can give you a set of

771
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:13,880
conveniences that allows you to solve for whatever your priorities are that, you know,

772
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:19,000
might, may, may heighten your ability to do that. And therefore it gives you more happiness. Or,

773
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,240
like in many people, you pursue wealth your whole life, because that's what our society wants. And

774
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:30,680
when you get there, you just feel so empty and then you feel so guilty for all you sacrifice for it.

775
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,840
And you're in the worst place, which is you got what you wanted. And then it was a mirage and

776
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,720
it meant nothing. And there are so many people out there that feel like, oh my goodness,

777
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:45,640
I was running the wrong race. You know, we talk a lot in life, Peter, around the best way to

778
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:52,360
run a race. No one steps back and asks, am I running the right race? And I think really

779
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:57,800
focusing on, you know, reevaluating the race you're running. So when you ask me questions about,

780
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:04,040
you know, Red Ventures in 10, 20 years, I made it very clear after my, you know, my plane event

781
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,040
that I was going to run a different race than everybody else. I wasn't looking for,

782
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:13,800
you know, being public. I wasn't looking for being the wealthiest. I wasn't looking for,

783
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:19,320
my race was to enjoy the race and to enjoy the race. I am crazy. So I love growing. I love being

784
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,760
challenged. I love competing, but I, I give no power to anybody. And I tried really hard not to

785
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:31,720
take power away from anybody. What do you think are the ways that, that people even inadvertently

786
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:40,760
take power away from people? You know, we as leaders, you know, can, can overlead and not let

787
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:46,920
other people's have, you know, kind of the, the, let them be celebrated and not take all the, all

788
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,280
the credit for things. Or on the contrary, take responsibility for things that may not have been

789
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,640
truly your responsibility. So I think, I think leaders have an ability to really

790
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:03,480
manage the, the kind of the power equation with intentionality. I think how you treat somebody,

791
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:08,280
like I think we talked about this in the last conversation, but I think the best way we can

792
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:16,360
parent is by showing our kids how to treat strangers and how we, you know, give people

793
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,480
respect no matter who they are, what they're doing, and how do we not give anybody too much respect

794
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,920
just because society made them be something, you know, everybody puts their pants on the same way.

795
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:32,520
Everybody has insecurities. Everybody has issues. You know, when you look at people as like, you

796
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,920
know, we all are in this like imperfect journey with imperfections, it just makes it really kind

797
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:46,360
of level field and, and, and simpler. One of the really enjoyable, I mean, there were so many, but

798
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:51,400
certainly one of the enjoyable highlights of the Friends Summit was when Simon Sinek got up and

799
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:58,680
talked about Finite versus Infinite Games, which of course is the name of the book. Maybe for folks

800
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:04,520
that aren't familiar with that, I know it's a book that you love as well. How do you implement

801
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:13,560
that ethos into both your business and your, your life? You know, when Simon sent me an early

802
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:20,600
book and said, Hey, what do you think? It was almost like he was writing what it was in my brain.

803
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:25,000
I just don't have an ability to write a book, but he wrote a book. I'm like, and he, he actually was

804
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,960
rewriting a book by somebody that had come before, right? He had put it in more modern terms. And it

805
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,920
became kind of codifying a language that I really believe in. And that the core of the Infinite Game

806
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,320
is that there's a bunch of principles of the game and how you play the game and all of that. But the

807
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:48,360
core of the Infinite Game is that there's no winning, that the whole objective of the game is to stay

808
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:57,000
in the game. The reality is if you really read into it, the real, real ultimate objective is not

809
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,520
just to stay in the game, but to perpetuate the game. So what you're doing through your podcast,

810
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,120
through your book that's coming out, through your kids, through everything else is you're

811
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:13,480
perpetuating the game, you know, the game that matters to you. And that's living with purpose.

812
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:19,480
Because you are now, you have a purpose of what you're doing. I feel the same way. So when you give

813
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,280
up the winning or losing, when you don't look at things, you give away a lot of the, you know,

814
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,080
the jealousy. Like I don't feel jealousy. Like I don't like it's, it's, it's an emotion that I'm

815
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:34,120
like, you know, I'm just because you have it doesn't mean I don't have it. You know, maybe a

816
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,960
little envious at times, like, wow, I wish I had the knowledge that Peter has about this stuff,

817
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,960
but zero jealousy. Right. So the infinite game, it makes it really, really simple not to get

818
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:50,840
caught up on winning or losing just makes it and like, just play the game. And therefore we give

819
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:55,960
away, we get away from back to this notion of like, Oh, you know, I came in second, I came in

820
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,720
third. And you and I have talked a lot about this kind of stuff. It's like, and by the way,

821
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,640
I don't think it affects the outcome at all. You know, I think you,

822
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,760
is that something that you have the luxury of playing because you run a private company,

823
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:15,240
but if, if, if Red Ventures were a public company, would you be able to, to, to, to live by that or

824
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:22,280
would quarterly earnings and other metrics that shareholders would be privy to and have an

825
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:26,760
interest in change that. In other words, do, do public markets demand winning?

826
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:34,760
I think by and large, yes. Now you could argue that Jeff Bezos at Amazon forever never made

827
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:40,760
money, even though the public markets were demanding that he did this. And he basically said,

828
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,240
no, I'm going to continue to lose money on you either going to like my story or not.

829
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:51,720
You could, you could argue that Mila Musk is playing the infinite game in many ways with the

830
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,680
decisions he's making. Even, even Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. Like with Meta, like, you know, he clearly

831
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:03,240
has not taken a short term meeting 75% of the value of the company. So I think you can do it.

832
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:08,120
You just have to have the temperament and the stomach to be unpopular. And you know what,

833
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:14,280
the best way to be that to not be unpopular is not to read. I don't read anything about us,

834
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:20,680
about me. Like it doesn't matter. The opinion of a stranger has zero value to me. Now, if you call

835
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:26,040
me and say, dude, I heard you say this or do this, and that feels like not you, I will listen.

836
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:32,200
Because I know that you know me and you care. So like, I have no desire to be popular with

837
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:38,120
people I don't know. I want to be respected by people that I care about. That's an amazing

838
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:44,520
lesson. That to me is a very difficult feature of living in the world today, right? It's,

839
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:50,040
do you, do you look at what people are saying about you on social media? Do you read comments?

840
01:22:50,760 --> 01:23:03,880
Not very often, but a little bit. Again, I would say I'm probably 95% compliant with the

841
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:11,080
notion of ignoring it. And when I do read it, I'm rarely perturbed by it, largely for the reasons

842
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:17,400
that you put forward, which is you understand that it's kind of irrelevant. But I can't imagine

843
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,120
what it would be like to be doing that from a real stage, right? I mean, look, I'm kind of a

844
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:28,280
nobody, but I mean, could you imagine being Mark Zuckerberg, for example? You know, I think he

845
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:33,560
doesn't care. Yeah. Meaning he's a main man at a place where whatever, you know, but I think, I

846
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,720
think it's all irrelevant, Peter. Like there's no stage that is different or bigger than ours.

847
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:43,240
Like there's just different stages. Just because someone is, has a bigger platform than we do

848
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:47,320
doesn't make their stage more important than our part. Like we're all the same. No, I think it just

849
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:52,360
means that the attacks are louder, potentially. But doesn't matter if you don't read them. If you

850
01:23:52,360 --> 01:24:00,680
stay true to yourself, it has all circular logic. Yeah. Have you imparted a lesson like this on your

851
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:07,560
kids? I mean, we've talked about this a little bit on our first discussion, right? You made an

852
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:14,680
interesting point that I think is, I've thought a lot about actually. I think I had historically

853
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:21,080
thought of it as our kids have it so much easier than we did because, you know, we came from little,

854
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:27,560
they come from plenty, you know, got reasons going on. You made a, I think it was the, I think you

855
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:34,040
framed it this way, but this is certainly how I think about it is I feel like me from my parents,

856
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:40,120
from their parents, from their parents, there was an inevitable trend that the child would exceed the

857
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:45,720
accomplishments of the parents. That was just the nature of moving from the industrial revolution

858
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:52,440
to now. And maybe it's our kids that will be the first one for whom it's not just going to be

859
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,800
falling off a log to exceed the accomplishments of their parents in whatever metric we use to think

860
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:05,080
about that. And you came at that from a real point of empathy, which is I want to make sure my kids

861
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:10,680
aren't under some unnecessary unrealistic pressure that they have to do something that their parents

862
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:19,960
did. Say more about that and how has your thinking sharpened? It stems from the premise, I think our

863
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:27,640
kids have a lot more comfort, they have a lot more access, they have a lot more experiences, but that's

864
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:36,280
different. You know, if you're defining this about feeling a level of satisfaction with life or a level

865
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:41,640
of happiness back to what we've been talking about, there's two separate things. They're divorced from

866
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:47,240
one another. They shouldn't tie. I think the fact that we're starting with the premise that achieving

867
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:53,960
more than your parents financially is the objective of life is like a goofy starting point, right?

868
01:25:53,960 --> 01:26:01,320
I think what I would love my kids is to feel like they were able, given the opportunity, to really find

869
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:08,280
their gift and to do it within a place of love and that they are great parents. And then as a result,

870
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:15,480
we as a family did good in the world. And I tell you, it is to me, none of these things kind of

871
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:20,360
make any sense when people are like, oh, we don't know. I just think it's hard. It's hard when

872
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:27,080
you are Peter Attia's daughter or Peter Attia's sons. And I think we should be mindful of that,

873
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:31,640
not because it's a burden that is put on them by others that they don't know how to accept. You know,

874
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:38,680
that's what I really meant by that. I saw a really interesting clip.

875
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,480
I'm sure we'll be able to find it for the show notes. It was Arnold Schwarzenegger, a very young

876
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:51,720
Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I'm guessing he would have been late 70s, early 80s. So I had already

877
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,720
accomplished a lot, but obviously had more to accomplish. Right. This is before he would have

878
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:00,840
become the world's biggest movie star and go on to become the governor. But he was being asked,

879
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:06,040
and I think it was like Barbara Walters, but it was some highbrow interview. So it must have been

880
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:15,880
the 80s by this point. What accounts for your greatness? And he sort of said, look,

881
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:24,440
to have this level, he's referring to his own level of drive. It must come from a place of hardship.

882
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:31,800
And he's much more eloquently than this described, that basically everything he has

883
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,880
comes from a singular focus of escaping and being better than and improving. And he said,

884
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,920
look, the reality of it is kids who don't come for this, if your kids don't come from this level of

885
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:49,400
deprivation, they can't be great. They can be very well adjusted. And that's really the best thing

886
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:53,240
you can hope for them, but they can't be great. And I really thought about it a lot. I was like,

887
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,680
that's really interesting. There's a lot to reflect on there because first of all, there's nothing wrong

888
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:01,480
with being well adjusted. It could be a perfectly reasonable goal for kids who come from privilege.

889
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:09,480
You know, kids who are never to want anything to be perfectly well adjusted. But he's arguing

890
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:17,080
that's the best case scenario. But great in what? Well, lifting weights, great at being a movie star.

891
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:21,800
Being exceptional. Yes. So that's different because you can be a great human being. You can

892
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:29,560
have a great like being the elite 1% of something has a huge amount of tax on other things.

893
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,000
Absolutely. And I don't think look, I mean, that's the irony, I guess, of his life is,

894
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,440
you know, he couldn't he couldn't see the crystal ball of the lows that would come with the highs.

895
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:44,520
And it's, you know, to me, that's the problem with hyper successful people that trying to repeat what

896
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:49,320
they did and ends up being more self destructive than not. And do you I would argue that most

897
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:55,400
people can't handle greatness because it is addictive or greatness as it's reflected by

898
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:00,360
being the best at something or the very best so for a period of time. And those who are able to

899
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:05,480
accept the fact that none of that matters and it will change and evolve better lives. What do you

900
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:10,520
want for your kid to be the greatest at something for a moment in time and miserable or do you want

901
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,840
him to be, you know, not self adjusted because that to me is like a consolation price. No,

902
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:23,000
no, but I think being well adjusted is is a fantastic objective, frankly. And I agree with

903
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:29,160
you completely. I wouldn't which actually, by the way, kind of is just a very extreme version

904
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:36,120
of the yin and the yang between fluid, fluid and crystallized intelligence. The more extreme one

905
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,640
is the harder, you know, the more extreme your fluidized intelligence is, it might be harder to

906
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,640
make that transition to crystallize intelligence. Yeah, yeah, that's right. And that's true in

907
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:51,000
intelligence. But I think that's even more true in, you know, what is it like to be Tiger Woods

908
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:58,600
or Michael Jordan? Yeah, that's why I think really, really great, like four perfect students

909
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,480
struggle to be super productive in life because they never had to deal with adversity.

910
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:08,200
They never had to be coached. They've never had to be in a place where they're they're

911
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:16,920
forced to be good at it. And, you know, like it is better to struggle so that you learn to struggle

912
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:24,200
than to be great at something because life is full of potential struggles. Well, Rick, as always,

913
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:32,120
awesome to sit down and catch up on life. Congratulations on on all of your successes

914
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:37,960
in the past couple of years in particular. And I'm really excited to hear about this museum in North

915
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,200
Carolina. I think the next time I come out to visit you, I hope we can make the time to go and

916
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:46,760
see it because I would actually love to see that. No, I would love that, Peter. And, you know, I

917
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:54,760
can't say enough to you. You've had an incredible impact on my knowledge of, you know, of myself

918
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:00,200
and exercise and nutrition and how I'm going to live. And, you know, I'm I hope I know that the

919
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:05,480
last 10 years of my life, I should I should name that to you because you've done you've helped me

920
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:10,120
a lot and I love our friendship and I love how we can be so honest with each other and raw. And

921
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:22,440
I'm humbled you would have me especially a second time. So great fun. Thanks, Rick.
