Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,640
today's episode. My guest this week is Guy Widge. Guy is a psychologist, an author,

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,680
a speaker, and now recently a podcast host. Guy received his PhD in clinical psychology from

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,160
NYU, where he also did his postdoctoral work at the medical center. He's been in private practice

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,840
in New York for nearly 30 years. And as we learned on this podcast, he shares office space

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,360
with my therapist and that probably speaks to the state of mind I'm in when I walk in for therapy

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,680
and that I haven't noticed the names of anybody else on the wall there. Guy has authored three

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,760
books, The Squeaky Wheel, How to Fix a Broken Heart, and Emotional First Aid. We get into a

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,480
pretty good discussion on two of these three. He's also the co-host of one of my favorite podcasts,

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,800
Dear Therapists, which he hosts with Laurie Gottlieb, a previous guest on this podcast. He's given

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,640
three fantastic TED talks and number of great Google talks, all of which I recommend highly.

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,560
I wanted to talk with Guy after I had a chance to get to know Laurie a little bit and obviously

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,880
since their podcast came out, which was late July, I've been pretty obsessed with it. And I think

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,640
getting to familiarize myself with the style with which Guy and Laurie work together, I realized

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,480
he'd be just a fantastic guest. In this episode, we talk a lot about his journey to the path he's

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,840
on now through psychology and what he learned along the way both about himself and perhaps

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,040
more interestingly to the listener what he's learned about the human conditions. We get into

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,440
a lot of things that he later acknowledged he doesn't get asked a lot of during his frequent

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,880
interviews. And so I'm grateful that we were able to have kind of that nuanced discussion.

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,040
I could have spoken with Guy for many hours, but before I knew it, we were nearly two hours into a

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,240
discussion and he was already in Israel and it was getting late at night. So where we did end

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,320
though was I think a really interesting discussion around emotional health, specifically vis-a-vis the

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,120
challenges that many people have experienced through the pandemic. And Guy would actually say

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,960
during our interview that he thinks it is the biggest sort of seismic shift that's probably

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,160
impacted our ability to recognize the importance of psychological and emotional health. And so if

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,080
you've found yourself interested in other episodes we've done that have covered mental health,

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,640
emotional health, I think you're going to find this one very interesting. And without further

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:13,880
delay, please enjoy my conversation with Guy Lynch. Guy, it's fantastic to be speaking with you here

36
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,400
today. I almost feel like I know you because I have been listening to your podcast, yours and

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,640
Lori's podcast pretty religiously since it came out, which I think was in about August, is that right?

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
Correct. July 30th actually.

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,040
Okay. And I don't know. Well, you can probably imagine the fondness I have for Lori that probably

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,720
came across in the interview I did with her. And so now by extension, I see you too as left and

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,880
right hand. And I've really just enjoyed listening to you guys. I do have to ask you a quick question

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,680
about this. When you read the letter at the beginning of each episode, actually before I

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,240
do that, explain to people the format of the podcast. And then I'll ask my question, how do

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,760
you guys set it up? Because you have a pretty specific format.

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,280
Right. Well, Lori is the advice columnist for The Atlantic and I write an advice column for Ted. So

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,080
our initial concept was, hey, advice. But we wanted to do something different because number one,

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,280
we're both therapists, which is not always the case when it comes to advice. And number two,

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,560
the thing that's always frustrated me about advice is that you can give the most brilliant advice,

49
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,720
but you never find out what happened. Sometimes people will write and tell you, but even then

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,560
it's very curated. So our format is such that we bring a letter each week. We start by reading the

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,840
letter to one another and we do a very brief case consultation like we would in a therapy office. And

52
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,200
that gives you a little bit of a fly on the wall in a therapy office perspective. And then we

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,240
immediately bring in the guest and we do a session with them. And then after the session or at the

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,800
end of the session, we jump in to give them very actionable advice that they have to do within a

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,120
week. And then we give some predictions about what we think will happen. And then we hear back from

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,280
the guest and hear what happened when they implemented the advice, how they felt about it,

57
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,040
how it went, what they took from it. And after that, we give our closing thoughts as therapists

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,760
to the situation. So it's a really complete and satisfying or not, depending on the resolution

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,800
arc that you get and you get to find out what happens. And that's what I really like about it.

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,480
You get to find out how therapists think and you get to find out what happens after the session.

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,320
One question I have guys, it's usually you trading off. Sometimes you will bring the

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,880
letter and read it to Lori and sometimes it's the reverse. And immediately upon doing that,

63
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:45,200
the two of you have kind of a back and forth banter before you have the consultation with the client

64
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,760
before they zoom in. And that'll be three to five minutes, I guess, is about what it seems as I'm

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,480
not actually timing it as I'm listening, but that's about what it feels like. Are you guys

66
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,840
doing that cold or is that scripted? We're doing that entirely cold, completely cold. The only thing

67
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,400
we say to one another before practically every taping of that section is, okay, but let's keep

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,480
it short because we can't go on too long. So that is as warm as we go. And I don't know what she's

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,560
thinking about this letter. She doesn't know what I'm thinking about this letter. We might be thinking

70
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,960
different things. And when we agree to do this podcast together, I'll just say this one, I met

71
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,680
Lori once in June of last year. That's the sum of our acquaintance before we started doing this.

72
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,840
So it's not as if we've been working together for years on end and I know how she thinks and she

73
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,360
knows how I thinks. She doesn't and I don't or I didn't, now I do. So we're entirely cold and

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,680
the idea there was let's keep it organic, let's keep it spontaneous because that will be more

75
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,920
interesting than getting all our ducks in a row and then sounding like the same person.

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,600
Well, you answered another question, which is kind of amazing to me, which is how do you have

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,880
that pretty apparent chemistry without a long track record together? That's not a simple

78
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,520
thing actually. That could have flopped. That could have gone badly so many ways. And I think

79
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:17,000
what saves us is that I have tons of respect for Lori as a therapist. And I think the same goes

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,040
for her. And what that means is that I see her leading in direction A and I want to go in

81
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,280
direction B. I'm assuming direction A is not going to be bad. So yes, let's explore A for a bit and

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,440
then we'll get to B. It has not happened. We've taped a whole season of 20 episodes. It has not

83
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,880
happened that Lori went in a direction that I'm like, oh my goodness, why are we doing that? It's

84
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,680
all valid because she's a very good therapist and I think she feels the same. And so we indulge one

85
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,960
another because we haven't come across something that's making us wince and kind of start to hit

86
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:57,240
the panic pattern. Well, let's back up a little bit and kind of talk about you and how you got here.

87
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,640
You've written about and spoken about the fact that you kind of wanted to be a therapist from

88
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,720
day one. So just as the way that some little boys want to be firefighters or professional

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,040
footballers or whatever, you sort of wanted to be a therapist. When did you realize that?

90
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,240
I wasn't sure when I realized that, but I think when one of the first articles that I was

91
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,160
interviewed in came out in the press, I got a message from, I think it was pre-internet,

92
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,240
so it was a phone message, actual phone message with rotary phones. What are those? Okay.

93
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,800
With a cradle. Yeah. And the person said, and it was a high school friend and she said, oh my

94
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,240
goodness, I remember you talking about wanting to be a psychologist when you were 14 years old.

95
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,040
Now to any psychologist, ding, ding, ding, what was going on with him that he wanted to be a

96
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,160
psychologist at 14 years old. But that aside for a minute, apparently very young is when I wanted

97
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,840
to be a psychologist. You grew up in Israel or you grew up in the United States? I was born in

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,840
England and had some years there and then some years formative ones in Israel.

99
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay. You have a twin brother. Is he an identical twin or?

100
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,640
He's an identical twin. What other siblings do you have?

101
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
That's it. It's just us.

102
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,840
Just the two of you. How close were you? Which sounds like a dumb question perhaps,

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,080
but I don't know. I've met twins who are not that close.

104
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah. As if I, we were always very, very close. We were one of the lucky ones or I guess. I mean,

105
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,640
my philosophy is if you can't get along with the person that's most like you in the world,

106
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,840
then you have some work to do to figure out why you don't like yourself really. I think just

107
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,120
because twins, especially identical ones, this is your carbon copy practically. If you love yourself,

108
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
you should love them. We always did get along. We always had a very strong bond.

109
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Did you finish high school in Israel or in the United States?

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,760
In Israel. I came to the United States after my undergraduate degree

111
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,080
with two suitcases and maybe a thousand bucks and hope.

112
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,880
Okay. You went to NYU if I recall and you did both your graduate degree and postdoctoral work

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,000
there. Is that right?

114
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,120
Yeah. I did a master's and PhD at NYU and then I did a postdoc at NYU medical center.

115
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:13,960
Got it. During that process, how did you refine your interest? I assume at 14, when you're thinking,

116
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,240
I want to be a psychotherapist or I want to be a psychologist or I want to be some sort of

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,640
therapist that helps people's minds and emotions. It becomes a lot more nuanced by the time you're

118
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,760
writing your dissertation. What was that journey as you went from a 14 year old to a high school

119
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,000
or to an undergraduate to a graduate student? How did you refine your objectives?

120
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,440
The good thing about an undergraduate degree in psychology is that if you do it right,

121
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,040
it gives you a lot of exposure to different areas of psychology because psychologist is a general

122
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,000
term, but you can be a psychologist who runs rats through mazes or you can be a psychologist that

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,640
does consulting for organizations. You can be a clinical psychologist and do therapy, which is

124
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,600
what I do. You can work with children, et cetera. Psychology is very broad. So you do get the

125
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,880
exposure and it was very clear to me from the beginning of my education, because really before

126
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,640
then I didn't have that exposure, that I am thoroughly disinterested in severe psychopathology.

127
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,480
In other words, everyone that I was studying with were fascinated by schizophrenia, for example,

128
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,880
hallucinations, because people were so wild to see and people fervently believing in delusions

129
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,080
and having paranoia and all those things. It just never interested me. It did seem a little bit like

130
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,760
a sideshow rather than ... And I felt I wanted to help regular people deal with regular life. That

131
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,760
was always my interest. And I don't know why or when I had that interest. I think my interest in

132
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,880
psychology all along was because I was looking at the adults around me, probably at age 14 and going,

133
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm not sure you guys are communicating very well. Or I had other notes probably for them and thought,

134
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,960
I need to study this to understand this because I'm really interested in ... Because I could see

135
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,320
mistakes and I could see things and I just didn't have a framework with which to understand them or

136
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,600
categorize them. And so the interest probably started there. But it continued in that I was

137
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,120
always interested in just working with regular people, improving their quality of life.

138
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Now, when I think back to my undergraduate, which was in engineering, my girlfriend for at least

139
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,080
half of my time in college was in the psychology department, but she overlapped with the business

140
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:32,280
school and ultimately went on to do her PhD in organizational behavior. And she never stated this,

141
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,560
but my impression was that the superstar people in the psych department were the ones going off

142
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,960
doing these other things. And there was fewer people sticking around to do the, how do I help

143
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:54,440
regular people suffer less? Now, is that true? Was there something less sexy about wanting to do what

144
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,480
you wanted to do? I will tell you, and if that girlfriend's around, she will confirm, the sexiest

145
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,720
thing you can do with a PhD is finish it. And there is a point at which you just don't care

146
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,360
about anything else except just finishing it. And so really, everyone is really oriented toward how

147
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:22,680
do I just get done? That aside, my program at NYU for graduate school was just clinicals. It was just

148
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,520
10 people studying clinical psychology. Undergraduate, I split between psychology and film.

149
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,320
So I was in the film school and the feedback I got from the psychology department was,

150
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,960
oh, you're good at this. And the feedback I got from the film school is they love you in psychology.

151
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,000
So I took a hint. How do you think about your undergraduate tour? Because I only took probably

152
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,480
two courses in psychology. And I remember thinking, wow, there's a lot here. I mean,

153
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,840
there are so many different schools of thinking. There are so many great thinkers in this space,

154
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,000
and they're often at odds with each other. So it was less like physics, which was where I spent

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,040
much more of my time where Schrodinger is building on the guy before him. And in other words,

156
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,080
there is a continuity of the science and a new discovery can upend an old one, but there's

157
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,600
general agreement about it. Relativity built upon Newtonian mechanics and people could understand

158
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,760
where the Newtonian laws broke down. I didn't feel that way in psychology. I really felt like

159
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,920
there were different camps. Does that sort of resonate? Did you sort of experience that as you

160
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,240
went through it? Oh, yes. I mean, you can't not, right? I mean, you mentioned Schrodinger,

161
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,320
because that's one of the few areas in physics where there is uncertainty, but psychology is

162
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,280
all about uncertainty. We don't have that grasp of the human mind. We don't have that grasp of

163
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,760
the brain. We don't have that grasp of emotions. We don't even have that grasp of consciousness

164
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,040
yet at all. And so we're very much in the infancy of understanding how we tick and how we operate.

165
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,440
I mean, I'd love to be at the point where we have an operator manual for the human mind that we can

166
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,200
only use to maximize our potential, but we're very, very far from that. So you approach a science

167
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,240
like that with like, I'll take what we, you know, any certainty feels like an oasis because there's

168
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,200
so much of uncertainty. Right. We don't have a unifying set of theories or principles the way

169
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,000
we do in physics and mathematics. And I guess that just speaks to how much more complicated humans

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,440
are than the natural world around us. Well, also how much newer psychology is a science

171
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,200
than physics or mathematics, right? Physics and mathematics have a couple of thousand years or

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,520
several thousand years on psychology. Do you think that as you're going through your training,

173
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,040
your impressions of which camps you tend to be in as students is potentially influenced by

174
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,640
the people who present the information to you and the affinity that you have for, hey, I, you know,

175
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,560
the way that professor teaches that resonates with me or alternatively, like an experience that

176
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,600
you've had where that school of thinking actually fits with my personal experience. I guess what

177
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm trying to ask in a clumsy way is how do you think a young student slash therapist creates

178
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,960
the scaffolding that is going to become their mental model? And more importantly, how malleable

179
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,640
is that over time? I can tell you about my scaffolding and it's such a such an interesting

180
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,880
question. I've never been asked that and I'm already enjoying this because it's really good

181
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,360
that you get to ask me to think about things that I haven't thought about necessarily in that way.

182
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,080
But here's my answer to that. When you go somewhere and you're presented with 10 different

183
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,400
religions that everyone who presents them, each one is presented fervently, my response to that

184
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,560
was to be an agnostic. My response to that was not to believe in any of them, but to curate and say,

185
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,640
what there can I take? What in that one can I take? What aspect of this resonates with me? And

186
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,320
that's from the beginning was how I treated it and how I thought of it. These are all ideas from

187
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:10,600
which I get to pick what seems right to me, but I don't need to endorse or embrace fully any of

188
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,800
them. And I never did. The highest compliment I can pay somebody in that scenario is to compare

189
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,640
them to Bruce Lee, but that's effectively what is referred to as Jeet Kune Do, which is the way of

190
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,400
No Way, which was his model of martial arts, which was every one of them offers things that are

191
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,240
useful and every one of them has things which are useless. What if you could dissociate yourself

192
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,320
from being a student of one exclusively? And so he created this technique, which actually the

193
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,720
privilege of studying for two years and you study it one on one with one teacher. It was very,

194
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,400
very interesting. He spends three months interviewing me to confirm I'm worthy of

195
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,080
learning this, by the way. Oh, wow. Yeah. But it was beautiful. And it was true to how it was

196
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:04,760
presented, which was it was never about being wed to one style. So that's an amazing kind of way that

197
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,400
you described it. Did that ever put you at odds with your colleagues who couldn't understand why

198
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,600
you didn't fit in one box? Yes. My program back in the day was pretty psychoanalytic. It was a very

199
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,440
New York kind of thinking. And so in that approach, for example, when the first patient I ever had,

200
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,800
because you have to start somewhere, right? You knew that they don't know you're there, you're

201
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,160
first, but you do ask me where I'm from. And my supervisor said, if somebody asks you where you're

202
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,720
from, you can't tell them. And I'm like, why can't I tell them? So because it's, it's, you're

203
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,400
introducing extraneous material, you should just ask them what their thoughts and feelings and

204
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,400
associations are about where you might be from and what that means to them. And I had a really

205
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,920
hard time with that. And I said, but if my accent were more obvious, then I wouldn't have to go

206
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,080
through that charade. And it just seems withholding and irrelevant because I don't know if they're

207
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,400
there to spend their time discussing where I might be from. It just makes me the center of something

208
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,520
that I don't think I should be the center of. So I had issues with some of the techniques that I was

209
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,360
presented with from the beginning, but I was very fortunate because the professors there, at least

210
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,480
the ones I interacted with were very open-minded. They didn't assume that you had to buy things,

211
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,200
lock, stock and barrel. They assumed that, you know, you get to wrestle with these things and

212
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,600
reach your own conclusion. The students were sometimes a little bit more, should I say,

213
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,520
devout. But the professors typically were more flexible.

214
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,640
You know, I remember, I think it was even Laurie wrote about it in her book, and I'm sure many have

215
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,520
commented to this effect because it seems like such an important finding that it's probably

216
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,960
been out there for some time, which is the training of the therapist, the credentials of the

217
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,600
therapist. All of these things probably don't matter as much as the rapport that is built

218
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,760
between the therapist and the client. Maybe I'm stating that slightly incorrectly, but what I

219
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,840
took away from it was it's at least as important how much of a rapport the client and the therapist

220
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,920
have as how, you know, voluminous the knowledge is of the therapist. Is that an accurate statement?

221
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,600
It's very accurate. In fact, my dissertation back in the day was about what are the aspects

222
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,120
of the therapist, their experience, their gender, their age that might influence therapy outcome.

223
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,520
But since then, it's been very clear, and the research is very, very clear about it, that the

224
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,040
most active ingredient in therapy is that fit between the therapist and the patient. And

225
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,200
specifically, a patient, if you're going to therapy for the first time, what you want to feel is that

226
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:51,160
the person you're, that stranger that you're spilling your guts out to, gets you, that they're

227
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,360
responding and saying things and asking questions that shows that they get it. We have a very clear,

228
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,080
it's like a bullseye, it's a bullseye or a miss. You either feel that person gets me or they don't.

229
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,920
Either they don't allow it or they don't a little bit, it doesn't matter. The ding, ding, ding of

230
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,200
gets me is very, very specific. That's what you want to feel when you go to speak to a therapist,

231
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,080
that at least they get you. The work starts from there, but without that, it's going to be a slogan.

232
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,280
Yeah, maybe an easier way to say it, I guess, is it's a necessary but not necessarily sufficient

233
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,440
criteria for great therapy. Exactly. That's been my experience in my own journeys of therapy. And

234
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,400
I think it comes, the reason I ask the question, of course, it comes back to your original point,

235
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,920
which is if you sit down for the first time with a therapist who has an accent and you ask them

236
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,120
where they're from, and they dodge the question, it becomes awfully hard to feel you have some

237
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,720
rapport with them. When instead, if you can spend two or three minutes having a relational discussion

238
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,800
about where someone is from and, oh, wow, you're from there. What a beautiful place. I've been there.

239
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,840
Oh, that's lovely. It strikes me as a non-therapist, at least as an elegant way to at least try to

240
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,240
capture some of that relationality. Absolutely. I mean, I remember when I graduated and I started

241
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,600
my practice and for the first time I could absolutely just do what I wanted. And I went

242
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,520
on vacation and one of my patients said to me, where are you going on vacation? And I answered

243
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,640
the question and I beamed not because of where I was going, but because I could just answer it.

244
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,400
And the minute I answered it, all the curiosity about it evaporated because who cares where your

245
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,880
therapist is going on vacation unless the therapist is making a big deal out of it.

246
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,440
Yeah, it's funny. There are parallels in medicine as well. I remember being scolded for something

247
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,320
when I was in my third or maybe fifth year of residency. A young boy came in, this is a sad

248
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,000
story, but you'll understand the parallel. So a young boy was in a car that was T-boned. So he

249
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,080
was in the passenger seat. It was hit on his side. Someone had run a red light and he was killed.

250
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,400
It was just unbearably tragic. And so I was the senior resident that received him in the ER and

251
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,000
tried in failure for 30 minutes to resuscitate him. And that meant I was the one that went and

252
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,320
spoke to his mom after and explained what had happened. And I don't think there's a harder

253
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,040
scenario than telling a mom who just saw her son two hours earlier, perfectly normal and healthy,

254
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,400
that now he's dead. Through that experience, I became close to the mom. I went to the funeral

255
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,080
three days later. And for years I stayed in touch with her and would speak with her on the anniversary

256
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:39,080
of her son's death and such. I really took a shit kicking for that from one of the senior fellows.

257
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,320
When he found out I went to the funeral, he said, that is an absolute mistake. You had no business

258
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,680
going to that funeral. You must draw a line between you and the patients. You cannot. And again,

259
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,480
I don't think he was saying this to be malicious. I think that was his way. I guess I never probed

260
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,080
enough to understand what he was saying. Was he saying you have to protect yourself from that

261
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,640
or you have to protect the Institute of Medicine from that? I've never fully understood it,

262
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,200
but I don't think his view was alone. I think probably a number of people would have thought

263
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,320
I made a mistake by doing that. Again, in Laurie's book, I think she talked very eloquently about

264
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,800
going to her patient's funeral. Now that's a different situation. She had such a long relationship

265
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,960
with that patient and the patient insisted that she go to the funeral. But I guess there are just

266
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,640
different ways of thinking about it. It's interesting because I've been in both

267
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,600
experiences. I've gotten the lecture that I shouldn't go. When I started out my practice,

268
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,960
how do you feel of practice when you're in New York City and there's four therapists for every

269
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,440
resident? Roughly, it seems that way, maybe not. But so how do you distinguish yourself when you're

270
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,160
young and just out of school? And so I would take on the cases that people didn't want. And some of

271
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:58,840
them tended to be kids with terminal illness. And so I've had that experience of being told by a,

272
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,720
not a supervisor at that point, because I had graduated, but by a senior colleague that I

273
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,640
really should not go to the funeral. And what they said was, A, you'll find yourself that the more

274
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,480
time you spend in practice, the more funerals you'll have to attend. And then at some point,

275
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,520
there'll be a point where you just can't attend all of them because over the years you'll have met

276
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,600
many people. You can't keep going to all the funerals. But I don't think that meant I had to

277
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:28,760
go to all the funerals, but I then later on, somebody died and they left me a letter that I

278
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,280
got after they died in which they said, I would like you to go to my funeral and speak at it.

279
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,360
So now it's a lift because now fine, I can go who knows who I am, but they want me to speak and

280
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,120
they're hippalors. So I actually can't say anything about anything. And so I went and I was surprised

281
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,480
that almost everyone knew who I was, not from the internet or anything. Just, you know, I was the

282
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,600
only one unfamiliar and it was, Oh, it's a therapist. It's a therapist. You know, so that's a fun room

283
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:06,600
to go into. And then when it was my turn to speak, what I decided to do was to say, you know, I

284
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:14,120
can't talk about him because of privacy laws, but I can talk about you because I knew all those

285
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,880
people. These are the people that sessions were about. And, and, and obviously I spoke about the

286
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,200
good part of it because these are people at his funeral. And I just spoke about how this one was

287
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,280
meaningful and this one was meaningful and this one and this one. And that's how I chose to handle

288
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:36,360
it at the time. And it was, it was, it gave me so much closure. It, it, it was so meaningful to me.

289
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm assuming it was meaningful to the people who were there. I, there was a lot that I got out of

290
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,640
it. I remember it as a very important experience. I'm curious about whether you feel the same about

291
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,560
the funeral you went to. I absolutely do. I just think it's a privilege to be in the position

292
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,160
you're in or the position that I was once in where obviously the most delicate situations of a person's

293
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,360
life, you can sometimes be a part of, and sometimes it's very unpleasant. I mean, I had another

294
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,560
patient who I had connected with very closely. He developed a pulmonary embolism. We tried to

295
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,360
resuscitate him and couldn't, and he basically suffered a catastrophic neurologic injury. So he

296
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,120
was now basically on life support and he was brain dead, very young. He was my age. So, you know,

297
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,920
I was in my probably early thirties at the time, as was he. And after a few days, his family decided

298
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,360
to withdraw support, but his mom asked, they said, look, we can't be here when you take the ventilator

299
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,000
off, but we would like you to be the one that stays in the room with him because we know how

300
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,040
much he liked you. And we remember the first day we walked in the hospital, how much he just

301
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,440
connected with you. And he was so happy that you were going to be part of his team. That's another

302
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,480
one of those asks, which is, boy, ordinarily I would not want to be in the room having to watch

303
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,400
a person take these, what are called chainstokes breaths, which are, you know, not real breaths,

304
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,760
but look like real breaths as they're sort of gasping and dying. But I also thought like that's

305
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,480
the responsibility that comes with this. And I think that that's a reasonable ask of the family.

306
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,560
Yeah. I'm sitting here thinking, and this is why I didn't go into medicine because I don't know if I

307
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,000
could do that. Well, but I think what you did is harder. I mean, I want to go back to something you

308
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,120
said a moment ago. Talk to me about the early part of your practice when you're taking children

309
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,280
with terminal illnesses. I mean, at that point you have two clients, you have the child and you

310
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,680
have the parents, right? Yes. And I was doing a lot of family therapy for that reason. I mean,

311
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,440
my training in graduate school, I had published some research before as an undergraduate and that

312
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,920
exempted me for some research courses in graduate school. And that was enabled me to double up on

313
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,920
practicum and to really study couples and family therapy from year one. And so usually you get to

314
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,320
take that as a module at some point, but I had four years of intense practicum and seeing patients.

315
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,520
And the way we teach couples and family therapy is with one way mirrors, you know, as opposed

316
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,160
to coming in and saying, this is what I said, this is what the patient said. Is that what the

317
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,760
patient said, or is that your collection? You don't know. But when you're doing it and the team and the

318
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,800
supervisor are actually watching you and calling in with suggestions, if they have them, et cetera,

319
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,640
it's a great way to study because you really, you can't hide number one, so you learn more.

320
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,760
And so I did that and I had a lot of qualifications with that. And so that's part of why I got that

321
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,480
gig as it were of working with these families because I could do family therapy as well as see

322
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,600
the parents for consultations individually. And so it was a lot of that. And when I started out,

323
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,200
it was couples, for example, where the husband was deemed aggressive. And so if it was a female

324
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,840
therapist, they felt uncomfortable. I was fine with it. Bring me these aggressive husbands. Now,

325
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,720
they were not, they were not aggressive. They were upset or, you know, angry, you know,

326
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,480
sometimes a little, maybe with, with other issues that triggered their anger, but they weren't

327
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,760
violent people, at least not the ones I worked with. So I would take the cases that people

328
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,480
would kind of fob off. And the other trick that I learned was that stay in town in August

329
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,360
when you're starting out, especially in New York, and then there's no therapists in town and people

330
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:23,480
will come to you. What year did you begin your private practice? 92. So you're going to run out

331
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,040
of toes and fingers. You're going to run out of toes and fingers. I love the idea of stay in

332
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,680
town in August. I mean, that is, yeah, New York is a ghost town. I guess the only thing that could

333
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,960
be better is go out to Long Island in August and then you'll, you'll be overrun. Well, yeah,

334
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,840
you can go to Mountess Vineyard. That's where all the therapists used to be. Apparently, I don't

335
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,680
know. I never went. Why did you decide to go into private practice versus stay in academia?

336
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,920
It's very simple. The dissertation was traumatic. You know, it is for a lot of people. It was for

337
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:59,720
me. I had a difficult situation. I was on a five year visa. I had to complete. I'm an immigrant

338
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,240
essentially to the US. So I was on a visa that allowed me to study and stay for five years,

339
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,680
but I had to be done by then. You were on a J1? I was on a J1. And when I was done, I was allowed

340
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,480
to stay for another 18 months for practical training. But if I wasn't done, I would actually

341
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:23,400
have to leave. So the average of graduation in my program was eight years. And I didn't have

342
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,640
eight years. I had to do it all very, very quickly, you know, and as, as soon as possible. And so,

343
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,000
you know, just that just impacted everything in terms of, you know, just how I did things,

344
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,840
what I did, the dissertation I did. And I had a dissertation advisor who was difficult, a little

345
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,920
difficult to work with. And there were moments I thought, if I have to do this, I'm not going to

346
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,160
finish. She just gave me so much to do. And it was objectively an unusual amount of the study she

347
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,760
wanted me to do was way too big. So it was very, it was very stressful. And it took me literally,

348
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm telling you this, it took me three to four years after graduating before I could walk into

349
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:10,600
a library without feeling a real surge in anxiety. That's interesting. How did you help yourself

350
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,560
through that? I mean, did you have a therapist at this point that you could process that with?

351
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,080
I did, but A, I just stopped going to libraries for a while. I was really traumatized. I mean,

352
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,080
I was really like, I, it's just truly anxiety. Like your heart starts racing when you walk in.

353
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,880
Libraries don't usually do that to most people. They usually consider boring rather than activating,

354
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,960
because when you, everything you have and, and, and every investment you've ever made,

355
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,920
talking about emotionally, intellectually, not financially, might go down the tube if you don't

356
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,160
finish and someone just is making it very difficult to finish. It was very difficult. And it's very

357
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,720
difficult for many people. Many people are traumatized by the dissertation process. Academia

358
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,320
is a very difficult place, but nonetheless, it took me some recovery time. The therapy was extremely

359
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,880
useful at the time, but it was very useful to also be able to start my private practice. And at that

360
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,440
point it was like, I don't want to do research. It was associated. I have to have to go to libraries.

361
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,520
I don't want to do that anymore. It just sowed me on something that I'd been very interested in.

362
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,760
It's unfortunate. Now, why did you decide to stay in the United States versus for example,

363
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,000
returning to Israel or going to Europe where you had spent some time? You still had a fondness for

364
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,560
New York? I had a fondness from New York from my first time I visited New York. The first time I

365
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:36,200
visited New York, I said aloud to several people who remind me of it, I'm going to live here.

366
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,640
I was captivated by New York. And so yes, to me, New York was where it was at, number one. But number

367
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,120
two, when you go through five years of school, then you do a postdoc, then you do a year and a

368
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,840
half of practical training, all your contacts are there. So I could start a private practice because

369
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,560
I had enough contacts to do it. If I was going anywhere else, even if it were Israel,

370
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,760
that's not where my professional contacts were. I would really have to start from scratch plus

371
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,440
not to quote Frankie too much, but really, if you can make it there, why wouldn't you want to make

372
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:21,080
it anywhere else? I read once that you, I don't know where I read this, but in some of my preparations

373
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,000
for our discussion, one of the things you struggled with when you went into practice

374
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,640
right away was sort of endless rumination and an inability to turn it off when you went home. Can

375
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,320
you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah, that was my third TED talk. So that's probably

376
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,200
where you saw it. And it was about that exactly. It was, that talk was actually about rumination.

377
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:49,080
It was about that we experience work stress, most of it actually outside of work. Because when we're

378
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,960
at work and working, when you're absorbed in your work, you're not conscious about whether you're

379
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,400
stressed, you're just doing it. It's when you stop and you're driving home, or in my case,

380
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,400
walking home, or you're sitting at dinner, or you're trying to fall asleep at night,

381
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:12,280
that all those worries and, you know, ruminations come. And if you're not diligent about managing

382
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,920
them and limiting them, they can really take over. And ruminations actually really harmful

383
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,720
psychological practice. What I find interesting about it is that the assumption is that

384
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,000
psychologists would welcome any kind of self reflection, like, oh, reflect away, that's a

385
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,240
great thing. Well, no, there's healthy and adaptive self reflection, and there's unhealthy

386
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,960
and maladaptive self reflection. And it's very clear what's useful and what isn't. If you're

387
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,840
thinking about things in a way that's trying to gain insight or understanding or meaning,

388
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,560
you're trying to problem solve something, you're trying to tackle it, that's adaptive. If you're

389
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:53,400
just replaying the same upsetting memory or idea over and over again, if you're just walking around

390
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,880
your house in the evening muttering, so much to do tomorrow, I have so much to do tomorrow,

391
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,680
it's not useful. You're stressing yourself out. Because when you do that, actually,

392
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,920
you activate your stress response. So you're really stressing yourself out. It's associated

393
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,080
with lack of sleep, with eating unhealthy foods, with irritability, you're checked out with your

394
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,800
family. You know, it's bad in all kinds of ways, but it's not something we pay enough attention to.

395
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,520
So that talk was about, you know, stress from work happens outside of work. So you need to

396
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,480
control it because you'll like your job much better if you're not burnt out. So how did you

397
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,560
start coping with that? How did you begin to treat yourself as you realized this thing was happening?

398
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,560
And I guess before I ask you that question, let me start with another question, which is,

399
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,680
do you think that this rumination was the natural consequence of now being the final person? In other

400
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,840
words, you didn't have a superior or a supervisor, the buck stopped with you. Do you think that was

401
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,200
really the source of the rumination? Absolutely. Because you know, I opened a private practice,

402
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,000
and suddenly the responsibility of that sits on you. You know, you're advising people, and again,

403
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,520
half my practice has always been couples and families. Those are very active, live, sometimes

404
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,720
intense situations, right? This couple has had an affair, this couple is dealing with this,

405
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,880
this family is fighting about that. Individuals don't go nuts in a session usually by themselves,

406
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,520
but a couple, you take your eye off the ball for one second, can go very wrong very quickly.

407
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,760
And people were coming to me with their kids who were dying, with their husbands who they were

408
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,440
afraid of, where they're, you know, like, irresponsible for helping and for having an

409
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,840
impact. And that is a huge responsibility. And I think it just is a process of adapting

410
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,120
to get used to that, to the enormity of it and to the responsibility of it. And that's what was,

411
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,040
and if you're conscientious, which I tend to be, then you ask yourself whether you're doing the

412
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,120
best you ask yourself, am I experienced enough to do this yet? Am I qualified enough to do this yet?

413
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,560
You seek help, you try and do the best you can. But if you're conscientious, it's stressful.

414
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,920
Yeah. And I imagine that, again, to your point about adaptive versus maladaptive,

415
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,640
a certain amount of stress is actually very adaptive, right? Without it, you become so

416
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,560
complacent, but it's really an inverted U. And at some point you'd go beyond it and it becomes

417
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,160
quite maladaptive. And it sounds like for you in the early years, you probably went a little too

418
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,640
far on the rumination. Did you recognize it at the time or is this more of something you now see

419
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,360
in retrospect? Well, part of the story I tell in the TED talk, and I'll just tell it briefly

420
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,200
because it's a quick one, was the moment that made me realize it was it was Friday night,

421
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,720
it was July, it was very, very hot. I was coming home from my office and I lived in Manhattan. My

422
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,120
office was there, I was walking and I get into the elevator in my building with a neighbor who was a

423
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:46,200
doctor in an ER. And the elevator, you know, rose a couple of floors, then shuddered and stopped.

424
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,160
And the man who manages emergencies for a living started banging on the door and poking all the

425
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,800
buttons going, this is my nightmare, this is my nightmare. And instead of being compassionate,

426
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,800
which I would have been in any other circumstance, I found what came out of my mouth was,

427
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:09,000
and this is my nightmare, which was funny to my ears at the time, not so much to his and really

428
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,640
horribly obnoxious and really unkind and plus to remind you, this is a neighbor,

429
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm going to see them again. It was just not wise. But it was so unlike me. And I felt so bad about

430
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,040
it the minute those words left my mouth. I literally said, what is going on with me? That's

431
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,400
not me at all. And that's when I started realizing I am burnt out, but I've only been in practice for

432
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,600
a year. How is that possible? And that's when I started thinking about, well, how many hours

433
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,640
am I working? And that's when I started realizing it's not the hours that I put in my office. It's

434
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,560
the hours that I'm working in my head afterwards. Those don't stop. And that's when I started

435
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,120
realizing I need to get a handle on it. This is really an epidemic, isn't it? I think this concept

436
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:59,240
is probably not appreciated by, I certainly don't think I've appreciated it as much until

437
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:06,040
kind of recently. And I think certainly in the era of nonstop electronics, it's only harder to

438
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,120
detach yourself from work. You're more tethered to it, even when you're not there. I mean, look,

439
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,000
these days, most of us are working from home, which is kind of nice, but also means you're kind

440
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,160
of at work all the time. I think that distinction is a really good one, right? Which is burnout

441
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,040
cannot just result from how much time you are at work, but how much time you're thinking about work

442
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,560
when you're not at work. And that's the part you can control, right? That's the part you have

443
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,040
control over. And yes, to amplify your point, the pandemic has been terrible for people in that way,

444
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,320
because it's not that you're home all the time. It's that your bosses know you are. And you know

445
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,800
they know you are. Like, why didn't you respond to the email? It's not like you were anywhere.

446
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,840
It's not like you had something to do is the kind of subtext of a lot of that exchange.

447
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Right. You weren't commuting for an hour and unable to respond because you were out.

448
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,280
You weren't out of the movies because most of them don't exist. You weren't at a Broadway show.

449
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,680
You weren't doing anything important. Yeah. So it's been a real problem because it's difficult

450
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,120
enough to make a separation when you don't have that physical space door to close and you have

451
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,280
to do it psychologically. But then when you keep getting bombarded with emails and requests and all

452
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,800
those things, and it's actually unless you create firm guardrails for yourself, unless you have the

453
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:27,400
discipline to really determine I finish at this hour, then you're going to struggle with it.

454
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,320
What do you think are some of the antidotes to rumination? What would you say to,

455
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,200
I could just give you the case study, right? I have many patients that fit this description.

456
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,520
Very successful man or woman professionally, right? So by any external measure, whatever the

457
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,720
world could bestow upon them as a measure of success, financial company, building,

458
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,800
entrepreneurial spirit, you name it, they look like they've done it all. And yet when they're home,

459
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,200
they can't interact with their kids because they're constantly lost in thought or their spouse.

460
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,920
They struggle to sleep. They don't have a hard time falling asleep, but once they wake up,

461
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,600
they can't go back to sleep. And that's usually somewhere around one or two in the morning.

462
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,960
They tend to numb that behavior with maybe a little more alcohol than they should.

463
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,240
What I just described is like, sometimes that's me. Sometimes that's my, like, I mean,

464
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,800
I think we all fit in this description, right? We can all put pieces of us in this description.

465
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,800
How do you start helping that person? So the first thing that person has to realize

466
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,360
is that this is not going to happen naturally. It's not that you can say to yourself,

467
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,760
yes, I'm working too much. I'm going to do better. That doesn't work because the intentionality will

468
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,840
be good for a day or two, and then it will fade. You can't direct yourself to not think about

469
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,720
something. You can redirect your thoughts to think about something else. And that will work

470
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,080
to the extent that the other thing that you're thinking about requires concentration and is

471
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,800
absorbing. If you're trying to drown out work thoughts by watching television, you won't get

472
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,480
through the first commercial with knowing anything about what's happening in that show, because your

473
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,480
mind will drift immediately. The same with reading, unfortunately. So it has to be something

474
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,480
active where you're actually engaging your head and doing something that requires concentration.

475
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,520
That's one thing. So if you're really caught in a loop, distracting yourself by doing something

476
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,240
that requires concentration, whether it's a memory task, a puzzle, or what have you,

477
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,440
the research is two to three minutes of a distracting task that requires concentration

478
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,960
should be enough to make that initial urge or the craving to ruminate go away. The other thing

479
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,800
people have to understand is that it feels very satisfying to ruminate because it feels like

480
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,880
you're doing something important. Here's something that's troubling me. I am thinking about it.

481
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,320
What possibly could be wrong with that? Well, you're not thinking about it. You're just

482
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,120
replaying it. You're just obsessing. You're in an emotional hamster wheel and just spinning your

483
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,000
wheels. You're not trying to figure anything out. So the second key is take whatever it is that's

484
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,080
troubling you. It's usually one or two things. People tend to ruminate on a day or one in the

485
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,840
morning about the same thing that's troubling them. Whatever that is, pose it as a problem

486
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,880
to be solved. Because when you pose it as a problem to be solved, let's say the really common

487
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,120
rumination of, I have so much work to do, when am I going to do this? When you pose that as a

488
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,120
problem, it's a scheduling problem. It's when do my schedule, am I going to have time to deal with

489
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,840
this? What can I move to make that time? And if you actually think about it in that way and you

490
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,800
put it in your schedule, move things around to do so, the stress you'll feel about it will ease and

491
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,320
the urge to ruminate will ease with it. The other thing you can do, and I think this is the most

492
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:45,880
important, is these guardrails. You need, and it's not just about that one night, it's about at what

493
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:54,040
point can your family, or you if you're that one, rely on you to show up and not be at work

494
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,760
mentally. And you have an obligation to them. So when you think about it that way, what you should

495
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,600
do is, if you decide that's eight o'clock at night or seven o'clock at night or nine o'clock

496
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,160
at night, whatever it is, then that's the time you let everyone know. And then you have to create

497
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,280
rituals of transition, which make you feel like you're no longer at work. So you have to change

498
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,080
your clothes out of work clothes and you have to put on some music and change the lighting. And if

499
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,480
you have kids, you have to get into the 10 year old mode or the four year old mode or the four year

500
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,360
old shouldn't be up at that hour. But anyway, you know what I'm saying? You know, you really have to

501
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,840
kind of, or if you have a spouse, you have to get into romantic mode. You have to get into the mood

502
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,320
and really engage with them. You can't just sit there passively, engage with them, which means

503
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,200
you plan the evening, you organize the game, you organize the outing, you curate dinner.

504
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,280
You really have to purposefully mark out territory to have a life. And if you don't, you won't.

505
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,680
How often do you collaborate with psychiatrists where they incorporate also pharmacotherapy

506
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,600
that can help with that, you know, medications that can help with sleep by easing some of these

507
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,840
circuits, you know, things like Trasadone or Thorazine, things like that, where you can sort of

508
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,080
start to short circuit it a little bit and it becomes kind of accretive with that process that

509
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:17,880
you describe. I work with psychiatrists all the time. My first instinct would not be to refer

510
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,520
someone, would not be to refer someone to a psychiatrist when they're ruminating in this

511
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,360
way, simply because there are so many things they need to try. I give a few examples. I can give you

512
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,000
formal examples of techniques and things you can do to limit ruminations that will work.

513
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,280
So if there's one of those things that you can do without meds, you should. If it's difficult to do

514
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,200
without meds, I'm actually for meds and I work with a psychiatrist all the time, but this thing

515
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,200
specifically, it will be more effective to change the habit that sets you up to ruminate rather than

516
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,040
just medicate the rumination away because the habit is setting you up to do it so much.

517
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,720
Yeah, I completely agree with that. It's more durable, of course, and it's a lot harder. I mean,

518
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,480
that's the reality of it. To have the durability of the response comes at a price, which is you

519
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,960
have to work harder upfront. It's much more difficult to change the habits as you describe

520
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:12,280
them to take a pill. One of the things for me from a ritual perspective that I have found

521
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,680
to be so helpful, you touched on it briefly, is the ritual of playing with kids. So if you're

522
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,880
lucky enough to have kids, which doesn't always feel lucky sometimes, playing with them in a truly

523
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,400
engaged way. So that means, at least for my two youngest, that's on the floor. Like they're now

524
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,520
on the floor. Yeah, you have to be on the floor. Yeah, you have to be on the floor and you have to

525
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:47,400
be doing exactly what they're doing. You can't be half doing it. That is a real antidote to

526
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:54,440
rumination in that negative loop, but it's also not easy to do initially. It turns out to be a bit

527
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:02,040
of a shock to your system because we, I think, lose this ability to play pretty quickly. It fades

528
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,040
from us. By the time we're adults, we've sort of lost. We don't know what that means anymore.

529
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,000
So it's actually a beautiful thing. I don't know. I'm sure there are other ways to capture that if

530
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,960
you don't have children, but for me at least, that's been a very powerful tool in that toolbox.

531
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Let me tell you how to capture that if you don't have children. There are many aspects of everyone's

532
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,800
identity. You're not just a professional. You're an individual. You're an amateur tennis player.

533
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,320
Perhaps you're an amateur cook. Perhaps you have this hobby or a sports fan. Perhaps you can access

534
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:39,000
any one of those aspects of your identity and bring it forth in that moment. Because when you're

535
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,600
screaming at the television, because your team is doing something you really wouldn't like them to

536
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,040
do, you're not thinking about work. You're just thinking about just get the ball down there.

537
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,160
That's where your mind is. You can access that. You sign up for a race and go train. Then the

538
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,560
question is, can you improve your time? Can you put in the miles you need to put in? Or if you're

539
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,080
an artist, then go into the studio because that's where you'll create best or create a studio-like

540
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,360
atmosphere. There are many aspects of our identity that we can access that actually get

541
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,680
short shrift when we're too preoccupied with work. We will suffer from not accessing these parts of

542
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,720
ourselves that are meaningful, or to the extent that they're meaningful to us. They make us feel

543
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,800
like us and they make us feel important. We do need to give them stage time. By doing so,

544
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,480
it's a good way to two birds with one stone in the sense of give that stage time, access that part

545
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,400
of your creativity, your personality, whatever it is. At the same time, if you're doing one thing,

546
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,080
there's not room in there for the other. How long did it take you to undergo this

547
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,520
transformation at the beginning of your career? Well, actually, it's a long story,

548
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,840
so I'll just give you some highlights of it because I went through an exploration.

549
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:00,840
It didn't take me long to limit the hours and to limit the rumination. But what it brought up for

550
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:08,840
me was, okay, here I am, a year or two now into my private practice. I have been full steam ahead

551
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,760
since my undergraduate days, undergraduate and graduate degree, then postdoc, then practice,

552
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:23,880
I hadn't stopped to consider how I feel about what I'm doing. And when I did at those times,

553
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:31,960
in addition to limiting ruminations, I realized I cannot do psychology 50, 60 hours a week.

554
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,320
It's too much for me. I need to do something else. I need to balance that. It can be related to

555
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,040
psychology, but it has to be different. And then I went through a two-year exploration

556
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,800
of what that would be. That exploration took me through some unusual, perhaps, stations. There

557
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,360
was a point where I was in conversation with the head of behavioral science at NASA because I

558
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,560
wanted to be an astronaut. I'm not saying that was a wise tangent on my part because actually,

559
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,400
I did not become an astronaut. But I was curious. Then I decided to maybe I should

560
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,840
enroll in the space university. Again, astronaut dreams. Then I realized, you know, there's not a

561
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,800
lot of behavioral science going on in space. That's not maybe the best place. Plus, I heard

562
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,160
about this idea of floaters, which is the problem with bathrooms in space that you end up with.

563
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,640
Sorry. So that turned me off. These small things sometimes make a difference. And so I ended up

564
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:34,520
realizing that I wanted to write. And at that point, I decided to limit the hours of the weekend

565
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,280
of the day in which I see patients and create space for writing. And that's what I did for many years.

566
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,800
How good were you at writing when you started?

567
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:53,080
I'm going to answer you this way. I did that for 14 years. I didn't publish a word.

568
00:51:53,800 --> 00:52:00,920
I didn't get paid a penny. That might hold within it some hints about my skill set at the time

569
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,720
as a writer. Now, to be clear, I was writing screenplays at that time. I went back to,

570
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,680
I had a rapprochement with film and I was writing screenplays. A couple of them did get options. So

571
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,200
I wasn't completely on a fool's errand. But, you know, there's the luck of the draw. I was in New

572
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:26,760
York. I wasn't in Hollywood. And it was in 2008 that this one screenplay got optioned for a second

573
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,840
time and started, looked like it was, it might happen. And I got my hopes up and I was working

574
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,760
with this company. And then the financial collapse happened. And that went by the wayside. And that

575
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:45,480
was when I was like, Oh my goodness, it's been 14 years. And then an agent I knew, who I knew

576
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,280
already said to me, like, I've been telling you just write psychology. And I didn't want to write

577
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,040
psychology, right? The whole writing thing was to not do psychology. And then I'll tell this very

578
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,880
briefly just cause it's so stupid, but it's like how life. Don't tell it briefly. Just tell it.

579
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:07,000
I love the story. I went to Best Buy to buy earphones. And I tried to get the attention of

580
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,200
someone there to help me. And three people walked by and didn't help me. And so I got annoyed and I

581
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,800
left the store. And as I'm leaving the store, there's a big picture of the manager. Like I'm

582
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,040
talking about like a four foot picture of the manager smiling and saying, how was our customer

583
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:29,560
service? Email me and let me know. So I emailed them and let them know. And the surprising thing

584
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:36,920
was that I got a email back the next morning saying, I'm so sorry that happened. Here's my

585
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,640
personal phone number. Let me know when you're coming by. I will make sure someone helps you

586
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:48,360
in whatever you need. And that email made me think, wow, if I would have gone to a customer

587
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,520
service hotline or stood in a customer service line, that would have taken forever. It really

588
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,680
made me think that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. And that gave me an idea. I'm like, huh,

589
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,000
what's the psychology behind that? And I, I started doing a search to see what books have

590
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,520
been written about the psychology of complaining and there weren't any. And a week later I saw

591
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,880
that agent at Christmas party and I said, no, I had this idea for a psychology book. And she

592
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,640
goes, finally, what is it? I said, no, I'm not even sure it's a book. It's just an idea. And it's

593
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,240
about the psychology of complaining. And I would call it the squeaky wheel. And she looked at me,

594
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,840
she goes, I can sell that. I'm like, there's not a that to sell. And she said, I'm telling you,

595
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,840
do the research, write a proposal, I can sell it. And it sold at auction.

596
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,520
So let's talk a little bit about the book. I've watched your Google talk, I think from back in

597
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,080
2011, where you you presented this. I love the story, by the way, of when you walk into the

598
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:48,280
bookstore ready to sign your copies. We'll let you tell that. But where did your research take you?

599
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:54,200
How did you how did you begin to sort of uncover what was known and more importantly, you know,

600
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,880
what the what the downside of complaining was? Because that to me is what you take away from

601
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,320
that talk, right? Is right. There's a there's a hidden cost of complaining incorrectly.

602
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:12,520
Right. Well, at that point, I was cured from my anxiety related libraries, I could enter a library

603
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,760
without having a panic attack, which was super useful when you're researching a book.

604
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,720
So back to the libraries, I went, and I started looking at research, but most of the research

605
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,320
was actually in the customer service domain. And when couples therapy domain, but very little bit

606
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,600
about our individual psychology. But from I started interviewing people, I started thinking a lot about

607
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:41,720
it. And the thing that came up over and over again, was that complaining is a form of expressing

608
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,880
empowerment, to the extent that we're trying to get a result. But the research was, for example,

609
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:54,600
that 95% of people who have a customer service complaint with a product, don't voice it, even

610
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:01,080
though they're very upset. Why? Because they feel and they fear that it will be too difficult and

611
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:07,320
too time consuming and too aggravating to do that. Instead, and this is the part that's fun,

612
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:14,680
they will tell 12 to 16 people on average about that incident, spending way more time getting

613
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,920
aggravated each time all over again, and getting zero result. And that fascinated me. I'm like,

614
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,400
wow, I'll complaining psychology is really broken. We just don't, you know, it used to be a

615
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,280
transactional tool and now it's just a venting thing that we do. And the problem is that when

616
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,400
you tell 16 people about how you were wronged and you don't do anything about it, you're going to

617
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:45,160
feel like a victim. You're going to feel powerless because that's the story you're telling. Here's a

618
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,240
story of my getting aggravated and not being able to do anything about it is the subtext of the story

619
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,480
you're telling, whether you realize that or not. Because it really reinforces it, right? I mean,

620
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,280
it's one thing to not complain to the entity who could right the wrong. And if it stopped there,

621
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:07,000
that could be problematic enough. But to then go and tell the story to 16 people who are not

622
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,600
empowered to fix it. I mean, boy, that really myelinate, I'm using the term myelination loosely,

623
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:18,440
but that almost, you know, myelinates excessively a whole new set of pathways that create a narrative

624
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,800
that's probably quite unbearable, right? Yes. And I love that way, that phrase. So we should be

625
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,240
using that from here on. But yes, it does. And especially when you think about how many complaints

626
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,360
we have on a daily basis, it's not one. So that's one thing. The other thing is when you work with

627
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:40,040
people in psychotherapy and individual psychotherapy, and they bring up issues with their

628
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,680
sibling, with their sister, with their brother, with their friend, with their mother, with their

629
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,880
partner, whatever it is. And you ask the most obvious question was, and did you discuss that

630
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:55,080
with them? The alarming amount of times in which you hear no, and the

631
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,800
stupefying amount of times in which they look at you like, why would I discuss it with them?

632
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,560
That's just going to cause an argument. They're not stupid. It's really powerful when you think

633
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:12,440
about it. Like people absolutely are convinced that to voice something that's really important

634
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,360
for them, meaningful for them, is an impossibility. Now, they're right. They're right because

635
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,760
the vast majority of people express complaints so poorly, it actually does get the wrong result.

636
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,520
It actually does cause the argument. It actually does piss off the customer service representative.

637
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:36,120
It turns out that when strangers scream at you on the phone and curse at you and threaten you,

638
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,080
you're not necessarily moved to try and help them as best you can.

639
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:46,440
Wait, wait, just let me confirm that. All kidding aside, do you get the sense that

640
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:53,640
this is a process that has changed over time? Let's take a very extreme example.

641
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,160
What did complaining look like when we were hunter-gatherers? Obviously, we don't have data,

642
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:08,440
but can we rely on any insight to say when we walked around in tribes of 18, if Johnny was

643
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,440
supposed to go out and get dinner that night and didn't, and the tribe doesn't get to eat,

644
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,800
do we have any sense of how that was handled? Then what has been that evolution to where we

645
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:26,600
are today? How did we get to the point where we're at today where 19 out of 20 people won't

646
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:33,800
voice the complaint to the entity that can address it, but we'll go and spend an average of 12 to 16

647
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,320
times lamenting it to the wrong people. I want to understand that transformation through our

648
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:46,120
history in as much as you think it's understandable. I can't say much about hunter-gatherers in that

649
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:53,480
domain, except to say that what happened with hunter-gatherers is that the research on ostracism

650
00:59:53,480 --> 01:00:00,840
and rejection tells us that the risk you took as a hunter-gatherer of offending your tribe mates

651
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,400
was severe, because the implications were that if you got ostracized from the tribe,

652
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:13,080
you weren't going to make it. So to really piss off your fellow tribe mates was something you

653
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:18,520
probably did very judiciously. So I don't know how that was expressed at the time. I can go back 150

654
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:26,920
years to the origin of the term, the squeaky wheel. It came from a poem by a guy called Josh

655
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,000
Billings, who was a humorist in the days of Mark Twain. And the poem was something like,

656
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,560
whatever, now I forget it, but it's something about, I hate to be a kicker, and I always long for

657
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,400
peace, but the wheel that does the squeaking is the one that gets the grease. It's something like

658
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,720
that. The issue there is the word kicker. The word kicker was the very insulting word associated with

659
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:53,640
the people who complained too much. In other words, as a society at that time 150 years ago,

660
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,080
complaining was frowned upon. And because it was, it was used mostly transactionally. If the

661
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,400
blacksmith didn't put the horse on correctly, you'll go and say, you know, my horse is limping,

662
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,840
but if your horse was only limping slightly, you might not, because you didn't want to be a kicker.

663
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,880
So it was frowned upon back then. And now it's now you're going to become a reality TV store,

664
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,600
if you complain enough, or if you, you know, voice something on social media. In other words,

665
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:27,960
the idea today, and I think it's, it's really developed because culturally complainers,

666
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,480
the squeaky wheel did, I'm not sure if they got the grease, but they got attention.

667
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,160
And sometimes the attention was better for them than the grease. And, you know, the grease is

668
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,280
supposed to quiet the wheel and they weren't looking to be quieted. They were looking to

669
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,400
actually get a megaphone and be louder, a lot of people. And culturally, they were rewarded

670
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:53,160
in that way. Number one, number two, we are expectations have grown over the industrialization

671
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:59,320
of society such that we would never, you know, complain about discomfort that when we were

672
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,560
sharing for people to a bed and going to the outhouse to go to the bathroom in the snow.

673
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,880
But today, you know, if there's anything slightly wrong with something we're going to make,

674
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,520
because we are expectations are so high and complaining in general gets triggered when

675
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:18,360
there's a big gap between expectation and reality. And because expectations have risen,

676
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:24,760
the gap is risen and complaints get triggered and then they get reinforced by culture and society.

677
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:31,640
How much general discontent do you think can be attributed to what you just said,

678
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:36,280
this gap between expectation and reality? I mean, do you, like what percent of,

679
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:41,160
this is probably an unanswerable question, but just directionally, like how much human suffering,

680
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,960
psychological suffering comes down to that single Delta?

681
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,680
A lot, right? I mean, you're asking for numbers. I don't know, but a lot. And more so because of

682
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,440
social media, because if your expectations were that, you know, you could see what your neighbor

683
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,880
did was all about, right? I mean, keeping up with the Joneses was keeping up with the people next

684
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,040
door because you could see what car they had. But now you don't have to be next door. You can see

685
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,040
that that person you grew up with lives very far away. Now they have this car and they have this

686
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,080
house and their wife looks like that. You know, in other words, social media has, and because it's

687
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:21,160
so curated, right? It's a highly curated best of in most cases, set very poor expectations or very

688
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,000
wrong expectations for what we should expect out of life and how much work we should be expected to

689
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,120
put in to get that. So that's not helped. Do you think that people say of your generation who

690
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:41,160
didn't grow up with social media and now as adults experience social media have one set of

691
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:47,240
potential downsides from that, from what you just described, but say a 10 year old today who's never

692
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,000
known a world without social media by the time they're your age is going to be in a different

693
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,920
situation. How would you compare the experiences of someone like you versus the person who's going

694
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,320
to be you some years from now who's never known in any other way? And I guess what I'm trying to get

695
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:08,360
at is if there's a harm to someone as an adult today, will it be greater to someone who's

696
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,360
didn't have some sort of a grounding at least without social media? I think so because for me,

697
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:19,880
you know, I grew up without social media. So for me, what stands out about the internet, social

698
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:26,040
media apps, all of those things are the convenience of them because I remember that before social

699
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:32,040
media, I actually had to call people to see what was going on with them or write to them and post

700
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:38,760
it in a mailbox. And now I just need to look at my phone. And so that convenience of being able

701
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,560
to keep in touch with so many people at a distance, you know, and see what's going on with them and

702
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:48,600
enjoy the pictures here and they're just knowing what's happening or, you know, reach out if I see

703
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,880
something not great is happening. It's very, very convenient. But for someone who grew up with it,

704
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,720
it's not about convenience. It's about image curation. It's about comparison. It's about how

705
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:06,040
everyone else has more followers than I do. Why does he get more followers or why did, you know,

706
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,360
it's just a very, it's looked upon very, very differently. It's looked upon as a way to measure

707
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,440
your worth rather than as a way to get something done. You've talked about, and I want to talk

708
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,920
about it with you, you've talked extensively about the impact of failure on our emotional health.

709
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:29,720
A lot of what you just described can be viewed as a failure, right? By definition,

710
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,960
if you're willing to compare yourself to a broad enough array, you're a failure. I mean,

711
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:42,920
there's always someone who is smarter, better looking, richer, more popular. There is no

712
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,400
metric by which I couldn't in 30 seconds come up with 10 people who are better than me. So

713
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:57,640
what is the antidote to that misery that comes from comparison? First of all, it's a true misery.

714
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:03,320
And the issue is that, for example, I work with a lot of successful people. They don't think of

715
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:09,240
themselves as failures. It's more painful. They just don't think of themselves as successful

716
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,440
because they've only made 20 million and they're looking at the person who made 50. And there's

717
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,880
something extraordinarily tragic about someone who went from nothing to $20 million and doesn't

718
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:27,560
think of it as a success. Right? I mean, that's just unfortunate that you would spend so much effort

719
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,600
to get somewhere and have zero appreciation for the fact that you're there.

720
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,480
I work with somebody once who tried to climb Everest and only made it to base camp.

721
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,880
And I was like, oh my goodness, you made it to base camp? And they were like, but they didn't

722
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,440
get to the top of Everest. I'm like, again, you made it to base camp? In other words,

723
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:53,240
that's actually impressive. It's not that simple. It's not that easy. And if you keep looking up,

724
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:00,920
you will never, ever be satisfied. You will never, ever be happy. And one of the things I say to my

725
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:09,000
patients all the time is if you just pause and celebrate these stations along the way, it doesn't

726
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,920
mean you're done. This idea that I only celebrate when I reach the top of a heap that doesn't have

727
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:23,560
a top is such a bad life plan because you will never be satisfied. You will always feel envious.

728
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:32,760
You will always feel insufficient, even though you've done so much. How unfortunate. And it is

729
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,560
very difficult to get people to look down or look sideways rather than keep looking up.

730
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:48,200
Was it ever difficult for you to find empathy within yourself for patients of yours who by any

731
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:54,840
objective metric were enormous successes, but who couldn't appreciate it? For example, when that

732
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,960
person comes in and says, I started with nothing. I'm worth a hundred million dollars, but I don't

733
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:07,560
feel like a success because my peers are all worth five times that. One could take a very jaded view

734
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:13,960
and say, I mean, shut up. I can't even relate to what you're complaining about. I'd give anything

735
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,240
to have a fraction of what you have, but I don't sense that in you. I sense a genuine empathy for

736
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:25,160
that person is actually suffering as odd as that might sound to someone on the outside. Was that

737
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,840
natural for you to be able to have that empathy and to be able to communicate what you just said?

738
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:36,040
Yes, it was natural for me. The job of a therapist is I see it. I'm not saying it for all,

739
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:43,400
but as I see it is my primary job is to see the world through that person's eyes, to really

740
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:49,480
understand their experience. And if they're saying to me, I am ridiculously successful financially,

741
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,760
but I don't feel like a success. My job is not to react to that as I would if I'm hearing it from

742
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:01,400
stranger. My job is to really try and understand, well, why? What's going on? Why can't they allow

743
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:09,000
themself this? What happened in their childhood that put them on this path of just keep barreling

744
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,080
forward and don't pause to celebrate anything? Because if you dare take your eye off the goal

745
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,080
or your foot off the pedal, you will come to a shuddering halt and never get going again.

746
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,880
It's usually some kind of fear there. It's very old, that fear. It's obviously not something from

747
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:31,640
their adult lives. But once I find that once you really understand someone, once you really see the

748
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:39,400
world through their eyes, two things happen. Number one, you have compassion for them. And number two,

749
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:45,800
for me, again, personally, you like them because when you really get someone, there's a fondness

750
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,760
that gets triggered, at least for me. And one of my, and I discuss this sometimes with people,

751
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,640
and they look at me like I don't understand these terms. For me, customer service as a therapist is

752
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:03,800
very important. And customer service, what does that mean? It means that because I have those

753
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,760
feelings, it's important for me that when I go to see you in my waiting room, or these days, when you

754
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,600
show up on my Zoom, I'm genuinely happy to see you. You're going to see that in my face. And I

755
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,560
think there's something very powerful about that for people who come to see you. And you look like

756
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:26,680
you're genuinely happy to see them, that you're genuinely interested in how they've been and

757
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,040
what's going on, and that you're generally compassionate for the things that are not going

758
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:39,960
well for them. And to me, that's a natural outcome of using empathy to gain understanding, to be able

759
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,680
to do your job. I love what you said earlier, and I actually want to go back to it and even

760
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:50,920
come up with some of the thoughts and behaviors that one can use, because I certainly see this a

761
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,800
lot in my patients, and I see it a lot in myself, which is an inability to simply acknowledge

762
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:04,600
something done as being successful. And certainly what you said resonates with me. I suspect that

763
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,040
also would resonate with anybody who's going to be honest with themselves. There is a fear that if

764
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:16,440
I stop and acknowledge this, I will lose it. I'll give you even the most trivial example. People

765
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:21,480
who listen to this podcast know how much I love archery and race car driving. And so I'm driving

766
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,120
my simulator almost every day. And you know, when you take a new car onto a new racetrack, you'll

767
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:35,880
start to set goals. Like, I want to achieve this. I want to break a minute and 14 seconds on this

768
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:45,240
circuit in this car. And it could take me months to achieve it. Invariably guy, whenever I finally

769
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:53,080
achieve my goal, the happiness lasts for maybe 13 milliseconds. And then I immediately think,

770
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:59,640
well, how much faster can I go? It's almost like I'm afraid to just say, wow, Peter, that was

771
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:05,160
amazing. Look at that. You literally, it took you six months to shave two seconds, which is a big

772
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,680
deal, right? Two seconds off a minute, you know, a minute 16 to a minute 14 is a big deal. But what

773
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:16,440
are we afraid of? Like what are we afraid of losing and why? And instead wouldn't it be, I like the

774
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,240
way you said it, which is how about doing both? How about saying, that's a wonderful achievement,

775
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,600
Peter. You should be really proud of yourself. And yes, by all means, try to take more time off,

776
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:32,760
but not at the expense of appreciating what's going on. How do you help people do that for

777
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,880
things that are much more important and much less trivial than what I just described? For example,

778
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:45,240
building a business or achieving financial security or mending a relationship, like, you know,

779
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,520
things that actually matter in life. It's okay. So we'll trade secrets. Fine. I'll tell you. Here's

780
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,680
one of the things I do. There are many avenues that you can take, but here's one of them.

781
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,760
What I would do, and it's difficult, might be a little difficult to do with a race car example,

782
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,160
just because it's a short timeframe. But if you take somebody who's been working on something for

783
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:10,920
a long timeframe, or the person who just finally made their first million dollars or whatever it is,

784
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,600
or made the first exit, what have you, is I will take them to a visualization exercise. Now, the

785
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:24,200
key about visualization exercises is the detail. The more detail the visualization, the more you'll

786
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,480
connect to it emotionally. And so you actually, you're not just quickly thinking about, you're

787
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:35,800
actually in the therapy session, you're going to spend time really painting the picture. So I want

788
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:42,520
to take you back to when this was a dream, a hope. Where were you? Let's find a time where you were

789
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,720
thinking about this. Where were you? What was the weather like? What were you wearing? Who were you

790
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:52,920
with? How were you feeling back then? What was the context for you? What did this mean to you? That

791
01:13:52,920 --> 01:14:00,920
idea of one day. And if you can really help connect people to what it felt like at the point

792
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:07,800
where they were just dreaming of it, thinking of it, wishing for it, and hoping, but truly not

793
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:15,880
knowing if they will ever have it. And then you have them insert into that visualization their

794
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:22,520
present selves that comes to give the news to their past selves about the success. And you have

795
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:29,400
them really visualize and imagine that entire conversation. How do you say it? How do you reveal?

796
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,200
And what does that younger version of yourself think when you're a bit told, yes, this is not

797
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:40,120
just a dream, you do achieve it. How would they react? How amazing would they feel? How excited

798
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:46,920
would they feel? So that's one way that you can really try and connect someone by giving them

799
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,680
the perspective of the person who hasn't achieved yet them at a younger age and looking at the

800
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,320
achievement from that point rather than from the point of the person who the day before was close

801
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:03,320
to achieving and now they just did. So what? So that sounds an unbelievable amount like EMDR

802
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:11,160
and trauma work where you take the adult version of you and you go back to the child version who's

803
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:17,640
been traumatized and you experientially go back and almost sort of try to help them and rescue them.

804
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,400
I mean, it's a pretty profound exercise you just described.

805
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:27,560
It is very profound and it's very, very moving for them and me truly. Those are the moments that

806
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:33,160
I remember very strongly in certain treatments of when the person really connected and you could

807
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,000
see on their face that they were experiencing it from that perspective rather than the present one.

808
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,640
But it doesn't have to be about trauma, right? I'm not necessarily as opposed to EMDR.

809
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,880
Oh, no, that's my point. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,480
Just to an earlier perspective.

811
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:52,360
And you're right because from any one day to the next, it's very difficult to appreciate a change,

812
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,520
but over a decade, I mean, it could be a step function.

813
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,000
Right. Now the other thing that's very, very useful is a lot of the times these people who

814
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,200
don't want to celebrate have people around them who do. And what I'll sometimes say is that,

815
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,760
and I'll say this because it's going to sound silly, but it does work. I'll say, you know,

816
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,400
if you don't want to go and have a celebration for you, do it for them. They want to celebrate you,

817
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,280
indulge them. And the thing is that they might start out thinking that they're indulging them,

818
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,280
but they will get swept up most likely in that moment when they're actually out celebrating

819
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,120
that thing that they really didn't want to, but their family or friends really thought was

820
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,480
important to, they get caught up in it and they can connect to it at some point.

821
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,680
So actually sometimes from the outside in works to just start celebrating, you'll connect

822
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:44,120
at some point to what it is you're celebrating. So how was your book received?

823
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:51,160
Which one? The first one, sorry. Yeah, going back to 2008. So the squeaky wheel book and how much

824
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:57,800
of an itch did that scratch for you vis-a-vis you are now, you're an author. It's a new part of an

825
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:02,760
identity, right? Well, remember those 14 years, right? So it wasn't... Yeah. Well, now you're a

826
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,960
published author, right? So there's like your name is on the book. Well, I actually got paid

827
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,760
for the first time. And when somebody says, oh, what do you write? I can actually point to

828
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:19,080
something and say, it's a thing. Here it is. The book was received not well in the States and

829
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:27,880
rather well internationally. That book sold in 12, I think to 15 countries and did rather well

830
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,840
in them. What was funny to me was the first country was South Korea. And my agent said,

831
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:38,280
oh, we just sold that book in South Korea. And I said, why? What a book about complaining.

832
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,480
They said, well, I'll send you the email. And the email said, oh, this is great.

833
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:49,160
Koreans are the biggest complainers. And then we sold it in China and we got the same email. Oh,

834
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:53,640
this is great. Chinese are the biggest complainers. And then the French were the biggest

835
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:59,160
complainers. The Estonians too, the Poles are biggest complainers. Every territory that bought

836
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:03,160
that book announced that they consider themselves the biggest complainers as if it was some kind of

837
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,480
title worthy of having. But my perspective is that it just touched a nerve with people.

838
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:18,040
It didn't do that well here, primarily, I think, because the book is a mixture of psychology and

839
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:25,080
business. And it's difficult when it's not quite one thing or the other would be my guess. I think

840
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,240
the book is quite well written, actually. But if you're looking for the psychology parts, you have

841
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,360
to get through the customer service parts. And if you're looking for the customer service parts,

842
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:37,160
then what's this thing going on about couples? So I think it was a difficult book to market.

843
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,760
But what happened was because it didn't do well, my agent said to me, the book came out in January

844
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,720
of 2011. By March, it was clear that it's not taking off. And my agent said to me,

845
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,400
if you want to sell another book, you have to do it now. And I'm like, excuse me, the book just came

846
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:57,320
out. She goes, yes, but it's not doing well. And I can convince editors that it would do much better

847
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,920
in paperback. But it's going to come out in a year in paperback. And if it doesn't do well,

848
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,880
no one's going to be interested in the second book. So you have to sell one before that one

849
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:11,640
comes out in paperback. I'm like, I'm still doing publicity for this one. Like, can I take a break?

850
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,120
She goes, no, you can't if you want to have another book. And again, 14 years taught me that

851
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:22,280
let's take the opportunities when we can. So I put everything aside and started working on a

852
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,560
second book. Now, was that the emotional first aid?

853
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:30,200
Emotional first aid. Yeah. What was the motivation? How did you decide that that was going to be the

854
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:35,080
next? I mean, it's an unbelievably important topic and something I want to discuss with you now. But

855
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,160
how did you decide that that was the next book? I decided that I definitely wanted the next book to

856
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,480
be just full on psychology. I wanted it to be about emotional health. And I wanted to really

857
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:48,440
reflect the work I was doing with patients in which I was at that point, you know, for quite a few

858
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,520
years at that point, because I'd recovered from the dissertation, regularly reading research

859
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,360
articles and trying to find ways to apply findings in my practice, because research articles in

860
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,560
psychology are not written for practitioners. They're written for other researchers. But they

861
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,840
might actually have a lot of information that's very relevant to practitioners. You just have to

862
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:10,440
translate the research finding into an intervention. So I would do that when I found it necessary.

863
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:15,160
And I would try things out with my patients and let them know there's this research and it implies

864
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:20,200
that this might be useful. Try it out. And if it was, I would recommend it to other people. And

865
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,160
over the time, I had curated a lot of different little tricks and tips and techniques for people

866
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:31,320
to manage common emotional wounds like failure of rejection, guilt, self-esteem, low self-esteem,

867
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,600
and such. And I always had this idea, it would always piss me off, that, you know, medicine

868
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,640
cabinets were such a thing, but there were none for emotion. There was no psychological medicine

869
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:47,160
cabinet. And so I had this idea, like, I want to write a book that's, in essence, the psychological,

870
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:52,520
emotional medicine cabinet you should have in every home. And so I started doing that.

871
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,520
Let's contrast three types of injuries. And I want to better understand why it is we struggle

872
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:05,320
so much with emotional injury. So case one, a broken femur. And let's make it really juicy.

873
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:12,680
And it's a spiral fracture that's open. And you can literally see the femurs sticking out of the

874
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:20,120
thigh bone. Injury two or illness two, type two diabetes. Don't really see anything from the

875
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:25,720
outside, but, you know, we have a blood test that can tell us you have it. Injury number three,

876
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:34,680
rejection. Nobody sees it. And the point I think you make is we're far less likely to even acknowledge

877
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:43,400
it. Help me understand that spectrum and what it is about us as a species that is very quick to

878
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:49,240
acknowledge case one as an injury. And frankly, despite the fact that we don't really see case

879
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:55,480
two externally, we don't seem to have a hard time accepting type two diabetes as an illness that

880
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:02,680
warrants treatment and can't be left alone. And yet for many people listening to this, the idea

881
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:08,840
that being rejected or failing at something warrants treatment is going to sound stupid and

882
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,080
you're going to have to do some convincing. Is it okay if I answer by way of a story?

883
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:20,680
Please. Okay. So this is a true story. I'm sitting with a very, very senior executive in a financial

884
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:27,080
institution and I'm talking about emotions and the importance of emotions. And he immediately

885
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:36,120
shuts me down, waves his hand and says, yeah, I don't, I don't believe in feelings. And, you know,

886
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,040
I do what most psychologists do on their court of guard. You know, you just repeat the statement in

887
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:47,080
the form of a question. I said, you don't, you don't believe in feelings. And he said, you know,

888
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:51,960
I know people have them, but it's not as if they're real. They shouldn't matter. Now,

889
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:59,080
he said this in the first few minutes of a couples therapy session with his wife sitting next to him,

890
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:06,680
dabbing her eyes with a tissue because she was having feelings. So it was an interesting time to

891
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,040
make that statement that they didn't believe in feelings when his wife is crying beside him in the

892
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:17,400
first few minutes of a therapy session. But so many people feel that way. And when he says, you

893
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:23,160
know, they're not real, it's not unicorns or aliens that you have to have proof of sightings or

894
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:30,120
something, in other words, but he really didn't think feelings mattered. And so what I did is I

895
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:37,240
turned to the wife and I said, did you know your husband doesn't believe in feelings? And she stopped

896
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:44,760
crying. She looked at me and she said this, no, but it explains a lot. And I started laughing

897
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:50,200
really hard because I thought it was really funny. And I laughed so hard that she started laughing.

898
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:56,520
And then she laughed so hard that he did not start laughing. He actually looked really irritated.

899
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,000
So I looked at him and I said, what, you don't believe in laughter either?

900
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,840
And then he was literally about to get up and I said, you look angry. He goes, I am angry.

901
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,840
Like, well, there's one feeling you believe in. Now let's talk about some of the others and how

902
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,880
they might be impacting your marriage. And he sat down because I've made the point. You can't just

903
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:18,200
curate. If you believe in anger, there are other feelings you have to believe in as well.

904
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:26,360
But many people think that feelings are not worthy of attention. And to be honest with you,

905
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:33,480
when we were earlier on in our development, societally, industrially, when it really was about

906
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,560
just keep alive, you know, roof, shelter, the hierarchy of needs, as it were, your emotional

907
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:43,960
well-being was very much at the bottom of that hierarchy. Actualization was at the bottom of that

908
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:50,840
hierarchy. And so we had to reach a certain level of industrialization and comfort and safety and

909
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:57,400
self-sufficiency as a society, as individuals, to be able to start looking at higher order needs,

910
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:02,280
beyond safety, shelter, et cetera, food. And that's when we started paying attention more

911
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:07,720
to emotions. It's a very recent development, relatively speaking. And if you go even today

912
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:14,040
to certain war zones, no one's going to be listening to podcasts about how to self-actualize and be the

913
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:19,160
best you. They're going to look at podcasts about what to do when your femur's shutting out of your

914
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:26,200
leg, or you have type 2 diabetes and no insulin. So that's going to be a bigger concern. Fair enough.

915
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,920
But for most of the industrialized and Western world, probably, we are at a point where we need

916
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,760
to think about our emotional well-being, even because it has a huge impact on our physical

917
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:42,600
well-being and our longevity and our health. So even if that's the priority, just staying alive,

918
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,520
we know there are many emotional and psychological conditions that can actually contribute to you

919
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,680
dying much more quickly than you might otherwise. So that would behoove you in that way. But we are

920
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:55,640
finally at a point where our emotional well-being, our happiness, our life satisfaction is something

921
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,000
that's on our agenda. And then we're starting to pay more attention to it, but not everyone is.

922
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,360
By the way, I think Guy, that is probably one of the most eloquent explanations, both in terms of

923
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:10,840
the story, but also I think drawing on the hierarchy of needs is a great point I hadn't

924
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:16,680
considered, which is you could argue since the domestication of crop and cattle, we've had the,

925
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:21,960
only then, only since then have we had the luxury of even thinking about stability with respect to

926
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,000
food and infrastructure. And that would have started the clock on when having the luxury of

927
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,920
thinking about this began, whereas physical injury, we've had our entire evolutionary history

928
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,320
to worry about. Right. And that Industrial Revolution was 11,000 years ago. It's just not

929
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:43,240
that long and, you know, like writing's only been around 5,000 years or whatever. In other words,

930
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,800
yes, we're pretty new and it's only very recently that we can attend to this.

931
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,080
Yeah. I mean, even go one step further, language might only be 50,000 years old and yet clearly

932
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,920
prior to language, we still had to concern ourselves with a physical injury. There's no

933
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:02,440
animal that isn't concerned with a physical injury. I guess the one thing that would draw

934
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:09,240
some concern is I don't think we have another 50,000 years or 10,000 years or 5,000 years to

935
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,160
figure out how to deal with emotional injury because we probably won't survive it. That's

936
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:19,480
been my conclusion as a person who has come to this from the lens of the physical side, right?

937
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,280
The longevity side of things. I think it hasn't taken me my whole life, only half of it,

938
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:31,000
to figure out that if the emotional piece is not working, at best you will continue to do okay

939
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,120
physically and just be miserable, which strikes me as the definition of torture, or at worst you'll

940
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:43,640
have all of that plus an impaired physical existence. So either way, if you're emotionally

941
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:52,040
broken, I think you're in for a very difficult life. So how do we shave 5,000 years off the next

942
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:57,960
50? And how does your work and the work of people like you start to change this mindset?

943
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:03,640
One of the reasons Laurie and I decided we want to do this podcast is because we

944
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:14,200
sat there and spoke about, wow, if we can really show people by doing this work and putting it out

945
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:20,600
in a podcast, that people who, you know, so we have this episode about Heartbreak, an episode about

946
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:26,200
parental alienation, episode about this and that, but within those episodes there are a lot of

947
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,840
insights that we're offering that are nothing to do with that and that are very transferable. And

948
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,480
in the reviews that we have and the letters that we get, it's the point that people emphasize the

949
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:42,120
most that, wow, nothing to do with me and I learned so much about myself regardless. And I think we,

950
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:49,080
and I've said this before, I think any mental health professional these days has to think of

951
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:57,480
themselves as an ambassador because there is such ignorance that we have about our emotional and our

952
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:07,160
psychological states and how we operate and what matters. And any professional needs to be able to

953
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:14,280
talk about that and to let people know and to educate because we are so in need of that education.

954
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,840
One of the things I sometimes do in a session, a lot of the sessions that I do from people who are

955
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,600
foreign, they find me they want to do sessions obviously via Zoom way before the pandemic and

956
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,920
usually have an hour say. And for me if I have one-off hour with you, I'm going to come in

957
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,920
guns blazing right from the beginning because we're going to get something done. And so it's going to

958
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:40,280
be a little head spinning for the person because I'm not holding back here. I'm not doing the, well,

959
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:46,360
I don't need to do that now, we'll get to that in week 10, all now. So I am this point experience

960
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:52,440
enough that I can fill in a lot of gaps. I don't need to hear a lot before I can figure out where

961
01:29:52,520 --> 01:30:00,840
the problem is and where the issue is. And what people find really interesting is that, well,

962
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:06,280
wait, how are you able to articulate what I'm feeling better than I can when you just met me?

963
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:11,720
And this is the thing that makes me sad. It's something we should all be able to do if we were

964
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:17,160
better educated in how psychology and feelings work because there's a lot we don't know but there's

965
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,240
a ton we do. We know, for example, that rejection hurts even if the person who rejected you is

966
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:28,280
someone you absolutely despise and would never want to be associated with ever. But if they

967
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:33,400
rejected you, it's going to sting. Now if you don't know that we are wired to respond that way,

968
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,640
you're going to have a lot of other ideas about what kind of loser you are or, you know, like why

969
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:45,640
is this hurting? Why? Knowing our basics, and we have some basics about our emotional responses,

970
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:52,280
understanding that if something happened to you and you feel this way about it, anyone else that

971
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:58,440
happened to is going to feel similarly they might not show it, they might not display it,

972
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:03,960
they might not confess it, and they might not feel it to that extent, but feel it they will.

973
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:11,240
Our emotional DNA is global, it's universal, it's evolved, we're all very, very similar in our

974
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:16,840
emotional responses. In our experiences, our responses might differ, but our experience is

975
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:22,120
the same. So there's so much we can teach, there's so much we can inform, and there's so much that

976
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:28,520
if we did would feel unifying as humans, would make us feel more connected to one another because

977
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:34,920
we're all so the same under the skin. You said something there that really resonated. It's a bit

978
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,600
tangential, but I think it's worth mentioning and I think you'll agree, but if not, please tell me.

979
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,960
I remember at one point I was saying something to one of my therapists, her name is Esther Perel,

980
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:52,440
you I'm sure know Esther, you're both in New York. If I may, Esther and I have shared offices for 27

981
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:58,200
years. We have been office mates for 27 years. I don't think I knew that, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

982
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,720
If you've been to her office in person, you have to say that. I have many times. So no,

983
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:07,640
so I've been in your waiting room then, that's amazing that I didn't realize that. So Esther said

984
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:14,120
something to me once when I was explaining to her a thought pattern I was having. I was explaining

985
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:18,920
it to her as though I was the only person in civilization that has probably ever had this.

986
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,920
So of the 10 billion people or whatever number of people who have lived to date,

987
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:28,920
Peter Tia is the first one that has ever had this pattern of thought. As I start to explain it to

988
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:37,480
her, she finishes the thought for me. I said, how do you know that? She said, Peter, I

989
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:43,240
hate to tell you this, and I'm not saying this to minimize you as a person, but this isn't a very

990
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:52,200
uncommon thing. Your mind when it's poisoned is staggeringly unoriginal. Lots of people

991
01:32:53,240 --> 01:33:00,920
have the exact same poisonous sets of thoughts that you do. And unfortunately, there's a very

992
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:07,160
common set of beliefs that are maladaptive that people like you have. And I've heard every one

993
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:12,200
of them, and it's basically what you just said. It's the pattern recognition that allows people

994
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:19,160
like you and Esther and Laurie to be so good at what you do. And I actually took great comfort in

995
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:23,160
that, right? I mean, she said it to me in a way that was like, hey, I don't want you to not feel

996
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:28,360
special because everyone wants to be special. But at the same time, Peter, please realize like

997
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:34,600
you're actually not that special. And that's good news in this situation. You're not alone.

998
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:41,560
Yes, you're not alone. And it should be comforting, right? Because, and the upsetting thing is,

999
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,960
you're not alone on the one hand, on the other hand, because you probably hadn't expressed that

1000
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:51,880
to many people before other than to a therapist, as many others haven't. That's why you didn't know

1001
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,920
that it was common, because people don't talk about it. And that's, again, why I believe that

1002
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:03,400
it's the duty of therapists to be ambassadors in some way, because even if it's a dinner table

1003
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,720
discussion, and by please, by all means, I'm not trying to say walk into a room therapist and

1004
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:13,240
start taking over with your drowning on about your work. Please don't do that. But if you have an

1005
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:20,360
opportunity to point to a generality, to point to research, to say, yeah, this is how this works,

1006
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:27,160
this is a truism, this is something that's always the case, then do so because you can educate

1007
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:32,760
people, we can crowdsource this, we can really let people know, you know, I mean, I have the

1008
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:39,560
podcast, I write books, I give a lot of talks, I do consulting, I am trying in these years of my

1009
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:47,400
practice to really get the word out because I do feel a certain sense of mission. Because when you

1010
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:53,560
do, it's kind of upsetting that we know so little and that people know so little. And for you, that's

1011
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:58,040
a moment of insight and therapy, where for Esther, she could complete the thought and she could

1012
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,680
probably have completed it even before she told you she could complete it. If it's that clear to

1013
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:08,920
her, it should be clear to everyone, but we just don't have any platforms by which we can

1014
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,680
disseminate that information. It should be high schools, obviously, because that's when we have

1015
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:18,200
people captive and that's, we should be teaching life in school, not whatever esoteric information

1016
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:22,440
people will soon forget when they graduate. We don't, it's unfortunate, but that's where it should

1017
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:28,760
happen. Do you think the tide is changing? You know, you've been in practice for nearly 30 years.

1018
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,600
When you think about where we're going to be 10 years from now versus where we were as a society

1019
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:41,160
10 years ago, specifically with respect to the seriousness with which we take emotional injury,

1020
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:47,720
what does the derivative look like? The most important event in that regard,

1021
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:56,280
the event that moved the dial more than anything else by far is the pandemic.

1022
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:05,240
By far, because there are very, very few people untouched. And I don't mean by illness, I mean by

1023
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:12,360
stress, by anxiety, by grief, by loss, by loneliness, by tension, by relationship,

1024
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:20,040
rupture, by fear, by depression. Very few are left untouched. And I know that not just because

1025
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:27,960
that's how we are and that's how we respond, but because I have been getting calls and talking

1026
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,600
with entities who would never have contacted me before, because they would have been like, well,

1027
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,480
this is just not something I can saddle my employees with listening to. And now suddenly it's

1028
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:43,080
a necessity. Now suddenly I need the people who work for me to know how to deal with this,

1029
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:49,080
or with that, or how to understand this and that, and all kinds of very specific kinds of organizations

1030
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,480
who truly would have been at the bottom of my list of who would ever call me, have called. It is

1031
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:59,160
something everyone is very much aware of. And I wrote an op-ed for the Boston Globe about this in

1032
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:06,920
April, in which I said this pandemic is going to leave a legacy of mental health crisis that is

1033
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:14,360
going to be years to address. And we should start thinking about it right now because we cannot,

1034
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:20,280
as therapists, address the needs of people who are not enough of us. Therapy is not a practical

1035
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:25,960
solution for everyone. We need to start working on online mass interventions that can be deployed

1036
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:31,240
psychologically and emotionally, because we're going to have masses of people with trauma. What

1037
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:37,000
about all these nurses and doctors in the front line who are truly traumatized? I give a talk to

1038
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:44,200
7,000 nurses in the Duke nursing system in May, I think it was. And one of the questions I had

1039
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,160
was, it was a very simple one, but it was just, it stayed with me. This nurse, she was very

1040
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:59,720
emotional. She said, what do I do when I am risking my life and my family's life every day? And then I

1041
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:05,880
go on social media and my own best friends, my own immediate family members are out there. They're

1042
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:12,280
not wearing masks. They're not social distancing. Every image is a stab in my back. What do I do

1043
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:20,680
with those feelings? And that's what we're going to have after this is all over. A whole cadre of

1044
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:27,000
nurses and doctors and physicians assistants and all of it, healthcare workers, frontline workers,

1045
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,960
who are truly traumatized. What do we have in place to help them? Nothing, nothing. And we'll need it.

1046
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:41,080
And not just them. What do we have for the kids, for the adolescents? We've been dying to socialize

1047
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,680
because that's what life is about and prevented from doing that. For the parents who don't have

1048
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,800
a break because they're remote learning this and this. People are going through an extremely hard

1049
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:56,360
time emotionally. And while most people are unscathed physically, emotionally, everyone is

1050
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,840
a little bit damaged now. So the one thing it's done though, yeah, we don't have interventions. I

1051
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,560
can go on about that for a while, but I'll get off the soapbox. What I really mean to say is that

1052
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,880
people are actually paying attention to it now. They're more receptive to it now. They're more

1053
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:15,960
interested in it now. And I think they will listen more now. How can the work that you do,

1054
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:23,960
that Bester does, that Laurie does, how can it be scaled? Because every time I meet a therapist,

1055
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:31,400
they don't have room for more patients. It's just very difficult to get in to see a great therapist.

1056
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:36,200
And I know sometimes people will say, look, I can do a one-off consultation, but I can't take a new

1057
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:42,760
person on as a regular. And so how do you scale this given that it's not a widget, right? You can't

1058
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:51,400
just tell the factory to make more. It takes years to... Even if at this moment, guy, thousands of

1059
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:56,440
people were listening to this as undergraduate students and felt, you know what? This is an

1060
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:02,360
amazing calling. Rather than go and do X, I'm going to go and do this. I mean, we're still a

1061
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:07,880
decade away from those people being on the front lines. So what do we do between now and then?

1062
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:15,240
The answer is not make more therapists. That's not the answer because it's just not practical.

1063
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:21,080
The answer is there are already all kinds of studies going on about online interventions

1064
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:28,520
for things like loneliness or anxiety. There are all kinds of protocols and they are just

1065
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:35,880
being used in regular research, but they're not... This vaccine effort that was a global vaccine

1066
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:43,400
effort. If a fraction of those resources were allocated to finding useful interventions

1067
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:49,000
that truly can be put online and anyone can do in the privacy of their home in their own time,

1068
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,560
will it be as effective as one-on-one therapy? No. Will it be effective and actually helpful

1069
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:02,200
to a lot of people? Yes. Not everyone needs the therapy. We have nothing and we have therapy or

1070
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:06,920
read an article or read a book. There's a lot in the middle that we can do that can be deployed

1071
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:11,960
and scaled really on a mass level. And then once you do it in one place, you just translate it and

1072
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,040
you have to adapt things for culture always, but that should not be that heavy a lift.

1073
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:21,960
And it can be really popularized in the sense that people can find these resources to at least

1074
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:27,080
triage, at least do some first aid. Emotional First Aid, the book I wrote, it's a book,

1075
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:34,440
I don't come with it. And yet that book has done really well. It's in 27 languages and people write

1076
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:39,400
to me all the time saying, oh, I keep dipping back into it as needed. And it's very useful because

1077
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:45,320
it is that medicine cabinet. And if you can do it in a book, you can do it even much better with

1078
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:51,720
interactive online tools, with apps, with AR, with whatever you need to use. But if the

1079
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,440
efforts were going to that, you can scale and you can actually do things that are really,

1080
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,680
really helpful for people on a mass scale. You can't do that with medicine because a femur has

1081
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:05,320
to be set, a broken femur individually. You can't look at an online thing and do it yourself.

1082
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,400
But some of this you can when it comes to psychology and emotional health.

1083
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:15,400
One of the things you've written and spoken about that I can speak to from personal experience,

1084
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:19,800
and initially I would have never believed it is the use of affirmations.

1085
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:26,520
I was challenged at one point to come up with an affirmation for every year I've been alive.

1086
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:33,240
So I'm 47 and that meant I had to come up with 47 affirmations. And my experience with it,

1087
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,360
which I think you will understand because of the way you've spoken about it is, and this was

1088
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:43,320
during a very intensive therapy. This was three weeks of residential care, right? So this was

1089
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:49,080
10 hours of therapy a day. For the first two and a half weeks, I couldn't come up with two.

1090
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,960
I just refused to write anything down. And I wasn't pushed to because I think the therapist

1091
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:02,760
understood I had to come up with these on my own. I had to believe them. And then I had an enormous

1092
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:09,880
breakthrough at the very end of that experience. And in one sitting wrote them all out. And the

1093
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:15,880
important part here is believe them all, right? Talk a little bit about the importance of believing

1094
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:22,280
an affirmation that you come up with versus going to an affirmation website and downloading

1095
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:30,440
some posters. So positive affirmations are defined as those typical sayings that you get on

1096
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:37,160
refrigerator magnets and the bottom of calendars. I am going to be a great success. I am beautiful

1097
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:43,560
and worthy of great love, et cetera, that kind of thing. What the research shows, and by the way,

1098
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:49,240
these are a multi, multi-million dollar industry, these positive affirmations. What the research

1099
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:55,800
shows is that there is a very specific group that benefits from them and a very specific group that

1100
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:01,800
is harmed by them. The people who are harmed by them are people with low self-esteem. The very

1101
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:06,840
people these affirmations target. Why are they harmed by them? Because when you're feeling very

1102
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,880
unbeautiful or very unsuccessful, looking in the mirror and telling yourself that you're going to

1103
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:18,840
be a great success, when you feel like a massive failure is not going to register as believable.

1104
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:23,240
And because it's going to register so unbelievable, it's going to remind you that in fact you feel

1105
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:29,160
like a failure. Same with saying you're going to find great love when your immediate experience

1106
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:36,840
has been that you're not. So who they do help is people with high self-esteem because it doesn't

1107
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:42,280
contradict their internal beliefs, which is horribly ironic, right? That the thing it's

1108
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:46,680
supposed to help, the people it's supposed to help get harmed, the people who don't need it can benefit

1109
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:51,480
from it. But there's a way to change affirmations into useful. And the way you do that is, as you

1110
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:57,880
said, you individualize them so that they sound believable to you. So don't say, I'm going to be

1111
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:04,520
a great success. You can say to yourself, I'm going to persevere until I succeed. That's believable.

1112
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:11,080
Don't say, I'm worthy of great love. Oh, I'm beautiful and I'm worthy of great love. Say,

1113
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:18,120
I have amazing eyes and an amazing personality and I'm going to keep putting myself out there

1114
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:25,160
until I find the person who appreciates them. Individualize the affirmation so that it sounds

1115
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:33,240
believable to you and yet is hopeful and optimistic and sets a goal. That's the key to making them

1116
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:38,360
useful. And those versions don't usually come on refrigerator magnets because they're too long.

1117
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:44,520
They don't fit. That's exactly right. I mean, it took a couple pages to write them all out.

1118
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:52,200
And I went through a phase of my sort of recovery slash journey where every single day I would take

1119
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:56,600
five minutes out and I pegged it to getting dressed in the morning so that it would never be missed.

1120
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,920
So I had a ritual that said, when you're getting dressed, you're going to also stand in the mirror

1121
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:05,160
and you're going to read these and not too quickly, you're going to read them and sort of reflect on

1122
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:10,920
what they mean. And truthfully, Guy, there were days it was hard to read them. There were days

1123
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,800
I didn't fully believe them when I was, you know, having a bad day. You know, when one of your

1124
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:21,160
affirmations is I am a good father and you just yelled at your kid over something that you

1125
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:25,640
shouldn't have yelled at them for, it actually becomes a little hard to read that. But it also

1126
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,600
reinforces that you are a good father who just made a mistake and that's okay too. And you get

1127
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,360
to read it again tomorrow and come to it with a different light. But, you know, when I heard you

1128
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:39,400
speak about that, which again, I think was in one of your other Google talks, I found it to be

1129
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:45,800
an amazingly insightful view of something that I felt a little hokey about having done, but

1130
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,600
personally found very valuable. And again, if you'd told me a year earlier, Peter, you're going to

1131
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,640
find this valuable, I would have said there's zero chance I'll find that valuable. Right. Because what

1132
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:59,960
you would have associated was Stuart Smalley, right? Looking in the mirror and set it a night

1133
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:06,440
live and doing it or some kind of trite thing that to you sounds trite because it is to you

1134
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:10,920
doesn't sound personal because it's not. So yeah, you were thinking of that version, but that's the

1135
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:15,080
whole point you can individualize. And I would even say to you that on the day that you'd just

1136
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:20,280
yell at your kid before you're about to say, I am a good father, adapt it. And that day don't say,

1137
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:26,520
I am a good father. You can say, I am trying to be a good father and I am learning from my mistakes.

1138
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:30,760
Say you can always, always tweak it so that it has the same sentiment,

1139
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,440
but it matches the reality that you're living in that moment.

1140
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:40,280
That's a fantastic point. Do you think that there's something to be said, by the way, for the

1141
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:47,320
fact that as a writer, it makes you a better therapist? I mean, I sort of, obviously there's

1142
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:54,040
a enormous selection bias because we're more familiar with people who are out there doing

1143
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:59,000
other things besides their clinical practice. And often it's their writing and speaking that

1144
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,640
brings them to our attention. I mean, I sought out Esther years ago, but in part it was because

1145
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:09,880
of her work, right? And that's how I sought her out. But that said, do you think that for example,

1146
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:16,600
like you and Laurie, when you're doing your podcast are able to do what you do because of

1147
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,040
the discipline that writing has brought to your thought process?

1148
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:27,480
It's an interesting question. I'll answer it two ways. One thing that's very important to me,

1149
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:34,760
I'm sure to Laurie and I know it's important to Esther, is language. Because sometimes a lot of

1150
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:39,320
people will say to me, oh, I'm really empathetic. I'm an empath. Some people say, I don't like the

1151
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,920
word, but they'll say it anyway. I'm an empath. And I'm like, what does that mean? Like, I really

1152
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,760
know how people are feeling. I'm like, how do I know you do? In other words, if you aren't able

1153
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:55,320
to express it in language that truly captures it, I have no idea if that's what you know or not.

1154
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,400
It's one thing thinking that you know how someone feels, but it's another being able to articulate

1155
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:06,280
it very clearly and very accurately. And so language is a very important tool for therapists,

1156
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:11,960
because for example, our emotional language is very limited, tends to be its primary colors.

1157
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:16,680
We're angry, we're sad, we're upset. There's no nuance, but there's tons of nuance in language.

1158
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:23,320
We have dozens of words for certain levels or kinds of upset. And I try and choose mine

1159
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:28,200
very, very carefully, because I want to make the point that you're not just angry. You're also

1160
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:34,600
quite frustrated and you're also quite resentful. And in that way, you feel a bit of rage too.

1161
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:39,720
And you can start teasing out the nuances. And when I start going through that with someone in

1162
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,320
that context, they'll get it. It'll be, yeah, that's true. That's true. That just would never

1163
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:47,080
be how they would have described it. They would just be like, I'm annoyed, but no, no,

1164
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,160
it's very nuanced. You're also a little bit relieved because you've been waiting to vent

1165
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:56,040
and yell at that person. It's very complex, our emotional experience, except we tend to think of

1166
01:49:56,040 --> 01:50:00,360
it in just like one thing, which is not. So language actually is very important tool for

1167
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:04,440
therapists, because when you're describing emotions, which you are apt to do, you really

1168
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:10,360
want to be able to do so. But the other way it's very important for a writer is that I,

1169
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:16,360
and I know Esther, I know Laurie, a lot of, you know, most therapists I know, use narrative

1170
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:23,480
psychology to a degree in anything that we do. Because when somebody comes to me for a first

1171
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:29,960
session, it's not a one. So what my duty is in a first session is you will tell me your story,

1172
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:34,520
and then I will tell it back to you at the end of the session or midway at some point,

1173
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:39,560
I will tell your story back to you and it will be a different story. And in my version of the story,

1174
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,800
why you feel the way you do, or why you're stuck in the way you do will become abundantly clear.

1175
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:53,640
And what you need to do in basic rough terms will also become clear, because in your version of the

1176
01:50:53,640 --> 01:51:00,680
story, you're stuck. In my version of the story, you're not. And I can explain why. But that means

1177
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:06,200
that I have to be able to describe your narrative, take the data points that you presented to me,

1178
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:11,800
shuffle the order, look at some of them from a different perspective, and tell a different

1179
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:17,720
story. The simple example I always use just to illustrate this is, if you're a survivor of a

1180
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:25,080
horrible plane crash, and you lost a limb in that plane crash, what is the story you have about that?

1181
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:31,480
Are you a horribly unfortunate person who became disabled in a plane crash? Or are you the luckiest

1182
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:37,880
person alive? Because you're the only one who walked away, albeit maybe hopped. Which is to say,

1183
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:42,840
those different perspectives are going to make you recover in a very different way, feel very

1184
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:48,120
differently about yourself, and feel very differently about the life you go forward to live.

1185
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:54,120
It'll be much more adaptive to think of yourself as a very fortunate survivor, rather than have

1186
01:51:54,120 --> 01:52:00,440
the self-pity of think, you know, you've been horribly, horribly victimised. And we have choice

1187
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,280
in the stories we tell ourselves. We don't have choice about the facts. We have choice about our

1188
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:09,480
organisation, our perspective, and the narrative we create around them. And as a therapist, you have

1189
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:14,600
to be able to create and present a different narrative. And writing is certainly helpful.

1190
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:19,320
You bring up such a great point. And as I think about it, you know, I can think of examples of

1191
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:23,160
people who don't write, you know, or haven't published books, but yet have this. I have a

1192
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:28,680
friend, his name is Jim Kachalka, who's an amazing psychologist. Now, he's a colleague of mine,

1193
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:34,120
a friend of mine, not a therapist of mine. But any time I've sat down with him to have dinner,

1194
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:39,800
unfortunately, I just suck up all of his time because I end up, you know, it's always a one-sided

1195
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:45,960
discussion, but he's just so giving. And I come away from these discussions appreciating what

1196
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:54,600
you've said, which is Jim's ability to articulate things is unbelievable. And I could go in with

1197
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:00,600
a narrative that says, I'm upset about X, and come out of that discussion with

1198
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:09,400
12 more layers of complexity to that onion. So maybe that is the sinquanan of a great therapist,

1199
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:15,240
is that ability to say, you showed me an onion, I showed you there were actually 12 layers to it.

1200
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:21,080
Right. I do think it's a very important aspect that you have to be able to master at some point.

1201
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,440
Guy, I could continue this discussion with you for hours, but we've been at it for quite a while. I

1202
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:30,040
guess I want to conclude by just letting the listeners know that if they haven't already done

1203
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:36,120
so, they really need to listen to the podcast you do with Laurie. I absolutely love it. There's one

1204
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:40,840
episode in particular I'm just going to make a make a shout for, for people to start with. It's the

1205
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:48,680
one called Molly's Father's Suicide. I found that to be a very, I don't know why, I just wanted to

1206
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:54,200
hug Molly to pieces. Like I wanted to jump through my phone and just grab that woman and squeeze her

1207
01:53:54,200 --> 01:54:03,080
till tomorrow. Peter, can I tell you how I have to restrain myself? I said this to my brother, I said,

1208
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:07,640
I am so dying to see how she's doing. I want to email her, I want to call her, I want to give her

1209
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:12,920
a hug. And we've gotten those responses, we forwarded her a lot of emails and texts of people

1210
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,400
going like, oh, please send hugs to Molly, please send hugs to Molly. I haven't done that because

1211
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:22,200
I'm respecting her privacy and her distance, but oh my goodness, you feel for this woman.

1212
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:28,120
Yeah, so I would say folks that haven't heard the podcast start with that one and that'll give you

1213
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:33,560
a sense of the kind of work you guys are doing. Guy, thank you very much. Peter, thank you very

1214
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:37,080
much. It's been so interesting. You've asked me things I've never been asked and I've been doing

1215
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:42,360
interviews for many, many, many years. And when you get me to start thinking about things and

1216
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:49,480
going, oh, I appreciate that so much. So thank you very much. It's been a pleasure. And I'm sure

1217
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:53,400
this won't be the last time. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.
