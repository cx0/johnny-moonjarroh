00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:47,040
Hi everyone, welcome to this special edition of the Peter Attia drive.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,560
This is a special edition because it is the longest podcast ever recorded in the history

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,760
of podcasts.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,480
It was a seven hour only getting up to pee once interview with Dr. Tom Dayspring, who

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,960
a number of you will immediately recognize by name.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,560
Tom is one of my most important mentors and is generally the mentor to the mentors in

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,920
the field of lipidology.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,520
We're breaking this into five parts.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,760
So this is going to be the week of Tom.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,120
So today, if you're listening to this in modestly real time, on Monday we're releasing part

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,000
one, and there will be a part released each day, Monday through Friday.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,160
So this seven hour podcast will be released over the course of a week.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
I'll call it the week of Tom.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,800
And what you're listening to right now is part one.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm going to use part one to give the bio and background on Tom and give you just the

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
insights over what is covered in part one or episode one.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,200
And then prior to each episode, I will just highlight what's going on there.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
Tom Dayspring is the chief academic officer for True Health Diagnostics, a laboratory

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
company.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Tom is a fellow of both the American College of Physicians and the National Lipid Association.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,320
He's board certified in internal medicine and clinical lipidology.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,520
He practiced medicine in Jersey for just under 40 years.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,080
And in the last two decades, he's given about 4,000 domestic and international lectures

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,960
to lipidologists and cardiologists everywhere, including a little over 600 CME programs on

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
this topic.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,800
He's listed in the Guide to America's Top Physicians and is on the editorial board of

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,720
the Journal of Clinical Lipidology.

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
He's authored and co-authored more manuscripts than I was able to count, although that's

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,600
obviously a countable number.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,640
And he has received the 2011 NLA National Lipid Association President's Award for Service

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,040
to Clinical Lipidology.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,200
I actually spoke to the president of the NLA who gave him that award and he described it

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,040
as the most important award he had ever given out.

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Tom's really active on Twitter at Dr. Lipid.

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,800
That's D-R-L-I-P-I-D.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,720
And more than anything else, as I think comes across in these interviews, I share just the

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,280
greatest affection for Tom.

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
He can be rough around the edges.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,440
And when I ask Tom a dumb question, boy, do I get an earful about it?

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,720
And he'll always tell you, I'm sorry, I'm just a Jersey boy.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
I just don't know how to sugarcoat it.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,600
But I don't know how to express my gratitude towards Tom other than the way I probably

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,040
do so in this podcast.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,360
And I really wanted to do this to share so much of the knowledge that Tom has given me

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
with so many other people.

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,080
There's obviously been such an interest in understanding this space, as I think I probably

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,600
alluded to in this podcast back in 2011, 12, and maybe even into 13.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,920
I wrote a nine-part guide on cholesterol called the Straight Dope to cholesterol.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
It was about 30,000 words.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,080
It was quite a lot of work.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,040
Obviously could not have done that without Tom's help.

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,000
And to this day, Tom is probably the single most important clinical mentor that I have.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,880
In this first episode, which is probably going to be a little bit longer than the others,

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,320
this is where I'm going to really introduce you to what I call the national treasure.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,220
And that's just the way I describe Tom.

66
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,220
He is just a national treasure.

67
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,300
And I am not the only one to say that.

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,020
You ask any card-carrying lipidologist who they look to as their go-to guy on education,

69
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,720
and it's going to be Tom.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,420
We talk about some of the definitions of things, but we actually start by talking about things

71
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,060
about Tom's personal life that most people don't know.

72
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,580
His obsessions, firefighting, hockey, and ultimately lipids.

73
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,260
And there's a common thread to Tom's obsessions.

74
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,900
He's an amazing author and illustrator.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,380
And we talk a little bit about some of that stuff and his gift to teaching.

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,300
So in many ways, the first episode is the soft one.

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,860
This is the one that kind of gets you warmed up, gets you ready to think about what we're

78
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
about to do.

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,380
And then in episodes two through five, we get into sort of the more technical stuff.

80
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,380
The other thing I just want to say for this episode, as some of you may recall for the

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,820
episode with Dave Feldman, we splurged on getting a transcript so that we could really

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,660
make this technical information available.

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,740
Tom was so kind to go through and edit and correct all the things that Dave and I had

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,760
said incorrectly, which is invariably going to happen in a long podcast.

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,800
And he also did the same thing for this podcast.

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,620
So when this podcast came out, I want to say it was 80,000 words or 90,000 words.

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,260
It's basically a book, medium sized book.

88
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,940
Tom went through with a fine tooth comb and made all of the corrections there.

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,460
So what you'll also find in the show notes is sort of an editorialized corrected version

90
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,460
of the transcript.

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,340
I think it is safe to say that you could learn more in the next seven hours, meaning episodes

92
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,300
one through five, and you would learn in a lipid fellowship.

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,060
And I suspect that many people who are studying in a lipid fellowship will find great value

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
in this.

95
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,220
That's the level of detail we go into.

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,660
And at the same time, if you're a patient, if you're a primary care physician, I think

97
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,020
you will still find this incredibly valuable.

98
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,820
So this was a little more work than usual to prepare for it, to record it, to edit it,

99
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,520
to break it down, to do all of the things we did.

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,700
But I believe it's worth it.

101
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,820
And I am so happy to have been able to have done this because I think there are a few

102
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,260
things that I get more pleasure out of than sharing Tom's knowledge with other people.

103
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,260
So with that, welcome to episode one of the Week of Dayspring.

104
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
Hey, Tom, how are you?

105
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,580
I'm very good, Peter.

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,820
Thank you so much for schlepping all the way up to New York to talk with me.

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,420
Not the world's longest journey.

108
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,420
I think a lot of people have been looking forward to this.

109
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,420
I think many people have sort of relied on your insights, your knowledge over the years

110
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
as I have.

111
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,420
And I think what follows, and I have no idea how long this is going to be, but I suspect

112
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
it will not be one episode.

113
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,420
But this will certainly be the master's class in lipidology.

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,420
But not just for physicians who want to understand this more, but I think for patients too.

115
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
But there's so much stuff to talk about before we get into that.

116
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,420
And I figure if you're willing to talk about it, what I'd love to do is have you explain

117
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,420
a little bit about this kind of remarkable physical transformation you've undergone

118
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,420
in the last year, which this is only this is actually the first time I've seen you

119
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,420
in person in eight months.

120
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,420
And I could barely recognize you as you walked down the hall to my apartment yesterday.

121
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,420
Well, many people who have seen glimpses of me on the internet or whatever in person,

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,420
God knows how many lectures I've done across our great country, have always known, geez,

123
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,420
for a lipid guy and a cardiometabolic guy, he's kind of obese.

124
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,420
So he probably doesn't always practice what he may be preaching and everything.

125
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:49,420
So indeed, I've had a long, long experience with obesity and insulin resistance and

126
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,420
giometabolic disarray and everything.

127
00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:00,420
And always had the usual million excuses why I didn't have to do anything about it or so.

128
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I felt good.

129
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Nothing was happening to me.

130
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,420
And I just did kept ignoring it, but I did keep aging.

131
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:16,420
So for those who don't know, I reached 72 years of age this year, 71 last year.

132
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
I've been great friends with Peter for a long time.

133
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,420
And Peter, of course, has been harping at me to do better nutritionally and everything.

134
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:33,420
And I just stumbled into his podcast done up at MIT, where he talked a lot about longevity

135
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
and Haiti average age of death in the United States.

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,420
And as an old man, I can see a little light at the end of the tunnel, like, geez, if Haiti

137
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,420
is the average age of death, how much longer do I got to go?

138
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,420
And over the last five, six years, I've dealt with a bunch of morbidities, a lot of them

139
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,420
arthritic in the spinal nature, but cholecystectomy and fatty liver and things like that were

140
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
sneaking up on me.

141
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,420
Even though, other than my bone issues, I felt pretty bad.

142
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,420
So I just said, you know, since I do see the end of the tunnel and Peter's making a lot

143
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,420
of sense, what he's talking about, about longevity here, maybe I ought to listen to what he's

144
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
preaching here.

145
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,420
And he did raise the topic of intermittent fasting during that talk and everything.

146
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,420
I sort of figured I got to do low carbs finally more than I ever did.

147
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,420
But the fasting was kind of new to me, you know, and in further conversations with Peter,

148
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,420
he just put me on an incredible regimen he's developed.

149
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,420
It's a modified intermittent fast that I said I can do that.

150
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,420
And I did it.

151
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,420
And as Peter says, that was 67 pounds ago over the last 11 months.

152
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,420
I just finished my 11th month of a, I do one week a month of 700 calories or less, pretty

153
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
significant carb restriction.

154
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,420
And it's not only the weight has gone off, but I mean, a bunch of residual orthopedic

155
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,420
symptoms that I was having that I just thought I'm going to have to live with the rest of my life.

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
I've had hip replacements, several spinal surgeries.

157
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,420
I almost 90% of the time, 95% I feel like I've got my normal hip back, my normal spine back.

158
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
I can walk again.

159
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,420
We walked to dinner last night and you said that that was a walk you would not have been able to do a year ago.

160
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Yeah, a year ago I could walk on a short block and I'd have to sit down and wait for my bones to say,

161
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
okay, try it again.

162
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,420
And now they just don't have any of those limitations.

163
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
So it's been miraculous in a lot of way.

164
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,420
And I think it's way beyond just the weight loss too.

165
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I think this fasting and whatever else it's inducing in me has just changed a lot of things.

166
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
And we know that because look, I work for a laboratory.

167
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:56,420
I can do a lot of sophisticated testing on myself and checking every cardio metabolic marker that pretty much a lab can do

168
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
now a day.

169
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,420
And there was some ugliness to my report a year ago.

170
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:11,420
And it's those who follow the lab I work for know it's reported in red, yellow and green and green as you've got an optimal level of whatever.

171
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,420
And I went from a pretty yellow red report to a hundred percent green report.

172
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,420
So it's not only I'm feeling so much better biochemically, I'm doing an unbelievable amount.

173
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,420
And I mean, I'm happy about all of that, but the disappearance of the M and a levels have been especially impactful.

174
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Yeah.

175
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
So I'll interject to just add some commentary.

176
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,420
So the first thing I would say is you were quite resistant.

177
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
I recall when we first had the heart to heart.

178
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,420
So you called me after you saw the MIT video.

179
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
I don't even know why you saw it.

180
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
I don't think I sent it to you.

181
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
You linked it to me.

182
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,420
And one last joke about that, you know, I'm good friends with Peter.

183
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
I don't want to ignore anything.

184
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
He sends me.

185
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
I send him a lot of stuff.

186
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
And I know he reads most of it.

187
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
And I said, all right, I'll humor him.

188
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
I'll listen to 10 minutes of this lecture.

189
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
And at least I can be honest.

190
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Yeah, I listened to it.

191
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,420
And I put it on and I'm a busy guy.

192
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,420
I don't have an hour and a half to listen to a podcast.

193
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
And I just couldn't stop listening to it.

194
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I went right to the end of listen to it one more time.

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,420
I've referred to many other people to listen to.

196
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:22,420
So it's one of these things in life that somehow it really impacted me on that day.

197
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Which is interesting because the first 10 minutes are not particularly interesting.

198
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
So I don't know.

199
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Luckily, we snuck you through.

200
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,420
So I'd always had this concern because over the past seven years we've known each other.

201
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
You know, you see my labs.

202
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
I see your labs.

203
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,420
And I'd always been kind of concerned about those LFTs.

204
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
And it was like they were getting higher and higher.

205
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
And there were a number of other things I was concerned with.

206
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,420
So when you responded to me saying, hey, I want to do something about this.

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,420
And I said, you know, in the past you've had a hard time just adhering to carbohydrate restriction.

208
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
I think we need to try something a little bit more extreme.

209
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,420
And so what I proposed, as you said, was this idea of doing a modified fast.

210
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,420
And this is sort of loosely based on Valter Longo's five-day FMD.

211
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,420
But we kind of took it a little more extreme.

212
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,420
So a slightly higher ratchet up on the caloric restriction during five days.

213
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,420
And also doing it every single month as opposed to quarterly.

214
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,420
And also, in Longo's version of the fast, it's focusing on the restriction of protein.

215
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
So it's actually relatively high carbohydrate.

216
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,420
We wanted to restrict carbohydrates both inside and outside of the FMD.

217
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Well, you expressed enormous reservation.

218
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Just at a practical level like I, Peter, I don't think I can do this.

219
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,420
So what I think I wanted to point out was that it was amazing that you took that plunge the first time.

220
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Because I remember that first one you did last, I think, October.

221
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Right.

222
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,420
And you worked very closely with Nicole, who's our dietitian inside the practice.

223
00:13:50,420 --> 00:14:00,420
And she, you know, was just incredible at sort of guiding you through the logistics of what does it actually mean to eat 700 calories a day of basically no carbohydrates.

224
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,420
And then once you emerge from that, what are you going to?

225
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Do you remember what it felt like after that first time?

226
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Yeah.

227
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,420
And look, I was highly motivated because of morbidities I had my age.

228
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
And I'm a time bomb.

229
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Something more is going to happen.

230
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,420
I sure don't want to go more orthopedic degenerative, arthritic changes.

231
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm like, oh, bladder's gone.

232
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,420
But that fatty liver and how many liver cells do I have left?

233
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,420
My big worry for what I do is cognitive impairment as time goes on.

234
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,420
And I was certainly headed towards ugliness in that direction also.

235
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,420
And as you start approaching it, I want to hang around.

236
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
I got a son.

237
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I got a great life.

238
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I want to be here for a while.

239
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,420
I was super motivated, which 20 years ago, if we even knew this stuff, I don't know how motivated I would have been.

240
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
So the end was near.

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:56,420
And just being so motivated, even though when I looked at Peter's recommendation and Nicole's, wow, I don't think I can do this.

242
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You want me to me, the caloric restriction for those five days was you're starving yourself.

243
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:10,420
And I just didn't think my body would allow me to do that as a guy who's used to nibbling all day long, every day of the week and everything.

244
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,420
But the motivation made me, I'll try it.

245
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
You know, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

246
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
But he had convinced me in that talk.

247
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,420
There was a good chance to shut down a lot of these metabolic pathways that were contributing to my morbidities.

248
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:35,420
So with Nicole's great help and understanding how to put together meals, especially during that week and with an incredible wife who is willing to prepare my meals and everything.

249
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
I did it.

250
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:45,420
And you know, that first five day fast, you know, by day two or three, the hunger pings are there and oh, my God, can I do it?

251
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
But I got to do this.

252
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,420
And it's kind of funny, like after day three, the hunger disappeared and on subsequent fast.

253
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Sometimes I go five days.

254
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
I don't even feel hungry during it.

255
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Maybe some like last month I did it the third day, which I do it a Monday through Friday, the Wednesday.

256
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
Oh, God, I'm kind of hungry.

257
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
I feel kind of weak today.

258
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,420
But it lasted half of that day and then just passed.

259
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,420
So I'd really tolerate those five day fast.

260
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Well, and the results are so astronomical.

261
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
The weight just poured off.

262
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,420
We rapidly repeated some of the biomarkers.

263
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:29,420
And for a guy like me, who's my life is looking at biomarkers and people and seems just so impressive that this has got to be doing good things to my body and symptom wise.

264
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I mean, just symptoms disappeared that I didn't realize, you know, I didn't realize I couldn't walk up a flight of steps without being a little bit dyspneic or things like that.

265
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
And that's just all gone.

266
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,420
So there were a lot of rewards that came quickly.

267
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,420
And the fasting wasn't as horrific as I thought it was going to be.

268
00:16:48,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Yeah, I think people who listen to me talk have got the sense that I've become more and more a proponent of fasting as an adjunct to dietary restriction, of course, dietary restriction, meaning the restriction of certain macronutrients.

269
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
So carbohydrate restriction would be a form of dietary restriction.

270
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Protein restriction would be, you know, meat restriction for those who choose to be vegetarian or vegan.

271
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
That would be a form of dietary restriction.

272
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,420
And all of these things can offer benefits potentially.

273
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:24,420
But caloric restriction, the actual restriction of the total number of calories for limited periods of time, I think has to be a cornerstone of what we do.

274
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Because it is simply the most powerful way to deplete glycogen.

275
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,420
It is simply the most powerful way to reduce insulin.

276
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,420
It is the most powerful way to turn those nutrient sensing organelles and molecules off.

277
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:50,420
And we know that we don't want those things off indefinitely, but we know that our current living environment, where they're basically always on, you have these, you are constitutively fed.

278
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
It's evolutionarily unnatural.

279
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,420
And in the metabolically ill person, it might be the single most destructive thing you can do.

280
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,420
And I've said this before, and I'll say it again, Tom, my intentions, I wish I could say it was just altruistic.

281
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,420
It was incredibly selfish, my motivation for this.

282
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:21,420
I remember sitting down and saying this to you in October, September last year, I was like, look, Tom, the impact your teachings have had on me personally, and therefore by extension on all of my patients, it can't be measured.

283
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,420
And so I started jokingly, and I've been calling you this for a couple of years.

284
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
I've been referring to you as the national treasure.

285
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,420
And I remember saying this to your brother when we had dinner with him a few years ago, and he kind of rolled his eyes at me.

286
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
I'm sorry to your son, to Brad.

287
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,420
And so I just said, look, this is a selfish motivation that I have to keep Tom around as long as possible.

288
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,420
So as long as I can be transparent about that.

289
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Oh, you're very kind.

290
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,420
And the other good thing about your talk, look, I'm basically a scientist.

291
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,420
I don't try and ad lib and make things up like so many people do to support whatever they believe.

292
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,420
There was just so much plausibility and the science behind a lot, what you said seemed very real to me and did a little reading.

293
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,420
And so that sort of boosted me to Peter's just not making this stuff up.

294
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,420
It's beyond the theory stage, I think.

295
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:19,420
And if we look at our evolutionary genetic ancestry and what our human ancestors, the way they ate years ago, it just makes a lot of sense.

296
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Here I am, and I'm not giving it up anytime soon.

297
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Well, and I'm holding out hope that my dad is listening to this or will listen to this.

298
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,420
I don't think he's ever listened to one of my podcasts, but I might insist that he at least listen to this portion of this podcast,

299
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:41,420
because if I could get my dad to do this, that would be, again, probably for selfish reasons, that would be sort of the highlight of my life.

300
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:48,420
And you generously offered to speak with my dad because I don't, he certainly won't do what I would recommend.

301
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,420
I think it would have to be Nicole and you sort of cajoling him into trying this.

302
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,420
And Nicole has also offered to help in any way.

303
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,420
So, dad, if I can get you to listen to this, I hope you'd consider doing this.

304
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:09,420
So with that said, thinking a lot about, well, first of all, just watching the transformation you've just described unfold over the last seven, eight months,

305
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:22,420
it's blown my mind because I've worked with many patients over many years and I've almost never seen the level of fastidious dedication to adherence that I've seen from you.

306
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,420
And I've known you for many years before and you'd been sort of ambivalent towards this.

307
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:33,420
So it was sort of this question of once the switch flipped, there was no wavering.

308
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Now, I didn't make the connection at the time, but I think more recently I've realized that's just kind of the day spring way.

309
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,420
So before we get into lipids, I want you to tell me about the very first obsession you had.

310
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Well, I've had a few obsessions in my life.

311
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,420
There is more to me than just understanding biochemistry and cholesterol and other lipids or so.

312
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,420
And probably the first thing in my life was being born to two incredible parents,

313
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:09,420
one of whom was a professional firefighter in the city of Paterson, New Jersey, New Jersey's third largest town.

314
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:23,420
So when you're a son of a firefighter real early in life, you're visiting firehouses and being exposed to the incredible men who are firefighters and all their glorious machines that are sitting here in the fire.

315
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,420
These big red things with bells on them and sirens that when they start them up, make a lot of noise.

316
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Every once in a while, your mom brings you to some major conflagration where you see your dad running in and out of buildings that are collapsing and on fire.

317
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:46,420
So I just developed an unbelievable passion and love of firefighting, which remains to this day.

318
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I'll put in a plug. I run one of the most viewed and largest historical firematic firefighting websites in the United States.

319
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,420
It's pattersonfirehistory.com if anybody would like to do it.

320
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:13,420
And you'll see, and there's just thousands of pages of thousands of photographs and incredibly documented data on the Paterson, New Jersey Fire Department, which has very unusual in the United States.

321
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:23,420
It goes back 200 years. Paterson was formed by Alexander Hamilton right after the Revolutionary War as a mega industrial town because of a giant waterfall that was in the town.

322
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
So they had a need for firefighting early on.

323
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,420
So you can really trace the entire history of firefighting in the United States by focusing on Paterson.

324
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,420
And it applies to New York and other towns that have been around for a long while.

325
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,420
So I've just had a great passion doing that. So, of course, I wanted to be a firefighting too.

326
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:52,420
So look, to collect the 30, 40 years of data that is now on my website, you got to be a little bit of a nut job with a passion for firefighting to do that.

327
00:22:52,420 --> 00:23:00,420
And I was able to collect that material through, of course, having a father who was well connected in a firefighting world and everything.

328
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
But I put my heart and soul into it.

329
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,420
When I was an adult after med school, I used to go to every antique market around firematic flea shows to collect.

330
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I collected one of the largest displays of firematic antiquities that were around in the United States outside of a museum.

331
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,420
I didn't even know that was a word, by the way. I just like the way that sounded.

332
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
Firematic antiquities.

333
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Yeah. And there are a bunch of nut jobs like me who are very much into this.

334
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
It's funny.

335
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
You were recently given an award.

336
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,420
I was because of my dedication and patting documenting all this.

337
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
They're so proud of it.

338
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,420
It's probably the most visited historical fire department website in the United States.

339
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,420
The department very much respects what I do.

340
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:57,420
At a certain point, they became very cooperative with sharing some of their archival material that my father hadn't stolen when he was a chief officer department years ago.

341
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
So the latter years have had their cooperation.

342
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,420
But they brought me up to a memorial ceremony they had in June recently because I was very much.

343
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:18,420
They have a monument up there where if you make the supreme sacrifice, if you're a firefighter who dies in a line of duty, you get your name on this beautiful bestowed monument outside their fire headquarters.

344
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,420
And they've had 28 firemen, unfortunately, have their name on that monument over the last couple hundred years.

345
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:32,420
And through my archival analysis in 1938, I found the name of a firefighter who died on the job.

346
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,420
He dropped dead as he was carrying a big hose running to a fire hydrant to hook it up.

347
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,420
And it sort of got ignored.

348
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Now, 1930, he obviously died of a heart attack at the scene.

349
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
He was 50 some years old.

350
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Dying of a heart attack while you were fighting a fire was not considered a fireman's death at that time.

351
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,420
If a wall collapsed on you, it would have been.

352
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
But nowadays, it certainly is.

353
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,420
If you have a heart attack at a fire, you would get your name on the monument.

354
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Your colleagues would mourn you heavily.

355
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,420
So I actually found the data buried deep in the files.

356
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
This guy dropped dead at a fire scene.

357
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,420
I went to the library, got the newspapers that documented that, and I presented it to the department.

358
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,420
So lo and behold, they added the 29th name to the monument.

359
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,420
A fireman, Edward Moore, died in 1938.

360
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,420
So a little belatedly, but his name is there.

361
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,420
So I wanted to go up and see that presentation.

362
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,420
And the chief said, Tom, would you get up and just tell this crowd a little bit about who Edward Moore was?

363
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Because none of them will certainly know him.

364
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,420
So I made a little three, four minute speech on who he was, what happened to him.

365
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
And I started to walk back to my seat.

366
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,420
And the chief said, no, Tom, don't leave the podium yet.

367
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,420
And he said, you know, make a long story short what you've done for the department.

368
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,420
We are, for the first time in the department history, making you an honorary battalion chief.

369
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,420
It's the highest honor a professional fire department can ever give to a civilian.

370
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,420
They will never give you a rank above a battalion chief, a deputy chief, assistant chief, or a top chief.

371
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,420
But me, a battalion chief, my dad was a chief for 30 years in the Patterson Fire Department,

372
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,420
starting as a battalion and a deputy and assistant.

373
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,420
I just can't display the emotions that went through me.

374
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Because my life, I always wanted to be a fireman.

375
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,420
Dad twisted my arm and said, no, you're going to college and you're going to study whatever you want to study,

376
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,420
but you're not joining the fire department out of high school, which I probably really wanted to do.

377
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:36,420
And as tears were in my eyes, there were 400 people in the audience at this big ceremony.

378
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,420
I just looked to the skies and hoped I was additionally making my father very proud of me.

379
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,420
And he was a very proud man of me because of my medical career, of course.

380
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,420
But so my love and passion of firefighting got me this.

381
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,420
And just to finish that story, because they told me you're the first person it's ever we've awarded a bad Italian chief to.

382
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
But they know I know their history.

383
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Back in the 1960s, a woman was made an honorary battalion chief in the Patterson Fire Department and happened to be a nun at one of the big hospitals in Patterson, a sister Loretta Agnes.

384
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Now, what do you know?

385
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:27,420
I think one of the major reasons I'm a doctor and had I trained actually at St. Joseph's Hospital in Patterson, New Jersey, because I really wanted to practice in that area.

386
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,420
She was a friend of the family and none and would visit our house all the time.

387
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,420
And she knew I was pursuing a medical career.

388
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
And she used to always harp me.

389
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,420
You've got to come and visit our hospital.

390
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:46,420
I'll give you the grand tour and you can hang out there in the emergency room if you want and just get to know our hospital.

391
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Mr. Smart ass here.

392
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,420
No, I'm going to go to some big university hospital here.

393
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,420
And so I want nothing about a hospital in Patterson, New Jersey.

394
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Even at seven hundred beds and it's a generic hospital with a teaching program.

395
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,420
But I took her up on it as an I was a freshman medical student at the time.

396
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,420
And I just she just let me hang out in the emergency room and I hooked up with a couple of docs who would work out.

397
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Go in the evening after finishing classes.

398
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
I'd go hang out in St. Joe's.

399
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,420
I don't know. It's a large part of who I am, what I do.

400
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
It fit in perfect. I'm a fireman.

401
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Emergency room is where all the action is happening or stuff.

402
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:31,420
So Sistla Loretta had a mega influence and I did go to train there and she was a godsend to patients.

403
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
So I interacted so much.

404
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,420
But Sistla Loretta was made in honor of her battalion.

405
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:44,420
She bought a department because of her care that she extended to every firefighter who has ever brought to St. Joseph's Hospital in Patterson, New Jersey.

406
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,420
The two honorary chiefs in her history are linked in other ways.

407
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,420
So it's just kind of spooky there how that turned out.

408
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
But just a great honor.

409
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,420
And on my desk at home, I have a blotter that is like a plastic top.

410
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,420
So I can stick things that are important to me underneath it.

411
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,420
I have my mother and father's, the little card that was at their funeral that through the homes put out.

412
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
I got some pictures of my son there.

413
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,420
And I've got a mass card that my wife and I gave to Sistla Loretta on her passing.

414
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
It's just such an impact.

415
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Last but not least, the fire department actually now does an annual Sistla Loretta Agnes dinner for the clergy in Patterson and stuff.

416
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
And I kind of laughed about two years ago.

417
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:34,420
They called me up and said, oh, you know, did you ever hear Sistla Loretta Agnes?

418
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Does it bear a shit in the woods?

419
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:43,420
So actually on our website now, I have a whole page dedicated to her and what she's done for the fire department and everything.

420
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
So it's kind of funny.

421
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Well, we could probably spend another hour talking about that.

422
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,420
And I know that our listeners would actually appreciate it.

423
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,420
But that said, there are a couple other things I want to get to, even before we get to the lipid stuff.

424
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,420
The other thing that we connected on pretty early was I realized you were a hockey fan.

425
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Of course, I grew up in Toronto.

426
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,420
And I don't think you can grow up in Canada without being a hockey fan, without playing hockey and being obsessed with it.

427
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,420
And certainly when I was a really young kid, probably till I was about 13, it was hard to think of anything but hockey.

428
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:22,420
And it turns out you kind of just as you had this sort of light switch moment with all these things we've talked about,

429
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,420
you had kind of that flip of the switch moment in hockey too, right?

430
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I sure did. And it was very easy to grow up in New Jersey in the 1950s and early 60s without knowing what ice hockey was,

431
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,420
or even ice skating per se, other than a month or two on a pond, maybe in January.

432
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:47,420
You know, when I was a young boy, a defining moment in my life was the first visit my dad picked me up in a car and brought me to Yankee Stadium.

433
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:56,420
And I walked into, probably in the early 50s, into that stadium in the Greengrass and these Yankees running around in their white uniforms and pinchers.

434
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:03,420
So I became a mega baseball fan growing up in a New York Yankee diehard, which I remained to this day.

435
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:11,420
And that was a transforming moment to be sure. It's the sport we played as a kid, wiffle ball all the time, me pretending I'm Mickey Mano.

436
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,420
And the pitcher would be Whitey Ford throwing to me and everything.

437
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:25,420
But in 1962, while in high school, my best friend was another young man who also had firefighting as a passion.

438
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,420
I always joke. I think I became his best friend because he knew my father was one of the fire chiefs in Patterson.

439
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,420
He wanted to hang around with a fire chief's son. But who cares? I love the guy.

440
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,420
And we grew, we became so close in high school and everything.

441
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:44,420
But for some reason, he was a hockey fan or something. He says, I want you to, you know, I go to Madison Square Garden occasionally.

442
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:54,420
I'd like you to come. Why not? You know, so I went over and I remember to this day, it's probably 1962, freshman, sophomore in high school.

443
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,420
You walk into the old and I'm talking the old garden up on 8th Avenue 49th Street.

444
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,420
It was a dark, dingy place. You're walking in. You almost need night vision goggles.

445
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:10,420
But all of a sudden you walk into a spot where the glow of that white ice strikes you.

446
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:20,420
And how come these guys in red, white and blue, the New York Rangers, who at that time were wearing no helmets and you really and the other team, they're only six teams there.

447
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,420
So the competition was unbelievable. So I just fell in love instantly.

448
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,420
One game I knew I just have to start following this sport.

449
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:38,420
And I told Peter within the year, not only did I say I have to watch this, I went out and bought myself a pair of skates, which wasn't easy to do back in those days.

450
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:44,420
And me and one other buddy at night in the winters, we started going to a local pond we knew about.

451
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,420
We're the only two people out there and we just taught ourselves how to ice skate, bought some hockey sticks, started playing.

452
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,420
One thing led to another, convinced a few other young friends to do it.

453
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:01,420
And within a year or two, we knew the one or two rinks that were in 50 miles of our house.

454
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
So we would drive down there and rent the ice for an hour.

455
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:14,420
So I became a pretty decent hockey player, considering I didn't grow up in Canada and everything, at least playing against New Jersey competition and over time, join men leagues.

456
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,420
And some of my best friends in life now are not doctors.

457
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:28,420
They're guys I played men's league ice hockey with beer hockey, as they call it nowadays or whatever, because after you're done with the rinks, you know where you wound up for a while.

458
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,420
And I played until I was 50 years old.

459
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:43,420
And the last part of my hockey story, of course, when I was so lucky, my wife and I, to have a child who turned out to be a boy, when he came home from the hospital, my wife and I drove him home,

460
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,420
brought him upstairs, put him in this wonderful bedroom we had put together with a crib in it.

461
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,420
And what was laying in his crib, a small hockey stick, that was about four feet long.

462
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,420
And I wanted him to imprint on it like the ducklings do to mother duck.

463
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:07,420
And as it turns out, my son turned out to be an incredible lifelong hockey player at every level, youth hockey, high school and college.

464
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
He was a team captain in college, wasn't he?

465
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
He's just had leadership abilities.

466
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
I credit that to my father.

467
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:20,420
And yeah, he was probably the captain of every team he was ever on, from might up through high school and into college.

468
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
And so very proud of him.

469
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,420
So a large part of my life was not only playing hockey as I grew up, watching hockey.

470
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,420
But when he started getting it every night of my life, I was out of practice watching him.

471
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,420
And so again, some of my best friends were other hockey parents and stuff.

472
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Again, I wasn't hanging out with all the ducks and going to the doctor's bowls and that kind of stuff.

473
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
They like never saw me.

474
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:57,420
And in practice for 37 years, I just thought God send of a fellow, I'm a brother, really my associate, who just covered my tail every time I wanted to run to, hey, I got to go to practice with Brad or I got to play hockey.

475
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,420
He just covered the practice and it was made my life easier.

476
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,420
So yeah, that's the other super passion.

477
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:19,420
When I say dedicated to hockey, even when I was in med school, when class was over, I was going to a rink or someplace or I'd show up in my greens because, hey, guys cover for me for a few hours.

478
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
We got a game tonight.

479
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,420
And that's how crazy I was in my medical school yearbook.

480
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,420
You'll see a picture of Tom Day spring and the class voted.

481
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
You know, we're going to predict what everybody's going to wind up.

482
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:39,420
And I was predicted, of course, to be the future New York Rangers team physician, which I never did achieve, but close enough.

483
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Well, it's not too late.

484
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,420
So we should add that to the list of things that we might try to figure out how to tee up.

485
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,420
You know, it's so funny because I grew up in Toronto, of course, the Maple Leafs were also one of the original six.

486
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,420
Now I grew up in the 70s and 80s.

487
00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:02,420
So by then the league had expanded and I very quickly fell in love with the Edmonton Oilers who would very soon go on to become the most dominant team of the 80s.

488
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:18,420
But even watching them come up before they became that most dominant team, they were just electrifying thanks to, of course, Wayne Gretzky, but also guys like Mark Messier, who would go on to become captain of the New York Rangers and finally bring glory back to the Rangers after one of the longest hiatus in sports.

489
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,420
It was 94 when they won the Stanley Cup again, right?

490
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
But it's the same experience.

491
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:32,420
I remember the first time my dad took me to Maple Leaf Gardens, which of course is not where they play anymore, but it was this old sort of historic kind of dingy arena.

492
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:41,420
And I remember one game because there was like gold seats were the best, then red, blue, green and gray.

493
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
And we could afford the grays.

494
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:50,420
But I remember for an exhibition game where the tickets were a bunch cheaper, the Oilers came to play the Leafs and we got gold seats.

495
00:36:50,420 --> 00:37:06,420
And I mean, I couldn't I couldn't believe what it was like to sit 10 feet, maybe a bit more, maybe 20 feet from the glass and actually see, you know, at the time, there was a goalie named Grant Fuhrer who was like I was a goalie.

496
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
I played goalie in hockey.

497
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
So Grant Fuhrer was actually the guy that I was trying to emulate.

498
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,420
And to see these guys, you know, Yari Curry, Glenn Anderson, Paul Coffey, Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky.

499
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,420
I mean, yeah, it's just it was a very special thing to do as a kid.

500
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
And I can certainly relate to that.

501
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:34,420
And the older I got, the more I realized that the experience I had was basically going to be shared by every kid growing up in Detroit, Chicago, New York.

502
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,420
I mean, the stuff that, you know, you would have seen Montreal, never mind.

503
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,420
I mean, you know, you might argue that it was even more fanatical in Montreal than any other place.

504
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
So let me just expand that.

505
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,420
Peter is right.

506
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,420
If you ever have the opportunity, I mean, any hockey game is great.

507
00:37:49,420 --> 00:38:01,420
But if you can get such a seat and way back when we were kids going over to the garden, you know, the lower best seats, a lot of them were corporate, you know, those who could afford those seats.

508
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
But they didn't always show up, those guys.

509
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:12,420
So almost always by the third period, we'd be sneaking down there and sitting there as young kids and they ushers wouldn't give you too much trouble if you were showing up in the third period there.

510
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,420
And it's just a different game back then.

511
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
And look, I love the military.

512
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Nothing can be like in a foxhole when you're fighting for your life.

513
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:29,420
But when you see what those guys with the way they look at each other and the way they hit and at top speeds, wow, it's a different sport.

514
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Yeah, it's funny you bring that up.

515
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
I totally forgot.

516
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:37,420
But as a kid, that was my M.O. is we'd get the gray seats, which I think were five dollars, maybe nine dollars.

517
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
But they were, you know, that was what we could afford.

518
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:47,420
And we would just take binoculars and lock eyes on seats where we thought people had left and then we'd weasel our way down.

519
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
And it's the same thing.

520
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
It was just a different era back then.

521
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,420
They weren't electronically scanning tickets.

522
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,420
So usually by the end of the game, you were sitting close, very, very close.

523
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Yes.

524
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,420
But God, just just special memories.

525
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,420
Well, let's get to what everyone really wants to hear.

526
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,420
I'm sure nobody wants to hear us bullshitting about hockey and stuff like that.

527
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
Like I said, I don't even know how we're going to organize this.

528
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,420
I mean, we've talked very briefly about kind of like a loose framework for what we want to talk about.

529
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,420
I don't want to put any restrictions on time.

530
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
I just want to go as long as we got to go.

531
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,420
I've set aside an entire day, which for me is almost impossible to do.

532
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,420
I think I'm seeing one patient all day today and then we'll divvy this up in the end.

533
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,420
So let's just start with kind of definition.

534
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
What's a lipid?

535
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
What's cholesterol?

536
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
What are these things?

537
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Let me tell you how I wound up in this world or so.

538
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,420
Look, I went to med school 68 to 72 residency in internal medicine for three years after that.

539
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:52,420
And I've already told you I've done an extensive amount of time working in emergency rooms, you know, where everybody comes in.

540
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:59,420
In those days, acute myocardial infarction was, you know, very, very common.

541
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,420
You didn't spend the night in the ER without seeing a couple of people coming in and pulmonary edema and everything.

542
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:15,420
And, you know, I just recognized early on that atherosclerotic heart disease and its clinical endpoints are bad news.

543
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,420
And a lot of those people were young and dying way too prematurely.

544
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:27,420
And in those days when you come in, even if we got you through your acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary edema, I mean, it's 50-50.

545
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Most of them were dead by morning or those that survived then had this morbidity they had to deal with.

546
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:42,420
So I grew up in an era when it was rampant, the acute episodes that I don't think they see anywhere near with the frequency that I did back then.

547
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
And I just latched on to it.

548
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
And I was lucky.

549
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Those were the days when the concept of a coronary care unit was invented.

550
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:56,420
Mason Sones invented coronary angiography at that time in our hospital developed a big one of the probably first departments in New Jersey.

551
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
That was doing coronary angiography.

552
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,420
And that's the world I decided to start hanging out in.

553
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,420
My electives in medical school were all spent in the coronary environment.

554
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,420
One year of our residency, the third year, was pretty much elective.

555
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Like, so all I did was hang in the angiography lab or the coronary care unit or the post coronary floors providing care.

556
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:26,420
My first opportunity to go into practice, a cardiology group, actually brought me in to, hey, you manage your hypertension.

557
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,420
You do stress testing, which I had done a lot of as a resident.

558
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,420
And of course, I'd be taking a call every fourth night in that group, too.

559
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:41,420
And, you know, it dawned on me, God, every night I'm being called back to the hospital at two, three in the morning.

560
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,420
It's another acute MI for God's sakes.

561
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,420
So I jumped really on to the prevention strategy.

562
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,420
It would be far better to prevent auto-taxing, getting up at three in the morning and praying you could help them survive this episode

563
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,420
that they at least made it to the hospital with.

564
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,420
So early on in life, I just said, what's involved with atherosclerosis?

565
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,420
And early in my career, hey, please don't smoke.

566
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Try not to be fat, which I was not the best example of.

567
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,420
And let's attack your blood pressure aggressively.

568
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:21,420
And I want to pause for a second here because you said something really interesting that I just hear so often from physicians of your generation,

569
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,420
including a physician I'm really close to here in New York who I share office space with.

570
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,420
And he's, you know, he's about your age, runs a very nice concierge practice in the city.

571
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:40,420
And he basically said the exact same thing you just said, which is we just saw MIs all day, every day, nonstop.

572
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,420
You know, a week couldn't go by where one of his patients didn't have an MI.

573
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
And then he contrasts it with today.

574
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
He's like, I don't know the last time I saw one.

575
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
I don't know the last time I saw a Q wave MI.

576
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,420
I just, you know, he doesn't recall.

577
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I get that all the time from young docs, residents or physicians who have been in practice,

578
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,420
but they're not in a baby boomer of my age or anything.

579
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,420
And they've all seen, obviously, acute coronary syndromes or things, but it's a different type of acute coronary syndrome.

580
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,420
They don't see these people coming in, in fulmin and pulmonary edema.

581
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:22,420
They just don't know what it's like, the massive transmural MIs with Q waves developing, dropping dead before your eyes,

582
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,420
because they're rushing them right to the cath lab now and dissolving their clots and everything.

583
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,420
They never saw how these people survived or didn't.

584
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:38,420
So I was talking to Peter last night, and it would not be unusual during my residency if you were the first year resident,

585
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,420
but you covered every admission in our 700 bed hospital.

586
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,420
And there were nights where I'd get a dozen admissions to the coronary care unit,

587
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,420
a dozen of some sort of exacerbation or a clinical event related to atherosclerotic heart disease,

588
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,420
most of them of our most horrific nature.

589
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,420
And I just don't believe that they see that nowadays.

590
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,420
Yes, they see acute coronary syndromes, but they don't see the type of acute coronary syndromes we saw back then.

591
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
So it has changed.

592
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,420
And look, we got a long way to go to still eliminate this heart disease.

593
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,420
We all jumped on prevention much earlier in life.

594
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,420
We'd end this disease.

595
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,420
But yeah, it was a different world back then.

596
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,420
It surely was.

597
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Is there one person that would sort of be your first mentor, the person that specifically got you,

598
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,420
not just interested in cardiovascular disease, but pointed you towards lipids?

599
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,420
Like something about these lipids matter.

600
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,420
No, I sort of discovered lipids by myself.

601
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,420
As I said, it was evolving.

602
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,420
I wanted to be a preventionist.

603
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,420
So I was on the hypertension bandwagon.

604
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:47,420
And it became pretty obvious after a lot of the big epidemiologic trials started coming in with more data framing him, Mr. Fit.

605
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:55,420
That lipid, specifically cholesterol, was the one they sort of focused on early on, was a real big player in here.

606
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:05,420
So I realized, and I'm a self-education guy in most of the things, that, all right, I'm as up to date as I can be on hypertension in the 1980s.

607
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,420
Now it's for me to start doing some lipid education.

608
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,420
So I started doing a lot of reading and stuff.

609
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:17,420
And first course I ever went to take lipids to a different level was out there at the Cleveland Clinic.

610
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:26,420
But the guy that I hooked on earliest that really became a major mentor, a good friend, was Dan Rader down in Philadelphia,

611
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:34,420
who turned out to become a world high-density lipoprotein expert, but just an expert in my mind, in all things lipid.

612
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,420
He was so far ahead of the curve.

613
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,420
So Dan was one of the real early ones.

614
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Others I had jumped on to were Tony Gatto and Virgil Brown and Alan Snyderman and Ron Krauss and people like that who are really doing the type of investigations that when you started doing lipid reading, you'd find what they were saying.

615
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,420
Yeah, all rows pointing to these guys.

616
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,420
I really did.

617
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,420
And they were gifted enough also that you could semi-understand what they were writing about and talking about.

618
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,420
I told Peter, you say, how long did it take you to math?

619
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,420
It was 10 years of serious reading, anything you could get your hands on.

620
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,420
I think the first five years was you read something, you didn't even know what you read.

621
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,420
But I was just motivated to keep going back sooner or later.

622
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,420
And one day I woke up and it sort of sort of all made sense or so.

623
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,420
It took a lot of education.

624
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,420
I think it's easier nowadays because there are phenomenal reviews if put together by a lot of people.

625
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,420
It just didn't exist in those days.

626
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:43,420
You kind of sort of discover it yourself if you didn't spend two years at the NIH doing research on it and you would be exposed to it that way or so.

627
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Well, you've also played a big role in that.

628
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:52,420
I mean, when I now get to think about how I got into this interest, you know, what sparked my interest was there wasn't a single moment.

629
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:58,420
But I do remember reading a single document that you had written in 2011.

630
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,420
And I think I was introduced to it by a member of that guy, Greeny, up in Reno.

631
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,420
Yeah, sure.

632
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:10,420
Yeah. So I think Greeny had sent me a document you wrote and it was the first time I'd even heard of NMR.

633
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,420
I mean, I knew what NMR was for from chemistry, but I didn't know what NMR was with respect to lipids.

634
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,420
And so he sends me this document.

635
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,420
It was like a PowerPoint, but with notes embedded.

636
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,420
So it was printed as a vertical.

637
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:30,420
You know, I printed it as a vertical and each so each page had a slide, which I would learn to go on were like famous day spring figures at the time.

638
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
I didn't realize that.

639
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,420
And then, you know, just great text and prose explaining it.

640
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,420
And it was 26 pages long or something like that.

641
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,420
And it was dense like you can't imagine.

642
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,420
Well, you can imagine because you made it.

643
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,420
But it was there was a density to it that I was like.

644
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:55,420
And I'm thinking, OK, I know I'm just kind of a dumb surgeon, so it's not like I ever knew this stuff, but it was just so it was just so captivating.

645
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,420
I was like it was like there was a whole other world that I didn't know existed.

646
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,420
And these particles mattered.

647
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:08,420
And I never I remember feeling like how did I not want to know this when I was going through medical school and training?

648
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:13,420
You know, I was just you know, I guess when you go down that surgical path, you're not thinking about this stuff.

649
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,420
You're thinking about the surgical ways to address these problems.

650
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,420
And I mean, I read it so many times because the first few times I was kind of frustrated.

651
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,420
I was like, I don't know what the hell is going on here.

652
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,420
Like I really have no clue what he's talking about.

653
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,420
And what are these apo this and apo that?

654
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,420
And I just kept getting confused by the concordance and the discordance between all these particles.

655
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,420
But that, you know, mid 2011 was kind of when I just I don't know.

656
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,420
I guess that was just the bug that bit me too.

657
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:52,420
But to your point, I think so many people today, whether it be physicians, patients, anybody who wants to understand this topic better,

658
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:02,420
really can look to you and your work as a great way to synthesize the work of these luminary folks that you've alluded to.

659
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,420
It's kind of funny because who could have ever imagined that when I started my lipid journey,

660
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,420
I just was a real world internist with a big practice in northern New Jersey.

661
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:21,420
My only real goal was to be a better internist to my patients, most of whom were getting atherosclerotic or cardiovascular events.

662
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:29,420
So rather than mastering ulcers and GI bleeds, I just went where the money was atherosclerotic heart disease.

663
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:38,420
And I invested all my time and effort on learning this with no grand design that hey, I'm a day of spring, whether you know it or not,

664
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,420
within 10 or 15 years, you're going to be the most requested lipid educator in the United States.

665
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,420
How did that ever happen?

666
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:54,420
And it just happened because I self taught myself as a dumb real world internist made it understandable to my brain.

667
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,420
Part of the day spring learning curve is visual.

668
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,420
You said you used to draw.

669
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:06,420
I draw graphics as I'm reading this stuff initially and I have no artistic skills, whatever.

670
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,420
If I draw a human being, it's that stick figure with a circle as a head.

671
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:16,420
But PowerPoint came along and there are tools there which are not that hard to master.

672
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:23,420
So I was able to draw and I'm now known as one of the best lipid lipoprotein illustrators in the country.

673
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:34,420
We're going to probably not probably, we will unquestionably link to maybe your 50 finest diagrams in this podcast, which is to say about one percent of what you've produced.

674
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,420
But I remember the first time you sent me one of your PowerPoints, I was like, oh, it's really interesting.

675
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:47,420
Like either Tom has contracted with an illustrator to do this or he's found somebody else that's already done these.

676
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:57,420
And when you said you had done them, I was blown away because you have to remember I cut my teeth in PowerPoint at a place like McKinsey where we're PowerPoint ninjas.

677
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,420
I could do anything in PowerPoint.

678
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,420
I couldn't do what you had done simply because I couldn't.

679
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,420
I didn't have the time.

680
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:14,420
Like those were such complicated figures that like if I ever came across something that was that complicated that I needed to make a slide for, I would just get the illustrator to do it.

681
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,420
I wouldn't actually be able to sit there and make it happen.

682
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,420
So I couldn't believe it.

683
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:28,420
And I think the listeners who aren't familiar with your illustrations are going to find themselves incredibly surprised and grateful for that sacrifice.

684
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,420
So illustrating things made me understand.

685
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,420
I mean, look, my illustrations got better and better as time went on early on.

686
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,420
They were a bunch of colored circles and stuff.

687
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,420
And then I learned shading and making them move and animate on the slide.

688
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,420
So I've really progressed there.

689
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,420
But I just learned by illustrating.

690
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:57,420
I've since had serious educators tell me the human brain just understands things better by seeing pictures and graphically than reading thousands of words put together.

691
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:11,420
And there is no doubt my gigantic success as a lipid educator where I could dumb down the talk and try and make you understand complex enzymology or anything else, the apoproteins and how to interact.

692
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:19,420
But as I'm saying it in my dumbed down version, you were looking at it moving on a screen with a graphic.

693
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:30,420
So it made comprehension of advanced lipid related areas much easier for either a layman or certainly a physician to understand or so.

694
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,420
So just the part of who I became.

695
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:41,420
And then somehow because of all my intense prepper writing slide notes, as Peter said, I became pretty good at putting together prose.

696
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:51,420
So I've done a little bit of research in my time because of places I wound up on and have the author research publication.

697
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:58,420
But most of the things you'll find in the literature of me are reviews and discussing this, trying to make you understand concepts.

698
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,420
Then you can go read the genius studies and you'll understand what they're talking about and everything.

699
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:13,420
So I just evolved into that. And actually, the first guy who was a cardiologist down in Florida, Michael McIver, he's the first guy ever so use PowerPoint for lipids.

700
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,420
And I just used him and he shared a lot of his early stuff on it.

701
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,420
And I learned off of him and it's made my life as a well-known lipid educator.

702
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,420
I've got opportunities to start doing lipid education.

703
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:38,420
And if you go out and you're lucky enough to have some people come and listen to you, you better be good at what you do or they're going to badmouth and you'll never be invited back.

704
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,420
Or if you do want to come back, they're going to like you, they're going to be in touch with you.

705
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:50,420
And I just developed ways of explaining lipids and illustrating lipids that became huge.

706
00:53:50,420 --> 00:54:03,420
And a lot of just to finish is Mike Davidson, who's one of the all-time gods in the lipid world in Chicago, still a university professor there, one of the big founders of the National Lipid Association,

707
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:11,420
did at one time during his presidency bestow their president's award to me, which is given to people who make contributions to lipidology.

708
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,420
But this is the top lipid organization in the country.

709
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:22,420
How does some real world internist with no formal lipid training ever work his way up to an award like that or so?

710
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:29,420
Mike told me, we polled the NLA and a lot of people joined this organization because they heard a Tom Dayspring lipid lecture.

711
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,420
And Mike was a big advocate of You Teach Through Illustration.

712
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,420
I've illustrated many things from Michael over the years.

713
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,420
And so he's right. And that's my claim to fame.

714
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:47,420
I hope some of you follow me at Dr. Lipid because Twitter is the way to get a lot of my graphics nowadays.

715
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,420
Yeah. And there's a lot of stuff that we'll make sure we link to.

716
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,420
But the Lipiholics Anonymous, you used to write a lot more into.

717
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,420
Yeah. I used to read those case reports constantly.

718
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,420
We'll have to make sure we can pull all those things out of the archive because there's some amazing cases there.

719
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,420
But yeah, we'll make sure people know where to find you on Twitter and all that stuff because quickly.

720
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:17,420
And when I was on this giant lecture tour for 10, 15 years of my life, I did generate a weekly newsletter called Lipiholics Anonymous,

721
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:23,420
where they were one case discussion, all real world, that were in my practice or sent to me by other docs.

722
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,420
And I would just take it into the next level.

723
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:32,420
So I would explain it basically. And then I would, like I'm talking to Lipidology Illustrated, it became immensely popular.

724
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,420
I had several thousand people. It was free.

725
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:42,420
I sent it out each week in a group email, but it really enhanced my, and it found itself on a lot of desktops, you know.

726
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,420
So that's a big part of who I was, you know.

727
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,420
And I do have most of them still there, but I am really people.

728
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:57,420
Give me all it because I don't want you to know what I was saying in the year 2002 because it's mostly all wrong nowadays because we've evolved so much.

729
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:04,420
But if you want to see what we were talking about in the Lipids in 2002, they might have some historical interest.

730
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:11,420
Yeah. Well, you just touched on kind of an important point, which is I like to say facts, all facts have a half life.

731
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,420
And some of them are really, really long half lives.

732
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,420
You know, the earth being round is, we would call that an incredibly long half life fact.

733
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,420
We're going to, you know, the half life is nearly infinite on that.

734
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,420
But elevated levels of HDL cholesterol are necessarily a good thing.

735
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:31,420
That's a fact that I think, you know, it used to be deemed a fact based on the epidemiology of Framingham.

736
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:39,420
I think today anyone who's serious about the study of lipidology would say that's grossly oversimplified, potentially incorrect.

737
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,420
That's certainly one of the old time facts that really disappeared.

738
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:54,420
I personally think it's a waste of time to even put it in the lipid profile other than it's used in certain calculations that are popular nowadays like non HDL cholesterol.

739
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:15,420
I encourage no one to ever make a judgment on any human's cardiovascular risk based on their high density lipoprotein cholesterol level or think you know what you're doing to a human being if you somehow change that HDL cholesterol metric in that patient has nothing to do with anything to be understood.

740
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:22,420
All right. So now I'm chopping up the bit. We got to get into this. So where do we even begin? Do we want to start with what's a lipid? What's cholesterol?

741
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,420
But let's explain what these things mean, HDLC and stuff.

742
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:36,420
Sure. Well, a lipid is basically a molecule that is not soluble in water. It might be soluble in certain organic solvents, but not in water.

743
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:45,420
So it's a hydrophobic compound. And oils and fats are what everybody thinks of as a lipid.

744
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:59,420
Some cholesterol is in there. I never liked calling cholesterol fat, but it's a lipid. Fats to me are fatty acids and combinations of fatty acids are so glycerides.

745
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:11,420
So that's what lipids are. And different lipids have different degrees of solubility. Some are extremely hydrophobic because both ends in a molecule that can't be seen in water.

746
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:22,420
Some lipids have a one end is a little bit water soluble, hydrophilic, and the other one is. And that would be where cholesterol fits in, phospholipids fit in.

747
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:37,420
So that's what a lipid is. And there are several types of lipids in your body, but the ones that those of us who live in a clinical lipidology world are focused on our cholesterol, basically two types of cholesterol.

748
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:54,420
And there are fatty acids, but fatty acids stick to a lot of things. And it's sticking is called the styrification in the world of lipids. So they can bind to carbohydrates, cholesterol, a three carbon sugar called glycerol is the most common thing they bind to.

749
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:10,420
So if you have one fatty acid on a glycerol, that's a monoacylglycerol. If you have two, that's a diacylglycerol. If you have three fatty acids stuck on your glycerol compound, that is called a triacylglycerol, which most people would call a triglyceride.

750
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:25,420
If you're as old as me, you're not used to hearing those terms, and you're used to hearing triglycerides, but initially they were just called glycerides. And glycerides would be the whole family of monoacyl and triacylglycerides or so.

751
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:49,420
And it's basically the way in which the human body transports fatty acids, or stores them and transports them in the plasma or stores them in various tissues. In case you need a fatty acid for a certain purpose, be it energy or a structural purpose, then the fatty acids would disconnect from its glycerol backbone, that would be called de-esterification.

752
00:59:49,420 --> 01:00:00,420
And that fatty acid could be used to whatever a cell wanted to do with that fatty acid, or so the cell didn't need it, could store it till when it did need it as a glyceride.

753
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:17,420
So those are your basic definitions, but the one glyceride that is of incredible importance, maybe in the future, the one we're going to be looking at most seriously, and the one that nobody ever looks at or even brings into the discussion now, they are phospholipids.

754
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:34,420
And phospholipids are simply glycerol compounds, so you got your three carbon alcohol sugar there, and there's two fatty acids attached to it, and there's a lot of fatty acids in the makeup of every phospholipid, might have the same two fatty acids, different fatty acids.

755
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:44,420
Fatty acids come in different lengths, different types of double bonds, and then they got a head group, which is usually got a phosphorous moiety in it, and that's what a phospholipid is.

756
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:56,420
Phospholipids are kind of cool because part of it is water soluble, part of it is hydrophobic, or doesn't like water, they're called amphiphiles, amphipathic is the name or so.

757
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:18,420
And that allows them to sit in certain positions in our body where, hey, their hydrophobic lipid tails, the fatty acids, can exist in a lipid-enriched environment inside the cell, inside a core of a lipoprotein, which is all hydrophobic lipids, but its hydrophilic surface can interact with plasma.

758
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:30,420
So where do phospholipids exist? On the surface of our lipid transportation vehicles, lipoproteins are on our cell membrane, every cell membrane in your body is phospholipids.

759
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:59,420
And what nobody seems to know is most of your phospholipids are made in the liver, or they're made in the small intestine, because the intestine absorbs fatty acids, repackages them into glycerides, phospholipids are triglycerides, and then they become part of lipoproteins that enter your lymphatics from the gut, the cholomicrons, or your liver gets fatty acids and as phosphors, it makes phospholipids,

760
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:11,420
and your liver makes lipoproteins and excretes them. So few people know that a gigantic, everybody talks of lipoproteins as if they're delivering cholesterol all over the place, that's what we have lipoproteins for.

761
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:22,420
That's probably the last reason we have lipoproteins, because every cell in your body makes every cholesterol molecule it needs to do what it has to do, with a few rare exceptions.

762
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:36,420
So if I'm a nose cell, I don't need some lipoprotein to come and deliver cholesterol to my cell, because I need cholesterol in my nasal cell membranes. That cell will make cholesterol.

763
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:44,420
Every cell has the genetic power in the protein, the enzymology, to make cholesterol till its heart's content.

764
01:02:44,420 --> 01:03:01,420
The tragedy is the co-op we eat, most of our cells make way too damn much cholesterol, which becomes then not an absolutely life-sustaining molecule needed in your cell membranes, but a cellular toxic molecule, because it crystallizes and kills that cell.

765
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:15,420
So evolution has given our cells incredible powers to evict, efflux out cholesterol, so they don't suffer cholesterol toxicity in no cells, and that will be certainly something we'll get into.

766
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,420
How do cells get rid of all this cholesterol because of what we're eating, they're making too much of our cell?

767
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:33,420
It's not that lipoproteins are delivering too much cholesterol to most of these cells, although they can in certain areas. Some people do get cholesterol builds up in their skin, xanthomas and things like that.

768
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:46,420
And I want to just interject for a moment to go back and clarify something for the listeners. So we talk a lot about fats, but many people are familiar with the term saturated fats, mono-unsaturated fats, poly-unsaturated fats.

769
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:56,420
You touched on it very briefly, but just so that they understand the broader context, a saturated fat means a fatty acid hydrocarbon that has no double bonds in it.

770
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:08,420
A mono-unsaturated fat has a single double bond in it, and a poly-unsaturated fat has two or more, and of course, depending on the position of the first double bond with respect to its carboxyl group, that's where we get into these omegas and things.

771
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:21,420
But the point here is when people talk about saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fat, they're referring to the positions of these double bonds within these long hydrocarbons that also can be of variable lengths.

772
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:28,420
So, for example, a saturated fat can be very short, six, seven, eight carbons in length, or it can be much longer.

773
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:37,420
And each one of them has its own name. And the same is true with the monos. So once you get into the monos and the polys, the nomenclature starts to get complicated because you are

774
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:43,420
describing both the position of the double bonds and the length of the hydrocarbon.

775
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:59,420
Now, these things have all of these complex properties, but in many ways it still pales in comparison to the complexity of the cholesterol system, because those fatty acids can also mean even though they're not soluble in water, and therefore they can't float around willy-nilly,

776
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:13,420
they have the luxury of being transported on albumin, right? Which is another protein in the plasma that can hide this hydrophobic part of them in an ability to transport them through.

777
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:24,420
But yet, why can't we transport cholesterol, which you've just explained is not soluble in water, it's hydrophobic, why can't we transport cholesterol or phospholipids in albumin, something that's so ubiquitous and benign?

778
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:40,420
Well, you can. Cholesterol can attach to albumin. And just before I answer your current question, what I was explaining before is, you know, the lipoproteins, everybody thinks their purpose is to deliver cholesterol to tissues. That's their last purpose. They don't do that.

779
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:55,420
They are the real purpose of our lipoprotein, our lipid transportation system, is to develop, transport energy to tissues that need them. That would be triglycerides, the fatty acids, which are cells oxidized to create ATP.

780
01:05:55,420 --> 01:06:03,420
So they are brought to tissues that are very good at extracting triglycerides from lipoproteins, muscle cells.

781
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:15,420
But if your muscles, because you're not using your muscles, don't need any energy today, those triglycerides will be dumped in an adipocyte to be stored as your fatty acid until you need them.

782
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:24,420
But what nobody talks about is what else are the lipoproteins delivering? That cells cannot be a cell without their phospholipids.

783
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:36,420
And what is the surface of every lipoprotein? Phospholipids. Where do the phospholipids come out of? Lipoproteins produced in the intestine or the liver.

784
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:47,420
So what are the biggest lipoproteins? Because they would have the most gigantic surface area. Chylomicrons coming out of your gut, very low density particles coming out of your liver.

785
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:56,420
So we all talk about how they're delivering cholesterol. They're delivering maybe triglycerides because they're very triglyceride with they're delivering phospholipids.

786
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:06,420
So just to clarify again, this spherical lipoprotein has an inside, which carries the cholesterol ester and the triglyceride.

787
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:14,420
But the phospholipid isn't carried inside that central cargo. It's actually embedded within the structure of the lipoprotein.

788
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:19,420
And therefore the chylomicron being the largest followed by the VLDL, the very low density lipoprotein.

789
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:26,420
The larger the surface area of these things, the greater their capacity to carry phospholipids since the phospholipid is carried in the wall.

790
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:37,420
Correct. And when these gigantic triglyceride rich particles go to your muscles or adipocytes to deliver their triglyceride in their core, very hydrophobic.

791
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:44,420
And that core is a special type of cholesterol that has a fatty acid to it. Cholesterol esters are incredibly hydrophobic also.

792
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:55,420
Those two tissues that I talked about have very powerful triglyceride dissolving enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which starts hydrolyzing the core triglycerides.

793
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:06,420
Now, these big dump trucks full of triglycerides like that, they start to shrink when the triglycerides undergo hydrolysis, deesterification.

794
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:12,420
The particle as it shrinks, that's called lipolysis, removal of a lipid from a lipoprotein.

795
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:20,420
So you can imagine these big fat balloons full of triglycerides. If you could suck water out of a balloon, it becomes a smaller balloon to it.

796
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:27,420
It would get wrinkles on it. Well, lipoproteins don't become wrinkles. They just evict their surface phospholipids,

797
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:35,420
which can immediately attach to a contiguous cell where the decrease in diameter of the lipoprotein is occurring,

798
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:46,420
or they jump on a protein that evolution has given us called phospholipid transfer protein, which then takes all those phospholipids and brings them to cells that say, hey, I need phospholipids.

799
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:56,420
Or the only lipoprotein that is not made in the liver-ertean testing but grows itself, matures itself in the plasma, high-density lipoproteins,

800
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:05,420
you couldn't change a baby APOA1, which is the structural protein of an HDL, into a big fat mature large HDL if you weren't supplying it with what?

801
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,420
Phospholipids.

802
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:15,420
Where would an HDL get phospholipids? As these big triglyceride-rich particles shrink and they extrude them, phospholipid transfer proteins,

803
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:22,420
says, here, little baby HDL, here's your phospholipids, and they can mature into it. So it's just an incredible system.

804
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:27,420
I love anthropomorphizing these things, little babies, HDL, and all these other things.

805
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:36,420
It helps. So that's all being said. I want everybody to realize, because nobody, because we don't measure them, because it's complex on how to measure them,

806
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:44,420
and there are so many different types of phospholipids based on the exact fatty acid makeup, the lenta to fatty acid.

807
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:50,420
Remember, a glycerol has three positions. They're called stereospecific number one, number two, and number three.

808
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:58,420
Everything depends. The lipases attack various fatty acids and different positions, and so it's really complicated.

809
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:06,420
So the phospholipids affect a lot of functioning. Since phospholipids are making up not only a surface of lipoproteins,

810
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,420
basically because they're water soluble and it allows these dump trucks to float around in plasma,

811
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:19,420
in the cell membrane, what Peter was just talking about, that fatty acid makeup in the phospholipids becomes so crucial,

812
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:27,420
because saturated fats are straight, they're rugged, they don't bend. So it gives some structure to a phospholipid.

813
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:34,420
If your phospholipids contain a lot of saturated fat, you've got a strong cell membrane there that's hard to get through.

814
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:42,420
But the real reason cells function and interact with the rest of the cells of your body is they signal each other.

815
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:54,420
And signaling occurs because something occurs at a certain area of the lipid cell membrane that we're going to call a lipid raft,

816
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:02,420
which is a specialized collection of special phospholipids with a little bit of free cholesterol interspersed.

817
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:10,420
But the structural positioning that a phospholipid takes up, if you have several double bonds in that thing,

818
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:18,420
if you've ever seen a 3D view of a phospholipid that's got several double bonds and it takes up an incredible amount of space,

819
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:24,420
so it's two legs spread out and you change the structure of the cell membrane,

820
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:31,420
and that structure of that area called the lipid raft allows certain cellular proteins to locate there.

821
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,420
And those are all our receptors that pull things into cells or extrude things out of cells.

822
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:42,420
So the fluidity of the membrane is highly, highly dependent on the nature of the fatty acids in the phospholipid?

823
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,420
The fluidity and the ability to shelter or let certain proteins be expressed in that area.

824
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:57,420
If I'm an LDL receptor or some immunoreceptor, there are certain areas of cell membrane I could never locate to because the phospholipids wouldn't allow it.

825
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:02,420
But there are other areas they say, welcome, here's where you're supposed to be expressed.

826
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:10,420
And cells know that and they construct their lipid membranes, hopefully, if you have the right type of phospholipids and everything.

827
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:19,420
So as we start to talk, and those who study and investigate membrane physiology, it's one of the more advanced areas in lipidology,

828
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:27,420
as we also are starting to understand some of the qualities beyond just measurements of various lipoproteins,

829
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,420
their phospholipid makeup is going to be crucial.

830
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,420
And as we talk about HDLs, we're going to start throwing around the word HDL functionality.

831
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:42,420
And a giant part of HDL functionality, what a specific HDL particle does in your body,

832
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:50,420
what it might be capable of accomplishing or not accomplishing is due to the fatty acid makeup of its phospholipids.

833
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:56,420
And one day I think we're going to be analyzing the lipidome of various lipoproteins,

834
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,420
and we're going to have a lot more insight of what lipoproteins do or don't do.
