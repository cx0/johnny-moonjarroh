00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,760
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Kevin Sayer. Kevin is the

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,400
executive chairman of the board of directors and the president and CEO of Dexcom. During his

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,240
tenure with Dexcom, he's been instrumental in leading the development of new technology,

48
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,880
including the G5, G4, and of course now the G6. If you've followed me for some time, you probably

49
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,800
know how much I love my Dexcom glucose monitor. I consider it to be one of the two most important

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,840
devices that I wear and I wear it pretty much all the time. I would say 300 to 330 days a year I

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,640
am wearing my CGM. It's offered me great insight, not just into the obvious things like how does

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,400
eating food X impact my glucose, although I still continue to learn a lot through that lens, but also

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,560
the impact of exercise, sleep, and stress on mitigating those things or amplifying those things.

54
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,600
So for example, one of the things I've noticed much more recently is the role that cortisol in

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,560
the evening plays on my glucose. In this interview with Kevin, we talk about a bunch of things. We

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,040
talk about how we met and his path to becoming the CEO of Dexcom. We talk about how the CGM

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,040
technology works and what makes the G6 what I conceive to be is the best model yet. We talk

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,200
about the challenges of working in the US healthcare system after getting CGM insured.

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,240
We talk about developing an even smaller, more user-friendly, less costly product while maintaining

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,640
performance and accuracy. Kevin does a really good job of explaining his framework on what

61
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,920
are the constitutive elements that would drive a CGM device. You'll see where this performance

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,600
and accuracy become important. We talk about what's the next thing on horizon for patients

63
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,800
with type 1 diabetes, the accuracy of the G6, software improvements for people with type 2

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,000
diabetes, and the remarkable benefits of real-time feedback that drive behavioral change for anybody

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,520
using this. Talk a little bit about Dexcom versus the competitors. There's basically

66
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,120
three large companies that do this, Dexcom being one, Abbott being the other through the acquisition

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,880
of Libre and Medtronic. We talk about less invasive options that people have asked about a lot.

68
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,080
Talk about the cost, why you need a prescription, when there might be an OTC, that's over-the-counter

69
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,600
option. We talk about smartwatch integration, Bluetooth, exciting collaborations and partnerships,

70
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,160
and future places for CGM such as in the hospital. We talk about lessons learned through failures and

71
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,480
successes. Before we get to this, I want to read a disclaimer that Kevin's team has asked me to read

72
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,480
and that's of course because he's the CEO of a public-traded company. This presentation includes

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,560
forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this presentation are made

74
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,520
as of September 21st, 2018, that was the date of the interview, based on information currently

75
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,560
available to Dexcom and are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the actual results

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,280
could differ. Dexcom undertakes no obligation to update such statements. With that said,

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,640
and without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Kevin Sayer.

78
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Kevin, how are you? I'm great. Thanks so much for making time. I don't often come into somebody's

79
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,240
office, take them away from their work and ask them to sit down and talk. You know, our discussions

80
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,480
have been so interesting over time. I was thrilled when you asked me to do this. I can't imagine

81
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,760
what journey will go on as we talk for the next while, but I'm really looking forward to it. So,

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,760
speaking of which, I think I've told the story a couple of times to some friends how we met,

83
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,640
but it's sort of funny to me because anyone who knows me knows I'm when I'm on an airplane,

84
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm there to mostly just work and I don't really talk to people. Occasionally, if somebody talks

85
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,240
to me, I'll certainly be polite, but I'm really focused. And so of course, it was about three

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,080
years ago, you and I met on an airplane. The funny part to me is how it happened, which is

87
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm taking a little break from work to look at one of my 12 favorite watch sites and you look

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,120
over. Do you remember what you said? Oh, I do. I took my headphones off. I said, are you sure you

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,160
want one of those? You know, and I'm the same as you, Peter. I get on a plane and my wife claims

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,680
I am the most unfriendly individual in the world because I sit down. I wait for that moment when

91
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,040
I can open up my computer. I'm hooked to wifi. I start working and I'm thrilled. Or I just take

92
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,680
a break from life and watch something on the screen. So we hadn't said a word and all of a sudden,

93
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,720
you open up to watches and I go, I've got to talk with this guy. We've got to look at these things

94
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,760
and make sure he picks the right one. It was a very fun meeting and then neither of us worked

95
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,840
the rest of the flight. Yeah. But the best part is we talked about watches for an hour.

96
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,040
And then we're about an hour outside of New York. And at some point we literally hadn't talked about

97
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,960
anything but watches, but I just sort of said, Oh, are you heading home or heading to work? And you

98
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,960
said, Oh, you're going to work. And then it was like, what do you do? And then this is the part I

99
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,160
don't think I told you. I had only heard about Dexcom two months earlier from a guy named Jake

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,080
Kushner. I don't know if you know Jake, but he's a pediatric endocrinologist. Yeah. And so I was

101
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,240
having dinner in Houston with Jake a couple of months earlier and he was showing me his data

102
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,920
on his kids with type one diabetes that are walking around with hemoglobin A1c's of 5.6.

103
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,960
And he's saying to me, it's a game changer. We're done with telling kids with T1D that 7.5 is normal.

104
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,880
The new normal is 5.6 and we're having no hypo events. And he goes, but we can't do it without

105
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,240
this thing called CGM. And I was like, tell me more. And he said, so we use this thing. I think

106
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,720
it was the G5 that they were using at the time. And I remember sort of thinking about it and going,

107
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,680
that sounds so interesting. That's on my list of things I need to learn more about. And then

108
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,800
I ask you what you do and this is what you guys, they couldn't have made it up. No. And this is

109
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,480
all we do here at Dexcom. And we do see remarkable results in type one diabetes with these kids and

110
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,680
with everybody who uses the technology. Well, I've been wearing one now for almost three years.

111
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,760
I think after that flight, you said, well, you got to come in one day and we'll shoot the breeze. And

112
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,480
within like a week I was wearing one and I've never stopped. Well, and I also use you as a critique.

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,800
Because if we give Peter technology, you're a very, very good critic and very objective versus

114
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,320
our diabetes patients who, while they love the technology, it's life saving for them. For you,

115
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,360
you kind of look at it from a different perspective. And I use observations like that all the time when

116
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,720
I talk to engineers. And as we design future products, I love different perspectives on things.

117
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,600
And one of the things in our culture that is very unique, we are very curious as an executive team

118
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,280
by nature and curious is the word that I would use. We love to learn, explore. We all wear these

119
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,080
things. We all wear the new ones. In fact, I'm supposed to get a prototype of a new one next

120
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,400
week that's going to communicate with some other devices. It's really fun. And it does allow for

121
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,240
learning. It keeps your mind going very quickly. We put Peter on our G6 technology right as it was

122
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,560
approved. Yeah. And well, actually, I mean, I was on that G5X a year ago, which was almost a G6 minus

123
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,440
the calibration issue. That's right. So now let's go back a little bit. What were you doing before

124
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,800
Dexcom? So if you go back in the history of my career, I started in diabetes in 1994. I met

125
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,040
an individual named Al Mann, who's one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs ever. And he had designed

126
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,040
the insulin pump that is now Medtronic Diabetes. And we had a glucose sensor there. That's where

127
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,560
I saw the first one. And I worked in diabetes there as the finance person and very much a

128
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,600
business person till we sold the company to Medtronic. I stayed on with Medtronic for a while.

129
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,640
And we launched the first continuous glucose monitor at Minimend and Medtronic back in those

130
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,960
days. And then I decided I didn't love big company. So I left and I found a couple of other jobs that

131
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,080
were interesting, but I didn't love them. And my job right before this company was culturally

132
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,200
fascinating. It was a Singapore headquartered Singapore public company. And I was head of the

133
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,440
US operation and the chief financial officer of the entire company, but we had operations in China,

134
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,840
Japan, and all over Europe. At the same time, I joined the Dexcom board. My dear friend and

135
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,560
associate from Minimed, Terry Gregg was the CEO here. And as we wrapped our other company down,

136
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,680
as it became obvious, we weren't going to be a US presence, the opportunity came to move to

137
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,800
San Diego and go to work at Dexcom. So I went home after our board meeting in December of 2010

138
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,080
and told my wife, I think we're leaving our dream house here in North LA. We're going to go,

139
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,640
I have another adventure. And we moved down here in June of 2011. And it's been just a tremendous

140
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,760
ride ever since. Now between the time you spent at Medtronic, where you were a finance guy,

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,400
but obviously as the listeners going to learn soon, you have pretty good technical chops on

142
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,600
this stuff. But you were working on CGM then and you probably just by osmosis absorbed a lot of it.

143
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,520
But between the, what sounds like the mid to late nineties and then your return here via Dexcom,

144
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:07,160
were you still in a CGM space? No, my position right after Medtronic was with a specialty laboratory

145
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,960
that ran esoteric lab tests and did that for a little while. And my company right before here,

146
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,200
the Singapore based company was a drug eluding stent business. And we had a proprietary drug

147
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,840
formulation and a proprietary polymer that was bi-absorbable. So when the drug eluding stent

148
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,360
was expanded into the vessel, both the drug and the polymer would absorb for better safety rates.

149
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,200
But getting a stent approved in the United States was too big of a deal for a company as small as ours.

150
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, especially when Abbott, Medtronic, J&J and Boston Scientific, the four of them own the entire

151
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,800
market. The law of four. Medical device companies, you see technologies, you start with a couple,

152
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,640
they swell up to 10 or 11 and then you go back down to three or four.

153
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,080
I didn't even know this about you. So once we're done with this podcast, when we go grab coffee,

154
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,160
we'll talk about my previous life where I had to know everything about drug eluding stents.

155
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,080
Oh. I spent two months interviewing 150

156
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,640
interventional cardiologists around the country when I was at McKinsey trying to learn everything

157
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,960
about this for our client, which was obviously I can't say who, but it was one of those four.

158
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,280
And it was at the reintroduction because remember there was a period of time when they had to go

159
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,720
back to bare metal. Oh yeah.

160
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,640
And then they had to reintroduce. So fascinating topic. So basically you came back to this company

161
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,520
and what I assume you were bringing that was of most value was you understood medical devices,

162
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,120
you understand durable medical goods, you understood the law of healthcare. It wasn't

163
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,760
that you were the world's expert on CGM. No, I'd been on the board and I really

164
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,000
will never be the world's CGM technical expert. These guys here are spectacular. But what I did

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,640
bring, or at least I believe is very much that curious factor I talked about and a very open

166
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,560
and aggressive mind to grow our business. This company has gone through tremendous change.

167
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,320
I came in for a couple of reasons. Terry is exactly 10 years older than me and I was supposed

168
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,600
to succeed him at Medtronic and that one didn't work out the way we wanted to. And when I joined

169
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,520
the board, that was something we talked about early on. And I knew all these guys. I knew the

170
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,840
technology very well. I knew how bright they were and I just thought it would be a tremendous

171
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,680
opportunity. Let's take another step back just for folks to give them a basic because there's so many

172
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,840
questions I get asked about this. In fact, I went out to Twitter a week ago and said,

173
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,440
I was going to be sitting down with you and hey folks, if you have questions shoot them over. And

174
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,760
I was really amazed at how many people ask questions. And there are a lot of questions

175
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,600
that I could answer truthfully, but there are some that I can't. So I'm going to try to assimilate

176
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,320
the question. So I think the first question that I get asked a lot is how does this actually work?

177
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,560
In other words, why is it that even if you don't look at CGM, if you just talk about point of care

178
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,440
glucose, why is it that with one prick of blood, you can measure something like glucose,

179
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,080
but you can't measure a number of other things? What is it about measuring glucose that enables

180
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,320
that? Well, our technology is designed to measure glucose only. And the way our sensor works is

181
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,040
there's a small wire that's thinner literally than a human hair or as thin as a human hair

182
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,080
that's inserted subcutaneously into your tissue. That wire is very special metal alloys and it's

183
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:27,000
coated with a number of membranes. That wire and those membranes then generate an electrochemical

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,360
signal that goes up into a transmitter that sits on top of the sensor. You've worn it,

185
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,920
you know what it looks like. And inside that transmitters an algorithm that converts that

186
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,840
electrochemical signal to a glucose value. So that is the only thing that we have done

187
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,960
with this technology. There probably are other analytes we could take and develop enzymatic

188
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,120
layers that would sense that type of chemistry. In fact, you and I have talked about some of the

189
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,000
things that might be meaningful and useful over time, but we've grown so quickly, we just, we

190
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,640
haven't addressed those. But I think the key is it's an enzymatic reaction. And I think that's

191
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,280
the point I try to make to folks is if there's an antibody that can be linked to it, if there's an

192
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,520
enzymatic reaction that can be done without multiple washes, that's the kind of stuff you

193
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,680
can measure in point of care. Whereas many things that are complex, you can't, you know,

194
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,520
you can't measure, you know, the number of lipoproteins or something like that, because that

195
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,600
requires NMR. It's a very separate test. You can't even measure insulin. You're either going to do

196
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,040
it through a radio immune assay or you're going to do it through multiple washes, something called

197
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,480
an ELISA based assay where you have to rinse and repeat and stuff like that. So out of the gate,

198
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,560
there are some things that can be measured in a drop of blood, which again is different from what

199
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,200
you guys are doing. And, you know, glucose is one of them, electrolytes, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate,

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,120
which you and I have talked about a lot. So, I mean, I guess let's go back and so how deep is that

201
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,960
that little filament that sits inside the patient? It goes in at an angle now it sits in probably a

202
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,960
half inch under the skin. The insertion technology of the sensor goes in with a needle and needle

203
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,920
comes out. There is so many engineering hours into the insertion of that sensor. And one of the first

204
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,520
things you notice about the Gen 6 product, it's an automated insertion. The needle is in your skin

205
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,280
as the engineers tell me, less time than it takes a hummingbird to flap its wings a couple of times.

206
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,720
So it's in and out very quickly. So a patient doesn't feel it. And then the sensor rest in the

207
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,640
subcutaneous tissue and you really don't feel that sensor at all. I think I've commented to you

208
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,000
probably the very first time I tried this, which was on the prototype that with the G5, of course,

209
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,560
you are the one is the patient who is responsible for the velocity with which that needle goes in.

210
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,960
And if you're a human being, which we all are, I think we're just hardwired to do it a little

211
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,360
slower than we'd like because it's so, you know, it's a little uncomfortable. Look, it wasn't the

212
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,360
most uncomfortable thing in the world, but it's, if you're doing it, it's scary. Yeah. Yeah. It is

213
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,200
not an appealing thing. You look at that, our old device, which was very functional, but you look at

214
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,200
it and it truly looks like, I don't know if I want it. And we've had patients send emails saying,

215
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,920
I've stared at this thing for six weeks and I don't dare put it in my body. We're not having

216
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,000
that reaction with the new one. Yeah. And I had that reaction with a number of my patients,

217
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,400
because as you know, a lot of the patients in my practice, though, they don't have type one or type

218
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,080
two diabetes, like me, they understand the value of even people with, you know, quote unquote,

219
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,800
normal glucose levels being able to track this. But occasionally folks would freak out and they'd

220
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,000
say, you know, we'd go through the, all the process of getting them a three month supply and they,

221
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,720
you know, they've already paid for it. Cause of course their insurance isn't going to cover it.

222
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,600
They don't have diabetes, but then that needle just sort of scares them away. Of course,

223
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,280
the other thing that we speculate, or maybe it's not a speculation, maybe it's just a given is

224
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,080
the lack of trauma that's involved with the G6 insertion seems to make for a much more

225
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,960
accurate device, which the G5 itself was remarkably accurate, but I don't know if it's

226
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,720
anecdotal, but in my hands, at least the way I track it, the G6 seems to be so accurate. It's

227
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,640
almost hard to believe. There's so many elements that go into the performance of a sensor. I

228
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,000
believe the insertion process does make it more accurate, but that G6 sensor has new membrane

229
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,480
technology versus the old one. There's also a new algorithm. In fact, one of the things that has

230
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,560
made our company successful during this G6 project in the middle of it, our algorithm engineers came

231
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,840
and they said, we have a better way to do this, but it's going to delay the project if we do it.

232
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,520
We looked around the room and said, but if it's going to be that much better, let's delay it and

233
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,560
put it in. And so we did, and we made that decision. That algorithm has helped tremendously

234
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,720
with the accuracy. So all those things together, the easier insertion, the new membrane technology,

235
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,320
the new algorithm, I think even the fact that it's flatter on the body and doesn't pull as

236
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:01,880
much is helpful as well. I think on three occasions over two plus years, my kids kicked

237
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,840
out my G5, including once on the very first day I put it in, which really bummed me out when I

238
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,400
picked up my son and he obviously just not playing around and he horse and he kicked me and the thing

239
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,720
came out. Whereas the G6, yeah, it's a lower form factor. And obviously this is only going to

240
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,680
continue as the evolution of these things goes. So you talked about a couple of other things that

241
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,240
could be measured besides glucose. Are there any that you think are commercially viable? There's

242
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,600
lots that could be interesting, but do you think there's anything else that's commercially viable?

243
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:42,360
We don't know yet, but we have so many markets to take our technology to now that we need to

244
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,720
capitalize on this opportunity and take care of the people that we serve and open the other markets

245
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,440
where glucose can just be a wonderful tool that we really haven't done that much of yet.

246
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,360
So approximately how many patients in the United States have type 1 diabetes or what percentage

247
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,600
population? How do you think about it? About a million and anything you read in the literature

248
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:10,440
says anywhere from 1.3 to 2 million in the United States, common numbers 1.5. And there are another

249
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,400
1.5 million people with type 2 diabetes who intensively use insulin. So they are really in

250
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,520
need of a continuous glucose sensor to manage their health. Now, going back to those folks with type

251
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,320
1 diabetes, what percentage of them use one of the commercially available continuous glucose monitors?

252
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,000
Most would estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 percent right now. And again, these percentages

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,400
have grown rapidly over the past couple of years as we've gotten better and as other products have

254
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,600
come to the market. So you and your competitors, and I guess your main competitor is Abbott?

255
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,640
Abbott and Metronic. The three of you collectively aren't even remotely close to

256
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,880
saturating the most obvious market for this product, which is type 1 diabetes. That's right.

257
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,320
Again, hard to speak speculatively about what others think, but I assume everybody's also

258
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,640
looking at that second group you just mentioned, which is another market, which is the insulin

259
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,800
using patients with type 2 diabetes. Yeah, in fact, when Medicare and CMS gave us approval in

260
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,960
January of 2017, they approved the use of CGM for intensive insulin using type 2 patients.

261
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:23,240
And that was a step that we really needed. One of the barriers, and it's not really a barrier,

262
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,720
but it's very interesting as you grow a business and one of the fascinating things about our journey

263
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,240
here, it makes such common sense. Everybody thinks, well, everybody should just have this.

264
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,800
And the insurance companies were very well insured and very well covered,

265
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,880
but it's not always easy to get. I was in a state not too long ago, for example,

266
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,440
where a patient had to document a certain number of events where their blood sugars went below 50

267
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,080
before they can get an X-Com, even if they have type 1 diabetes.

268
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,000
Which is very dangerous for a type 1 diabetic. Very dangerous for anybody.

269
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Yes. And yet, because of fear for spending money on devices and treatments that aren't useful,

270
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,400
payers are hesitant sometimes. Not all of them. We get very, very good coverage, but it is cyclical.

271
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,200
You know, a payer will cover us very well for a two-year period and they'll look and, man,

272
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,920
we've added so many people to this technology. What are we doing? Let's slow it down. So they'll

273
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:30,680
slow it down through criteria. We have a full-on sales team that does nothing but call on those

274
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,960
who reimburse for the product and we try and make it as easy as we can. There are trade-offs for

275
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,680
price and access and we try and negotiate those things on a regular basis. I believe over time,

276
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,200
at least 80% of the people with type 1, and I've said this in public forums, 80% of the type 1

277
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,280
intensive population should be using continuous glucose monitoring.

278
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,040
Has there been an economic analysis done, ideally, independently, but it might be done, obviously,

279
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,840
by one of the companies or more, that does the equivalent of what we would think of as an NNT

280
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,280
for a drug trial. So for the listener, an NNT is a number needed to treat. This is an analysis

281
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,680
that's not done economically. This is more of a life-saving. So how many patients do you need to

282
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,480
treat with a certain drug to save a life? But you can also start to do these things economically.

283
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,480
And is there a question of how many patients need to be on a CGM before you either save a life

284
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,360
through a hypoglycemic event or maybe a different analysis would be the cost of the CGM versus the

285
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,720
cost of the complications from mismanagement? So has any of that been done? We have done some

286
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,120
economic models and studies in that area. What we find is the major cost that CGM prevents is exactly

287
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,120
what you talked about in the acute setting. They prevent hospitalizations. So you end up with a

288
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,640
specific set of patients who are what are often called hypoglycemia unaware, who aren't aware when

289
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,160
their blood sugars go low. The CGM gives them alerts and alarms. And our system also alerts

290
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:05,400
and alarms others who give care to those patients to whereby they can be taken care of. That share

291
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,960
feature is really one of the most remarkable things we've done here. You could be in Singapore,

292
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,040
and your wife could be here. If you had type 1 diabetes and your blood sugars went low, your wife

293
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,160
would know. And she could call the hotel and wake you up. And we hear stories like that all the time.

294
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,280
Does Medtronic's product or does Abbott's product do that? I believe Medtronic's new product does.

295
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,160
I believe they do have some sharing capabilities, but I know we pioneered it. We're the ones who

296
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,400
got it through the FDA, and it took a lot of effort. So that sharing capability is really good

297
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,560
for hypoglycemia unaware. That category, one hospitalization, I've seen numbers ranging from

298
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:50,200
10 to 30,000 dollars for that one hospitalization, but not everybody's hospitalized. We certainly

299
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,880
save on the long-term complications of diabetes, and that has been measured historically. And you

300
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,720
know, I've talked about this with A1c, which neither of us believe is the perfect measure.

301
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,600
But in our studies, we see at least a half a point drop over the course of a 12-month period compared

302
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,920
to multiple finger sticks. A full point drop for the patients, if you just look at them

303
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,720
independently on continuous glucose monitoring use for a six-month period, that is sustained.

304
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,160
That drop in A1c leads to reduced costs in the healthcare system, and there are very,

305
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,920
you know, well-known economic models to build that out. But here's where the rubber meets the road.

306
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,080
A 25-year-old probably isn't generating all those complications yet, and a 25-year-old is with an

307
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,120
insurance plan for two years before they move to their next job, and they're on another insurance

308
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,280
plan for two years. So we have to do a better job as a company documenting these economic benefits.

309
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,840
We run more studies to see how, you know, how much quality of life's improved, to see what we can

310
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:58,520
prevent. We are currently building outcome-type-based models to whereby we can, look, we can go into an

311
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,080
insurance company or a parent, say, look, here's what we think we can save you if we can put

312
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,400
everybody on CGM. But we're creating a new industry here. It's a completely new business.

313
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,880
Every day is a challenge like that, and every day there's more thoughts and more things to address

314
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,680
along those lines. The Medicare one is the most interesting. I spoke at a conference on a January

315
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,560
Wednesday where I told a group of our investors we would not have Medicare approval for 18 months.

316
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,400
And we got it Thursday.

317
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,560
That makes you look not terribly well informed.

318
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:40,120
That is correct. And the way it was approved, our device talks to a phone or a dedicated

319
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,320
Dexcom receiver. The way it was approved for the Medicare patients is they couldn't use the phone

320
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:53,800
app. Yet our Medicare patients are the ones most likely, other than children, to need to share the

321
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,760
data with somebody else. It took us, I want to say 18 months, we finally got the phone use

322
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,400
approved for the Medicare patients. When you're creating an industry like that, there are all

323
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,200
sorts of hurdles that you run into that you don't contemplate. You just kind of have to react.

324
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,160
I mean, I think that's one of the challenges that folks face in this industry in general,

325
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:21,560
which is the policy piece of it is hard because you don't exactly know from a long-term planning

326
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,600
standpoint exactly what changes are going to come about. The challenge that you raised, I think is,

327
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm glad you brought it up because I think it's one of the most misunderstood issues in the US

328
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,160
healthcare system. I grew up in Canada and I'm actually not incredibly that impressed with the

329
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,360
Canadian healthcare system. I know that's going to make me a lot of enemies out there, but I don't

330
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,160
think it's like a panacea. I don't think necessarily Canada is doing it right either. But there's one

331
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,640
thing that I think a single payer system, at least one thing a single payer system brings over a

332
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,160
system that we have in the United States, which is the incentive is aligned between the payer,

333
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,000
the patient, the provider over a long-term. It's easier to align incentives because one way or the

334
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,200
other, that payer is going to pay. It's pay now or pay later. Yeah, that's right. Which by the way,

335
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,400
we were talking about children before we went on the mic and you had great piece of advice,

336
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
which I'm going to ask of you to share with others, but my brother's advice, which is

337
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,360
my brother has five kids. His piece of advice is pay now or pay later. Pay now or pay later.

338
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,040
You can either discipline your kid when they're five or you're going to discipline them when

339
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,520
they're older. But this thing with healthcare is if you have that 25 year old and the difference

340
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,680
between them having a hemoglobin A1C of 8% versus 6%, in the next year, it's nothing. It doesn't

341
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:44,120
matter. But in 20 years, it matters beyond words. That's right. And if you as the payer are on the

342
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,800
hook for that one way or the other, the economic model becomes so much more straightforward because

343
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,360
you don't have the portability of healthcare. That's right. Again, I'm not close enough to this

344
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,440
to know if a single payer system is even something that's viable in the US. It strikes me as

345
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,320
politically very unviable, but who knows? That said, it's not what you're dealing with now. So

346
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,280
you have a harder challenge to make the case economically, I suppose. No, we do. But again,

347
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:15,000
we're covered by 99, literally 99% of all reimbursement authorities where our coverage

348
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,440
is a little spotty still is in the Medicaid programs, we've got several states. But it's still,

349
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,960
there's a lot of documentation required. We're covered where it gets difficult as the documentation

350
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,160
the patients have to provide or the physicians have to provide and consistency of copays and

351
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,800
things of that nature. We're also classified as durable medical equipment. So our patients have

352
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,600
a copay and a deductible, which leads to a very seasonal business for us because in the fourth

353
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,880
quarter, most of our patients are maxed out on their deductible and copays and they want to buy

354
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,000
everything they possibly can. It's like Christmas. It's like Christmas. So from October to the end of

355
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,040
December here, it is all hands on deck. That's interesting. What percentage of your patients,

356
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm guessing it's very small, but do what me and my patients do, which is it's a cash pay business.

357
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,400
There's no dealing with insurance. It's directly from, you know, a physician writes the prescription

358
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,920
and the patient comes straight to Dexcom. Not very many. Again, like you do, we have cash pay

359
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,160
patients and everybody in your system uses prescription is important for the regulatory

360
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,240
folks that I point that out. Not as many as we used to. We used to have a lot of Medicare patients

361
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,080
who paid cash. I see. But once Medicare covered, we actually had to refuse the Medicare cash patients

362
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,760
because if we took cash Medicare, while Medicare covered a device, we were in trouble. And it took

363
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,840
them seven or eight months to figure out how we could ship and process this new product code. So

364
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,440
we had upset patients for somewhere between six and eight months before we could start serving

365
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,800
them properly. The people who don't live in the United States that are listening to this are

366
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,320
scratching their heads, thinking what is going on over there? It is a, we have a really complicated

367
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,560
healthcare system. Yeah, we do. But look, there are some things that I think it does well. And I

368
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,240
think, you know, one of the things that does well is it seems to set up an economic engine that

369
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,560
allows for an innovation that I think is hard to do outside of the United States. Oh, I'd agree

370
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,400
with that. And I don't think it's a small accident that the disproportionate share of the innovations

371
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,520
come out of the US. So, you know, kind of going back to some of the technical stuff,

372
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,560
you have a partnership, you have a collaboration with Verily. We do. So tell people what is Verily,

373
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,840
how does that have, what does that have to do with Google? And how did that collaboration come about?

374
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,600
And how does it work? Well, the way it came about was interesting. Back in 2015, there was a

375
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,160
healthcare group within the walls of Google before Alphabet came around. And they analyzed

376
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,360
technologies where they felt they could develop technology that would make an impact on future

377
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:48,360
products. And they also analyzed disease states where they felt they could use Google's or Google

378
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Healthcare's analytic capabilities to develop better care models. Google has made a couple of

379
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,040
attempts at healthcare. And they came down and met with us and said, Look, we've looked at your

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,840
product, we've looked at what you do, we have a lot of electronics expertise, we have expertise

381
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,560
in data analytics, and a bunch of other areas we would like to partner with you. Aislinn told us

382
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,240
they were going to talk to other glucose sensor companies as well. We looked at that and said,

383
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,440
You know what, this Google is a big company, and they do a lot of things. And we looked at their

384
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,960
concepts and their thoughts. And they looked at the problems different than we do. They looked more

385
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,480
at miniaturization and size and convenience, and the things that consumers look at. Because we as

386
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,400
a company, again, serving our, our population of people with type one diabetes are in a bay, we

387
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,200
tell you this, our core principle has been performance and accuracy, we will performance and

388
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,640
accuracy, we always want to build the best, we were the first to be connected. But as far as really

389
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,080
getting the thing tiny, or something that somebody without diabetes can wear, that had not been a

390
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,880
focus here. And you know, that they can wear for fitness. So when they came down and presented this

391
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,640
this to us, we decided that as an electronics and design partner that we would like to work with them.

392
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,000
So after several months of negotiations, we not several months, a couple of months, we

393
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,680
signed up a deal more co developing future products for Dexcom. Those products will be Dexcom

394
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,320
sensors, those membranes and those algorithms that we've developed to make our sensor accurate,

395
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,040
and perform very well will come from our core technology that we've always developed.

396
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,760
The electronic side and some of the communication and the Bluetooth and those other things

397
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,480
have been driven by the Verily engineers, that's where they have great areas of expertise.

398
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,800
The overall package and mechanical part of the system we've done together. We've talked about

399
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,240
this Peter, we focus on performance, patient convenience and usability and then taking cost

400
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,040
out of it. We kept all three of those in mind as we did that. Yeah, it seems to me and I like your

401
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,400
framework, right? So let me see if I remember what you said, it's going to be performance.

402
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,200
Performance first.

403
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,720
How accurate is this thing? End of the day, that's the single most important thing. If it doesn't

404
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,680
perform, who cares what else it does? Then the patient experience, how big is it? How easy is it

405
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,200
to use? How often do you have to change it? Do you have to separate the sensor from the transmit?

406
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,800
What does the software look like?

407
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
And then cost.

408
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
And then cost.

409
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:19,000
It seems to me, having been fiddling around with this thing for a while, that the step between

410
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,880
G5 and G6, you're now on the asymptotic part of the performance curve. There's not a lot of

411
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
performance gain at this point, is there?

412
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,960
There is some performance to gain. Boy, we spend a lot of time studying this and talking about this.

413
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,800
As far as just bringing the overall accuracy percentage down, there's not a whole lot to gain.

414
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,360
Where there is to gain on the performance side is bringing that curve of performance. You have a

415
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,760
bell curve of performance for every sensor, pushing that bell curve in to whereby every

416
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,960
experience is the same. Most of them are the same now, and we believe it's very consistent,

417
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,480
but that consistency and reliability enables us to do two things. Number one, it enables us to

418
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,280
do very sophisticated things with people who want to control their insulin dosage with our sensor

419
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,160
whether through an artificial pancreas system or on their own using our data.

420
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,320
But the other thing it enables to do, if that performs the same all the time, it will enable

421
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,800
us to go out to broader markets because people won't question or challenge the data. They will

422
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,280
see it and go, okay, this is right. This one works. And we call it internally eliminating

423
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,320
the outliers. And I know every company does this with what they build. And so performance-wise,

424
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,640
that's where we're headed there. And those are the things that we look at and in our meetings

425
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,640
all the time. I don't even know if I told you the story. It's kind of funny, about a year and a

426
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,640
half ago, a mutual friend, so it's a friend that I introduced to you, but I won't call him out. I'll

427
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,920
keep his identity private. He introduced me to Andy Conrad at Verily, but it was through some

428
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,000
completely unrelated, there was a different reason for us to meet. So I'm up there and I didn't,

429
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,840
at the time, I just, I either didn't know that you guys had worked with Verily or I just hadn't put

430
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,280
too many together. So I'm sitting in his office and I see these mock-ups of things that look like

431
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,480
next-gen CGM's. And I said, Andy, what are those? And he goes, oh yeah, we work with this company

432
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,040
called Dexcom. And of course I lifted up my shirt and showed him my, as at the time it was a G5.

433
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,440
And oh my God, I mean, it was, I felt like Dorothy, this was like Oz. I couldn't believe

434
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,000
what the future could hold. So going back then from a technical standpoint,

435
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,840
because you alluded to what the future could hold, right now you are measuring glucose in

436
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,480
subcutaneous fluid. Correct? Yes, that's correct. Not in blood. So people need to understand that.

437
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,640
So even a relatively lean individual has enough subcutaneous tissue that the risk of using this

438
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,960
thing, it's like, is it an issue in kids? Because I've seen some really tiny little kids with type 1

439
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,160
diabetes. Sometimes it is and parents learn how to make sure they insert it and that the needle

440
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,000
doesn't go into the muscle tissue. There will be an occasional instance where a sensor may go too far

441
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,360
in the tissue. But by and large, no, it's very successful. There's a meeting in Florida every

442
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,400
year, a group called Children with Diabetes, and look at all the kids who wear this. It's not an

443
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,480
issue for children. They do extremely well with it. You know, and I think I'm, I don't know if I

444
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,560
ever told you this story, but I was at a swim meet, it was my daughter's swim meet. I had just finished

445
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,120
my swim workout at the same pool. So I'm in my bathing suit finishing my workout as the kids are

446
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,880
about to start the meet. And this kid comes over to me and his eyes light up like saucers because

447
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,240
he sees that I have a sensor on and he's got a sensor on and he is tiny. He is the littlest

448
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:37,080
kid I've ever seen. And he was like, do you have type 1 diabetes? And I said, no. Why? And he looked,

449
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,360
I didn't even realize what he was looking at. And I said, he said, because you're wearing the same

450
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,520
thing I'm wearing. And I said, Oh, hey, little buddy, let me tell you, I volunteered to wear

451
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,600
this thing. That's how cool it is to wear. Oh, that's great. Yeah. He loved it. He loved that

452
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,280
there was some adult who was wearing this who didn't quote unquote have to wear it. But I was

453
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,120
like, yeah, we're the coolest guys here. I assure you. One of the most humbling things about this job

454
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:05,880
is when I go out to a diabetes function and meet the children or the adult patients, whoever who

455
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,720
has had this device save their life or change their life the way that it has. They want their

456
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,000
picture taken with me. I said, how about we just take care? No, we want you. Nobody wants needs

457
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,600
their picture with me. No, they want to take a picture. They are so gracious. They are so,

458
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,280
I know that they're so indebted to our company and it's really why we come to work every day.

459
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:35,320
What keeps us going. We had my favorite meeting ever. An 11 year old young man comes in. We sit

460
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,640
down and people come to San Diego on vacation and they come to Dexcom. So we got Lego land,

461
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,120
SeaWorld, Dexcom. And parents will bring their kids in and whichever the executive team is here,

462
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,560
we'll take them on a tour of the factory and then we'll sit in a conference room with them because

463
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,600
that is the best market research in the world to sit and talk to somebody who uses this each and

464
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:04,520
every day. This 11 year old young man said, I have some questions. I said, okay. He pulls like a legal

465
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,680
pad out of his notebook, out of his backpack and he has 40 questions. He wanted to know the chemical

466
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,320
composition of the membrane. 11. We just looked at him and go, no, we're not going to tell you all

467
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,160
those things. But he had thoughtfully written out all these questions and then had several

468
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,800
suggestions for us. It's just amazing. And your story, it happens all the time. Yeah, it's really

469
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,440
special. And I do have a friend with type 1 diabetes and she did say something to me that I've

470
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,200
thought a lot about since. She said, Peter, you have the luxury of if you don't want to wear that

471
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,720
sensor for a couple of weeks, you don't have to wear that sensor. She goes, I don't have that

472
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,360
luxury. And again, she wasn't saying that to be critical of how much I loved using it. She was just

473
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:54,920
saying, understand that my relationship with this CGM is different from yours. This is my lifeline.

474
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,720
For you, this is just a gain in your health, but it's not necessary for you to function. And I was

475
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,120
sort of humbled by that a little bit. And I realized, I can understand why someone who's got

476
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,680
type 1 diabetes has sort of a different relationship with this on both extremes.

477
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,840
On both extremes. It is love a lot of time. It's sometimes hate.

478
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,400
And the hate I think is the, I have to do this. I have to have this thing on me.

479
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,240
I had two close friends in residency who had type 1 diabetes. And this was back in the Wild West.

480
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,120
I mean, it was, I couldn't believe how archaic it was and how hard it was for them to manage

481
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:37,320
their diabetes. Because in a surgical residency, it's very difficult to predict when you're going

482
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,600
to eat. Oh yeah.

483
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,840
And therefore it's very difficult to predict when you're going to use insulin and which insulin

484
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,640
you're going to use. And I remember one of my friends who's now a cardiac surgeon in Minnesota,

485
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,800
there would be times when he always had to have a thing of orange juice and candies in the OR next

486
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,560
to his pager. And he would hopefully get to the point where he could say to a nurse while he's

487
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,800
operating, Hey, I need some orange juice quickly. And she would bring over the orange juice and

488
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,200
tuck the straw behind the mask and let him sip some orange juice or stick a candy in his mouth

489
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,720
or something like that. If he was, you know, this was an operation that was supposed to be done in

490
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,720
three hours and now it's five hours, that kind of thing. We take for granted in many ways,

491
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,040
like what this disease meant before banting. Oh, I don't know how people did it. Well,

492
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,640
they did it. They managed and then people have lived long, healthy lives. But this tool is so

493
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,280
much better than what we had before. And the things that can come in the future,

494
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,800
we made an acquisition a couple of weeks ago. The next thing on the horizon for type one diabetes,

495
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,680
let me take a step back is to develop algorithms to go with the sensor because right now we tell

496
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,480
you your glucose value. We tell you your trend. We tell you how fast you're going up or going down.

497
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,400
We will give you alerts and alarms based on what's going on. But we don't tell you what to do.

498
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,960
And algorithms have been developed for automated insulin delivery that will automatically do

499
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,720
things for you. One product that we're partnered with is tandem's new insulin pump. And it shuts

500
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,080
off when your glucose goes too low and then turns back on based on sensor signals. And the early

501
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,120
read on that product from consumers has been wonderful from patients. But these algorithms

502
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,840
are getting more and more sophisticated. Explain for the listener where that product sits. How

503
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,440
does it actually work? So there's an insulin pump that is on your body. It's about the size of a

504
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,240
good old fashioned pager that used to carry around in your hand. And there's an insulin

505
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:38,440
cartridge inside that pump contains software that regulates the delivery of insulin with that,

506
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,200
through that insulin cartridge to a small infusion set that is usually placed on your abdomen. A

507
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,720
little Teflon cannula goes under your skin and the sensor resides another place on your body.

508
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:56,120
And the sensor signal is read by that pump, which then takes all the information about insulin that

509
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,920
it knows how much has been delivered, your glucose value, and will determine, at least for this system,

510
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,040
if your blood sugars go too low, it turns off insulin delivery for some period of time,

511
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,960
then turns it back on when it sees the trend that you're coming back up.

512
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,680
Algorithms over time will do more than that. They can regulate your insulin delivery all throughout

513
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,360
the day, whether you're high or you're low, and detect things like meals. I mean, this is very

514
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,240
futuristic, but there are algorithms that will detect, okay, it's very apparent that Kevin just

515
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:35,880
ate, let's put some insulin in here and see how it goes. There are algorithms, again, to take care

516
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,120
of you more during the nighttime, because during the nighttime while you sleep, you're not eating

517
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,960
and you're not exercising. So there's not as many variables involved. So we acquired one of these

518
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,120
algorithms two or three weeks ago, just because it's an asset we felt we needed to have and develop.

519
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,640
Not everybody uses an insulin pump, not everyone will have access to that technology, it's not

520
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:03,240
inexpensive either. We think a lot of people will, but we also think we can take these algorithms and

521
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,440
apply them to people who use multiple daily injections as well to develop decision support.

522
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,320
You know, I always tell the engineers, I want the staples button, I want the easy button.

523
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,720
I want to take a shot and I want to hit something and say how much insulin do I take?

524
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,800
Or I want at 10 o'clock, I want to hit a button that says I'm about to go to bed.

525
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,640
What do you predict is going to happen? Those types of things are an engineer's dream,

526
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,360
which is what again, why it's so fun to work here. We have chemical engineers, software engineers,

527
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,840
electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, packaging it, any engineer you could think of.

528
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,880
Well, the algorithm guys, and along with the wonderful asset we acquired, are going to look

529
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,520
at developing those type of decision support tools to help make this easier for patients to

530
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,640
make good decisions. Now the question becomes how much benefit does that add to their care?

531
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:58,120
If they only go from 8A1C to 7.8, it's probably not worth it and nobody's going to pay for that.

532
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,280
But we think we can build a very strong outcome case over time.

533
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,400
But even if you went from 8 to 8 but reduced bad outcomes, like hypos.

534
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,280
Yeah, and reduced hypos. Yeah, that oftentimes happens. Your A1C may stay the same,

535
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,040
but your time hypoglycemic may go away.

536
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,040
That's the thing I was impressed with. Jake's data went way back even before you and I met,

537
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,160
which was they dropped hemoglobin A1C, I want to say like 2% on average,

538
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,080
but they reduced the hypos too.

539
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,800
Oh yeah.

540
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,960
And that's the part that like I remember in medical school, the standard teaching was,

541
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,680
you don't care about the hypers are fine. Yes, you can go too hyper, but the thing that you have to

542
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,320
ward against is the hypo and you'll accept a higher A1C to do it. And I think the tide is

543
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,800
changing. I think people are understanding that because of how long a person is going to live

544
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,840
with type 1 diabetes, the microvascular complications are real. And as you probably

545
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,760
know, there are data that actually suggest, and I saw this through Jake's work that

546
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,160
better glycemic control in kids when they're young, these are not randomized. So there's

547
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,200
an obvious confounder here, but it can predict better intellectual performance in school and

548
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,240
stuff like that. Now again, the obvious confounder there is maybe the kids that have better glycemic

549
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:17,000
control have better glycemic control because of some other variable that's impacting their

550
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,240
performance later on, socioeconomic status or the education of parents or the attention of parents.

551
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,080
So there's lots of other things there. I don't follow this literature closely. So it's possible

552
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,480
that there's actually been a randomization that would allow for determining that. But

553
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,160
the other thing, we talk a lot about average blood glucose and instantaneous blood glucose,

554
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,800
but another variable that I find very informative is the standard deviation. So every

555
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,400
day I look at my report, I always do the seven day report. I want to see a seven day report every

556
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,600
day. And that's showing me my average blood glucose for the last seven days and my standard deviation.

557
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,480
And then every month or so I want to see my 90 day trailing report. And you brought up hemoglobin

558
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,160
A1C earlier. I'm one of those people for whom hemoglobin A1C is categorically useless because

559
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,880
I have beta thalassemia minor. So my red blood cells are very small. They stick around for very

560
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,840
long periods of time. My hemoglobin A1C on a blood test generally varies between 5.6 and 6.0.

561
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:20,040
Basically I'm pre-diabetic on a test. But using CGM for the last few years and calibrating it,

562
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,520
because even the G6 I still calibrate every day just to... We left that option in. By the way,

563
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,640
that is a very elegant option. That's basically when I took my libre and threw it out the door.

564
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,520
Because I used to use the two in parallel and I just gave up on the libre because you couldn't

565
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,080
force the calibration and it was so inaccurate and you couldn't get real time. I mean, there was just

566
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,720
too many problems with it to even discuss here. But using these forced calibrations, I realize

567
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:53,080
this thing's plus or minus 3%. There are many days, Kevin, when it is the exact same number.

568
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,520
And I think to myself, this can't be happening. The meter says I'm 88 and I poke my finger and

569
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,840
it says I'm 88. And I'm like, how is that impossible? We call that the unicorn. Yeah.

570
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:09,160
But I get a lot of unicorns today before I came here. I did a calibration and I don't know,

571
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,400
the device said 89 and I was 88 or something. I mean, it was staggering. It's an interesting

572
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,400
dynamic because you are very focused on accuracy. I would say the biggest benefit of G6 to our users

573
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,080
has been the accuracy without the calibrations. We had somebody in yesterday who's been on a

574
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,600
product for a very long time, one of our Dexcom warriors. And I asked him how it was going and he

575
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,600
held his hands out to me and he goes, my fingers have not felt like this for 15 years. And that's

576
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,840
how long I've had diabetes. Well, that's another interesting point you bring up, which is when I

577
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,680
do my fasts, I'm calibrating twice a day. I'm checking ketones two or three times a day,

578
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,200
just 14 days of that kind of checking. My fingers are all blue and they hurt like crazy. And that's

579
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,720
another realization for me, which is think of all those kids that that is their life.

580
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,320
That's right. It sounds like how big a deal is that? It's really painful. In fact, you start to

581
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:15,640
lose sensation. One day I was upset about some clinical results I saw because we were calibrating

582
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,560
the sensor with a meter and it became apparent that the meter was off. So I got my car, I drove

583
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,040
to the drugstore, I bought three meters and I stuck my finger 60 times in a day, 20 times with

584
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,760
each of the three meters and I made my own little spreadsheet, recorded all the meters, recorded the

585
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,880
CGM reading to see what had happened. Because in the old days, when you had to calibrate this device

586
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:44,840
twice a day, a bad fingerstick would set it off for a while. Now we have since revised the algorithm

587
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,880
to identify a fingerstick that we just think is inaccurate and we'll wait a while and ask for

588
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,360
another one if somebody enters them. But it was very discouraging because we'd submitted a clinical

589
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,440
trial to the FDA based on a meter from a large company that we were told was fabulous and it

590
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:05,880
turned out to be high all the time. And that drives our accuracy level off. Do you have a point of view

591
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,240
about which of the commercially available drugstore meters do you find the most accurate?

592
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,840
I wouldn't offer that up. I have idea. I think most of them are okay. I would tell you my experience

593
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:23,720
of meters is also about the consistency. So oftentimes when I'm wearing our sensor and go

594
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,800
to check the accuracy, now I don't enter the calibrations like you. I like to see what the

595
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,840
patient is experiencing, but I'll stick my finger twice in a row and get like some meters I'll get

596
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,160
a big difference. Others I don't get very much. And do you do two sticks or same blood? I vary it.

597
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,840
Okay. So here's a little tip that I've learned and maybe you've already heard this from patients, but

598
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:50,200
by washing your hands before you do it, then using the alcohol, you can get some false elevations if

599
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,000
you have any food on your hands. So if you have just a little, you know, again, like a crumb on

600
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,240
your hand can actually raise the glucose. So, and I remember my friend in residency, again, I'm glad

601
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,240
I'm not identifying if I don't want to call him out. I mean, he wouldn't even wash his hands before

602
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,920
he'd be poking his finger. Cause he was just like, you know, on the go all the time. Yeah, on the go.

603
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,920
It's like, I don't have alcohol pads. I'm just going to poke my finger and you know, but you know,

604
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,440
those little things do, I think add up to a little bit of benefit for what it's worth. I guess I can

605
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,520
say what I like the most for glucose. I like the one touch ultra. Okay. I've switched to that. I

606
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,160
used to use an Abbott meter or a different meter by, I think it was by Abbott. And I don't know,

607
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,840
I found the one touch ultra to be pretty darn good. And I've done the same sort of experience.

608
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,520
The thing you've done where I've gone multiple sticks, multiple fingers, blah, blah, blah, blah,

609
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:42,680
going back to finish the A1C thing, my 90 day trailing average glucose under these very tight

610
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:51,160
conditions shows an imputed A1C of 4.5 to 5.1, depending on how tight my nutrition is. So in

611
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,880
other words, my hemoglobin A1C is a full percent higher. Oh yeah. And that's actually posed real

612
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,040
difficulties for me when applying for life insurance. Cause they say you're a pre-diabetic.

613
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:08,120
And I say, I'm not a pre-diabetic. And they say, yeah, but your hemoglobin A1C is 5.8 or whatever

614
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,200
it is. And I've had many interesting discussions with the actuaries as I explain the limitations

615
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:22,760
of hemoglobin A1C. But if I could be health czar for a day and wave a magic wand, I would love to

616
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,520
have something that meets all of your criteria, right? So it does the performance. It's got the

617
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,480
patient, it costs very little, but I really think that if everybody had a CGM on every minute of

618
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,320
every day in some completely fantasy based way where it doesn't hurt, it doesn't cost anything,

619
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,560
but they had that data. It just drives such a behavioral change. And I think that that's why

620
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:49,640
the use of CGM, even without a deliberate intervention, superimposed improves outcomes.

621
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:58,440
Because it is really hard to not pay attention to how activities in your life, mostly food,

622
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,840
but not just food, stress. It's amazing what stress can do to your glucose level. I think

623
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,000
one of the first insights I remember coming and talking to your team about a couple of years ago

624
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,760
was how high nighttime cortisol levels were raising my glucose levels at night.

625
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:20,600
I'd go to bed with a glucose of 90, three hours after eating dinner, and I'd wake up with a glucose

626
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:27,880
of 105. And once I started measuring nighttime cortisol levels by collecting urine overnight,

627
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,400
I could correlate this amount of cortisol produced at night to how much that glucose

628
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,040
level would rise in the morning. And today I'll tell patients that fasting glucose

629
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,480
is not nearly as helpful as people think it is inside of a reasonably physiologic range. So

630
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,800
someone who has a fasting glucose of 130, that's a different situation. There's something going on

631
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:53,640
there. But I have patients that get very upset if their fasting glucose is 100 instead of being 90.

632
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,680
And I say, it's very difficult to understand what's going on there. That can very easily be

633
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,880
explained by cortisol or hepatic glucose output for some other reason that's not a function of

634
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,680
insulin resistance. So that's why I just think that these tools are so valuable. And like even

635
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,960
yesterday, I was on a late flight coming back from, I was in Chicago, and I just hadn't eaten much.

636
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,200
My flight was delayed. That's the other thing. So I went into the little store near the gate,

637
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,960
and they don't sell anything but crap. That is, absolutely.

638
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,200
Yeah. And I've already learned, there are certain snacks that I love, and they're kind of my comfort

639
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,000
food when my flights are delayed. I feel like I deserve a treat because I'm stuck in the airport.

640
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,000
And I bought one. I bought my treat. My treat is trail mix. I love me some trail mix.

641
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,200
Trail mix will spike you as fast as anything you can eat.

642
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,680
Yep. So I get on the plane, and I buy the big trail mix because I don't do anything in moderation.

643
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,520
So it's got, it's full of M&Ms and raisins and peanuts and little whatever. And I get on the

644
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,520
plane, and I'm looking at the bag, and I'm looking at my glucose, and my glucose level's great.

645
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,360
And I just decide I'm not eating it. So I didn't eat it.

646
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,240
Oh my goodness.

647
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,040
And I promise you, if I didn't have that CGM, I would have eaten it. But I just didn't feel like

648
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,280
looking at that glucose, because I know I've done it in the past. I eat that whole bag of trail mix.

649
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,760
My blood glucose will be 130, easily.

650
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,120
Oh, then that shows what good shape you're in, because that'll get me up to 150 or 160.

651
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:25,960
It'll get me higher. The worst glucose experience I've ever had was in an airport.

652
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,920
And I had been with investors all day long, and I had not, my glucose hadn't spiked at all,

653
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,160
because when I sit in those meetings all day, I don't eat very much.

654
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,840
And I'm in the airport, and I'm in Boston, and I say, you know what? I'm going to try something here.

655
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:48,360
The yogurt-covered raisins, in the little thing where you turn the wheel like the bubblegum machine,

656
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,840
got myself a cup of yogurt-covered raisins. I think there's some chocolate raisins in it too,

657
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,640
and ate the whole little cup of them. And I'm telling you, that was my only ever

658
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,200
above-200-glucose spike in my life, and it only took 30 minutes. It just,

659
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,960
right up as fast as possible. And it came down very quickly as well.

660
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,360
Yeah, and then it overshoots. It probably came down to 60.

661
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,200
And then it overshot, and I was, yeah, it overshot down in the low 70s,

662
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,600
because I put so much glucose into my body, that's how my pancreas reacted.

663
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,160
But all of our bodies behave differently. We've talked a lot about type 1 diabetes today, and

664
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,840
one of our visions going forward is to get into other conditions. And you're certainly a pioneer

665
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,560
in this, and really one of our first. We started doing work in type 2 diabetes.

666
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,080
So again, let's paint a picture. We've talked about kids with type 1,

667
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,400
adults with type 1 who have to deal with insulin their entire lives, or they die.

668
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,720
And the device is a love-hate relationship, because it always reminds them.

669
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,840
Now let's look at somebody with type 2 diabetes. They're my age, 60 years old.

670
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,480
May have had type 2 diabetes for five years. All they do is they go to the doctor, they get

671
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,880
some pills, they get a meter, they go home, and nobody tells them what's going on, and they say,

672
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,440
you need to eat less and exercise more, and take your pills, and after five, ten years of this,

673
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,480
all of a sudden your A1C's at 11, and what do you do?

674
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,760
So we start adding more drugs, and you can turn on the television anytime you want to,

675
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,520
and you can see more type 2 diabetes drug advertisements, probably than any other

676
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,280
pharmaceutical product, because these drugs are expensive, and there is a big population

677
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,720
here to be addressed. So we start prescribing other compounds, hoping the A1C will come down,

678
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,280
and it might come down a little bit, it might not, and if it doesn't come down enough,

679
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,120
we prescribe another compound, and another compound, and another compound,

680
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,160
and some point in time that patient gets the dreaded information, they've got to go on insulin.

681
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:56,120
But type 2 diabetes, I'm not a neuroscientific as you, but it's almost not diabetes. It's almost a

682
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,600
completely different disorder with all the insulin resistance, and all the other things

683
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,640
that go on in your body. Yeah, the biggest disservice that I think has been done to this field,

684
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,120
and this is hyperbolic, I mean there have been many disservices, it's the fact that we refer to

685
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,640
them both as diabetes. Now I understand why historically that's the case, but you're

686
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,600
absolutely right. Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are so different, and I try to be

687
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,000
disciplined about always referring to them that way, and not just saying diabetes, because it

688
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,360
really does a disservice to them. What you point out is very important, Kevin, which is

689
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,120
that the real problem in type 2 diabetes is that we have fixated so much on just the glucose and

690
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:41,000
not worrying about how we get there. That's right. So when you use a class of drugs that increases

691
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,920
endogenous insulin production, and or when you use more insulin, what you reduce is the glucose,

692
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,160
and what you reduce are the microvascular complications, you do not save lives.

693
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,120
They're still getting cancer, they're still getting heart disease, they're still getting

694
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:00,680
Alzheimer's disease at a much higher rate. The challenge in type 2 diabetes is the combination

695
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:07,240
of the hyperglycemia with the hyperinsulinemia. So the therapies that save lives in type 2 diabetes

696
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,200
would be things like metformin, where you're actually fixing the glucose side of the equation,

697
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,000
and not just adding more insulin to the system. The SGLT2 inhibitors, these are the things that

698
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,400
are getting the glucose out of the system, which actually brings me to a question based on something

699
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:30,120
you said earlier. Is there any way it is algorithmically possible to estimate, let's say,

700
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,160
the average insulin that a non-diabetic would make over the course of the day based on glucose,

701
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:41,240
if you had some data points? So if I came to you, Kevin, and said, look, let me go and get under test

702
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,560
conditions, certain levels of glucose and insulin that are associated, we develop a kinetics model

703
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:54,520
for it, and then by tracking my continuous glucose data over time, could we ever try to estimate what

704
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,360
my insulin levels are in between? We have some studies that are very preliminary, and I really

705
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:07,480
can't talk too much about it, but we do believe that it's possible to measure how quickly insulin

706
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,840
reacts and how much by the slope of the glucose curves, but not at our five-minute measurement

707
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:18,840
intervals. So we're looking at other ways to record data, to develop algorithms to do that,

708
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:26,120
but it's very preliminary right now. I think over time, and this gets back into another thing that

709
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,640
Dexcom will do over time, we have an open architecture platform as well. So we've developed

710
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:37,560
APIs to whereby we will provide data to other software platforms if they can analyze glucose

711
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:43,400
values better than we can. One Drop, there are a number of them. They haven't produced a lot for

712
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,360
us commercially, but we've made the decision that this is the type of company we want to be,

713
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,960
because we just can't do everything. I think over time, that might be something that we'll look at,

714
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,800
but it also might be something somebody might be able to look at better than us.

715
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,920
Your raisins one, by the way, is so funny because I've had a number of those experiences.

716
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,200
Similar to that one where I was shocked was grapes.

717
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,720
Oh, grapes are awful for glucose values, yes.

718
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,680
I had not eaten anything in about 18 hours.

719
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,680
You had grapes, but the glucose ants are on.

720
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:21,320
I had grapes, and I was so pissed off. I thought the thing was broken. I was ready to rip it off my

721
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:21,720
body. It was not.

722
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,440
It was like, there is no way my glucose is this high after. I haven't had a grape since. That was

723
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,280
about six months ago. Oh, that's funny.

724
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:35,640
I was on an airplane about a month ago, and they had a snack tray, and it was some cheese,

725
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,680
a strawberry, and some grapes. It had five grapes, and I was actually really hungry. I ate

726
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,560
everything, but I didn't eat the five grapes. I'm sure the five grapes wouldn't have done anything,

727
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,240
but I'm boycotting grapes. I am done with that, what I call quasi fruit.

728
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,200
Well, I have not eaten many yogurt-covered raisins since that episode in Boston either,

729
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,000
so there you go.

730
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:00,840
See, that's my point. I think CGM has the potential to change the way people eat more than

731
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:07,080
any other technology I have ever laid eyes on. I'm heavily biased. I've stated my bias many times.

732
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,920
I'm a very big proponent of CGM, but I also believe in real-time feedback. I think it's

733
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,280
very difficult to curb a person's behavior when the feedback loop is so long, and the weight on

734
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:24,760
the scale, the blood test that you get at your doctor every six months, those things are valuable.

735
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:29,960
They help, but nothing trumps the 30 minutes after I eat the chocolate-covered raisins.

736
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:36,280
A, I see what it looks like, and now I can correlate that feeling of, I feel like crap

737
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:43,080
an hour later because my glucose has gone from 200 to 60. That's a crappy feeling. That's not

738
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:50,520
physiologically reasonable, and now people see why. So over time, where this gets very interesting is

739
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,680
that core technology platform I talked about where we make products to perform well,

740
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,440
that patients will use, and that costs less, never goes away. But there's a software element to what

741
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,680
we do that we can change dramatically given the experience we want a patient to have

742
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,120
or that a patient needs. And again, I'll give you the perfect example. Our type 1 patients,

743
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,520
the alerts and the alarms at nighttime while they sleep, are absolutely critical.

744
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:23,960
But somebody with type 2 diabetes who's taking these compounds, that may not be as critical for

745
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,440
them, but what would be critical is an analysis at the end of the day where we complement somebody

746
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,040
on, gee, you kept your glucose within range extremely well, or insights as we look back,

747
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:42,440
what did you eat for dinner today? Or integrating the CGM data into a food database to whereby

748
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,320
you take pictures of what you eat over time, and when you go back, you look at that food and say,

749
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,160
wow, I ate those scrambled eggs this morning and my glucose values didn't go up. Maybe scrambled

750
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,640
eggs for breakfast is a good thing for me, and then you take a picture of pancakes. And the next

751
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,080
time you sit down to eat, if you take a picture of those pancakes, you get reminded, you know,

752
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:06,120
you had pancakes a month ago, and that may not have been the outcome that you're looking for.

753
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,680
And I think this is the kind of stuff neutrino is working on, and I agree with you. That stuff is so

754
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,240
powerful. I feel like, you know, people assume I know a lot about food because of, you know,

755
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,360
sort of the work I've done and the things I've talked about and written about. And,

756
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,200
but the reality of it is I'm still humbled by how much I don't know, because it's not just what you

757
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,160
eat, but it's the physiologic state you are in when you eat it. It's very different. What happens if

758
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:34,680
you eat a bowl of pasta after you've exercised, you know, 30 minutes after a hard workout versus,

759
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,400
you know, eating it after having not exercised. It's a very different glycemic response.

760
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,600
Stress. We've talked about this and it can't be understated. How much higher my glucose levels

761
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:51,800
are when my sleep is crappy? Oh, or the correlation between high glucose levels and crappy sleep.

762
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,680
Because if you go to bed with high glucose levels after eating a very high carb dinner,

763
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:02,200
I've seen a direct correlation between my sleep and my glucose values. Yeah. Personally. Anyway,

764
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,640
I can't make this case enough. Now we talked about there are a couple other companies out there that

765
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,280
are doing this. Is there any publicly available information that compares the performance and

766
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:16,520
fidelity of the Abbott product or the Medtronic product to your current product? We all have

767
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,240
accuracy tables in our user guides, but they're biased towards the way the companies want to

768
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:27,000
project themselves. We have studies that we've published comparing ours to the other products.

769
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,160
We maintain our performance all the time. Yeah. It's not subtle in my hands. I mean,

770
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,840
I've been pretty vocal about it. It's not a subtle difference. And it isn't. We perform

771
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,720
extremely well across all the range of glucose in the low and in the high range. I won't speak as

772
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,320
much to the other guys. Our patients know. Our patients know what a Dexcom is versus the others,

773
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:50,600
and we can live with that one. Do you think that you will be able to maintain performance as the

774
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,000
sensor gets smaller and smaller? So in other words, is there a day when there's going to be a one

775
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,400
millimeter sensor? So something that really doesn't even get into the interstitium, but is still sort

776
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,640
of in the dermis itself that can perform this well, or is there just a technical limit to being

777
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,960
able to do this without accessing interstitial fluid? For us today, we've only gone down to the

778
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,320
interstitial fluid. We have looked at technologies that would go down more shallow. We have within

779
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,240
our R&D group, an advanced technology group who looks at nothing but things like that. Our second

780
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,880
verily product, one of our goals is to have a shorter sensor and to make it smaller, but there

781
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,760
are complications of a shorter sensor. What did the membrane layers look like so you can get an

782
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,880
extended wear on a 14-day sensor? How's the electrochemical reaction on a 14, you know,

783
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,800
on a longer life sensor if it's shorter versus the one that we have now? So we go through a lot of

784
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,720
trial and error as we look at these things to determine what is the best combination

785
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:51,480
of all of these features. I think we'll have a shorter one. Right now, we're very comfortable

786
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:56,280
with the interstitial fluid. If the pain of insertion is effectively eliminated, which it is,

787
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,720
once it's in there, I don't actually know the difference between it being in me versus on the

788
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,800
yeah on the skin. And I've played with other sensors out there that there are some that are,

789
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,440
you know, as short as 400 microns. There's some very short ones. And we evaluate those technologies.

790
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,480
We look at them. One of the beautiful things of being a public company having resources is if we

791
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:20,120
saw one that we thought was remarkable, we'd talk to them and see if there's something we can do to

792
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,880
further it along. But right now we're comfortable with what we're doing and what we have.

793
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:30,040
Now another question I get asked a lot is why can't this be done optically? Why can't this be done

794
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,840
the way a pulse oximeter, where you put it on your finger. So for someone listening to this who

795
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,040
doesn't know what that is, but if you've ever had surgery or anything like that, when you're

796
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,320
under anesthesia, there's a little device they usually put on your finger or on your earlobe.

797
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:48,200
And using light, it's actually measuring or estimating the saturation of oxygen. And can't

798
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,080
we just do that to measure glucose? Are there limitations to this that are just too great?

799
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:58,920
It has been tried on numerous occasions to do that. Several technologies have tried non-invasive

800
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,600
sensors. In fact, the first glucose sensor that I saw somebody wear, other than one we developed at

801
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:10,040
many men and Medtronic was one called the Glucowatch, which actually was a watch that sat on your wrist

802
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:16,280
and would take fluid out of your skin through reverse anaphoresis and measure it that way.

803
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:17,720
Wow.

804
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:22,920
It would leave a red mark on the outside of your arm and it was hard. We've seen a lot of

805
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,280
non-invasive glucose sensors and people call our sensor invasive because there's a needle

806
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,720
that goes in your body and comes out in a sensor that remains. So oftentimes people say,

807
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,840
we're going to develop something that is non-invasive. If it's two inches by three inches

808
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,640
and sits on the outside of your body, you can say, yeah, it was non-invasive. Well,

809
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,720
how do you find invasive? To me invasive is does it invade your lifestyle and does it produce the

810
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,840
result that you're looking for? A lot of people have worked on that type of thing. They've worked

811
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:01,000
on just measuring on the skin. There's one company that has one that measures in your tears that you

812
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,520
put inside your eye that I've seen. Are these accurate? Not accurate enough and none of them

813
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,040
have been to market yet, but only time will tell. People will continue to look, but they're not

814
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,840
solving the fundamental problem. I'll go back to those three things we build our product around

815
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,760
and I'll add a fourth. If it's accurate, if you solve the accuracy problem, if you make it more

816
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,480
convenient and solve the convenient problem, if you lower the cost, and finally, if you can produce

817
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:32,600
a healthcare outcome, you have something that's meaningful. Well, not having the little wire in

818
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:40,200
your skin while one can try and paint a horse story around that, it's not really that invasive

819
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,120
to your body. So anything that comes has to solve one of those problems better than the

820
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:51,480
technologies that are on the market. And if somebody can do that with an infrared sensor,

821
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:58,600
optical sensor, then we've had a wonderful technological step and we'll all figure out

822
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,840
where we move from there. We just haven't seen anything yet that's accurate enough,

823
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,360
performs well enough. Yeah, I suspect it's going to depend heavily on how much this stuff matters

824
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:13,800
and meaning how much accuracy matters. Obviously for me and for my patients, that's the highest

825
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,480
priority in what you give up right now is cost. I think of the four metrics you just identified,

826
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,360
the place where this is by far the biggest barrier is the economic barrier. It's the economics,

827
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:30,120
I would agree. So on that thread, anyone listening to this who says, gosh, I got to have a CGM,

828
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,960
they have to go get a prescription from their doctor and very likely they're going to pay out

829
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,560
of pocket for it. Unless they have diabetes. Yeah. They have diabetes. Including type two?

830
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,920
Depends. A few payers cover type two, not many, but a few.

831
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,960
Do you have the liberty of saying which payers? Do you know which payers cover type two?

832
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,640
Not at the top of the head. Because it's going to depend by region as well.

833
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:54,200
It's very regional and most of the type two patients are patients who use intensive insulin,

834
01:12:54,200 --> 01:13:01,400
such as the CMS Medicare patients. And this gets into our pair negotiations. Sometimes we sit and

835
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,800
we discuss, we want to make this easier for everyone to get. We want to cover type twos.

836
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,600
We want to cover type ones. We want all these things. And they go back to their economic models

837
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,600
and say, well, we can't do all those things, but we can give you this and we can give you this for

838
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,000
the type ones. And it is very much a business negotiation. And then based on your insurance

839
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,200
plan, typically our patients pay 20% of the cost, standard copay for durable medical equipment.

840
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,440
And depending upon the timing of the year, if you buy the first of the year and

841
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,960
their copayments and their deductibles have not been met, it's more expensive for them.

842
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,240
And is the cash cost fixed across the country or is that a regional?

843
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,360
We have cash prices here that are pretty much national.

844
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,720
You can say what the cash cost is.

845
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,480
I'll be honest with you, I don't even know what they are.

846
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:48,520
I should know this. My office does all the buying. The sensors come in boxes of threes, right?

847
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,000
Three centuries.

848
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,600
And we typically buy them nine at a time. So that's about a three month supply

849
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,080
because it's 10 days per cent. So that's 90 days. You know what? I used to do the math on what are

850
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:03,560
you paying per day? I'd amortize the whole thing over a per day cost. Does nine bucks a day sound

851
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,280
about right?

852
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,920
That's about right as to what somebody pays on the outside.

853
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,640
Yeah, I think that's what we pay. Nine or 10 bucks a day.

854
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:15,000
Between nine and $11 a day, we say on our earnings calls, for example, our average price per sensor

855
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
is X. We used to be only seven day sensors. So our average price is always between 70 and $75

856
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,760
that we have recognized in our revenue. Our 10 day sensor, we have different models as we've

857
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,200
gotten that reimbursed. That cost per day has to come down.

858
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,280
What do you think, or have you guys done an internal analysis that says, look,

859
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,640
at this point, this is a product where if we have 1% of the population has type 2 diabetes,

860
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,200
you've obviously built a very successful company where your customer base is 1% of the US population

861
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:51,160
or less. You've got a type 2 diabetes population that I think would benefit from this as much as

862
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,880
the type 1 population would, even though, as you've pointed out eloquently, different diseases,

863
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,240
basically. So that takes you to 10% of the population. Then you've got the pre-diabetic

864
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,600
population. Another 10.

865
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,880
Exactly. But then you've got like sort of half the people are kind of, I hate the term wellness,

866
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,280
but these are people that we're trying to optimize health for and they don't have a disease, but it's

867
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,880
not just that we're trying to prevent them from getting diabetes, but we're trying to figure out

868
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,560
if you can actually make them live longer through better glycemic control. What do you think or

869
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,360
what's your intuition about what does that need to cost per day to make that group say, look, out

870
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,320
of pocket, I'm going to pay for this because there's no way an insurance company is going to pay for

871
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,480
healthy people wearing these things.

872
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,160
We drive those discussions all the time. It's interesting. I had a discussion with a payer

873
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:42,840
once and I said, look, we want this to go to everybody that uses insulin intensively.

874
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,440
Tell me what the price is. Just tell me what to make it. Give me a number.

875
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,880
And the response I got was how low would you go? So I don't know what a person would pay out of

876
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,560
pocket because all we do is speculate on these kinds of things. Is it $25 for a two week sensor?

877
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,760
Is it $50 for a two week sensor? A lot would depend upon the information and the things that

878
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,640
you learn from it. There's a whole regulatory process we'll have to go through to get a health

879
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,440
and wellness product. For example, our device is a prescription device. Now we've been very clear

880
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,080
in our discussions, your patients who use this in its non-diabetic state, they have a prescription

881
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,360
from you and you pay cash for that. And we write them a new prescription every three months. And

882
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,880
they get it. To make this a non-prescription product, there's a lot of steps we'd have to go

883
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:36,520
through at the FDA. And one of the things that we look at with respect to our human factors and

884
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,720
our software design, if it were non-prescription, what would that software experience have to look

885
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,600
like? So let's explain to the listener why that's the case. So right now, everything we've talked

886
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,480
about, as you said, is still a medical device. It is a class two medical device. A physician

887
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,840
writes a prescription. And I'm only just talking about the cash patients. So this is not about

888
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,720
insurance anymore. Physician writes prescription, patient gets it filled, and they're all in cost,

889
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:05,720
is about nine bucks a day to wear this thing. And they are seeing the exact same data using the

890
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,880
exact same device with the exact same algorithms that a patient would type one diabetes. And the

891
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:13,080
exact same app. Yeah, the exact same software. Everything is the same. I am using everything

892
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:20,200
that someone with type one diabetes is using. So explain, Kevin, why if tomorrow a little elf

893
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:25,880
jumped out of your desk and said, voila, we can make this thing for a dollar. And just say that

894
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,880
the dollar was the price where like at a dollar a day, you could penetrate this new market.

895
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,160
That the FDA doesn't say, great, go ahead, go start selling it. Like there's a

896
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,280
fundamental issue. What is that issue? We have to go through clinical trials,

897
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,240
particularly if we're labeled for use for people with diabetes, to demonstrate the accuracy and

898
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:48,280
consistency of the product across all glucose ranges. The FDA and Ocander has been very

899
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:52,840
progressive with Dexcom. I mean, we're the first company ever to go directly to the phone. We're

900
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,560
the first company to share data. We're the first company ever to have a sensor perform at the

901
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:03,560
accuracy levels that we have. Most every first with the FDA in our industry has come to us

902
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:09,240
partnering with them. Most recently, they created a new category for continuous glucose

903
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:14,520
monitoring. And this is the intensive diabetes world called ICGM versus CGM, where they set

904
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,920
accuracy standards, where the products have to demonstrate on a statistical basis, they perform,

905
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:26,280
and you have to have a certain number of values in a study in a low range, in the high range,

906
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,480
in a certain number of points to statistically prove that that product is capable of doing the

907
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:37,000
things that we want it to do. In our intensive world, that's dosing insulin, either through a

908
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,000
manual calculation or thinking by a patient. But also with this ICGM category, which stands for

909
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,320
interconnected, we can connect to other devices. And they've made an easier path for other devices

910
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,880
to connect to our product. So for example, if you have an insulin pump in an algorithm,

911
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,600
and would like to run that algorithm, a glucose sensor, your regulatory path with Dexcom

912
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,040
is just to show you get the signal, you don't have to do a study to show the Dexcom is accurate,

913
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:10,040
we're done, it's interconnected. And Tandem's recent approval is along those lines. But if

914
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:14,680
you're displaying a glucose value, and that is a real time glucose value, and that is where we've

915
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:20,520
been at our discussions with the FDA, that's a class two medical device. And as of today,

916
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:26,280
that requires a prescription. At some point in time, again, as we look to the future, and as you

917
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,840
and I have talked, I'd like a device we could sell over the counter, or we could sell through

918
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,200
nutrition programs that a patient couldn't use to dose insulin, but what would be the real time

919
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:41,240
feedback you'd give somebody? Explain why that's necessary. That's what you just said is the

920
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:47,000
important point, which is if you want to sell this over the counter, the FDA is going to say,

921
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:53,960
it cannot be used by someone to dose insulin for today. For today, and maybe that will change over

922
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:58,360
time, but for now, those are the rules. And those are the rules that we play by. And that's very

923
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,520
important for people to understand, because that's one of the questions I get asked the most, which is,

924
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,680
why can't this thing just be over the counter now? I'm willing to pay the full price. Why do I have to?

925
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:13,720
Because not every patient has a physician who understands the benefit of this. And I know,

926
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,560
just from what I see on social media, a lot of people go to their doctor and say,

927
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:22,200
hey, you know, Dr. So-and-so, please write me the prescription. And he or she says,

928
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,680
what the hell for? Get out of here. Yeah, what are you talking about? Yeah. And so now that patient,

929
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,240
who's actually says, look, I'm willing to make an enormous investment in this because it's my health

930
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:36,920
and I believe that this is going to matter. Well, they can't do it. So what I'm hearing you say is,

931
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,920
there's one regulatory path that says maybe down the road, the FDA says, you know what?

932
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,040
This will no longer be something that requires a prescription. If the patient's willing to pay for

933
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:52,840
it, the patient can have it. I can't speak for them, but they have been so progressive with us

934
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,440
so far. What we would literally have to present again, is a case as to how somebody would never

935
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,160
harm themselves. And remember, there's a needle involved in inserting our product as well. There

936
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:08,680
may be standards and rules around needles, things like that. So I can't speculate how we get there.

937
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:14,440
But I think over time, that's something we would like to take on. But again, it would not be a

938
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:19,000
device used for diabetes treatment, it would be a device used for other things. We'll have to

939
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
figure out what that looks like. We don't know yet. And what you were alluding to a moment ago

940
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,320
was the other option for making this OTC is not to take the same device and just deal with the

941
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,600
FDA changing a rule, but it's to create a device that would fit into the current sort of regulatory

942
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,880
environment, which says the device would basically have to be dumbed down. You'd basically have to

943
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:47,320
strip functionality out of the device, right? Strip functionality and the user experience,

944
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:53,000
yeah. Not necessarily accuracy, not performance, but strip down the information that's presented

945
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,120
to the individual. So the ways that that can be done is one, you could make it such that they

946
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,560
don't get real time information. Because if you don't have real time information, if you see the

947
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:07,080
perfectly accurate identical data a day later, doesn't help you dose insulin. Another way is,

948
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:12,600
as you said, you just show ranges. Colors, the circles on your Apple Watch. I don't wear one

949
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,640
of those things, but I know you don't. You and I both like to wear our regular watches. I do wear

950
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:22,520
Apple, the Apple Watch frequently just to see what the user experience is. Okay. So what are the

951
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,440
circles? What are the circles? It's for training. You track your, how many times you stand up,

952
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:32,200
how many steps you take a day. They have some very simple measures. It's right there. It's pretty easy

953
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,600
to see and very easy to use. This is a totally unrelated question. Does the Apple Watch have a

954
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:42,120
little app or plugin that allows you to put the face of really cool watches on it so that you,

955
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,520
like if you really want to have a paddock, you could have like a little paddock Apple Watch.

956
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,280
Because that would be easy to do. You just need a picture of the paddock and you could have it like

957
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:55,400
looking like a, you know, your pick your favorite GMT, you know, or whatever. See Peter, we start

958
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,640
talking and it gets back to watches and other businesses we'd like to go start and do. I don't,

959
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,800
I don't know that that exists, but that would be fun. Who, why haven't Apple is your listening to this?

960
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,160
Maybe somebody has. Yeah, someone's got to develop the plugin that allows you to have

961
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,640
any watch you want as your Apple Watch. Apple Watch has cost what, a few hundred bucks? Yeah.

962
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,560
But you could put the face of a million dollar watch on it if you want. Well, and what we have

963
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,240
found within our company and with our patient base, there's a very high number of Apple Watch users

964
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,800
because our device goes from the phone and then the phone there's a watch app. Also, I didn't even,

965
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,840
because I don't use the thing I've never noticed. Yeah, there is a watch app and then we are

966
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:34,680
developing a direct to watch transmitter communication protocol. What that would do

967
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,800
for a patient, again, the new Apple watches have cellular capability as well, as will some of the

968
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,680
Android watches and some of the new Fitbit products. But with that direct cell capability,

969
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:50,520
that watch then can become a patient's receiver and the data could still be shared. You wouldn't

970
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:56,040
have to have it go to your phone. And again, we're thinking about those criteria talked to you about

971
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:01,080
earlier, as far as convenience, it's a lot easier for some of our people to pull their sleeve up and

972
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:07,400
look at their glucose than to get their phone out during an important meeting or to even take their

973
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,560
phone to bed, make it where they're watched to bed. Well, that's another new thing I like about the

974
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:18,680
G6 a lot. We didn't talk about this. With the G5, I had to keep my phone in my room to see all my

975
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:25,640
nighttime data. The G6 seems to store the data so that if I keep my phone in the office, it backloads

976
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:33,640
my file. There is some backloading if you do lose connectivity. The transmission range of our product,

977
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:38,280
I believe it's labeled for 20 feet. And if we've learned one thing about going to the phone,

978
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,600
Bluetooth is not an exact size. And I think we've all experienced that where some headphones connect

979
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,960
really well, other headphones do not. Sometimes you get your car, it works. Sometimes it doesn't,

980
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,200
it is very hard to explain. But is that why you went with Bluetooth as opposed to near field

981
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:58,120
communication? We went with Bluetooth because we didn't want our patients to have to put the phone

982
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,680
close to the device. We wanted the continuous feed. I think there is a place for near field

983
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:09,320
and it's quite possible we'd have both chips in a future one. But for now, we're very BLE oriented

984
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,200
and it works pretty well. Are there any, and again, I want to be sensitive to what you can

985
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,200
and can't talk about publicly. Are there any other partnerships or collaborations that you're able to

986
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:23,960
speak about that are maybe interesting to consumers, especially in this sort of non-diabetes,

987
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:29,480
non-type one, non-type two market for the people like me who are thinking about this for quote unquote

988
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:35,480
wellness. Well, nothing real concrete. I will tell you that Apple has been a wonderful partner for us

989
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:41,000
in getting the device to the iPhone and getting our apps working on Apple watch. In fact, at the

990
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,280
developer conference one year, we got a VIP invitation. Our head of R&D couldn't go. So I

991
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:52,440
went and Peter and I addressed differently. I'm total business person and Peter's Peter. And so

992
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,920
I show up at the Apple developer conference in my sport code in my shoes. And of course,

993
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,480
the guys next to me are in shorts and they're way younger than me. And they're looking at me like,

994
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:07,240
who's this? Who's this? Nobody dresses like this here. And I'm sitting there feeling pretty

995
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:12,200
uncomfortable. And they came out and talked about Apple watch. And lo and behold, Apple's got

996
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:18,680
Dexcom watch on the screen. Wow. Up there. And I, I elbowed the kid next to me. I said,

997
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:25,400
you see that? He said, yeah, I said, I run that company. I thought I was pretty, pretty special

998
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:31,960
for the day. Our partnership with Verily includes work with a company that they have called on Duo

999
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:37,720
that is developing treatment for type two diabetes and developing apps that combine everything

1000
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,440
they've learned about diabetes with a lot of Google technology. And they're in pilot phases

1001
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,560
with various payers on the type two side. We're also doing a lot of work with United Healthcare.

1002
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,720
On type two diabetes. And I think in the future with them, we're also going to develop some

1003
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:59,320
prediabetes models as we take this gen six technology out. You know, we talked about going

1004
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:05,240
to the consumer. Peter, you wouldn't have taken G5 to a consumer anywhere. It's too hard.

1005
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,680
Yeah. I had a hard time getting patients to do the G5.

1006
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,880
G6 is, it's not all the way there, but it's close. There are things we can do to make a little bit

1007
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:21,080
easier like pairing the device with the transmitter and some of the other things that have been

1008
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:26,760
inherent within our system. But it's close. As we get this thing closer to consumers,

1009
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:33,000
I think you'll see us try more things, more in different things. A couple of other applications

1010
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,840
where we'd love to take our continuous glucose monitoring technology where it's not.

1011
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,000
I've had numerous physicians ping me on LinkedIn saying, why aren't you in the hospital?

1012
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,560
Why aren't you in the hospital?

1013
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,680
That's a good question. Why aren't you in the ICU of all places, right?

1014
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:54,280
We tried many years ago. We had a joint venture with Edwards Life Sciences. And then the FDA was

1015
01:27:54,280 --> 01:28:00,840
extremely strict on accuracy and performance. And by the time we built what we built, it just,

1016
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:06,280
it didn't work out. Our technology has come so far and we've learned so much through projects

1017
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:12,360
like that in the past that we will make a run with G6 in that type of market to help patients.

1018
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,400
Think about it. You connect the Bluetooth to the nurses station. I was in one medical center

1019
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:23,400
where patients in the ICU are tested every 30 minutes, 48 finger sticks in a 24 hour period.

1020
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,720
Not uncommon. Intensive insulin therapy, of course, has had its ups and downs,

1021
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,960
resurgence in the literature, in the critical care literature. But basically there was a paper

1022
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:38,520
that came out in 2001 or 2002 in the New England Journal of Medicine that really changed the face

1023
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,280
of how glucose and insulin levels were managed or glucose levels were managed using intensive

1024
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,360
insulin therapy in the ICU. That has been questioned. Obviously there have been subsequent

1025
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:50,840
trials that have suggested that, you know, maybe the benefits on the glucose side come at the cost

1026
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,440
or the insulin side, et cetera. But you're absolutely right. Now that reminds me of something

1027
01:28:54,440 --> 01:29:01,240
though, which is acetaminophen. Tylenol has an effect on the performance, at least of the G5.

1028
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,440
Not G6.

1029
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,160
Oh, it doesn't have the effect anymore.

1030
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:11,640
That does not affect G6. We ran a very, very, very large study and put a lot of acetaminophen

1031
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,320
into patients to whereby we have no contraindication for acetaminophen anymore.

1032
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,680
So that's interesting, but the G5 would over or under?

1033
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,240
It would go high.

1034
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:19,800
It would go high.

1035
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,040
It would overestimate.

1036
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,080
It would go up a little bit.

1037
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:26,600
Yeah. So one of the challenges I suspect in the ICU patient is all of the drugs that they're on,

1038
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,720
also the third space like crazy. So their interstitium looks totally different from a

1039
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,800
normal person's interstitium. It's almost like there's a whole new calibration, right?

1040
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,240
We're going to have to go run some studies. But that being said,

1041
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,560
I'll go back to what you said your friend told you, you can pay me now or pay me later.

1042
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:49,400
If we can get this in the right configuration in the hospital on most every patient,

1043
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,720
at least every patient over 50 that comes in, forget whether or not I have diabetes,

1044
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,920
that hyperglycemia effect on healing we know is a very difficult thing.

1045
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:04,680
If we can get it on everybody and make this affordable and fit within the normal workflow

1046
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:11,560
of the hospital, that's a tremendous market for us. Another place we haven't been or been labeled,

1047
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:15,400
and you're going to be a little bit, probably chastise me after this. We've never been labeled

1048
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,800
for gestational diabetes. We had this discussion once.

1049
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:25,240
I didn't realize you weren't actually labeled, but I have a patient whose fiance is pregnant,

1050
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:31,000
and she had a device in and it turned out she had an old device. So she had the device and then

1051
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,480
never used it with one pregnancy, then used it with another and it wasn't working.

1052
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,240
We did some troubleshooting and to make a long story short, she said,

1053
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:44,040
I called Dexcom, but they said it's not approved for gestational use. I remember saying,

1054
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:49,640
what would be the difference? I'm very proud of my people for saying the right thing.

1055
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,240
We haven't run a study in gestational diabetes. We'll have to run a study there to get that label.

1056
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,120
One of my daughters-in-law contracted gestational diabetes while pregnant with twins.

1057
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:05,240
So her OBGYN wrote a script and we procured a Dexcom for her.

1058
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,680
He just looked at it and said, this is remarkable. We should all be on this.

1059
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:16,920
This gets back to A1C and other measures. As we look at evolving this Gen 6 technology,

1060
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,280
one of the things that we look at is this product that's a diagnostic as well.

1061
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,840
Right now, you drink that real sugary drink, go way high, you go way low. It's kind of awful.

1062
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,960
What about a blinded sensor on somebody for a week?

1063
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,640
Infinitely better.

1064
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,840
And then develop the algorithms to see what we can predict with respect to gestational diabetes.

1065
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:42,040
Those are the type of studies that we want to run in the future and the way we'd like to go about

1066
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,000
that market. And there's others as well. Again, I'll go back to your health and wellness one.

1067
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:52,600
Combining this with some of the nutrition apps out there, the Weight Watchers app,

1068
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:59,480
combining. If that had glucose data and you ate your points per day and you ate your 32 points

1069
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:04,520
today, but your glucose values were still high, maybe we take you down to 26 and vice versa.

1070
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:09,960
You can see how that can integrate with it wonderfully and integrate without

1071
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,840
showing a glucose value that you can dose insulin off of.

1072
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,840
I just think in the end, it's a much better metric for health. And I think health matters

1073
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:27,720
more than weight. Weight is correlated with health, but the correlation is not exceptional.

1074
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:36,520
It's reasonable, but it's so far from great. And my prediction would be when those trials are done,

1075
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:43,720
your standard deviation of blood glucose over a three month period is going to tell you infinitely

1076
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:48,200
more than whatever the fluctuations were in your weight. And it's frankly going to help you

1077
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,520
identify probably the type of weight that matters more. Obviously there's been a big

1078
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,760
discussion about the difference between subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. You could have two people

1079
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,640
that weigh exactly the same and you could even have two people that have a similar mass of fat.

1080
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:06,280
But where that fat resides probably tells us much more about their metabolic health. So I don't know.

1081
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:12,200
Like I said, if I could be czar of whatever for a day, I just don't see why I wouldn't want someone

1082
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:17,560
to have this information continuously in real time, every minute of every day under any physiologic

1083
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:23,800
circumstance, because what you learn, and not just someone who's got type two diabetes or type one

1084
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,280
diabetes or gestational diabetes, it's going to alter your baby. It comes back to the airport

1085
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:33,480
stories when we're in these environments that are at our worst. And you learn other really

1086
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:39,880
interesting things. I mean, you get a sense of how much even exercise can transiently raise your

1087
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:45,080
blood glucose, but what the benefits are after the fact, which is your ability to dispose of glucose

1088
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:51,400
goes up significantly. Yeah, I get about a 30 point spike in a workout, but for the rest of the day,

1089
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,400
my average glucose is about 10 points lower. Yeah, it's so amazing to think that such a simple

1090
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:04,280
biomarker is glucose, something we take for granted on every chemistry test we do on patients. You

1091
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:08,920
know, no one goes to their doctor and doesn't get their glucose measured, but what the utility of

1092
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:14,200
that is when you can measure it every five minutes. Kevin, this has been super interesting. I want to

1093
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:19,240
be respectful of your time. I know we don't have all day here and you have to get back to work. One

1094
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,400
of the stories you just told that I love so much that I didn't know was the going to the pharmacy,

1095
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:28,760
getting three of these things and poking yourself 60 times. To me, that's like, you know, Dexcom is

1096
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:33,640
a pretty big public company. Your market cap's like what, 12 billion? 12 billion dollars. Yeah.

1097
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,800
And, but yet you're still kind of a startup company. Oh, that's a startup CEO move.

1098
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:43,880
It really is. And I've had to learn to be less startup as we've grown. We've all grown with the

1099
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:48,520
company. But that culture, and again, one of the things that I manage as CEO here,

1100
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:55,320
is we've had to bring in skills and supplement our management team from that startup mentality

1101
01:34:55,320 --> 01:35:01,240
to the mid-size company mentality to whereby we have more structure and systems of a large company.

1102
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:06,120
So we're trying to mix all of those things together. We just had our employee survey and

1103
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:12,040
it's interesting. I read every comment. It's almost 200 pages of comments. I read everything,

1104
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:17,000
all the employees write, the good ones, the bad ones, and the funny ones. I will not quote the

1105
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,960
funny ones, but there, there, there's some pretty hilarious things people say. The most contradicting

1106
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:30,600
comments are we all need to go back to being a startup versus we need more structure to be bigger.

1107
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:37,320
And both are true. Both are true. The, the nimbleness of a startup in an industry where you're

1108
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:42,600
creating everything is absolutely essential. You've got to remain nimble. You've got to be

1109
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,840
willing to fail. You've got to be willing to start over. You got to be willing to do what's right.

1110
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:54,760
Conversely, that big company structure where you have systems and, and balances and checks to make

1111
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:59,400
sure you're doing the right thing and you start watching dollars more is a different culture.

1112
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,560
So we're mixing those two together. We're kind of like a mixed family here.

1113
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,480
We will have added more than 1500 employees in the last two years.

1114
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,960
Wow. I didn't realize you were that big.

1115
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:17,640
I was employee three, about 300 in 2011. I think we have 2500 full-time employees and

1116
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,280
several hundred attempts. We do a lot of our manufacturing work, attempt to hire and bring

1117
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,160
them in and grow and, and shrink with volume. They were the temporary workforce, but no,

1118
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:27,960
we have that many people.

1119
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,800
Can I add one more question for your internal survey that I think will produce awesome,

1120
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:37,800
interesting results. Every month have a, or every quarter or whatever frequency makes sense,

1121
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:43,240
have a tell us your best surprise glucose spike story. Because I mean, honestly, this,

1122
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:49,080
the grapes, the stupid chocolate covered M&Ms, whatever, I mean, I think, I mean, there's going

1123
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:53,000
to be the obvious ones. Like I ate a bag of Swedish fish. Look what happened to my blood sugar.

1124
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,440
But there's these surprise ones either in the velocity of glucose escape or the peak. Because

1125
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,680
I'm guessing most of your employees are wearing these things, right?

1126
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,320
No, no, no, no, no, there's too many of us.

1127
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,720
There's actually impact production.

1128
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,880
There's too many of us now. But you know, if we run an internal study under IRB protocol and

1129
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,440
everything, we will recruit volunteers within the company. We have several people at Type 1

1130
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:21,160
diabetes that work here because they can lend us a perspective for our patients that we don't have

1131
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:26,920
on our own. So that's important to us as well. A lot of it, where I'm in a lot of the things that

1132
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:31,400
we learn are through those in-house studies and through that in-house wear process.

1133
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,120
You said something a second ago about failing quickly. You have five kids, right?

1134
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,000
I have five sons.

1135
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,120
And just before we were getting ready to start, we were talking about our kids. And you asked me

1136
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:46,600
if I wanted some advice on being a parent to which I couldn't say no, of course I did. Do you

1137
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,800
remember the advice you gave me?

1138
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:54,760
I do. And I was recounting a story of how things have changed. There's a big gap. My oldest is 15

1139
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:59,640
years older than my youngest. And there's an eight year gap between number four and number

1140
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:06,520
five. But what I told you is we can't be afraid to let our kids fail. I know I'm going to sound

1141
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:12,280
horribly mean, but everybody getting a ribbon and everybody getting a trophy. I once told a coach to

1142
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:18,520
cut my son so he would learn something. If he wasn't going to play him, go ahead and do that.

1143
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:23,000
We learn in life as much from our failures as we do our successes. Sometimes we learn more

1144
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,600
and sometimes they motivate us to be great and motivate us to do great things.

1145
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:35,080
But we oftentimes as parents shelter our kids so much from that, what appears to be traumatic.

1146
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,400
And I'd given that advice to somebody who didn't have any children. And he came in my office,

1147
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,280
he goes, give me one bit of advice. And I said, all right, I'll give it to you. Because we just

1148
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:49,720
try and manage and regulate everything so much all the time. And look, I will tell you with number

1149
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,920
five, I did a lot more of that than I did with number one. Number one would tell you that I was

1150
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:59,240
very tough on him, but I let him carve his own way. And it's a good thing to let him learn.

1151
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:04,600
Last question, Kevin, is there a failure that you point to in your professional life,

1152
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:10,600
leading up to where you are today that has taught you more than the others about what you're doing

1153
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:19,560
now? Boy, that is a great question. I wouldn't tell you one in particular, at a corporate level,

1154
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:27,480
I'm going to go big picture. I was at one company where I knew exactly what to do. And

1155
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:33,080
it was really the only course of action that would have made that company successful.

1156
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:39,960
And I presented it to my board and they said no. And I then rolled up my sleeves and worked

1157
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:45,000
hard for several months and several months and several months. And I still got the answer, no.

1158
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:52,840
And I finally left after beating my head up against the wall. And that taught me a lot of

1159
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,240
lessons. Number one, to be better prepared and how I give my message. And I attribute

1160
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:02,760
fires like that to me. I don't blame the others. To be better prepared on how I deliver my message,

1161
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,640
to be more thoughtful. But if the situation isn't going to work out and what I ended up doing,

1162
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:13,560
and my wife would tell you this, my commute was five miles at the time. It's the most miserable

1163
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,200
I've ever been in my entire life. She would look at me and say, what on earth are you doing? I'm

1164
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:24,440
going to fix this. I'm going to get this. And I couldn't win. So I left and that's the one time

1165
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:31,560
where it felt like I didn't get done what we could have got completed. But I didn't see all

1166
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,960
the signs on the wall. So I've looked at ways I can be better from that. When I see something

1167
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:41,800
strategic like that, I do more homework. We have the people around us do more homework. We're more

1168
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:47,640
thoughtful. So that's one of them. We've all had numerous little failures. Sometimes, again,

1169
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:52,440
our failures are our biggest blessings. I would say the failure that's been my biggest blessing

1170
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:57,240
are all the jobs I didn't take. Because you get opportunities and you get mesmerized with an

1171
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:01,960
opportunity. I mean, you can go do this. And countless times in my life, those didn't work out.

1172
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:08,040
And then lo and behold, an opportunity comes along and it's, wow, I'm so glad that didn't work out.

1173
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,880
And then you learn so much from that. Now, and I would say the other thing that's important as far

1174
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:19,720
as success, you're only as good as those people that are around you. And it becomes clear and

1175
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:25,320
clear to me the longer I work. This team we have here at Dexcom, they are committed, they work hard.

1176
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:31,480
We are all engaged in our business each and every day. I never go to a meeting with another company

1177
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,080
where their people are as engaged in what they do as ours.

1178
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,640
Well, that's an interesting point to end on because I do think that Dexcom, obviously,

1179
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,720
I'm very biased. I've been very, very vocal about my bias to Dexcom over the other

1180
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:49,480
two Abbott and Medtronic. But I think you guys have an advantage that on the one hand is a

1181
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:54,280
disadvantage. Let's be honest, diversification. Those companies have a million products to fall

1182
01:41:54,280 --> 01:42:00,440
back on. CGM is but one of a hundred things they do. But that disadvantage is actually your biggest

1183
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:05,640
advantage, which is everybody shows up to, and I feel like I know half the staff here. I'm here so

1184
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:09,640
often shooting the breeze with you. There's something to be said for, what's the expression?

1185
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:14,280
You burn your ships, right? That's right. Yeah, you guys have burned your ships. You're all in on CGM.

1186
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:18,760
We are. Well, Kevin, I want to thank you very much for your time, for your insights and for your

1187
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:24,600
friendship. It's been amazing to think that we met on that airplane almost three, four years ago.

1188
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,240
And to this day, we managed to do a good job of not talking watches this whole thing. Once we turn

1189
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:32,360
the recording off, I want to talk to you about the one I'm wearing right now, which I think you're

1190
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:36,760
going to love. It is beautiful. Yeah, thank you. I wore it today because I knew I was going to see you.

1191
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:42,520
Okay. This is what watch idiots do. We do like show and tell. Does your wife make fun of you as well?

1192
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:48,440
Oh, it's ridiculous. Now I've learned a good trick, which is you start giving your wife nice watches,

1193
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:55,480
and she now understands and appreciates like why a Daytona is a nice watch and what Paul Newman

1194
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:59,320
meant and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all these other things. So now she's a little bit more

1195
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:04,520
tolerant of my nonsense. All right. All right, Kevin, have a great afternoon. Thank you, Peter.

1196
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:10,280
