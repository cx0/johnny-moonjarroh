00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,420

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,280
In this podcast, I'll be speaking with Corey McCarthy.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,240
I haven't known Corey very long.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,140
I first met him in April during a trip that Tim Ferriss and I took with a number of friends

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,240
to North Kern State Prison, which is a maximum security prison in California, about an hour

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,380
outside of Bakersfield.

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,360
We did this as volunteers with DeFi Ventures.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,180
And if you haven't heard of DeFi, or more importantly, Catherine Hoek, you should definitely

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,260
go back and listen to her interview with Tim Ferriss, which was done probably in January

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,420
or February of this year.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,060
And we'll link to that here.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,940
DeFi is a program where volunteers like us go into prisons and participate in helping

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,740
with teaching prisoners certain skills in life.

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,620
But I got to tell you, after just that one trip there, I've come to realize that the

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,580
volunteers get more out of that experience than the prisoners do.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,340
It's hard to really explain what we experienced there.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,780
And on the drive home, there was about six of us in an SUV that had a five, six hour

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,140
drive back, including Corey.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,900
It was clear that it was going to be very difficult to articulate what we went through

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,260
with people who didn't share that experience with us.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,620
But in particular, I was really moved by Corey's story.

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,060
You see, Corey himself was once an inmate.

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,580
And he was invited on this trip by one of my good friends.

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,220
And he asked, hey, I know this is kind of a small group of your buddies coming with

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,100
you and Tim, but could we invite Corey?

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,820
And of course, we said, sure.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,020
And it turned out Corey was just one of the most amazing guys.

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,700
And in many ways, the trip was stolen by him and his experiences.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,940
And on the way home, I realized that I wanted to have a discussion with Corey that I wanted

39
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,300
to be able to share with people.

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,740
And I think in part, it's so humbling to go through this experience that we went through

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
at Kern.

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,100
You start to realize that some of the smallest choices can lead you down the wrong path.

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,380
And so often there's a lot of pain that's at the root of bad decisions we make.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,940
And I didn't know what Corey and I were going to talk about, to be completely honest.

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,340
We didn't plan for it at all.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,540
I didn't have a script.

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,180
I didn't have a single question written down.

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
We just talked.

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,780
And I'm really pleased with how it turned out.

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,680
And I hope that you'll take this on a leap of faith and listen to this because I find

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,900
it impossible that anyone listening to this won't get at least something out of this.

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,180
Understanding how your experiences can define you, understanding what forgiveness means

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,140
of both yourself and others, understanding how good people can do bad things.

54
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,300
As you know, I'm very interested in longevity.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,920
But if you've been following me on social media, you've probably noticed I'm becoming

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,700
more and more interested in mental health.

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,100
And that's going to be kind of a recurring theme on this podcast because as I stated

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,440
before, and I think many people would sort of intuitively agree, what point is there

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,860
in living longer if your mind is not right, if you're not happy?

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,540
So I hope that you'll find this discussion half as enjoyable as I did.

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,740
Corey is an amazing guy and I'm really excited to introduce all of you to him.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,500
So without further delay, here's my conversation with Corey McCarthy.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Hey man.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
How you doing?

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Good.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
How are you?

67
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Pretty excited actually.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah.

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Welcome to the Big Apple.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Yeah.

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I like it here.

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,540
How often do you get down here?

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,180
Every year for the past five or six years, I've come with my daughter for Christmas time

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
and I have some friends.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,620
I might pop in once in a while.

76
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,220
Remind me, your daughter is 16?

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
17.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
17.

79
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,140
She graduates from high school next week.

80
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
Exciting.

81
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
Wow.

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Yeah.

83
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,020
I have a feeling we'll come back to that in a little bit.

84
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,360
Thank you for making the trip down from Buffalo today.

85
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,380
This was something that from the day we met, I was like, man, there's so much I want to

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,060
talk about with Corey.

87
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,020
And I figured this would be kind of an interesting way to share the experience that brought us

88
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,040
together and also talk more about your story.

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,420
So how did you even hear about this whole thing at DeFi?

90
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,860
What brought you out to California that day?

91
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,620
So Devin is a friend of mine and that's kind of a story in itself and one that kind of

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,100
ties my whole life story together.

93
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,300
Everything's kind of always happened for a reason.

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Because Devin, just so I'll tell my back end of the story, is Devin's a friend of mine

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,460
in San Diego.

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,100
I had told him about Cat Hoke and my trip that I was planning to defy, but totally by

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,140
luck because I happen to be walking into my bodywork guy who also works on Devin.

98
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,140
And as I'm walking in and Devin's walking out, I just mentioned it in passing and he

99
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,660
was like, I want to come.

100
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,500
And then the next thing I hear like two weeks later, he goes, hey, is it cool if my buddy

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,820
comes to which I was like, sure.

102
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,900
And then never knew anything else till you arrived.

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,700
It's so cool to hear because that just adds to the weave of the whole thing.

104
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:41,420
So Devin and I only know each other because six years ago, a friend of his who knew me

105
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,860
reached out and said, hey, my friends got like a big brother, little brother situation

106
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,500
where he's a volunteer for this kid and the kid's in kind of trouble and we think you

107
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,980
might be able to talk to him because of your background.

108
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,540
So me and Dev met through that and Dev.

109
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,920
This was Dev's little brother.

110
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,780
It's not his biological little brother.

111
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
No, no, right.

112
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Yeah.

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Yeah.

114
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,220
But Dev and I kind of remained associates because of that.

115
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,940
And then his little brother who's now in his twenties was getting out of prison and I've

116
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,780
kind of been his feet on the ground in Buffalo to walk Dev through what to expect, what not

117
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,060
to expect.

118
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,980
So he emailed me the email, I think that you sent to him and I immediately told him like,

119
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,280
man, like I just did all this research on it.

120
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
It looks really official.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,000
I'd fly out there to do that.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
And I didn't even expect for him to say that.

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,800
I was just kind of saying like, I'd love to do that.

124
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
And he was like, well, let me ask.

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
And then 10 minutes later he was like, yeah, they said it's cool.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That was in itself was like a challenge.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it's so funny how such like a small challenge that you don't want to tackle turns into like

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,440
a great thing because I had to go, you had to fill out paperwork.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,200
And so did I, with the paperwork I had to fill out was much more like I had to write

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
a letter to the warden, a personal letter to the warden.

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,620
And I had to find New York state records for me that I had to forward to them.

132
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,040
And because it's not like who I am, I got rid of that stuff.

133
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
So I had to go online.

134
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,700
Thank God you can find pretty much anything on anybody online.

135
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,920
But so that's how I ended up there.

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,560
So Dev invited me and I was like really excited to go.

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,440
And on our end, the way this all started was Kat, who you got to meet Kat Hoke.

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,780
I have four friends who have known Kat for various periods of time.

139
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,200
And so she's always sort of been someone I knew about, but I didn't actually meet her,

140
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,520
God, probably until earlier this year.

141
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,480
And it was only actually after I heard her on Tim's podcast that I had already reached

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
out to her by phone.

143
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,440
But that's when I kind of reached out to her and was like, look, I want to come and join

144
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
one of the prison visits.

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,360
And Tim had already agreed to do it.

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,320
So then I just said to Tim, like, let's do it together.

147
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,160
And we asked Kat which prison do you think would make the most sense?

148
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,460
And she suggested that Kern would be a great prison to visit because of her amazing relationship

149
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,580
with the folks there.

150
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,200
And so then it was just going to be me and Tim.

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,640
And Tim was going to invite a few people.

152
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,440
And then I bumped into Devin that one day and invite him.

153
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,200
And then a couple of my friends from New York who flew out.

154
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
And so, OK, so we get there.

155
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,840
Now I got to I remember on the way up there, which was like what, like a five or six hour

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
drive or some worse for you guys.

157
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Yeah.

158
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
You guys came from San Diego.

159
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Yeah.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
And pick me.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I felt like, oh, that's right.

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
We picked you up at LA.

163
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Yeah.

164
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,440
Well, no, it was like somewhere outside of LA.

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
But yeah, that was true.

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,360
But you probably would be the most skeptical guy going in.

167
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,920
I think me and Tim and Devin Jason, like we'd we were a little more like not knowing what

168
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,480
to expect, but perhaps a bit more thinking this is going to be really interesting and

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,840
it could only be good.

170
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,520
And I got the sense like you felt like let me see how real deal this is.

171
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,560
Devin asked me the same thing over the phone before we got there.

172
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,040
And I actually said, had Kat Hoke not had the history she had that I wouldn't have believed

173
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,120
in the program or her.

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,480
And it's funny because that's kind of why we're sitting together.

175
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,520
And it's kind of why I think you believe in me is because I like I'm not afraid to

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,960
tell you about who I am or what I've been through.

177
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,600
And it's funny even more because my daughter just wrote that in her high school apologia

178
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,800
that pain is how we're all tethered together.

179
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
And I believe in that.

180
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,960
Getting back to it, I was definitely skeptical.

181
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,480
I've seen programs in prisons.

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,040
I've seen people who work in prisons and I didn't necessarily believe.

183
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,120
I did my fair share of research.

184
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,720
I listened to the entire podcast with Tim, which was great.

185
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,000
I read about the program.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,160
I went through their whole website.

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,640
I read about you.

188
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
You know what I mean?

189
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,480
And I was like, all right, well, let's see.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
It was interesting because I was really hoping I didn't get let down.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,400
But I was prepared for it and I wasn't let down at all.

192
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,520
So that's I was definitely a little skeptical because there's people there's programs and

193
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,480
there's people that don't work and they're in place all over the place.

194
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,840
You know, it's interesting you make the point about how I didn't know that you had said

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,520
that to Devin that it was actually Kat's quote unquote baggage that made her appealing and

196
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,080
more trustworthy to you.

197
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:37,120
And I feel like in some ways when Kat and I finally met that was a big part of the connection

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,700
was, you know, I was going through a really difficult time.

199
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,620
She was going through a really difficult time.

200
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,320
And as you said, sometimes pain just tethers people.

201
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,740
And it's you don't want to be around people who are going to be very superficial and who

202
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,020
are just going to tell you how great everything is.

203
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,500
And you want to be able to just let your guard down and sort of be yourself.

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
And I agree.

205
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,740
I think that that's such a big part of Kat's efficacy.

206
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,300
Now, interestingly, I think she was equally efficacious even before the PEP scandal in

207
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,380
whatever year it was 2009 or something.

208
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,340
But if anything, all of the stuff that she's been through has only made her that much more

209
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,980
grounded in what she's doing and the importance of second chances and third chances and all

210
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
these things.

211
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,980
So I want to talk a lot more about what we experienced there because I found it to be

212
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,780
one of the most important things I've ever done in my life.

213
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,260
And yet I've never really been able to talk about it since we left.

214
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,340
I've said very little about it to even the people I'm closest to because I don't know

215
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,620
what to say.

216
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,420
Have you been able to talk about it with anyone?

217
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,780
So a lot of people want to talk to me about it.

218
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,860
The closest people to me tell me that they're so happy that I found where I belong.

219
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,100
Another guy told me, put your flag in the ground, your people need a leader.

220
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,980
And really, I mean, I get overwhelmed just thinking about it, but not overwhelmed in

221
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,420
a bad way, but in a really good way.

222
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,740
I've been able to talk about it, but it's also I feel like I had a unique experience

223
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,220
because of my history and I was able to see and watch you guys as well as watch the inmates

224
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,780
and because I was skeptical.

225
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,140
So I was watching.

226
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,160
I've always been able to like watch and see what's going on rather than talk.

227
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,740
I feel like it's very helpful.

228
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,580
But yeah, so I watched you guys have an experience and I watched the inmates have an experience

229
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,660
and I meanwhile had a really powerful experience.

230
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,380
But I think it's easier probably to talk to people who have been there and done it.

231
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,620
I thought that our drive back because we dropped Jason off back in Beverly Hills and then drove

232
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
back to San Diego.

233
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,860
So we had like six hours together.

234
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,220
I found that to be one of the most incredible road trips of my life.

235
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,260
You know, we listened to like the David Foster Wallace stuff.

236
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
That was good.

237
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,740
It was just it was water, right?

238
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,980
Yeah, this is water.

239
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,100
And we just got into all of this stuff that made so much more sense to everyone once they'd

240
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,420
been through that experience.

241
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,620
I just I found that six hours went by so quickly.

242
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,540
I was actually sad when we got to San Diego.

243
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah, that it was over.

244
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,740
Yeah, I wasn't like in a rush to get home.

245
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,540
It was probably the easiest road trip I've ever taken for sure.

246
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Yeah, comfortable.

247
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,060
Yeah, a lot of huge chocolate too.

248
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,580
That didn't hurt.

249
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,020
So let's talk about your story.

250
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,180
I mean, I don't actually know that much.

251
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,080
You've told me little bits, but I've been deliberately not asking you too much leading

252
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,540
up till today because I wanted to basically experience this as a listener would.

253
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,020
But all I basically knew when you showed up was your Devin's buddy, you'd serve time in

254
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
prison.

255
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
That was it.

256
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,020
You had a good haircut.

257
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,420
Yeah, I'll tell you a little kind of joke.

258
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,980
I spent seven years, three months and 10 days the last time I was in prison.

259
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,700
In prison, they give you single blade razors to shave your face and head with.

260
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
It's kind of a joke.

261
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,260
You end up with more cuts than clean shaves.

262
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,100
But I still use a two blade razor and everybody kind of busts my chops about it because they're

263
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
like, dude, you got seven blade razors.

264
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,820
Yeah, and they have batteries in them.

265
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,780
And I joke because I'm like, well, you know, like it's kind of the way I like to live.

266
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm going to work on the two for a couple of years and then I'll go to the three.

267
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,140
Like why wear out is welcome.

268
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,820
Like it still has value to me.

269
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Yeah, so I spent to kind of go back to the, I've recently since we were together, I kind

270
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,780
of saw a lot more of the value that I have with what I've been through and kind of again

271
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,620
with that tethering us together stuff, right?

272
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,140
The way I see it is we all go about our business kind of one of the things that got me through

273
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,300
that prison term was two words endure and overcome.

274
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,460
And a lot of times that's kind of just like, okay, put your head down and keep moving your

275
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,260
feet forward.

276
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,580
And we do that in life.

277
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,220
And we do that when we meet each other and we don't say, hey, like, you know, I've been

278
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,380
hurt.

279
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,120
And so we're not able to like say that to the other person.

280
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,180
So we don't get to connect unless we do that.

281
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
Right.

282
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
And I'm able to do that.

283
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,180
And I don't know why.

284
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,300
I think there's value in it.

285
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:31,120
So what I've been doing is going back through my own story to try to put something together

286
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,460
in honesty to help Kat Hoke or to help people like Kat Hoke.

287
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,740
Like the idea was to maybe put a book together and then take those funds to back something

288
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
like that.

289
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,900
And also give those books to the guys in jail, like just here, like in jail, everybody returns

290
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,720
and no, but you never see the guy who doesn't come back.

291
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
You never see him.

292
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
Right.

293
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,960
And so it's like you just negatively select.

294
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,280
And all you ever hear is, oh, you know, I couldn't get a job and my parole officer sent

295
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,200
me back and I, you know, my girlfriend and all you ever hear is excuses and really just

296
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
traps.

297
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,360
And that's why I think those guys valued me is because they were like, hold on, you, you

298
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,880
just came here with these people and you were in here with us.

299
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
Like, I don't know how that math works.

300
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
And it's like, well, I'd love to show you.

301
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,560
You know what I mean?

302
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,280
So anyway, I have a clear view of my like story.

303
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,320
But I grew up in a really nice home with like wonderful parents.

304
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
You grew up in Buffalo?

305
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah, in Buffalo, New York.

306
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,160
And I have like a lot of really good memories, but my dad's an attorney.

307
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,680
My mom's an attorney, working family.

308
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,760
I have an older brother who's five years older than me.

309
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I have an older sister who's three years older than me.

310
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,760
And back then it was, I don't know, like middle America type life, a small city, but

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,840
we think we're big.

312
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,040
I played a ton of sports, really athletic.

313
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,840
I think in some ways my dad favored that because I was like so into sports.

314
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,960
So me and my brother had like a big rivalry because he was like Star Wars.

315
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,680
And I was like, let's play baseball or the more impactful stuff.

316
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,920
I think the stuff that led me down the road I was on was when I was I think seven years

317
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
old.

318
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,000
And when you think about it, it's like a really young age, right?

319
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Like I was seven years old and we were at a public or a minor league baseball game and

320
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
we used to go to him.

321
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
It was a family outing.

322
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,680
It was like a cheap family outing, fun time.

323
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,040
And it was a cold day.

324
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,440
And the reason I remember it was cold was because nobody was using the bathroom.

325
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
Like nobody was getting drunk.

326
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
And so nobody was in the bathroom.

327
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
And I, me and my brother got up to use.

328
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
I was going to the bathroom.

329
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,200
He was going to get nachos.

330
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,320
And he must have been 12 at the time.

331
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,960
And I went to the bathroom by myself and some guy attacked me.

332
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Like there was nobody in there.

333
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,720
I don't want to get into like a ton of details in case I do sell a book.

334
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
Somebody can look for it, right?

335
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,440
So some guy attacks me and basically steals all of my innocence, all of my trust and like

336
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,720
adults like looking back.

337
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,900
And I don't like to blame anything.

338
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,860
But now that I am looking back at this stuff, it's like that guy really did a lot of damage

339
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
to a kid.

340
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:24,240
And the funny thing about like psychology is up until I've done some work to kind of

341
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,740
clean up my brain, I didn't realize like the story I've been telling myself was different

342
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:36,560
from the story that my, like, like in my story, I screamed, he ran.

343
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,040
And then I left the bathroom and like a cop came and they brought me to my parents.

344
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,160
And it's not how like in the real story, like somebody found me in the bathroom with like

345
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,560
blood on my neck and like choke marks and crying and sobbing and like brought and found

346
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,360
my family.

347
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,520
You know, I mean, like, it still hurts, right?

348
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,960
Like I was a seven year old kid.

349
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,520
And it affected me in a lot of other ways.

350
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,920
So then like kind of fast, like not even fast forward the next day or two days later, and

351
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,960
my mother tells me this now for like a couple of weeks, I would put like a shirt and tie

352
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
on every morning to go to school.

353
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,760
And I would say, well, like, maybe if I'm good, like things won't happen to me.

354
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,320
And it's like, well, like you didn't do anything, dude, like it's not.

355
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,760
But so immediately, like I, I, I must have felt like it was my fault somehow.

356
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,360
And then, you know, I think they put me in therapy pretty quick.

357
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,700
They didn't know what to do.

358
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,040
My mother actually just like gave me a poem that she wrote about it.

359
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,560
And it's like, it was about loss like, like I basically lost the little boy like that

360
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,380
little boy was no longer on the planet.

361
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Like we went to a baseball game and we came home different people.

362
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,020
And that's, you know, it's crazy.

363
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Yeah.

364
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,700
So you went from basically being an innocent child to a wounded child.

365
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,700
And then eventually, probably what people in that, you know, world of psychology would

366
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,180
refer to as an adaptive child.

367
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,060
And then a lot of times you get sort of stunted there, you don't become a functional adult.

368
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,140
So the adaptive child creates a bunch of behavior patterns that are effectively guaranteed to

369
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,300
make sure you don't get hurt again.

370
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Yeah.

371
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah.

372
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,660
I never heard the terms, but I, so when I was released from prison, I went, I like,

373
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,380
I hate to jump around too much, but I went and saw somebody and we kind of worked that

374
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,380
out.

375
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,860
And I actually went back to that same bathroom, same place, and sat in that same stall and

376
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,700
was like, like, it was, it was almost goofy because it was like, nobody can hurt you.

377
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,980
Like you're, you're well equipped.

378
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,580
And the fact of the matter is like, you don't even need to be like, you're not a little

379
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,580
boy.

380
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Like you don't need to.

381
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,020
And, and I, and you're right.

382
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,980
Like I lived my life kind of from then on in a way of like avoidance of situations that

383
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
I didn't feel safe in.

384
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:06,580
Or I mean, I'm not so sure, but I know that when I did the work later, it was like attacked

385
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,300
before being attacked.

386
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,140
Now when I get into like a playing soccer or something, and some guy who's like drinking

387
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,300
beers before the game screams obscenities or something like, and I'll be, I'll be like,

388
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,220
okay, like I'll just kind of laugh and smile and nod and be like, you have, you have no

389
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,940
idea.

390
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,780
And I hope you go home and like are nice to your family.

391
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,580
Have a nice evening.

392
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,180
So then what's amazing, by the way, about your story so far is that your parents were

393
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,980
actually thoughtful enough to realize that this was a big deal.

394
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,980
I know that when a lot of people go through these, these wounding events, which again

395
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,140
is how I sort of refer to these things as, you know, five types of wounding events that

396
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,660
occur in childhood can basically, if not completely dealt with, alter the course of your life.

397
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,020
Your parents are actually the exception in that they got it.

398
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,100
Like right out of the gate.

399
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,700
And I don't think it's necessarily because of how educated they were or professional

400
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
they were.

401
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,500
I mean, I guess just they had good instincts.

402
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,860
But the tragedy is despite that, it sounds like it, it might not have been enough at

403
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,820
the time.

404
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,900
So one of the questions I've been kind of asking myself a lot is like, what, what would

405
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
have helped?

406
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Right?

407
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Exactly.

408
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
What could I have heard?

409
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,900
And in that exploration, so I've, I've gotten, I don't have a good answer.

410
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
I haven't had it yet.

411
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
And I'm going to keep working on it.

412
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:39,740
But I know what I didn't feel like and I didn't feel valuable and I didn't feel I felt like

413
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,660
something was wrong with me.

414
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,740
And I think therapy kind of made it even more so because other kids weren't in therapy.

415
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,260
So it didn't make it easier, unfortunately.

416
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,140
And I don't blame the therapists.

417
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,500
How long were you in therapy for?

418
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,620
I'm not really sure.

419
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,580
I just remember not liking it.

420
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,180
So it might have been a couple of years or less, but by the time you were an adolescent,

421
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,780
you were sort of done with it.

422
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Yeah.

423
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,780
And so like a lot of people that know me from then will call me, it's not precocious mischievous.

424
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Right?

425
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,860
Like so I was like Dennis the menace.

426
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,580
I had literally had like white curly hair, like wore overalls all the time, which is

427
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,100
funny because I like my favorite pair had like paint splatters on them and I paint houses

428
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
now.

429
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,140
So it's like kind of goofy, right?

430
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,860
I don't know how long it was, but it didn't like a lot of good people tried, you know,

431
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,660
and I don't know what it would have took.

432
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,960
So I was like really mischievous.

433
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,540
So I think they were like, well, he's all right.

434
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,340
Like he rides his bike, he does tricks, he gets hurt and he comes home.

435
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,580
Like he's like, he's okay.

436
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,700
And I think they probably in some ways wanted to believe that, you know what I mean?

437
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I would.

438
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,620
I would want to hope that like everything.

439
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,660
So then when I was 12, I was in Canada, I was in Fort Erie.

440
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,380
We used to have a, I have some really good memories at Crescent Beach.

441
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,980
I don't know if you've ever been to Crescent beaches in Fort Erie, but this kid comes from

442
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,300
down the street and says, uh, like nobody's around.

443
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,220
The parents are at work and my sister's like watching me, but she's sunbathing on the beach.

444
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,300
And so my friend comes over and he says, uh, I forget the name of the hardware stores,

445
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,700
but like home hardware or something.

446
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

447
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
It is home hard.

448
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Yeah.

449
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
And they had the slingshots.

450
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
They had like wrist rockets.

451
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Yeah.

452
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Yeah.

453
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Like serious.

454
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,460
And he had to be 12 to get them.

455
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,900
And he was like, I'm not old enough, but you are, I'm old, but I don't look old.

456
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,380
And none of us had obviously ID.

457
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,700
So he was like, well, you buy it for me.

458
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,100
And I said, yeah, like, and so we buy this wrist rocket and it's, it's kid stuff, but

459
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,340
it's stupid kid stuff.

460
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,500
So we get like a couple on the train tracks up there.

461
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,780
If you like dig underneath the stones, there's like these hard or balls, right?

462
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,360
And so we dig them up and we take a couple and there's a parking lot, like a hundred

463
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
yards away.

464
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,320
Great like target practice, right?

465
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,360
So we start hitting like cars and within, I don't know, an hour, half an hour, 15 minutes,

466
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,840
like a guy grabs me out of the window of this cottage and pulls me out of the window of

467
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,920
the cottage who ends up being an off duty RCMP, right?

468
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,040
So he's going to arrest us who he's waiting for his like, so we're getting arrested.

469
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm 12 years old.

470
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,160
I have, I'm like shirtless and my like swim trunks, the pavements burning my feet.

471
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Like I remember that like looking up and being like, Oh man, like what's going on?

472
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,460
You know, like in my feet, I remember like hopping back and forth with this like man

473
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,160
holding me.

474
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,640
And so the guy arrests me.

475
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,920
They like, we get in the car, they handcuff us behind, they put us both in the car and

476
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,680
this guy punches me in the face, right?

477
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
The officer.

478
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,000
Not the off duty officer, but the uniformed officer punches me in the face.

479
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,240
And I'm like, I remember falling over, but when you're handcuffed from behind, you don't

480
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,320
like fall naturally.

481
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,280
So you just kind of like topple like a top.

482
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
I mean, that was impactful.

483
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,640
Like I laugh about a lot of stuff, but it was pretty impactful.

484
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,080
And just to kind of shine a better light on the RCMP is like, I recently tried to go to

485
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Canada and I spent three hours at the border, but it was the most pleasurable experience

486
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,080
I've ever had with law enforcement.

487
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,320
And it was because of the RCMP.

488
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,580
So not all RCMPs are bad guys.

489
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,360
So that was like the next kind of big, I got punished.

490
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,840
You know, I probably couldn't go out of the house for like the summer or something.

491
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,040
I mean, my parents were also disciplinarians.

492
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,880
They weren't like, oh, he's just let him do whatever he wants.

493
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,120
But that was kind of the next thing.

494
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,920
And I think it was like my introduction, my like harmless introduction to law enforcement.

495
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm sort of struck by the random sequence of events that generally lead to one person

496
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
going down one path or going down another.

497
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,160
I mean, just hearing you tell your story for the first 12 years of your life, I've already

498
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
sort of felt so many parallels to my life.

499
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
And it's really interesting.

500
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,800
I remember getting caught though.

501
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
It was not by law enforcement.

502
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,520
It was just a guy on the street when a bunch of my friends and I, well, one friend in my

503
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,800
car, we're basically hiding in bushes, throwing rocks at cars passing by and pinging them

504
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
and pinging them and pinging them.

505
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then sure enough, this one guy gets out of a car and comes and just shakes the shit

506
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
out of us.

507
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,120
And like good for him, because what he basically was screaming at us, he's like, you little

508
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,360
shits, like you're going to give someone a heart attack doing this.

509
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,920
As an adult, it seems ridiculous.

510
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah, as a kid, it seemed harmless.

511
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,000
I was probably 10 or 11.

512
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,160
What's interesting is like, your experience was probably a lot more traumatic because

513
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,200
you just happened to get caught by a guy who was also a cop.

514
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,720
And then on top of that, you get the bad cop that shows up.

515
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,360
And it's sort of like, I don't know.

516
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,080
I mean, again, I'm not justifying your actions or my actions, but in the end, kids do a lot

517
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,920
of dumb things.

518
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,560
And one of the things going back to Kern that there are 100 things about that day that blew

519
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,920
my mind.

520
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,000
But the saddest thing there that blew my mind was when we played the game Step to the Line,

521
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,400
which I want to talk about in more detail later, and Kat started playing the game of

522
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,280
at what age did you have your first arrest?

523
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,040
And I couldn't believe how young some of these guys were when they were getting arrested.

524
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,600
In fact, there was one gentleman there who has been basically incarcerated in one form

525
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,400
or another since he was seven years old.

526
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Yeah.

527
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,840
And I have a picture with him when he said that.

528
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah.

529
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Like I don't know.

530
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,360
I went and hugged him, him and the other guy who had been in solitary confinement for over

531
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
twelve years.

532
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Yeah.

533
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,800
I know exactly what you're talking about because he was just diagonal to me and I don't want

534
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,520
to say his name, but.

535
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Yeah.

536
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Seven.

537
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,680
I've probably mentioned that to five or six people since even this morning I talked about

538
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,000
the guy seven years old.

539
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,880
I mean, he didn't put a gun in his hands.

540
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Right.

541
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,960
If I recall, he and his friend lit a fire and it killed someone, right?

542
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm not certain.

543
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,560
It was either somebody died.

544
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Yeah.

545
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,640
It was either a firearm or like a fire.

546
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,800
But there were those two kids messing around.

547
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Yeah.

548
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,280
One of them or somebody died.

549
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah.

550
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Yeah.

551
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
He I mean, he was an adult.

552
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,840
He and he he actually had a business running like he had put together a good.

553
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,160
It's just I mean, it's like a sad state of affairs, really.

554
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
So after this brush, you're 12.

555
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
You're now getting ready that you're in middle school.

556
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,040
You're getting ready to enter high school.

557
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Yeah.

558
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,120
Actually good prelude because that's kind of when things right around then things got

559
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
funky.

560
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,960
I mean, I was a typical teenager in some ways.

561
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,160
Girls like 12, 13 years old, like exploring that and exploring school and still playing

562
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
sports.

563
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
Yeah.

564
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,560
Still playing sports competitively to unlike a couple of travel teams and stuff like that.

565
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
I was playing soccer.

566
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,960
And I mean, it's irrelevant.

567
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,560
But yeah, I was playing a good amount of sports.

568
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,400
But so the summer before high school, me and one of my closest friends stumble across like

569
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,080
his parents pot stash.

570
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,680
And to this day, two people who his mother actually just passed.

571
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,360
But the father I talked to all the time, good man, hard worker, teacher, smoke pot.

572
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Right.

573
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,320
But we found the pot and it was a lot like it was like a I don't know, it was a lot of

574
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
pot.

575
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,040
And so we took a hunk of it.

576
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,120
And I think we smoked that pot pretty much every day that summer.

577
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
And it was great.

578
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
You know, we didn't have any responsibilities.

579
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,960
And I was supposed to actually at the time I was supposed to go to this Catholic boy

580
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,640
school or Jesuit or something, boy school in Buffalo and play basketball there.

581
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,360
And that was like it was kind of set out for me.

582
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
And I was somewhat smart.

583
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,640
And I said to myself, well, I'm going to stop smoking pot two weeks before school.

584
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,800
And then I said, I'm going to stop smoking pot one week before school.

585
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,360
And then I said, you know, I'm going to stop pot the day of the first day of school.

586
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,880
And then I was smoking pot on the porch of school.

587
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Right.

588
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,760
Like in the next very impactful thing that happened to me and again could happen to anybody.

589
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,040
And it happened very like soon after that was I.

590
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,320
And this is in a weird way.

591
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,760
It's like as a man, it's like, oh, yeah, like I want to puff my chest out.

592
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,900
But like the fact of the matter is like I was a 13 year old child.

593
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,360
And so we got we got all stoned for this school dance.

594
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Right.

595
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,520
And like thinking about how much pot we smoked is just like ridiculous.

596
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,760
Like like boogers coming out of your nose from bong hits like just crazy.

597
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Right.

598
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,080
So like why would you ever want to do that?

599
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,320
But again, I was it like I was a child.

600
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,040
So we get to this dance or on our way there.

601
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,840
I see a friend, another friend of mine who I played soccer with.

602
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,480
And he's like he's got like a hash or something.

603
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,280
So we smoke some hash and I pull up to the school or whatever, walk up to the school

604
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,400
and my school and there's some girl crying outside of the school.

605
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Of course, right.

606
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,360
There's always some girl crying outside.

607
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,040
And of course, like I'm like, what do you need?

608
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,660
And she needed quarters to call her house because pay phones.

609
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,840
So I give her these quarters.

610
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,200
I remember giving her like a fistful of quarters.

611
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,840
I don't know why I had a fistful of quarters.

612
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,160
And I don't know if my recollection is all that clear either.

613
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,400
But before I know it, we're like making out.

614
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
And then the next thing I know we're having sex outside.

615
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,680
Right. Now I'm a virgin, but nobody knows that because when you're a 13 year old

616
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,120
boy, like you're not a virgin, even if you're a virgin.

617
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,120
So everybody, they let the dance out and we're outside on the lawn across the

618
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,440
street behind a four foot picket fence or a three foot picket fence.

619
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,280
And like I look up and at one moment I look up and I'm like, wow, this is fantastic.

620
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Like the stars are out.

621
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,720
It's a nice fall night.

622
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,400
And the next moment I like look up and there's literally like 30 people standing

623
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,520
there, like watching me have sex for the first time she gets up and like runs.

624
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,280
I like I had a girlfriend at the time who was in the dance.

625
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,640
So then now she's like screaming at me and like, you know, I don't know what to say.

626
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm pretty sure I said like, well, shit happens.

627
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,040
And like she tried to hit me and then I laughed.

628
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,280
But like what makes it even worse?

629
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,920
And this is it's funny because this is the stuff I would like to keep out of stories.

630
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,520
But I think it's the stuff that's important to keep in the story.

631
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,720
So like we went out to dinner later, like after that.

632
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,440
And I remember being like kind of in my own shell at that point.

633
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,800
Like what like what's like trying with you and which girl?

634
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
No, no, no. So me and like my buddies.

635
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
Oh, we went to like pizza.

636
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah, we went out.

637
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
We all went out to pizza.

638
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,000
And I'm sure I was like some kind of hero.

639
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,960
But like I remember feeling alone, not like in a like a sad emotional way,

640
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,240
but I remember feeling like something happened and I need to figure it out.

641
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,680
I remember going to the bathroom and realizing that I had blood all over me

642
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,000
and then being like really embarrassed, but also really confused because I didn't

643
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,360
know like did was that because of was that because of whatever.

644
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,560
Right. And then being like, well,

645
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,120
that's like awful gross and like so now like my whole sexual identities,

646
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,760
again, kind of screwy rights like this is unusual.

647
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,040
And then straight after that, the principal of the school or the dean of

648
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,120
students or something told me that I needed to tell my parents what happened.

649
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,360
And if I didn't tell them in three days or something that he was going to tell them.

650
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,080
And I just couldn't.

651
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,280
I didn't know how to say I still envy people who can like

652
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,280
I see them like, Mom, my kids found my pot, you know, my friend did that in front of me

653
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,160
to his mom and his mom's like, you're a jerk.

654
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,080
Like why? You know, but I remember thinking and this is only a couple of years ago,

655
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,080
like like you could tell her that like like how do you I don't understand how you I

656
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,640
quit a job when I got out of prison.

657
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,360
It was like a somewhat good job.

658
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,720
It was like I was driving with the union driving cement mixers.

659
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,320
And I didn't tell my dad for two weeks.

660
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,040
And we're close.

661
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,200
Like we we jog together every week.

662
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,440
Like I still have a hard time with it.

663
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,600
So anyway, and I think my solution because of my history and feeling different and

664
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,920
wondering why like a lot of like I constantly wondered why me like what it

665
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,680
what's what's wrong with me that this is like that I get caught, that I get punched,

666
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,480
that I get attacked, that you know what I mean?

667
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,640
And not to like throw blame at the world, but I just didn't understand.

668
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,840
I didn't understand chance.

669
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,960
I didn't understand any of it.

670
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
So I try to commit suicide.

671
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,800
And it's it's interesting to me because when we were in the during that three day

672
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,120
window, you know, right on the last day I started drinking.

673
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,200
I like I stole some liquor from my parents cabinet.

674
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,560
I took probably like half a bottle or a whole bottle of Tylenol,

675
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,000
which we talked about in the car and is a lethal dose of Tylenol.

676
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I almost died.

677
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
I was in the hospital.

678
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,960
I mean, my recollection, something like five to seven days.

679
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
But I was in the hospital for a while because they couldn't pump it out of me

680
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,960
because it was already like in my liver.

681
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,280
And I mean, you're a doctor.

682
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,320
Yeah, you got lucky if they couldn't get it out with the activated charcoal or the

683
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,480
NAC, then it's sort of a watch and wait.

684
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,320
And about half the people, I get it, I have to know your exact dose,

685
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,240
but more than half the people probably would have gone and deliver failure.

686
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,080
And the only thing that saves them is a liver transplant.

687
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Wow.

688
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,080
I remember once taking care of a woman, she was probably 27.

689
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,720
And I remember that she was absolutely stunning and beautiful.

690
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,080
And I guess she had broken up, her boyfriend maybe had broken up with her and

691
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,200
she took a whole bottle of Tylenol.

692
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,160
And by the time we got her in the ICU, I was in the surgical ICU at the time.

693
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,120
And she came to the surgical ICU from the ER because we basically it was clear that

694
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,680
her liver was going to bonk and she was going to need a liver transplant.

695
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,480
And we sort of had a three day window to get her a liver transplant.

696
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,600
And interestingly, she was certainly cognizant enough of what was going on

697
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,480
to realize what was happening.

698
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,960
And fortunately we were, she was lucky enough to be one of the ones that got

699
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,320
a transplant and God, I remember just being so sad for

700
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,960
her as we took care of her after that transplant because you could just sort of

701
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,800
sense the pain that she must have been going through to go that far.

702
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,080
Even though yes, you could say, well, maybe that was quite impulsive in the moment.

703
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,520
But yeah, it's impulsive, but it's still, I mean, it's a very deliberate thing to do.

704
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,560
And a cry for help, presumably, which I mean, I'm guessing at this point,

705
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,960
your parents have figured out something is going on.

706
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,440
Yeah, you know, so you said you're lucky and I know, I mean,

707
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,000
as I sit in here in front of you, I have like, I've had two brain surgeries.

708
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,160
The interesting part of that is, it's like, which list do you look at, right?

709
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,680
And it's kind of something I say to people and to myself all the time,

710
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,160
like which list are you looking at?

711
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,920
I think we might have talked about that too.

712
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,280
Like, do you have a car with a check engine light on?

713
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,120
Oh, you have a car.

714
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,720
That's great.

715
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:15,040
Like, that's so much better than, and so now it's, I've kind of, sitting here,

716
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,920
I kind of realize that I have the answer to the question, why me today?

717
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,160
But I also know that I was very lucky throughout all of it, and

718
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,440
maybe not luck is the word, right?

719
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Like, so maybe it all plays out for a reason, and I'm alive and

720
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,520
strong today to deliver a message.

721
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,400
I don't know, you know?

722
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,280
I know that I was lucky then.

723
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,480
I remember I drank charcoal for three or four days.

724
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,400
I remember, one of the things I remember still is my dad carrying me to,

725
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,120
like, get washed up, because I was weak.

726
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,360
I was like really, really weak.

727
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,000
I remember having to take, what do you call it?

728
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,080
Like, blood tests periodically, like every couple days when I got out of the hospital.

729
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,680
Because they wanted to check, I think, liver enzymes.

730
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,440
And I had to see a psychologist, and I had to see the police.

731
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,560
And things, honestly, and like in all honesty,

732
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,880
things really just deteriorated from that point on.

733
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,960
I mean, I was already at the probably beginning stages of addiction.

734
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,760
Addiction, like any type of substance,

735
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,720
I don't think I did anything other than smoke pot and drink alcohol.

736
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,480
But they take you out of yourself, right?

737
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,960
You don't solve problems through drug use.

738
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,920
And I found that to be helpful.

739
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,040
And so that's kind of the direction I went after that.

740
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,720
My parents, I think, tried, they put me in countless, they tried a lot of things.

741
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,760
I mean, this to me is sort of something I can talk about for hours,

742
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,160
because it's such an interesting topic as far as the relationship between trauma

743
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,240
and addiction.

744
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,360
I mean, it is such a strong relationship, which is not to say it's a one-to-one

745
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,880
mapping.

746
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm sure there are some people out there who have addictions, who have never

747
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
experienced trauma.

748
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,640
And there are certainly people out there who have experienced trauma that do not

749
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,840
develop addictions.

750
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,200
But I've learned a lot over the last couple of years about this.

751
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,560
And one of the things I've learned is the addictions that we tend to think of,

752
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,560
which are substance addictions, are one thing.

753
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,080
But there are many people who are addicted, but it doesn't involve a substance like

754
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,360
alcohol, nicotine, you know, narcotics, sex, gambling.

755
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,560
You start to get away from the substances into these more process-related addictions.

756
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,400
And one of the things I certainly am familiar with both maybe personally,

757
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,840
but also professionally, is just people who are addicted to work, people who are

758
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,280
addicted to perfectionism, people who are addicted to control.

759
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,240
And there's a great book called In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts written by a guy

760
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,080
named Gabor Mate, who is a psychiatrist in Vancouver kind of working on a part of

761
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,480
Vancouver that sort of sees a lot of inner-city drug use.

762
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,240
And he's talked about this extensively, right, which is even from a neurobiological

763
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,840
standpoint, most of us somehow numb pain with these different things.

764
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,560
And what's not entirely clear to me is, you know, why one person might have a

765
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,560
genetic predisposition to find alcohol to be sufficiently numbing or a drug of choice

766
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,800
to be sufficiently numbing, whereas another person might find stimulation from,

767
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,680
you know, gambling or sex or something to be the thing that completely bathes that

768
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,000
part of their brain in dopamine.

769
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,400
But I remember when I went into trauma-based treatment, one of the things

770
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,760
that just amazed me was, you know, you have a roommate, right?

771
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,800
So you've got, I'm rooming with someone who to this day is now still one of my very

772
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
close friends.

773
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,880
And I remember when I showed up, it was like I was so pissed off, I didn't want to

774
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,800
be there, I didn't want to be around anybody, I certainly didn't want to have a

775
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,000
roommate.

776
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,120
I was like, I'll pay extra if I can not have a roommate, right?

777
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,040
Yeah.

778
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,760
And then you realize, man, you know, even though he and I had very different paths

779
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,120
in life, or at least on the surface, it looked that way, actually were very

780
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,120
similar, similar injuries, similar responses.

781
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,080
It's just when one person is addicted to work and the other person is addicted to

782
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,840
alcohol and cocaine, society will tend to reward one over the other.

783
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,760
But it doesn't necessarily mean that that person's healthier.

784
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah. When we were in the car, one of the things that struck me about you was your

785
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,600
focus, right? Longevity.

786
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,400
And that one of the things you had said was geared towards not

787
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,440
not any specific like I don't want to pigeonhole what you said, but it was really

788
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,600
impactful because it was like, well, you kind of need the whole picture.

789
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Like, it's just not health, like, like, health or health isn't just exercise and

790
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,880
this and you know, it's like you need emotional stability, you need balance,

791
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
right?

792
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,400
It's almost like a ghost balance today, you know, it's like, and that's what

793
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,800
addiction is. It's like, I'm going to put my head down to solve everything and kind

794
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,280
of soldier forward, but everything else kind of gets lost in the dust, you know?

795
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,560
Did you have any issues with anger when you were growing up?

796
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,160
Did that? And the reason I ask is like going back to the the exposures that I've

797
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,120
had to this topic.

798
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,720
I mean, it's well, we got a lot of ambulances going by here today.

799
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah. That's that's the that's the beauty of doing the

800
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,640
recording in New York City here is you've got basically you can classify wounds

801
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,680
into these five things, which are in the place that I've never heard of.

802
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,760
Yeah. So it's basically like there's a trauma tree.

803
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,960
OK. OK. So the roots of the tree are the five things that are tend to be traumatic.

804
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,480
So the first of them is abuse.

805
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,400
Abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, spiritual.

806
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,440
The next one is abandonment.

807
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,360
The next one is neglect.

808
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,760
And then something called enmeshment, which is when parents kind of treat kids

809
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
like little adults.

810
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,560
So this is an obviously oversimplification or a simple example.

811
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,600
But you'll see this a lot with a single parent raising a child and then basically

812
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,560
convides in that child as though they're the partner.

813
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
Right. I've seen it.

814
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,280
Yeah. You have seven year olds who are having to hear about mommy's sex life or

815
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,760
something like that or her problems with her boyfriend or something like that.

816
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,480
And then the the fifth one is witnessing a tragic event.

817
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,680
So something that even if you weren't a part of it, but just witnessing something

818
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,440
completely horrific, like 9-11, right to have seen that would have been

819
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,920
devastating. So these roots of the tree basically create shame.

820
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,720
And then that shame, if not dealt with appropriately as an adult, manifests itself

821
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,400
typically in about these four branches that we sort of think about.

822
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,080
One of them is addiction, which again, very broad definition here.

823
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,440
This can be substance addiction, process addiction, etc.

824
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,720
Codependency, attachment disorders and habituated survival strategies.

825
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,600
And embedded within that is like dysregulated emotion.

826
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,240
So anger, emotional volatility, you know, all of these other things.

827
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,120
And so, you know, again, just kind of even listening to your story in my mind,

828
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,720
I'm sort of thinking about your tree.

829
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,720
Right. OK. Which is obviously you suffered abuse.

830
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,560
Right. But what I think most people don't realize is when it comes to children,

831
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,200
abuse and neglect or abandonment always go hand in hand.

832
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,520
You might not think of it that way because you had loving parents.

833
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,280
But the reality of it is as a seven year old child, you are supposed to be

834
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,120
protected by your parents at all times.

835
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,160
Now, I'm not faulting your parents at all for the fact that they didn't have the

836
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,280
foresight maybe to say we should escort Corey to the bathroom.

837
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,160
But the reality of it is and because no parent can do that.

838
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,120
You can't protect your kids 24 seven.

839
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,920
But the problem is when a child gets injured, there's an emotional response that

840
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,840
says, look, where were mommy and daddy?

841
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,000
Like someone's supposed to protect me at this point.

842
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,320
I initially had a very hard time accepting some of that stuff on a personal level.

843
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,560
And I'll tell you, one of the most interesting and powerful things a therapist

844
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,000
said to me was picture your children at the age that you were at when you had the

845
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,880
experiences you had and now imagine how much you're willing to not minimize the

846
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,040
effect when it's not you thinking about yourself.

847
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,000
So in other words, you imagine your daughter as a seven year old and that having

848
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,840
happened to her. And then contrast your reaction to that with your reaction to how

849
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,400
you treated it when it was yourself, which was, ah, you know, shit happens.

850
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,120
I got a bum rap that day, but hey, life moves on.

851
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
You wouldn't be feeling that way if it was your daughter.

852
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,360
What's the difference?

853
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,080
Yeah, the difference is it's a lot easier to minimize when it's you.

854
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,480
Yeah, get you through it.

855
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,880
You know, it gets you through for sure.

856
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,480
So what happened after you got out of the hospital?

857
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,120
So you're in your first year of high school now.

858
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,160
First year of high school.

859
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,840
I never even showed up for the tryouts for the basketball team.

860
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,040
And then I wondered why they didn't just come find me.

861
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,800
I really I really was like that.

862
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,600
What a bum like what a bum rap like.

863
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,000
Why didn't they come get me like that?

864
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,040
I thought I was that good.

865
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,360
And so they asked me to leave shortly after leave that high school.

866
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,640
And I had gotten in.

867
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,800
I mean, I did I did goofy stuff, too, like there was a bookie in the school, but I

868
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,280
knew that he was the actual money.

869
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,080
And, you know, he said, oh, you know, I get the bets from this old Italian guy.

870
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,760
Don't mess with him.

871
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,120
But I and he like these kids had a lot of money, some of these kids.

872
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,640
So some of them owed like five hundred thousand dollars.

873
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,760
And so I said, well, just give me half and I'll make sure you don't have to pay.

874
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,120
Like I was doing that kind of stuff and selling pot.

875
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,160
And, you know, I was like pretty popular.

876
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,600
I got along well with the girls and stuff and that all that became way more

877
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,760
important to me than like pleasing my parents or teachers or anybody.

878
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,640
Really.

879
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,320
I stopped going to practices.

880
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,080
I stopped playing sports.

881
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,520
How did your parents react to that?

882
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,880
I think my my father's kind of a stoic guy.

883
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,920
As I've been writing this book, I mentioned talking about some of this stuff to him.

884
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,280
And he said, well, everything's good now.

885
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,560
Like, why don't we?

886
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,200
You know, and I don't blame him for that.

887
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,280
Like, I wouldn't necessarily want to dredge any of that stuff up.

888
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,080
And so my dad, I think at the time, didn't know what to do.

889
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,320
My dad's kind of the long term response at the time, the one thing he settled in

890
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,600
on was like, if you follow certain rules, then you'll always have like a space in my

891
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,760
home and you know, you'll always be my son and I'll always love you.

892
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,680
But you can't live in my home if you sell drugs and don't go to school.

893
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,840
And my mom, my mom was my mom took on like a tougher, tougher love.

894
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,920
My mom thought I think my grandmother had mental illness.

895
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,280
So my mom thought I had mental illness.

896
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,240
And I did something.

897
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,480
I got drunk and I got into a fight and pretty much a blackout.

898
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,960
But I came home with my eyes split open like, you know, and I was screaming and yelling.

899
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,520
So there's your anger stuff.

900
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:47,720
Right.

901
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,960
Like, I mean, I would do that.

902
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,400
Yeah.

903
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,640
I hate you.

904
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,080
You know, like all that kid stuff, which is really terrible.

905
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:03,240
But they brought me to a, I don't know what it's called, like a child psychiatric unit for

906
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,360
like, they talked to a therapist and they're putting me like, getting me in there.

907
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,440
But for a week, maybe or two weeks, I think was the amount of time I was supposed to stay

908
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:13,760
there.

909
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,120
And that was a real eye opener.

910
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,360
And you're what, 15, 16, 14.

911
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,400
Yeah.

912
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,480
14 years old.

913
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,200
So one of the common terms that you hear from my parents is, um, out of control and what

914
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,520
that's led me to believe, like from their perspective, that they just didn't have any

915
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,480
control and they didn't know what to do.

916
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:39,720
And, you know, like I have a stepson who's 11 and he has, um, he's a great kid, loves

917
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,000
the kid.

918
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,200
He's like really cool, but he has some issues with handling emotions he doesn't like.

919
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,560
And so I know what like loss of control feels like.

920
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,680
And I know what like sitting up late and trying to figure out ways to help guide feel

921
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,960
like to, and when I say out of control, I mean, like I would one time I said I was punished,

922
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,920
couldn't leave the house.

923
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,440
And, uh, I said, I'm going to take the dog for a walk, tied the dog to the

924
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,920
porch and left for two weeks at 14.

925
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,280
And like out of control, like out of control.

926
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,360
My dad still will joke to this day.

927
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,720
If I threw your brother out of the house, he'd sit on the porch until midnight and drag

928
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,200
his trunk back in at midnight.

929
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
You know, he'd go down with this big trunk.

930
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,480
And, and if I threw you out, you'd leave with a stick and a sandwich and.

931
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,840
Out down the street, you'd March like, you know, like, all right, cool.

932
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,240
See you when I get hungry.

933
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,480
Your siblings are both older.

934
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,920
Right.

935
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,320
I guess by the time you're 14, they're almost out of the house.

936
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,800
So me and my sister have been talking a lot.

937
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,000
I mean, we, me and my sister have always been close.

938
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,840
My sister, I guess slept in the crib with me when I was a baby.

939
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,440
Me and my brother always fought.

940
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,720
I don't think me and my brother got along until I was 25.

941
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,560
And I think maybe a lot of that may have been because he wasn't the

942
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,240
athletic son in the beginning.

943
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,600
Like there was like differences there.

944
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,440
And then I think I probably in some ways blamed him or maybe my parents may have

945
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,520
blamed him or maybe he felt like he should have been there for me.

946
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,920
On that day at the baseball.

947
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,440
Right.

948
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,440
And then we fought like hard, like we would, there was times when my parents were

949
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,440
like, one of you has to be like, you can't be in the same house

950
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,760
together without an adult.

951
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,240
So around that time, he was really unhappy with me because looking at it

952
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,880
like an adult, like they lost a lot of attention, right?

953
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
My parents had to deal with me so much more because, and they couldn't, you

954
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,040
know, make it to all their games because they were getting Corey out of school or

955
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,800
taking Corey to therapy or, but my sister and I stayed really close and a lot of

956
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,200
shit started to happen when she went away to college and she still to this day kind

957
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,040
of feels like I wanted to come and save you, but I'm glad she did.

958
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,320
So you're about 15 when she goes to college, right?

959
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,920
I think so.

960
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,120
Yeah.

961
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,920
14, 15.

962
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,880
I was born in October.

963
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,760
She was born in March.

964
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,360
So it's like, it gets a little goofy.

965
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,880
I don't, I mean, yeah.

966
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,240
What were those last three years of high school?

967
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,480
Like when now both your siblings are out of the house.

968
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:00,760
Right.

969
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,280
So I go from child psychiatric unit.

970
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,080
I get out, I talk my way out and there was like a wedge between my parents because

971
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,360
my mom wanted to medicate.

972
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,360
My dad didn't shortly after that, I was like stealing my grandfather's car.

973
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,480
He was senile.

974
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,600
The keys were in our house.

975
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,760
So I would take the car.

976
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,200
I got arrested in the car, like joy riding.

977
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,840
And I was, I was given the option to go to a juvenile rehab as opposed to going to

978
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,960
jail and I had been, I had been in detention centers a few times too.

979
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,360
So then I go to this child rehab and it wasn't a bad place.

980
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,640
Like I actually spend a decent amount of time talking to the kids who

981
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,520
are in that same rehab now.

982
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,200
And, uh, I ran away from it after like two months and it's one of the interesting

983
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,600
things, kind of a time lapse story is I was sitting at a table with a bunch of

984
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,880
these kids one day and one of them was giving me all these reasons why he

985
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,800
wanted to go home.

986
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,280
I want to see my girlfriend.

987
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,320
I want good food.

988
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,760
I miss my family.

989
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,160
And I literally heard myself saying all those exact, like, I'm sure it's happened

990
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,160
to you, but I heard it.

991
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,840
Playback and me saying that.

992
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,480
And then I remembered, what did I do that day?

993
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
And I couldn't see it.

994
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,320
I was blind to it then.

995
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,080
But the first thing I did, I had like $10 in my pocket.

996
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,920
The first thing I did was go to a corner store, get a 40 ounce beer and a pack of

997
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,680
cigarettes, and I drank the beer.

998
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,920
And then I went looking for my friends and the pizza and everything else.

999
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,320
And as an adult sitting with those kids, it was like, geez, like really?

1000
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,960
It was, it was like addiction back then, even that was the first thing you went to.

1001
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,840
So I ended up going back.

1002
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,280
My parents talked him into letting me back in and not getting arrested.

1003
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,280
And I went back to the rehab and I almost finished it and I, uh, I broke into a

1004
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,920
teacher's desk to steal the answers for somebody else.

1005
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,200
Right.

1006
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,080
So that was like one of those things I saved.

1007
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,040
I was just trying to help somebody, you know, in my head, like why I was a good guy.

1008
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,680
So they asked me to leave and I left.

1009
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,360
And at that point, my parents had split up while I was in the rehab.

1010
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,120
And that was pretty impactful too, because the way they did it was kind of terrible.

1011
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,920
And I'll joke with them to this day.

1012
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Like they sat down on either side of me.

1013
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,840
My mother said, we have something to tell you.

1014
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,320
My dad cried for like the second time in my life and was like, your mother doesn't

1015
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,080
love me anymore.

1016
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,760
And I was like, what the fuck?

1017
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,920
Like, pardon me.

1018
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,640
And as a 16 year old, it's funny cause you're like, I laugh about it now, but as a

1019
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,480
16 year old, I really went, hold on.

1020
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,880
So you don't love him, but you've known him longer than you know me.

1021
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,920
How do you just do that?

1022
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,960
So, so all those times you've told me you love me.

1023
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,880
So anybody can walk away at any time.

1024
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,280
Right.

1025
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,680
So there's your abandonment, right?

1026
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,280
Like, uh, um, so I got out and I kind of bounced back and forth with parents and

1027
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,960
lived on the streets and then, uh, friend of mine's mother took me in.

1028
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,200
I love this woman to this day.

1029
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,600
Uh, she has five sons.

1030
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,160
One of them lives here in New York.

1031
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Now he's like massively successful as an interior designer.

1032
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,800
Big shout out to Sammy, but their mother still says the rosary for me every morning.

1033
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,040
Right.

1034
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,600
So there's your, how am I lucky?

1035
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,520
I just saw her last week and she said it.

1036
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,120
But you know, I, she had one rule cause she had five sons, no girls in my house.

1037
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,080
Like you can pretty much do anything.

1038
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,840
I mean, this woman went to work every day and she would come home in her uniform,

1039
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,480
make dinner for five boys, six boys, clean the whole house and fall asleep in her.

1040
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,960
She delivers the mail in her uniform and get up and go to work.

1041
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,280
Right.

1042
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,680
Like, but she, she said, she cried and said, like, I need you to go.

1043
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,640
You keep bringing girls in my house.

1044
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,480
I think we had a girl in the attic for like three days or something.

1045
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,360
Her father came.

1046
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,280
It was a mess.

1047
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:48,000
And then I ended up in the clutches of like a predator, a 15 or 16, something

1048
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,360
like the right around there.

1049
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,880
And this happened to be a friend of mine's father.

1050
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,400
Right.

1051
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,200
So I mean, and he was like the cool dad, you know, like he was like,

1052
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,760
he had been to prison and he was like, Oh, you can stay with me.

1053
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,560
And like my son will stay there too.

1054
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,680
And, uh, it's, I don't even like to talk about it.

1055
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,840
Right.

1056
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,800
But he, I remember I still hadn't done any real drugs, just alcohol and tobacco.

1057
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,360
And one night we were all playing cards and my friend went to bed and he says,

1058
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,320
do you ever do cocaine?

1059
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,040
No.

1060
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,960
And he's do you want to like kind of?

1061
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,680
Yeah, sure.

1062
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:24,120
And so he like, within a few weeks he had me selling cocaine in like a bar.

1063
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:29,040
I had dropped out of any schooling I was in, you know, he gave me the keys to the

1064
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,160
car, he gave me a day job in his deli.

1065
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,600
I mean, it only lasts so long for an adult to like work a job and sell drugs at night.

1066
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,000
And you know, and I was 16.

1067
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,560
So within a short period of time, I was like really worn out and really sick.

1068
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,760
And then, you know, like he, one night it was just me and him.

1069
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,320
And then like I said, it was like a really comfortable situation.

1070
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,480
He had made it that way and then it wasn't.

1071
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
And it was really, really uncomfortable, but I had nowhere to go at this point.

1072
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,880
And I had no, none of my own money or anything.

1073
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,640
Cause it's kind of like, this is an ugly term, but it's kind of like pimping somebody.

1074
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,960
It's like, here's everything you need in life, but none of it's yours.

1075
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,240
Right.

1076
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,000
As soon as you walk out the door, you're done.

1077
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,000
And I think people do that in relationships and whatever else.

1078
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,200
So there was nights, there was a lot of nights where I was like 16 and we'd go

1079
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,400
out drinking and we'd be looking for girls, but I knew what he was like hoping

1080
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,560
for and I would just be like, I'm staying out.

1081
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,040
And so it'd be four or five, six, and I'd be walking around the street until

1082
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,200
I thought he'd be asleep.

1083
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,840
And then I found out that like creepy dudes are on the street too.

1084
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,560
You know, like I remember the first time.

1085
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,120
If you've never like walked the street as a teenager late, like early in the

1086
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,760
morning type stuff, like you wouldn't know this, but creepy dads and minivans

1087
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,400
will ask you where the party is.

1088
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,760
Right.

1089
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,440
And like the first time I was like, Oh, there's like a party down, you know, and

1090
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,720
I didn't know like what they need.

1091
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,360
Like looking back at the dude was probably like, you fucking idiot.

1092
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,280
Like, but in those situations, I had the courage to tell somebody like,

1093
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,520
get the fuck away from me.

1094
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,320
But in a closed room in a house, like I didn't, and that affected me beyond

1095
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,160
measure, like it's just sort of amazing to me, this, the consistency in this

1096
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,960
idea that predators have like a sixth sense for wounded kids.

1097
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,200
They have like wounded child antenna.

1098
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,120
If you remember any of the sorted details from the, the Catholic church scandal.

1099
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,600
I mean, the one theme that was relatively consistent there, because there

1100
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,080
was the ubiquity of the priests that were molesting these kids was unprecedented.

1101
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,520
But it's like, they always managed to pick the kid that didn't have a dad or

1102
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,160
that was living in a broken home or who there was always some problem.

1103
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,880
And it's, um, it's really, it makes it that much more infuriating.

1104
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,920
They've got like this discernment.

1105
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,640
They can look at a person and realize that this is a person that could be exploited.

1106
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,320
You give them something attention.

1107
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,280
Typically, yeah.

1108
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,240
Could be money.

1109
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,200
It could be something like that.

1110
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,560
You give them something that they are missing and then you can exploit them.

1111
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:09,280
And it's, uh, it's such a, it's got so, so painful to watch.

1112
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,040
Yeah.

1113
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,880
You know, the more I've like explored it and to be honest with you, I've never,

1114
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,040
I've talked to one other person too, at this point in my life about that kind of

1115
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,520
stuff, but I, again, I think the more I can show the more I can help.

1116
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,680
And so that's like, and the reality of the situation is I think the more I let

1117
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,160
down any guards I have, the more I can let people in and the more I can let

1118
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,200
people in the richer I'll be in people.

1119
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,160
And that's all I really give a fuck about at this point in my life.

1120
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,720
And so that's why I'm doing that.

1121
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,960
But I've also realized that these people do what they do very intentionally, you

1122
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,720
know, um, and they, they do know what they're doing, like there's a plan behind it.

1123
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,400
And it's, I'm still like not the person you want to put in the room with a pedophile.

1124
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,200
I mean, like, uh, you'll see the worst of me.

1125
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,680
I would imagine my father prosecuted pedophiles for some time.

1126
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:09,400
And when I was waiting to go to prison, he would tell me like, which guy like,

1127
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,040
Hey, did you see such and such?

1128
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:16,120
And I'd be like, no, but when I do, and then I'd be in solitary for like beating

1129
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,840
them up, I just don't have the stomach.

1130
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,240
I don't know.

1131
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Children are such like gifts and so vulnerable.

1132
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:29,840
And I think like, especially in my, with my history, I, uh, I just can't see like

1133
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,520
anybody hurting kids.

1134
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,400
It's you do so much damage, you know, you break into somebody's house and you steal

1135
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,080
their sense of self security, right?

1136
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:43,240
But like, if you, if you like hurt a child, like you steal kind of their life.

1137
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,000
The life they could have had, I suppose.

1138
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,360
Right.

1139
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:46,720
Yeah.

1140
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,320
I mean, I think that's what basically happens is you, you take a kid who's seven

1141
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,400
and you, you wound them severely enough.

1142
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,960
That's when their childhood stops.

1143
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,040
So whatever comes after that is not a normal childhood.

1144
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,600
It's like I said, it's this adoptive childhood at best.

1145
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,440
So this adaptive childhood basically takes over when in reality, you should be able

1146
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,880
to enter functional adolescence, functional adulthood.

1147
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,320
There's a lot of sadness there, right?

1148
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,720
And that was probably one of the last like major.

1149
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,360
It's funny, but I sat down with a therapist when I got out of prison to

1150
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,760
like work out some more demons.

1151
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,020
Right.

1152
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,060
And you do a timeline.

1153
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:22,860
Right.

1154
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,540
And he was like, Jesus Christ.

1155
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,340
He was like, dude, your life is like a trauma after trauma after trauma.

1156
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,900
So that wasn't the last thing, but like the real, like the meat of this is like,

1157
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,380
in a lot of ways, like turning it around.

1158
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:36,620
Right.

1159
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,900
Like, and that's why we met.

1160
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,900
Like, I mean, the fact that I'm, but how did you end up in prison?

1161
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,060
So no, I'm not going to like skip everything.

1162
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,220
So at 19, so that was terrible.

1163
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,340
I got away from that.

1164
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,220
I like turned the shower on one day.

1165
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,300
Uh, while my friend was there, while his father was there and I walked out and

1166
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,420
they never went back and I, like, I hated myself for that too, because again,

1167
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,580
that was my fault, right?

1168
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,900
Like I didn't stop any of it.

1169
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,100
I like, I continued to be there.

1170
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,100
It wasn't your fault.

1171
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,620
Well, no, no, no, I know that, but in, but you're, you're, you're sort of telling

1172
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,380
yourself at the time, that's your narrative.

1173
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,380
So another thing that's kind of important is the only person that I was listening

1174
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,380
to was me, right?

1175
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,820
And I created this narrative that was, and one of the reasons I really.

1176
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,300
Believe in cat Hulk and her programs is because it's about changing the narrative.

1177
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,580
And sometimes it's not as simple as that, but that's one of the major things.

1178
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,300
Like what list are you reading from?

1179
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:29,660
Right.

1180
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:35,700
And so at 19, this is like another kind of trauma.

1181
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,920
I was at a, um, and I'll be frank, like I w I went to a high school hockey game

1182
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,300
with a bunch of my friends to fight some people.

1183
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,220
Some people had jumped to one of my friends.

1184
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,460
He was in their neighborhood.

1185
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,660
They were coming to our neighborhood for this hockey game.

1186
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,460
None of them showed up.

1187
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:56,180
So we were there spectators watching one of our friends play a game after the game.

1188
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:01,900
Most likely provoked the opposing team came out in front of the rink and started

1189
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,460
hitting one of my friends with sticks, with their hockey sticks, right?

1190
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,880
And I don't remember anything from this point on, and I still don't, but I was

1191
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,700
actually just with somebody that does.

1192
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,420
And there's newspaper articles about it, but we all ran back to help.

1193
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:21,460
I ended up with seven, I think fractures in my skull, three in my face, broken

1194
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,300
orbital bone and no bleeding, like external bleeding, right?

1195
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,780
So my head was swelling like rapidly.

1196
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,060
Nobody knew what was wrong.

1197
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,300
I wanted to go home.

1198
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,940
I didn't know where home was.

1199
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,820
And here's like the, what list are you reading stuff?

1200
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,340
My flight here.

1201
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,700
I flew next to the cousin of the doctor who saved my life.

1202
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,100
What?

1203
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,220
She sat with me.

1204
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:49,180
So this doctor rushes in to the emergency room and at Buffalo ECMC

1205
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,060
hospital, Erie County medical center.

1206
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,980
And he's like the MacGyver of brain surgery, right?

1207
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,340
He gets there, he bust me.

1208
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,580
Dad, I don't have ID on me.

1209
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,660
He says, I don't give a shit.

1210
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,900
Like the kid's going to fucking die.

1211
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
I drill a hole in his head.

1212
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,460
So he gets going.

1213
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,500
He saves my life.

1214
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,100
Does two brain surgeries.

1215
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,740
I walk out 10 days later.

1216
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,180
He was pretty surprised, right?

1217
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,980
And on the way here, I'm chatting like the lady next to me.

1218
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,100
Hey, why are you going to New York?

1219
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,140
I'm like, all right.

1220
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,620
Like, I'll give you.

1221
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,420
Why do you have those huge scars on your head?

1222
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:16,700
Yeah.

1223
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,020
Well, I think I had a, I think I had a hat on it.

1224
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,100
She's in private practice as a drug counselor.

1225
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,060
So we started like, you know, we hit it off.

1226
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,660
I was like, I'm going to talk about this experience I had with this guy.

1227
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,620
And, and she's like, Oh wow.

1228
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,340
You know, like that's what I do in Buffalo.

1229
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,020
Like I work with drug addicts and this and, and I was like, Oh cool.

1230
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,180
And I was like, yeah, you know, long story short, that's the

1231
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,540
story that I look for today.

1232
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:40,820
Right.

1233
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,060
That's the stuff that I'm like, Oh, okay.

1234
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,660
There's my light bulb.

1235
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:44,940
Right.

1236
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,180
So she, like I was able to tell her, Hey, tell your cousin, I wrote him a letter

1237
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,940
probably six years ago and sent it to the hospital, like thanking him.

1238
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,380
But I was like, tell him that like my daughter said to graduate next week.

1239
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,820
I'm flying to New York.

1240
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,820
I own a business site.

1241
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,620
Like I have employees who love me and come over for Christmas.

1242
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:05,540
Like, and it's because he saved my life that night.

1243
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,940
You know, that's like my days.

1244
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,500
My days are filled with this kind of like, wow stuff, man.

1245
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,180
They really are.

1246
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:12,540
Right.

1247
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,380
It's no bullshit.

1248
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:17,420
And, um, it's like, Oh, you should write a story.

1249
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:22,900
Like, yeah, it is like the whole thing is kind of an ongoing crazy fucking story.

1250
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,900
So I had this brain surgery.

1251
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:32,220
Um, for a while I remembered I was in a coma and I remembered the coma for a while.

1252
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,060
And it was like, I was back.

1253
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:39,300
I was back in that home with that abuse with that guy at 16 and I couldn't

1254
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,500
get out of the hospital, but like, I couldn't get out.

1255
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,700
And, uh, my father took me in after that and he was like, you're going to come live

1256
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:50,100
with me and you're going to get your GED and your license before you get any

1257
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:50,860
stupider.

1258
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:56,220
I remember him saying like those words and I did and I got my GED and that's

1259
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,060
general equivalency.

1260
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,900
I remember I scored like almost perfect and everybody was like, you're such an

1261
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:06,100
asshole, like, why, like, why couldn't you have just gone like you just had two

1262
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,140
brain surgeries and you get this like great score.

1263
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,100
Like, what did they do?

1264
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,620
Fix you.

1265
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:14,580
Uh, but I also remember very vividly walking out of the house with all my

1266
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:20,420
friends and my dad looking like really sad and upset like he was going to lose

1267
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:20,980
you again.

1268
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,820
And he was, we went to a, uh, cemetery and smoke pot.

1269
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:25,780
Right.

1270
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,540
And I remember that.

1271
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:31,260
And I remember going to a bar and I still had like a stocking cap from the, uh,

1272
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,660
for the staples because I still had staples in my head.

1273
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,540
So I couldn't have been home more than what three, what, how long do they take

1274
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,540
them out a week?

1275
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:38,860
Yeah.

1276
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,660
So I was in a bar and a club with staples and probably cause I thought it looked

1277
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,740
real cool, right?

1278
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,660
Like a, like the white DMX of the time.

1279
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:46,860
Right.

1280
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:53,740
So, so I remember some girl like grabbing my head and being like, oh my God, you're

1281
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,220
alive.

1282
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:54,420
Right.

1283
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,660
And like, what the fuck?

1284
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:00,860
Like I still have staples in my head and now I look at it and I'm like, what an

1285
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,100
idiot, like, what were you like?

1286
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,620
Why not just get a little rest, dude?

1287
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,740
You didn't even have a job to go to, but I remember that.

1288
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,700
I was like, I'm going to go to, but shortly after that, I started to get in real

1289
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,860
legal trouble.

1290
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,580
I got a couple of thousand dollars from a settlement.

1291
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:20,100
I was such a jerk that I like actually went to court and said, I didn't like see

1292
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,620
anybody do it, which I didn't.

1293
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,100
Right.

1294
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,860
But like I had to be like, you know, this was the sort of street ethic.

1295
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:26,860
Yeah.

1296
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:30,180
And honestly, up until then I didn't have a violent street.

1297
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,700
Like people used to joke and be like, yeah, surfer Corey.

1298
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,660
Cause I like really just wanted to like smoke pot, have a good time and not

1299
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,220
know how I hated myself.

1300
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:37,580
Right.

1301
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:44,380
And, um, after that, it was definitely if you like, if I think you're going to hurt

1302
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,820
me, I'm going to hurt you first.

1303
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,620
Because the reality is I literally almost died and it was by the hands of other

1304
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,980
people and it was intentional.

1305
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:52,580
Right.

1306
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:58,860
And so I think I got like $10,000 and I bought a couch, a BMW and some cocaine.

1307
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,900
And I was like set.

1308
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,980
I was ready to take over Buffalo.

1309
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:07,580
And, uh, I think I got arrested seven times that year and each arrest has its

1310
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,900
own sad story and its own kind of.

1311
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:15,300
Just kind of depravity and like maybe someday we'll, we'll talk about all those.

1312
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,340
But like, well, at least save that one for the book.

1313
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,500
Right.

1314
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:17,740
Yeah.

1315
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:22,340
I'll say the saddest part about it was two things.

1316
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,780
One was it always smelled like urine and kind of bums, right?

1317
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:26,220
Jails.

1318
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,940
And I would wake up in the morning and, uh, I would know where I was because of the

1319
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,460
feel of the bench on my back before I opened my eyes and I wouldn't know why I

1320
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,700
was there and that was terrifying.

1321
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,380
And I was like 19, maybe 20.

1322
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,540
And it was like, what's happening?

1323
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,300
Obviously.

1324
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:47,500
Like when we talked about out of control at 14, like this is like, I don't

1325
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,900
control this anymore.

1326
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:54,180
And the other thing was I woke up in my bed one morning and it smelled like the

1327
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,780
jail and I knew that it wasn't the jail anymore.

1328
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,220
Right.

1329
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,900
So it smelled like urine and, you know, throw up.

1330
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,060
And I was like, like old alcohol.

1331
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,380
And I was like, well, it's not your roommate.

1332
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,860
You know, it's like, this is you.

1333
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,700
And those are two kinds of impactful things from that time.

1334
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:16,220
And then kind of jumping forward to 22.

1335
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,940
I had just turned 22 and, uh, I was selling a lot of drugs.

1336
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:26,340
I was kind of a, in my own head, I was like a somewhat of like a big shot.

1337
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,500
We sold a ton of pot.

1338
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,980
We had a lot of guns too.

1339
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,700
Um, and our house got raided, but I wasn't in it.

1340
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,540
And my roommate at the time kind of took the fall.

1341
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:40,700
He went as far as to say everything in the house is mine and the stuff like Corey

1342
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,740
doesn't even live here.

1343
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:45,220
He just, his name's on the lease because like when his girlfriend throws him out.

1344
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,700
And so he was actually, I like a lot of Buffalo cops.

1345
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,340
I'll say that in case anybody ever hears this, but some of them screwed up and they

1346
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,300
put the wrong number apartment on the warrant.

1347
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,860
So the whole thing fell through and like they let my friend go, but they found 13

1348
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,700
guns in the house.

1349
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:08,660
Like things were now obviously way out of control, but I still had this weird set

1350
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,460
of ethics and I would only, I would only harm people that were in that life.

1351
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,220
I started robbing drug dealers.

1352
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:18,500
So like guys would come over and be like, I got mushrooms and I'd be like, well, how

1353
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,060
much do you have?

1354
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,020
And they'd be like 10 pounds.

1355
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,060
And I'd be like, I'll take it all.

1356
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,340
And then I would just take it.

1357
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:22,940
Right.

1358
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,420
And kind of by hook or by crook, right?

1359
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:28,740
So I grew up with lawyers and politicians and stuff.

1360
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,700
So I like knew how to be sneaky as shit.

1361
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,940
So I would do these sneaky things and I would also do it by like force.

1362
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:40,740
I robbed these guys who happened to be like a weird working for a terrorist cell

1363
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,380
in Buffalo.

1364
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:46,420
And my father was like livid cause he was like, these guys were monitored.

1365
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,660
Like you robbed like their weed branch, you idiot.

1366
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,900
Like they're going to, and they did.

1367
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:51,580
They tried to kill me.

1368
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,620
They stabbed me with a screwdriver, like a 30 guys.

1369
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,020
I had a sneaker mark on my face for a week and a half.

1370
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,940
Like I got beat up really bad.

1371
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,740
And then I robbed the guy because he was dating my girlfriend and I robbed him

1372
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,780
for some cocaine.

1373
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,420
He was like dating my mother and my daughter.

1374
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,180
I didn't even say anything about my daughter because at that time it was like

1375
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,660
everything else.

1376
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,100
Right.

1377
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,900
And so I had a daughter when I had the brain surgery, my girlfriend was pregnant

1378
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,260
with her.

1379
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,620
There's just so much in there.

1380
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,220
It's like so much was happening.

1381
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:31,340
I mean, I ruptured my stomach at one point and got clean for a while and went

1382
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,740
to a homeless shelter for kids on my own.

1383
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,660
And like, there was a lot of like clean periods in there too.

1384
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,700
And there was like a lot of trying.

1385
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,500
And when I got to the end of that, like trauma and this kind of shitty story,

1386
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,220
it was like, if I don't play the game, I can't lose.

1387
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:47,700
Right.

1388
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:51,220
So I stopped at the point that I ended up going to prison.

1389
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,260
I had stopped trying.

1390
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,140
My daughter's godfather, we sat down on a bar porch and he said, like, what are you

1391
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,700
doing? Like, this isn't who you are before you went to prison.

1392
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,100
Right.

1393
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,540
And he was like, like, why are you behaving like this?

1394
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:08,500
And I said, dude, like, I'm tired of trying to be good and failing at it.

1395
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,060
And I leave a lot of that stuff up and I don't do it intentionally.

1396
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,420
But like I had tried.

1397
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,420
I'm trying to like get to like the the media stuff.

1398
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:16,740
Right.

1399
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:21,740
So, yeah, I had I had a two year old daughter who lived with me at that time

1400
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:26,220
that I went to jail seven times in one year and her mother, you know, she would

1401
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,020
leave and then I'd talk, I'd get sober and clean and but without any type of help,

1402
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,060
just kind of on my own.

1403
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:35,700
And I'd stop selling drugs and I'd go to work and she'd move back in.

1404
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:40,860
And then like, eventually we'd have some type of fight and she'd move out

1405
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,100
and then I'd get crazy again.

1406
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,420
And were you still in touch with your parents much?

1407
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,380
I mean, your dad, obviously, you mentioned he was at least in the loop when you

1408
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,020
robbed the weed arm of the terrorist cell.

1409
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,540
And your parents, of course, are at this point now divorced.

1410
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,900
Are you closer to your dad than your mom at this point?

1411
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,540
So I almost don't talk to my mom at all.

1412
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:07,020
The only reason from 16 to like 19, I barely speak to my mom at all.

1413
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,780
She said when I worked at that bus terminal, I was like selling coke that I would call

1414
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,740
her once in a while, be like, somebody needs legal help.

1415
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,700
Will you talk to them and like put them on the phone?

1416
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:19,180
And I think probably subconsciously, I just wanted to hear her voice and hope she would

1417
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,300
be like, are you OK?

1418
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,820
Can I come get you?

1419
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,100
But me and my dad, I was definitely a big disappointment.

1420
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,980
And my dad's kind of by the way, that's such an interesting point as you're telling

1421
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:32,980
that story. I'm trying to imagine being your mom because listening to everything

1422
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:37,420
you're saying, it's like I think a listener will put themselves in your shoes, put

1423
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,300
themselves in your parents shoes, put them, you know, whatever.

1424
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:43,300
And in that moment, I was thinking about your mom.

1425
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,980
I was thinking about being your mom and how frustrating that would be to get that

1426
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,620
call. And it's so interesting to hear you say that all you wanted was to hear her

1427
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,740
voice and hope that she would say, are you OK?

1428
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,740
Can I come and get you?

1429
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,620
And as I'm thinking about it from your mom's point of view, I'm thinking how pissed

1430
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,060
would I be in this situation?

1431
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:03,460
Like and I realize like, oh, my God, that's that's the problem, right?

1432
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:08,300
It's like I wouldn't think at that moment to be vulnerable, to put my guard down, to

1433
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,860
put my feelings away and say, how can I help you even for your own?

1434
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,900
Even for your child.

1435
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:18,420
Yeah, because look, it's and I'm saying this trying to be empathetic to the pain your

1436
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,060
parents are going through, which is what the hell happened here?

1437
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,940
You know, because they with the best of intentions, they probably cannot figure out at

1438
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,020
this point that this all goes back to what happened to a seven year old boy in a

1439
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,020
bathroom.

1440
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,460
Yeah. And I don't I mean, obviously, I'm not saying that either to say that.

1441
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,580
But now that I've become.

1442
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,020
Highly obsessed with this topic and these stories.

1443
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,420
And this is kind of like all I read these days.

1444
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,100
Like I mean, I mean, I read scientific papers in the day, but the evenings are

1445
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,660
basically reading about trauma and addiction and all of this stuff.

1446
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,380
And your story is such a poignant example of that.

1447
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,540
I mean, it's an extreme example, let's be honest.

1448
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:02,980
I mean, most people fortunately will not go through one tenth of the trauma you have

1449
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,060
experienced to date in their entire lifetimes.

1450
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,100
But that doesn't mean that the trauma that they're going through doesn't also

1451
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,100
dramatically alter the way they interact with the world as adults.

1452
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,180
And I don't know.

1453
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:20,740
I mean, there was this movie once with what was it called?

1454
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,340
Jeez. Somehow, like the movie was basically about doing history over and over again.

1455
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:31,540
Like you could redo life, but you could see like how one small change would lead to a

1456
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,620
dramatic change.

1457
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:37,060
Right. And it's like when I hear these horrible stories and, you know, when I think

1458
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,940
back to the stories of the people that I know when I was going through these sort of

1459
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:47,420
recovery paths, you always had those moments where like almost everybody had this

1460
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:52,820
inflection point where something really, really bad happened and it doesn't have to

1461
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:57,620
be bad or, you know, as we used to try, but you got capital T trauma and small T trauma.

1462
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:02,700
OK. You have a lot of big T traumas, but sometimes it's just an accumulation of little

1463
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,300
T traumas that sort of bend somebody.

1464
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,900
But these big T traumas, they they are the ones that sometimes have these profound

1465
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,540
effects in a relatively short period of time.

1466
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,860
And I don't know, it's just it's really I think it's just sad.

1467
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,180
I get sad for you, but I get sad.

1468
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,580
Not that that's, you know, the purpose of the exercise, but but I guess that for your

1469
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:26,380
parents, too, because I can't imagine how helpless they'd feel watching someone who

1470
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,460
they love unconditionally self destruct.

1471
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:34,860
Yeah. As a parent myself now and then like as a step parent, you know, I think about

1472
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:39,140
that stuff a lot and I like deal with a lot of people who are addicted and like who

1473
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,420
one guy I was trying to help, I hung himself and it was because he didn't want to quit

1474
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,780
his job to go to rehab.

1475
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,580
And my son lives with me and I got to pay the rent.

1476
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:51,700
And I said, like, we'll figure that out, but you're going to die.

1477
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,900
You know, and he's like, and he hung himself.

1478
01:16:53,900 --> 01:17:01,460
It's like, but like for your child, you know, like I'm so so lucky, so blessed that my

1479
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:07,780
daughter is on her own, a very amazing young woman like on her.

1480
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:14,260
And when I say on her own, like she she was the driving force of any success she's had

1481
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,220
in her life.

1482
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:18,580
How old was she when you went to prison for that long stint?

1483
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,180
Yeah, so she she was three.

1484
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:28,340
And so I was up until then, I was like a dad, but I wasn't a good dad in any, you know,

1485
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,340
like I would her mother worked in the mornings.

1486
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,780
And so I would take I was with her every morning, which was great.

1487
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,580
And like I have some really cool men.

1488
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:41,300
Like we had tea time, you know, so I wasn't like I think of a lot of this stuff.

1489
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,300
And I wondered why people would still come see me in jail and write me and like all this

1490
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,700
stuff. And it was because I wasn't a terrible person.

1491
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:53,780
Right. And as we learned in Kern, a maximum security prison, I didn't meet too many terrible

1492
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:54,700
people there either.

1493
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,340
No, no. Right.

1494
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,260
Yeah. Correct.

1495
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,340
So she was three when I went to prison.

1496
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:06,740
And the impactful things about that were like I spent a lot of time with her before that.

1497
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,100
It wasn't it was obviously not caring about myself.

1498
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,180
But she told me I robbed this guy.

1499
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,220
He was a drug dealer.

1500
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,820
He told me he was going to kill me.

1501
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,340
He actually like it sounds stupid, but he like set me up.

1502
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:24,100
He paid somebody to put me in a car and bring me to a place.

1503
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,980
And like unbeknownst to me, he called me a bunch of times, told me he was going to kill

1504
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,420
me.

1505
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,140
I told him like really frankly, a number of times, like please leave me alone.

1506
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,700
Like I have a gun in my pocket.

1507
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,740
I'll shoot you and you'll go to the hospital and I'll go to jail.

1508
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:41,020
And like I this is a terrible way to end the day.

1509
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,220
And that's what happened.

1510
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,780
Like he pulled up, he jumped out, I jumped out and I shot him in the chest.

1511
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,820
He ran away.

1512
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
I ran away.

1513
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,780
Later that night, I called a friend of mine.

1514
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,100
He told me to turn myself in.

1515
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,060
I did. And I was December 21st, 2003.

1516
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,700
And Christmas, I called my father's house.

1517
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,780
My daughter was there.

1518
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:04,620
And I remember very vividly him saying, Mackenzie, do you want to talk to your father?

1519
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,140
And her saying, no, he'll be here.

1520
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,500
And thinking, no.

1521
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,780
Right.

1522
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:16,780
Meanwhile, she just wrote her like acceptance letter to college based on that like

1523
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,820
experience, like starts with that experience.

1524
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,740
She knew how to grab people, I think.

1525
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,100
Then the next one was I called one day and she said, I thought you were never going to

1526
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,180
leave. And she was four maybe.

1527
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,300
Right. And it was true.

1528
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,940
Like I had told her that and I had meant it, you know.

1529
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:40,700
Thankfully, so I got sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for shooting a guy

1530
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,340
for assault. I pled guilty to assault.

1531
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,740
When you shot him, did you I mean, do you think he was going to die?

1532
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,060
Maybe what were you were you thinking?

1533
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,140
Like, I want to make sure he does not die, but he gets the message.

1534
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,140
I mean, was there any?

1535
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:53,620
No.

1536
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:57,700
The reason I asked this, by the way, is when I was at Hopkins, I mean, it was a very

1537
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,660
busy trauma center.

1538
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,660
And so.

1539
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:05,540
I think the numbers back then were more probably 16 penetrating traumas a day on

1540
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,660
average, maybe 16 gunshot or knife wound a day on average.

1541
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:11,060
It's probably less today, but probably not much less.

1542
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,460
Call it 10 a day even.

1543
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,700
But what you realize is 95 percent of it is drug related.

1544
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,500
But what I couldn't believe was the ubiquity of death.

1545
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:27,020
I mean, I just couldn't believe how many people could kill each other.

1546
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,180
And of course, it's quite random.

1547
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:32,180
Like, you know, the bullet, you know, I see guys that came in that were shot 16

1548
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,260
times that would live.

1549
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,540
Clearly, that guy wasn't intended to live.

1550
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:40,140
No. And then you see guys that get like this one random shot that like happens to

1551
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:43,580
cross their pelvis and that's the one that kills them because it hits like their

1552
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:46,300
iliac vein and, you know, that's almost lethal injury.

1553
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:47,700
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,180
Like we'd get guys with single gunshot wounds to the chest that got so lucky, you

1555
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,180
know, like they'd be out of the hospital in three days.

1556
01:20:53,300 --> 01:21:00,860
This guy, again, medical like medical miracle, they said, I think I don't know

1557
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:04,820
because it wasn't any of my business to know, but I think it bounced off his sternum

1558
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:08,340
and deflected down, but like right in front of his heart.

1559
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,380
Never reached terminal velocity.

1560
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,660
Yeah. So there's another example of if you had been two inches to the left of the

1561
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:19,860
sternum, if, you know, a bullet going through the heart is a lethal injury.

1562
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,060
Right.

1563
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,060
Non-negotiable.

1564
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,100
There are lots of other ways to kill somebody shooting them in the chest.

1565
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:29,180
But there's another example of like you could you could add up the ledger of all

1566
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:32,220
the things that went against you and then all the times the wind was at your back.

1567
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,860
Yeah. And a lot of times in the same instance.

1568
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,260
Yeah, exactly.

1569
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,940
You know, that gets even crazier, too, like how that played out.

1570
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,860
But that continues to happen.

1571
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:48,780
Right. Did you know you had hit effectively your rock bottom at that point?

1572
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,860
Like when did the gravity of that situation I wish I had, believe it or not.

1573
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,740
So I didn't screw my head on straight the next day.

1574
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,900
No, no, I get it.

1575
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,820
But did you I guess what I'm asking is because it doesn't mean that you I was

1576
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,900
relieved. You were relieved to go to prison.

1577
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:07,180
Yeah, I knew that this was going to end like what was happening was going to end.

1578
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,940
A major change was going to like happen.

1579
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,100
Think about how sad that is. It's terrible.

1580
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,540
But I hear how sad it is.

1581
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:17,300
I didn't realize that that the idea that you could finally go someplace where

1582
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,580
there is structure, you're probably safer inside than you were outside.

1583
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,060
A lot less choices.

1584
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:27,740
Yeah, I wasn't going to like you can't you can't continually disappoint people

1585
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:32,100
if you're already like a I joke today, but I'm like people have such low expectations

1586
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,900
of me because I'm an ex-felon that like I say please and thank you.

1587
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,820
And they're like, what a fucking gentleman he is.

1588
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:38,780
And they're like, yeah, yeah, you got it.

1589
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,260
He flips the toilet seat up when he pees.

1590
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,980
I put the dishes in the sink, right.

1591
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,980
Yeah. So, yeah, sentenced to eight and a half years.

1592
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,940
And it wasn't the end.

1593
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,980
Like I slept for two weeks when I first got there.

1594
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,180
I spent were your parents with you when you were sentenced.

1595
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,860
Yes. So here's a real kind of funny one.

1596
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,420
My parents were with me the whole time.

1597
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,540
This first one's not funny.

1598
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,100
My mother came to see me and like it like the amazing mother she is.

1599
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,860
She said this is what she says to me.

1600
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:10,220
I think the first time she visits me in jail after I shot somebody.

1601
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,780
OK, honey, you need to start thinking about what you're going to do

1602
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:15,460
when you get out of here and how you're going to put the pieces together.

1603
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,860
And to her credit, she didn't slap me because I said, mom, the sooner

1604
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,300
you realize that this is who I am, that I'm going to get out and I'm going to rob

1605
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,900
people and I'm going to go back to jail and I'm going to do drugs.

1606
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,820
And this is my life.

1607
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,620
The sooner you'll feel better about this.

1608
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:35,220
And I'm sure I think she probably just said, oh, OK, honey, like basically

1609
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,860
you're not there yet, but we'll work on it, you know, and like came back

1610
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,420
with a good attitude the next time.

1611
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,420
And that's what I believed.

1612
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,900
And that's that self talk and that's that bullshit.

1613
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,420
Like, you know, like it's my fault. I stayed.

1614
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:50,820
I, you know, and that's what Kat Hulken, that program.

1615
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,820
That's what Kern, that's a big part of their curriculum is like,

1616
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,660
now let's turn that around.

1617
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:00,860
Like maybe there was some things you did, but like, what are we going to do now?

1618
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,300
Right. And so they were both there with me.

1619
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,460
Both of them are attorneys.

1620
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:08,220
My father is a prosecutor for 30, 40 years.

1621
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,940
My mom was a defense attorney.

1622
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,060
Right. My mom's like a hippie.

1623
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:14,380
My dad's like a just kind of straight shooter.

1624
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,820
He's not a politician. He's not.

1625
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:18,140
He's just kind of a good guy. Right.

1626
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,060
They get this fantastic lawyer.

1627
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,660
Obviously, he does it for free.

1628
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,860
Like one of Buffalo's best lawyers is like, no, I'm going to do it for you guys

1629
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:27,420
because you're good people or whatever.

1630
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,500
And he gets me this deal for eight and a half years.

1631
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,380
So they pull me in and I have to agree to it.

1632
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,220
And I'm like, OK, but it's like agree to this on the spot.

1633
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,540
Right. Like trials. What was the alternative?

1634
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:43,140
So you pled to assault, pled to assault, pled guilty to assault.

1635
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,060
I see you're going to be charged with attempted murder,

1636
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:48,220
attempted murder, assault and possession of a weapon.

1637
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,260
And there was a 50 50 chance that I could have won because I had brain damage,

1638
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:55,540
because he came after me, because there was a call record, because there was

1639
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,500
witnesses. However, I still had a gun in my pocket.

1640
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,540
Like I got up that morning and put a gun in my pocket.

1641
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:04,980
So even if I did win a trial, I'm going to still be found guilty

1642
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,820
of having a firearm and intending to use it.

1643
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:12,100
And that carries a minimum of like seven years or something like that.

1644
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,380
It was like if even if I win and I get the best possible outcome at seven years.

1645
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,740
Right. So it was like, OK, or possibly more.

1646
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,380
So they they work out a deal, you know, like back room deal,

1647
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,300
like eight and a half years.

1648
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,620
And like it is.

1649
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,980
And keep in mind another thing that we saw at Kern, which is how many of those guys

1650
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,100
would have never had the opportunity you even had there, right? Right.

1651
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,820
Yeah. You know, like a good lawyer.

1652
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,060
They wouldn't have a good lawyer.

1653
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,500
They wouldn't have had the parents there.

1654
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,180
They wouldn't have had somebody looking out for their best interest.

1655
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:45,620
And that's how those guys are going to like those guys end up on a path to life in prison.

1656
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's

1657
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:52,100
they need like an advocate, right?

1658
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,500
So my mom, my mom says, take the deal.

1659
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,860
My dad says no.

1660
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:59,180
And that's kind of the funny story is like so here is like the two people

1661
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,820
I probably respect the most on the planet are split.

1662
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,780
Yeah. And they're split debt like that.

1663
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,300
Come on. Like, could you just agree?

1664
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:10,220
Well, in the back room and argue and come out with a unified answer.

1665
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:14,380
Yeah. Like, oh, and the funny thing is, like, as far as advice

1666
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:18,060
and intelligence and stuff like not that my I don't think my mom's smart,

1667
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,660
but I feel like my mom's emotional and I feel like my dad can

1668
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,740
separate himself from that better and make more informed decisions.

1669
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,420
I went against them.

1670
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:31,060
I was like, nah, because in this instance, and this is kind of indicative

1671
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,660
of my father and my relationship, he was like, no, like you're special,

1672
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,780
like you're not supposed to get eight and a half years.

1673
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:40,500
Like you're somebody supposed to come in at this point and say,

1674
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:43,180
he's a good kid. Give him five or something, you know.

1675
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,660
And I could see it in his eyes and I was like, I'm taking this deal.

1676
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:52,300
So I did. And, you know, I went downhill in there for a couple of years.

1677
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,100
Like, I still had something.

1678
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,300
What was what what happened your first night in there?

1679
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,340
The first night or like first night in prison or first night in jail?

1680
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,860
First night in prison. First night when you when you when it's all like the worst

1681
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:07,420
day I think I had, it was repeatedly was like the first day because they

1682
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,100
have a thing in New York State prisons called the draft and they they pack you up.

1683
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,340
They tell you, they say, Mr.

1684
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,340
It's here, you're on the draft, pack all your stuff up, you'll be going on a bus

1685
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,020
tomorrow and you have no idea where.

1686
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,860
And every time I mean, like prisons like a new high school.

1687
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:27,740
Right. And so new cool kids, new cool kids, new bad kids, new good kids,

1688
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,780
new teachers to impress new.

1689
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,580
You know what I mean? Like the whole thing.

1690
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,380
But with like knives and you know what I mean?

1691
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,620
And heroin instead of like pot.

1692
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,020
So it's like, OK, this is serious business.

1693
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,100
Like there's like there's a bunch of first nights because you go through a real

1694
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,780
dehumanizing process of the whole shades of head thing, the whole naked shower

1695
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,300
thing like that's real like it's not bullshit.

1696
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:55,660
And then you don't you have like one pair of pants, one pair of underwear

1697
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,980
and you have no idea where you're going.

1698
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,540
Then you go to another jail and you stay there for like two months until you end

1699
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,420
up at the place you're going to go.

1700
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:06,860
And the place I was going to go was a Supermax correctional facility in New York.

1701
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,420
And it was it looks like a spaceship from the inside.

1702
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:14,540
I actually looked a lot like not like current because it's only there's one hallway

1703
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,300
that connects everything.

1704
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,700
But it looked like a like a spaceship in some ways.

1705
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:23,180
Man, there's like this huge bubble and this one big, really big, like

1706
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,460
Aryan type looking dude, like could see it.

1707
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,420
And he was like, yeah, you fucked up.

1708
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:31,180
Like, because I was just like kind of like wide eyed.

1709
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,340
Like, what what's like what's happening?

1710
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:36,020
You know, dragging like a potato sack of my clothes.

1711
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,220
And he was like, yeah, you fucked up, dude.

1712
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:43,060
And I was just like, I mean, I don't know if I was terrified,

1713
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,500
but I was just like, what's around the corner?

1714
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,540
Like, got to be aware. Yeah.

1715
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:53,460
Do you remember the first night there at your ultimate destination?

1716
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,580
No. You have a roommate?

1717
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,740
Yeah. So many.

1718
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:00,340
Yes. Oh, my coach.

1719
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,900
Coach was a piece of shit.

1720
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
He'll be here as a.

1721
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,300
Yeah, and he was actually a good guy to me then, but he was high.

1722
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:15,980
He was like a pedophile that was hiding and like told this great story

1723
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,700
about how he had like smashed some guy with an ashtray

1724
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:22,540
because he tried to rob a restaurant, but he ended up in jail for it

1725
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:25,540
because he heard him so bad and he was an ex-military guy

1726
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,860
and he was the coach of football and and it really he was like a coach

1727
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:34,300
because he had no kids and he was a creep. Right. But how do guys tell their story

1728
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:38,500
in there? Because if you're a pedophile, I'm guessing you don't want to advertise

1729
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,580
that at all. No. So they typically hide and they they hide in different things.

1730
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:45,060
They had they hide in religion.

1731
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,340
All right. Like the Catholic Church kind of thing or

1732
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:52,100
like a black pedophile would most likely be like in a religion,

1733
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,460
like a blacker religion, like a Muslim. Right.

1734
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,700
Like in jail, that's how things are kind of segregated, unfortunately.

1735
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:03,420
But and then like the the chaplains, like assistant is most likely a pedophile

1736
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:08,580
who spends all his time with like the chaplain trying to reform his soul or whatever.

1737
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,140
But they tell a story, you know, they come up with a story.

1738
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,460
Everybody's got their story. Right. And in jail, it's kind of like Facebook.

1739
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,980
Nobody knows you from home.

1740
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:20,660
You know, like what's the chance that you're going to see your buddy

1741
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,420
from like Ontario Street, you know, like really?

1742
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:27,220
I mean, like so like everybody's got their own like, no, I didn't steal purses.

1743
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:31,860
I was like I was like a car thief for the Albanian mob like, OK,

1744
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,060
but you don't have any cigarettes like.

1745
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,260
All right. Like, sure. You need to borrow a stamp.

1746
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,540
Like, it's kind of a common joke.

1747
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,100
Like, oh, yeah, you need to borrow a stamp.

1748
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:43,140
But you are a kingpin status in this. You know, it's bullshit.

1749
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,580
So how did you navigate those seven years?

1750
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:50,100
I mean, I know that it would take us another seven hours to get through

1751
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:54,180
probably everything you went through emotionally

1752
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:58,220
and probably physically and spiritually for that matter.

1753
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,420
But what's the general arc?

1754
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,860
Sounds like it went down before it went up.

1755
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:09,420
It did. I was reading a journal on the flight here of when I got clean in jail.

1756
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:14,820
Like, I kept a journal off and on for the whole time and I have them all.

1757
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,540
And they're kind of interesting, sometimes frightening to read.

1758
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:22,820
But first, you know, continued drug use.

1759
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,340
This might sound like a naive question

1760
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,620
because I remember being surprised to see how much drug use there was in prison.

1761
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:31,740
But given how much can be controlled in prison,

1762
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:34,820
I was sort of surprised at how easy it was to get drugs in there.

1763
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,340
A lot of it comes in through like visits.

1764
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,540
A lot of states, I guess, don't have like contact visits,

1765
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:43,180
what they call contact visits, where you can kiss and hug and stuff.

1766
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:46,500
But a lot of stuff comes in from guards to like one of my buddies

1767
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:51,420
who's successfully released from parole a couple of weeks ago in Rochester, New York.

1768
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,620
I still talk to all the time.

1769
01:31:53,620 --> 01:32:00,140
He had a kitchen worker, a civilian, they call him, bringing him in drugs for money

1770
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:04,180
because it's it's what's the best currency in prison because cash.

1771
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,420
Does cash have a lot of value?

1772
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,460
None. Cash has no value, really, because you can't do it.

1773
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,500
I mean, you got to get it out. It's like a job.

1774
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,100
Yeah, cigarettes, cartons of cigarettes.

1775
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:18,580
I call them crates, stamps and like books of stamps, like 100 stamps.

1776
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,540
There's a lot of gambling in prison, like football, gambling and stuff like that.

1777
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,260
And they use stamps.

1778
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:30,940
And then you can send money to somebody's family, loved one, whatever.

1779
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:35,540
So that's that's the real currency beyond like inside.

1780
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,380
There's people that are selling like a good amount of heroin

1781
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,420
or now it's probably suboxone and stuff like that in prison.

1782
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,100
And that's what they do.

1783
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,820
You know, send your girlfriend's going to send my girlfriend

1784
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:51,660
a hundred fifty dollars ten times. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1785
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,420
That's the drugs.

1786
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:58,060
Yeah, so it went down like I was in and out of solitary a bunch of times for like,

1787
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,540
you know, I didn't have a lot of problems in jail.

1788
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,940
A lot of I think the scars on my head and like,

1789
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,620
I don't know what it was, but a lot of guys didn't give me a lot of trouble.

1790
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:10,060
And that was I'm grateful for that. I'm really grateful for that.

1791
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:13,940
Did you have to or did you feel pressured to become affiliated with any of the gangs?

1792
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,940
Presumably they would have loved you in the Aryan Brotherhood.

1793
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,940
Yeah, I hated those guys.

1794
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,460
So here's it's kind of a goofy.

1795
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:24,140
So I'm in this jail called Elmira Correctional Facility.

1796
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,180
It's one of the New York State Correctional Facility.

1797
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,380
It's real old Shawshank Redemption.

1798
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:33,020
It's like the big kind of corridor, forty four cells long.

1799
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:36,660
I could paint you the picture, but unless you've seen like a movie like that.

1800
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,660
So so they have a porter that like delivers food and brings you water

1801
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,980
to like wash your body with and stuff like that.

1802
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:47,460
And one of them was a guy named Leroy Brown.

1803
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,580
I remember because of it, right?

1804
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:51,180
The song. Yeah. And he was big and he was black and he was.

1805
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,660
But he was cool as a fan, too. But he.

1806
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,860
And then the other one was like this Aryan dude, right?

1807
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,300
And and he was like big and bald and white.

1808
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,940
And so the Aryan dude sells me three cigarettes for three stamps.

1809
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:05,620
But he never brings me the cigarettes, but I gave him the stamps.

1810
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,060
So I'm thinking I got eight years to do.

1811
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:12,180
Like, I can't allow this to happen. Right.

1812
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,860
And this was my attitude.

1813
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,420
So this is kind of how I got through the first four years.

1814
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:19,340
And so they opened the doors for Chow or whatever.

1815
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,620
And we're all supposed to come out in that line and line up.

1816
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:25,420
And I go running to where he is and just jump on him like a rabbit.

1817
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,060
I was probably like 150 pounds to write.

1818
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,700
Like I have stretch marks from pull ups because I was so skinny when I got to jail.

1819
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,420
And I'm not a big guy. Right.

1820
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:38,340
So I like jump on this guy and like start attacking him.

1821
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,100
And the cops come and they pull me off.

1822
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,980
And like Leroy comes to my cell later.

1823
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:44,060
He's like, dude, what the like, what the fuck is it?

1824
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,180
Like, why would you do that?

1825
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,820
And I was like, oh, he played me for three stamps.

1826
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,340
Like he and Leroy was like, I like I gave you the cigarettes, too.

1827
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,100
But you didn't have to do all that crazy shit.

1828
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,980
And I remember telling him, like, no, man, I got eight years to do.

1829
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,460
Like, I can't.

1830
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:00,020
And so ever since then, I really didn't like a lot of those.

1831
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,100
I don't like.

1832
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,140
Gangs are really an ugly, ugly.

1833
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:05,740
It's it's more pimps.

1834
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,980
It's more pimps of hurt people.

1835
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,900
And the other thing that's really impactful is a lot of the people that were in those

1836
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:14,660
detention centers with me when I was a kid and stuff are all in jail.

1837
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:17,420
Right. They're just hurt kids, man.

1838
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,660
And gang leaders are pimps.

1839
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:23,300
They sign kids up who are scared and afraid and don't have anything.

1840
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,700
And they tell you, we'll give you stuff.

1841
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,100
We'll give you somebody to talk to.

1842
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,260
We'll be your friends. We'll walk around with you.

1843
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:31,620
And then honestly, what most of them do is they get drugs from somebody else.

1844
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:35,740
Like the leader will get the drugs and then they'll tell the kid, you got to go cut

1845
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:38,140
that guy. He's a snitch.

1846
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,860
And if you don't cut him, we're going to cut you.

1847
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,300
It's like, what the fuck?

1848
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,100
Like, why are you?

1849
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,780
I was amazed at how often I heard that story all the time.

1850
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,860
Right. We were together when we got to Kern.

1851
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:51,340
Remember how they said the day before we got there?

1852
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,260
Oh, my God.

1853
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:58,460
Attack on the guards, complete lockdown was a couple of guys that were a day away

1854
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,740
from getting out.

1855
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:03,820
Yeah, like they were working in the front of like nonsecure.

1856
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,780
They could have walked out and they probably got hurt.

1857
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:10,380
But like and I remember talking to the warden and saying, you know, like a sort of

1858
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:15,180
naive idiot, I'm like, I don't understand how a guy who's been in jail for 15 years,

1859
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:19,460
who's three days away from getting out, would attack the guards.

1860
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,420
Which it just it doesn't.

1861
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,660
The only explanation is the guy doesn't want to leave prison.

1862
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:27,380
And he's like, yeah.

1863
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:32,260
Or the other explanation is he was basically told he had to do this or he was

1864
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,620
going to die or yeah, exactly.

1865
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,100
Or someone he cared about was going to die.

1866
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,660
And it's like they just didn't want to let their gang member go.

1867
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:42,980
You know, it just hit me as you were saying that it's like if if if because it didn't

1868
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,980
make sense to my mom either.

1869
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:48,340
Right. And it didn't make sense to my dad and it doesn't make sense to people like.

1870
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:53,380
So if it doesn't make sense, like instead of getting mad, something's wrong.

1871
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:58,820
You know, so like one of the things that like may help is like what's wrong or,

1872
01:36:58,820 --> 01:36:59,900
you know, and that's said a lot.

1873
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,020
But like, what can I do?

1874
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:05,260
I know something's wrong, you know, because because if it doesn't make sense, it's

1875
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,380
obvious like something is wrong here.

1876
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:12,180
Like you don't. That's so unnatural of an act to hurt yourself in that way.

1877
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,820
Right. To stay in the environment, to hurt somebody that's going to give you more

1878
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:18,700
time. And it's just I don't know.

1879
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:22,620
So during the first four years, your daughter basically is going from the ages of

1880
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:23,620
three to seven.

1881
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,340
Yeah. And how often did you get to see her again?

1882
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,020
Thankful to my parents.

1883
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:29,820
I got to see her every month.

1884
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:33,860
And I think one of the major reasons that I started to turn things around or one of

1885
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:39,140
the things that was most impactful to me is I was I was calling her every Wednesday

1886
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:43,300
and she would go to my father's house every Wednesday night and I would call home and

1887
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,700
I would talk to her every Wednesday.

1888
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,540
And every time this kid, how long were you allowed to talk?

1889
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:48,900
Thirty minutes about.

1890
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,620
I mean, I could call back again and thankful today.

1891
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:57,700
And now in today's prison system, it's so overrun with gangs that a non affiliated

1892
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:04,620
guy has a hard time even using a phone ever like just you can't like unless you're you

1893
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,020
know, back at the prison where you spent the majority of your time, what percentage of

1894
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,420
guys would be unaffiliated?

1895
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,700
A lot.

1896
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:11,700
Here's a funny thing.

1897
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:17,260
So since fourteen to twenty five, twenty five is after the first four years of my incarceration.

1898
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:21,220
I didn't live in one place for more than six months, right, including prison.

1899
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:26,260
Like they moved me from prison to prison because I was acting up every six months

1900
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:30,300
or eight months, maybe, you know, I didn't stay in any place for long.

1901
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:37,580
And my daughter, what was impactful to me was that somebody would hand me drugs on a

1902
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:41,380
Wednesday afternoon and I would forget to call her.

1903
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:46,220
And the thing is with with me, I don't know about anybody else, but I wanted to be a good

1904
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:47,220
dad, right.

1905
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:51,100
And I wanted to be a good son and I wanted to be a good brother.

1906
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:56,700
But when it came time to choose those things, it didn't become a choice between one or the

1907
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,700
other.

1908
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:03,660
It just became like, well, I had I've come up with a list of reasons why I should and

1909
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,540
why it was OK.

1910
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,620
And a lot of times it would it was momentarily.

1911
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:10,820
It was like somebody say, hey, here's twenty five of these.

1912
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,820
Right.

1913
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,100
And I'd say, OK, give them to me.

1914
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,780
And I'd eat them all.

1915
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:18,620
And then I'd be coming back from the yard at 10 o'clock at night and I'd pass the phones

1916
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,260
and I'd realize I hadn't called.

1917
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:24,780
And then I went to solitary and I wrote my father and said, can you tell her the phones

1918
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:25,780
are broken?

1919
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:28,260
And he said, no, I'm done lying to her for you.

1920
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,820
Like if you want to lie to her, you can lie to her.

1921
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:31,820
And I couldn't.

1922
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:33,860
How long were you in solitary the first time?

1923
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:37,140
Every time other than 130 days.

1924
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,140
And I think it was probably like six times.

1925
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:42,620
One time was 48 days or something.

1926
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:46,980
We met these guys who had been in solitary for years at a time, including one guy who

1927
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:51,100
I think had spent 12 or 13 years in solitary and he was only 30 years old.

1928
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,100
He was only 30.

1929
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,260
Yeah.

1930
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,100
What's solitary like?

1931
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,700
I mean, first of all, what are the dimensions?

1932
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,620
I mean, what are the rules of engagement?

1933
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:04,860
In all honesty, I think the worst part about solitary for me was getting there.

1934
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:10,260
So you're kind of like marched through a compound or through a prison handcuffed and you're

1935
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,900
not treated like kindly or softly in any way.

1936
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,940
Right. Like you're a threat at this point.

1937
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:19,820
You're you know, your hand cuppy on your back and your arms are up and probably rightfully

1938
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:25,860
so. Right. But when you get there, the odd thing to me is it's like reminiscent of the

1939
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:32,540
abuses that I've suffered over my life because it's a very, very tight rope to walk.

1940
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:35,300
Like you're in a room with probably five guards.

1941
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:40,300
They're all gassed up and you have to take your clothes off like piece by piece while

1942
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:45,340
you're facing a wall and its directions like take your left sock off with your right hand.

1943
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,500
Which in that instance, become very charged.

1944
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:54,740
Right. And it's like Jesus Christ, I hope I don't do this with the wrong hand.

1945
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:59,060
And if you do like your head goes off a wall and then you're like and then you're on the

1946
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:02,980
ground and then you're back up and then you're trying to do it again and like it's like

1947
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:06,460
somebody slapping you in the head, telling you answer a question, answer the question like.

1948
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,660
And so for me, that was like really difficult.

1949
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:13,180
I just like I said, I think it brought me back to like abuse when I was a kid.

1950
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:17,820
But being in the cell wasn't the worst thing for me.

1951
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,060
How big is the cell?

1952
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,940
She's maybe eight by 10, six by 10, something like that.

1953
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:24,900
It wasn't. I don't know.

1954
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:29,260
It was big enough that you could be on a bunk, which had to be at least six feet because I'm six feet.

1955
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:34,820
Right. So probably seven feet long, maybe five feet wide.

1956
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:38,020
So you couldn't put your arms out in the width of the cell?

1957
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:38,860
In one or two.

1958
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,300
I had been in one where I couldn't.

1959
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,660
And that was in Buffalo.

1960
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:46,180
That was like an extra special solitary room, really.

1961
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,020
And you're in there 23 hours a day.

1962
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,260
Yeah, most of the time.

1963
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:52,100
I mean, like if it's in New York, your rec is outside.

1964
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,100
So you'd be a damn fool to go out.

1965
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:59,900
The funny thing is, if you go out, if you ask to go to rec in the winter, they get mad and they leave you out there for two hours.

1966
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:05,740
And like literally you're jumping jacks like you're doing jumping jacks just to just to stay warm.

1967
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:10,220
But like you don't have enough calories and you should be doing jumping jacks to stay warm either.

1968
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,340
The food was an issue.

1969
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,180
But like I read a lot.

1970
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:18,620
I probably read a thousand books or more when I was in prison.

1971
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,980
I don't know. I'd say more.

1972
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,780
I just read and read and read.

1973
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:27,380
And the thing is, when I read these journals, too, like even in those first couple of years, I was trying to be better.

1974
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:30,380
But I wasn't deducting that like, OK, to be better.

1975
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,380
Maybe you need to subtract the drugs and alcohol.

1976
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,540
Like that just can't be an option anymore.

1977
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,620
Like maybe you've abused that right.

1978
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:42,420
And so interesting that you say that my brother is also a prosecutor and he has a couple of boys.

1979
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:49,380
He's always toyed with writing an article called Everything I Learned About The Criminals I Prosecute, I Learned From My Sons.

1980
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:53,500
Because he's like basically like we're all kind of born as criminals.

1981
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,820
We're born like. Yeah. Yeah.

1982
01:42:55,820 --> 01:43:04,020
Like we're you know, we have to learn, you know, once we develop a prefrontal cortex, we have to learn the boundaries and the rules and things like that.

1983
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:08,780
And so I was telling him this story about my older son who's like almost four and he's

1984
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,460
you know, if he were an adult, he'd be a sociopath.

1985
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,580
But you know, he's just a he's a four year old.

1986
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,780
He's a cute little four year old who's problematic.

1987
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:20,780
I took him to the grocery store the other day just to get him out of the house.

1988
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:28,900
And I mean, he's I was just he's like such a little dick sometimes, you know, I mean, like I know he goes and bites apples

1989
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,980
and he takes one bite of an apple and throws it takes one bite of an apple and throws it.

1990
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,660
And it's like I'm like Reese.

1991
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:38,060
And you get like and he takes his shopping cart and rams it into other people.

1992
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:41,220
And he's just like it ended the day like you can't even take the kid grocery.

1993
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:49,260
So I'm that the part that I told my brother that made me think of what you just said is I said, you know, the funniest thing that Reese says is sometimes I'll sit him down and I'm like, buddy.

1994
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,860
Why are you being so bad?

1995
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,900
And he's like, I want to.

1996
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:59,940
And then other times I'll say, Reese, why don't you just try to be good, man?

1997
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,620
And he's like, I don't want to.

1998
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,340
Yeah, so.

1999
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:10,580
But then there are other times like when I'm putting him to bed and he's in a better space and I'll be like, Reese, man, it was a tough day today, buddy.

2000
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,860
It's a tough day, man.

2001
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:15,140
You really created a lot of problems.

2002
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,340
Do you think tomorrow could be a better day?

2003
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:20,580
And he's like and he he'll cry and it just breaks your heart.

2004
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:23,100
And he goes, he goes, Daddy, I want to be good.

2005
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,660
I just don't know how to.

2006
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:29,700
And I like I thought of you a second ago with what you said.

2007
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,820
It's like you wanted to be good.

2008
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,980
I mean, you didn't want this.

2009
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,300
You didn't want to be sitting in solitary confinement.

2010
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:42,780
And I want to not be able to call my like, let this girl down like like you got to be able to do better than that.

2011
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:43,860
But I didn't know.

2012
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:48,740
Yeah, I mean, that to me is like part of this mystery of this cycle of shame,

2013
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,940
because all that trauma is long behind you.

2014
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:58,180
But now what you're dealing with is just the complete morass of shame that has engulfed you.

2015
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,460
And I had owned it at that point.

2016
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,980
It wasn't even it was like you're just I used to say, like, I feel like I'm born bad.

2017
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,340
And that's all there is to it.

2018
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,540
Like, it wasn't a feeling anymore.

2019
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,260
It was the truth.

2020
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:11,380
Yeah. And I'm sure that biologists will debate it forever.

2021
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,780
And sociologists and criminologists and whatever.

2022
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:16,020
I'm not sure I buy that people are born bad.

2023
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:20,140
Maybe. But I I think Occam's razor.

2024
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,020
Well, I don't know what Occam's razor would say here.

2025
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:25,740
Maybe it would say that there's enough random permutations that some people are just born bad.

2026
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:30,340
But I I have a hard time believing that I think that there are lots of bad people out there.

2027
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:31,620
There's no doubt about it.

2028
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:37,100
There are people who something bad happens and they just go down a path and they're unrecoverable errors.

2029
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:42,500
But I think that more, quote unquote, bad people, more of those guys that we were meeting.

2030
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,540
Yeah. I mean, I don't I didn't get the sense.

2031
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,900
Any of them wanted to be bad.

2032
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,100
I got the sense that a lot of them wanted what you wanted.

2033
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:54,020
None of those guys until DeFi was in there had the playbook.

2034
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,380
Right. Or the beliefs.

2035
01:45:55,500 --> 01:46:01,740
So my parole officer came to my house when I had been released from prison and we got a good rapport.

2036
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:08,540
And and he said, Corey, why do you think like nobody makes it?

2037
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:12,140
And I said, because there's like a fear of failure and a lack of hope.

2038
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:15,540
And then those aren't like factual things and they fluctuate.

2039
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,180
There's more to it, obviously, than that.

2040
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:23,580
But like when you are in that position and you don't like I don't I don't want to be like a failure either.

2041
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,860
I got all right. I'm a loser. Fine.

2042
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,420
But like, let me be a good loser.

2043
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:30,180
Like where people like I got my own TV time in jail.

2044
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:33,020
Like, all right. Well, and I got cigarettes and nobody fucks with me.

2045
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,100
Yeah, I'm at least.

2046
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:40,020
And so these guys, they go there and like the one of the guys we were with, he he was the warden had talked to us about him.

2047
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,820
And he was like like a mastermind in jail selling drugs. Right.

2048
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:53,220
And so in here, he's like I think it's hard to even understand the risk he's taking by taking himself out of what he's like a master at.

2049
01:46:53,460 --> 01:47:00,100
Right. And saying like, OK, I'm going to try this other thing, even though I don't believe it. Right.

2050
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:05,140
And like every day telling himself that there's a possibility that this could be real for me.

2051
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:06,980
There's a possibility. Yeah.

2052
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:11,860
I think as you said, I like the way you described it, which is Defy gives these guys a playbook.

2053
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:16,780
I was going to say it much less eloquently, which is the guys know what the objective is.

2054
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:19,500
I don't want to be here and I want to live a better life.

2055
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:22,260
But they don't have the strategy or the tactics to do it.

2056
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,860
Because why would you?

2057
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:29,580
I mean, if you had the strategy and the tactics, the probability that you'd be there in the first place is probably quite low.

2058
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:36,620
And so. I mean, I do take some comfort in knowing that perhaps one of the most.

2059
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:45,180
It might be one of the only major bipartisan things that seems to be relatively uniformly agreed to on the right and the left is criminal justice reform.

2060
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:51,500
Yeah. Whether you come at it from the standpoint of social justice or fiscal responsibility.

2061
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,460
Nobody wins.

2062
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:57,340
There you can't make the case for anybody winning in this situation.

2063
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,020
That makes sense.

2064
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:01,340
So what turned you around four years into this?

2065
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:05,940
So it'd be silly to say that one thing did.

2066
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:08,540
Right. Just like one thing didn't get you in there.

2067
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:11,580
No. And, you know, I spent a lot of time thinking about this, too.

2068
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:14,780
And it was a culmination of a bunch of things.

2069
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,180
There was this one guy from Queens, this crazy guy.

2070
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,620
He was like a biker from Queens.

2071
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:22,060
And he always used to say, you don't have to live like this.

2072
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,700
Right. But he'd be like, come to the AA meetings.

2073
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,420
And I'd be like, this fucking nut.

2074
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:28,460
Like, leave me alone, you weirdo.

2075
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:29,420
And he was a cool guy.

2076
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:35,700
But then there was this other kid who was could have been me, another white kid who had just finished doing eight years and was back to do five.

2077
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:38,060
And he was telling me how happy he was with his life.

2078
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:39,500
And he would walk by the mirror.

2079
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,700
And when he was home, right.

2080
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,900
And he'd feel good and look good.

2081
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:47,020
And then he went out and he had a drink and then he had two drinks and then he did some coke.

2082
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,060
And then he knew he was going to go back to jail.

2083
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:50,180
And all he had to do was stop.

2084
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:50,940
And he couldn't stop.

2085
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:51,900
And he committed a crime.

2086
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,500
And he ended up back for five years.

2087
01:48:54,140 --> 01:49:01,220
And then there was this girl who I had given mouth to mouth to when I was like 15 or 16, who had like overdose from coke.

2088
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:05,860
She she came to visit me out of the blue and she had brought me like an AA book.

2089
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:06,780
And she was like here.

2090
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:09,580
And I'd like used it as like to prop my bed up, you know.

2091
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:15,780
And she she came like continuously, like every six months, eight months, she would be like, hey, how are you?

2092
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,540
How are you doing?

2093
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:21,380
And her life was like she was like selling insurance in Maine and had like a picture on the side of buses.

2094
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,540
And she's like pretty, right?

2095
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,540
She's like a really pretty girl.

2096
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:26,660
I was like, how the fuck did you end up in Maine selling insurance?

2097
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:29,340
And I ended up in here and she was like, well, I stopped doing drugs, dude.

2098
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,180
And she came to see you.

2099
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,100
Yeah, that's the huge right.

2100
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:38,180
Like I made it a habit to when I wasn't listening even more.

2101
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:41,260
Right. Like if you're listening, it's like, oh, I'm selling something and they're buying it.

2102
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:46,140
But like selling Greenpeace on the street in New York is like a hard sell.

2103
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:47,540
And she was doing that.

2104
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:55,980
And, you know, and I wasn't I wasn't able to call when I should be calling and I could see it and my life wasn't getting any better.

2105
01:49:55,980 --> 01:50:01,660
And I could see that like I was putting this thing or these things in front of the growth that I really wanted.

2106
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,980
Right. I'm reading all the right books.

2107
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,700
I was reading like Carlos Castaneda and The Four Agreements and all this stuff.

2108
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,660
And it wasn't sticking.

2109
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,780
Why isn't it sticking?

2110
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:13,420
Like because you're still hurting yourself and you don't believe that like you can be different.

2111
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:17,660
So those two girls came on like here.

2112
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,940
Here you go with like the stories.

2113
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:22,340
They came on the same day that some guys were coming to bring me some drugs.

2114
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:26,340
The girl who was coming to give me like this message of like hope and stuff.

2115
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,020
And she comes with another girl who I grew up with and who I'm still friends with to this day.

2116
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:36,660
And they didn't like like you got to get clean, you got to get sober, you got to go to like AA and you got to pray.

2117
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,700
And like they didn't do any of that.

2118
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:40,420
They just loved me. And they were like, yeah, like we're not selling ourselves.

2119
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,740
Isn't that great? Like and I was like, wow, like good for you.

2120
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:46,740
You know, like and they were like, dude, you look like you're kind of like torn.

2121
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:48,540
And I was like, yeah, I'm afraid.

2122
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,620
And they were like, what are you afraid of?

2123
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:52,300
And I was like, I'm afraid that this is the rest of my life.

2124
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:57,780
That in and out of here, the sad I just kind of want to not go to visits anymore.

2125
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:59,900
I just want to hide in here and never.

2126
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:04,220
And they were like, dude, if you don't drink, you like and do drugs, like you won't come back here.

2127
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,820
Like you're a good guy. You're just buried and shit.

2128
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,980
And like I think I bought it for like a minute.

2129
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:13,100
And it happened to be Father's Day and it happened to be 11 years ago.

2130
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:16,900
And I haven't since then had a drink or a drug.

2131
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:22,860
And that I think has like in a lot of ways allowed me to save my life

2132
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,900
and allow me to receive a lot of help from other people.

2133
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,260
And so I started doing like real work like I have.

2134
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:32,220
I was reading the journals on the way here, but I like started reading,

2135
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:36,420
rereading some of those books and like thinking, how can I apply these to my life?

2136
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,660
And like in those journals, there's stuff like, OK, like I had

2137
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:43,460
like an outburst today and how can I see that outburst coming?

2138
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:46,100
Like not in the moment, but days ahead. Right.

2139
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:53,380
Like how does my attitude shift before I punch somebody in the face or challenge a guard to a fight?

2140
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:55,140
Like and it was real.

2141
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:58,500
It was like, OK, like you start complaining about your circumstances

2142
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,460
instead of appreciating your circumstances. Right.

2143
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:06,260
Like and then very soon, like it's OK to do these things. Right.

2144
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:08,740
Whereas if you appreciate your life, it's not.

2145
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:13,540
And and obviously I had bad days and I had a ton of support. Right.

2146
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:16,220
Like I went to a halfway house upon release.

2147
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:18,740
I worked with counselors in jail.

2148
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:22,820
I went to solitary like clean and sober to like I still

2149
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:25,780
I thought it was like OK to like steal from the commissary.

2150
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,340
I think I told you guys about that.

2151
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,780
Yeah, like we're like embezzling funds while we're in jail.

2152
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,460
Yeah, I had lessons to learn.

2153
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:35,740
I still think that like had I not been in there for the first four years

2154
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:40,060
of my change that that change may or may not have happened.

2155
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:44,380
Like we talked about, like one thing can kind of switch the course of the life.

2156
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:48,140
And I needed to get like really grounded in who I thought I was.

2157
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:52,860
And I think one of the biggest things, Peter, and I was talking to this guy

2158
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:56,740
this morning about it in Queens was that I had to stop caring

2159
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:59,420
about what other people thought so much.

2160
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:04,700
I learned to do like some yoga and some stretches and some meditation stuff

2161
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:06,900
from books, right?

2162
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:09,900
And I would get up at 5 a.m. to do it because nobody else was up.

2163
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:13,180
And this guy I knew got up one morning and he like made a noise

2164
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,940
as he went by like of shame.

2165
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:16,980
And I jumped in my bed like I was seven.

2166
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:20,460
Like I jumped in the bed and like put the covers and I was like, what the fuck?

2167
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,780
Why am I afraid to be good?

2168
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,820
Right. Like why am I afraid to like take care of myself?

2169
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,820
Right. Like I have to be tough like fuck them like.

2170
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:33,620
And the funny thing is that the less tough I am like today

2171
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:37,180
dealing with these guys in jail, like I told one of the guys in jail

2172
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:38,940
about like some of these abuses, right?

2173
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:41,980
And he was like the minute I told him, he was like, dude, thank you.

2174
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,700
Like me too. Right.

2175
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:46,740
But like I can't tell anybody that because like we're bad.

2176
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:50,700
We're supposed to be bad and tough and defensive.

2177
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:55,940
And but anyway, I had to like learn to love to like fight for myself.

2178
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:59,900
When I was going through some stuff, I was in a place where we had to,

2179
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:02,420
you know, go to a 12 step meeting every single night.

2180
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,060
So even if you weren't, you know, they were all open meetings.

2181
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:09,340
So you would go even if you weren't to, if you weren't an alcoholic,

2182
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:12,140
you would still go to the AA meeting or the NA meeting or the essay meeting

2183
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:13,220
or all those things. But.

2184
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,260
You know, the part of the country we were in, which is super rural.

2185
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:19,620
I mean, I saw things I just couldn't imagine.

2186
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,780
And I got to tell you.

2187
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:25,460
I never said a single word at any of these meetings, you know, but I

2188
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:28,300
I took something so powerful from it.

2189
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:32,620
I was so moved by some of the

2190
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:37,340
the things that people admitted to in terms of like awful things

2191
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:40,300
that had happened to them and awful things that they had done. And that.

2192
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:44,540
You know, I know that people are quite critical of 12 step programs.

2193
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:47,020
And I don't I mean, again, I think part of it comes down to like

2194
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,580
assuming that one solution works for everybody.

2195
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:53,020
And that's just obviously patently incorrect in any walk of life.

2196
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:56,060
Addiction shouldn't be an exception to that.

2197
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:59,820
But there actually is something quite powerful about that process.

2198
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:03,100
And I have many patients who

2199
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,940
maybe some of the most successful people I've ever met,

2200
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,100
they'll still spend four days a week going to their meeting,

2201
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:12,900
you know, whether it's an AO and on a lot of them, they'll go and they'll say,

2202
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:15,300
you know, I haven't spoken in four years.

2203
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:19,380
But that's, you know, for me, it's it's not about being the smartest guy in the room.

2204
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:22,900
It's it's about being grounded in the struggle.

2205
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,980
I have like mixed emotions about 12 step programs.

2206
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:28,820
But I generally like the steps.

2207
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:34,420
And so like the old school minnow down or whatever steps are

2208
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:38,900
like admit fault, clean house and help others. Right.

2209
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:42,580
That's like the old school, like one, two, three.

2210
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:47,780
And it's funny because in defies like in the podcast where they with Tim Ferriss

2211
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:51,940
and Kat Hulk, they got through some of the actual curriculum.

2212
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:57,900
And a lot of that curriculum is stuff that's in different 12 step programs.

2213
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:01,700
Right. It's like taking like saying, hey, I can't handle this first.

2214
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:03,980
Right. And then saying, I need some help.

2215
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:08,420
And then saying like, I believe that I can receive that help and change this.

2216
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,980
And then saying, OK, what's my fault?

2217
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:14,900
And then saying, here's the things I've done.

2218
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,700
Am I really that bad?

2219
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,940
And then saying, how can I fix those things?

2220
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,460
And then saying, OK, I need to take an inventory.

2221
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:24,020
And then how can I help other people?

2222
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,300
And that's fantastic.

2223
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:28,660
But I think once you put a name on anything, it gets a little.

2224
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:33,140
Yeah, I think I guess I think once people become so anchored to

2225
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,900
maybe every single rule, every single religion about it,

2226
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:40,140
once it becomes a religion, it becomes problematic.

2227
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,620
Really? But the interesting but it's sort of like my view on these things is

2228
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:45,140
you've got to take a Bruce Lee approach.

2229
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:48,260
So, you know, if you know, if you understood how well, how Bruce Lee created

2230
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:52,140
Jeet Kune Do, he said, look, every martial art, boxing, wrestling,

2231
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:55,060
all these fighting forms, each of them has something to offer.

2232
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,940
And each of them has things that are utterly useless

2233
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,820
and will get you killed in a street fight.

2234
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:02,460
I want to absorb what is useful, discard what is useless

2235
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,860
and create this perfect thing, Jeet Kune Do.

2236
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:08,900
And in many ways, what you might extract from AA might be different

2237
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,700
than what I would extract from it.

2238
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:13,180
But I do think that there is value in these steps.

2239
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:15,740
And you just articulated it really well.

2240
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,340
Yeah, it's kind of the interesting thing.

2241
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,740
And like I said, I've kind of got mixed emotions about it

2242
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:26,220
because I still go to AA on a fairly regular basis.

2243
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:29,020
But the interesting thing is I'll ask myself

2244
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:31,660
because I don't want to ever get stuck in one thing, right?

2245
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:35,780
And I always want to stay open minded.

2246
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:39,460
And like I said, I think it allowed me this time and space

2247
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:42,620
to extract one thing from the mixture

2248
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:45,820
and then learn how to handle life again.

2249
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:48,820
It gave me a curriculum, whereas I didn't have a curriculum

2250
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:51,140
like the guys at DeFi do.

2251
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:54,900
It gave me a playbook for getting morals back.

2252
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,980
Right. Like you shouldn't lie.

2253
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:59,300
You know, it's like, OK, well, that could get me in trouble.

2254
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:02,340
Well, then don't do the things that'll make you feel uncomfortable

2255
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,980
or to lie, you know, and like get you in trouble.

2256
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:07,900
And again, like there's once it becomes a religion,

2257
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:10,700
it's like there's a lot of interesting

2258
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:15,500
just, you know, to say it plainly like weird and kind of creepy motherfuckers

2259
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,980
and AA, NA, SA, right?

2260
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,900
There's people in those places that are looking to sell drugs.

2261
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:23,900
Or so I asked myself, why am I here?

2262
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:26,860
And there's there's like one group I go to that's like

2263
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:30,060
like a straight up tribe of really cool men.

2264
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:31,220
Right. Like good men.

2265
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:33,740
And I love going to see these guys like 715.

2266
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,540
And the funny thing is it's like in a

2267
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:39,380
it's in a temple, like a Jewish temple.

2268
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,780
And it's like this group of guys in the morning.

2269
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:44,540
And we all kind of joke and it's good.

2270
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:46,060
You know, there's like good people there.

2271
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:48,740
We all help each other in life around the community, everything.

2272
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:53,220
But then I go because I like I like the humility of the situation. Right.

2273
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:57,140
I like to realize that I've been there and I can go there.

2274
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:00,860
Some really important things for me in life are like gratitude.

2275
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,100
Right. Like gratitude and humility.

2276
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,380
And then like there's a really good group of people that I can help.

2277
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:10,260
And I have the capabilities of trying to help.

2278
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:16,860
And for me, again, like the values there, like the value in my life is there.

2279
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:21,340
Like money is good, but I've been really, really broke and ate like noodles,

2280
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,220
like college kids for years and years.

2281
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:25,620
And like I don't really give a shit as long as I can.

2282
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:29,020
I don't look at prices of food, thankfully, these days, but like

2283
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:31,740
I don't have to worry about a lot of stuff.

2284
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:35,820
So if I can help people with my spare time other than my own family, like,

2285
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:39,780
all right, cool. I'll go find some guys that like have the same issues as me.

2286
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,500
And that's a great place for it.

2287
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:45,780
But again, it I'm not an allegiance kind of guy.

2288
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:47,980
Like I don't pledge allegiance to anything, you know.

2289
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:52,540
So how long before you were released, did you find out you were going to be released?

2290
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:55,380
Because it sounds like you got a lot got out a little earlier than you were.

2291
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:57,020
I did. I got seven years.

2292
01:59:57,020 --> 02:00:00,940
My God, you impressed me with your intelligence and your like memory.

2293
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:04,100
But I know I just I what's funny, you know, I was a math major,

2294
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:07,580
so I was able to go eight and a half minus seven and a quarter.

2295
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:10,580
And know that that was like a number bigger than one. That's all.

2296
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,780
Yeah, you're smart.

2297
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,900
Yeah, that's that's all.

2298
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:16,540
But you remembered it from an hour or so ago, but

2299
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:21,060
so you get determinant and indeterminant sentences, right?

2300
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,140
And like an indeterminant is.

2301
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:26,900
Three to six, right?

2302
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,740
Or one to three.

2303
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:31,100
And then a determinant is a set sentence.

2304
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:37,980
But in New York state, you can do 85 percent of your time unless you don't satisfy

2305
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:40,260
certain requirements and get into trouble.

2306
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:45,180
And I happened to satisfy those requirements and all the trouble I got into wasn't

2307
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,060
serious enough to take any of that time.

2308
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:50,980
But I think they were still possibly going to take some of that time,

2309
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:52,220
which was kind of nerve wracking.

2310
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:57,660
I remember I had to go like see somebody to make sure that they were going to give

2311
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,940
me that time. And that was nerve wracking because like I didn't want to tell my

2312
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:03,980
daughter. Yeah, set her expectations and water down.

2313
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:08,380
Yeah. When you have that hearing where they said, yep, we're going to commute

2314
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:12,260
your sentence to 85 percent, how long from that moment until you are out the door?

2315
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:16,740
Probably three months, three months, six months at the longest, probably three

2316
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:18,100
months, 90 days.

2317
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:22,020
So was there any period of time in there when you were actually afraid to get out?

2318
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,620
Terrified. Yeah.

2319
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:25,460
Like I almost sabotaged.

2320
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,420
I got I was playing soccer and it was a perfect storm.

2321
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:33,140
Like some guy was picking on some kid and like slammed him into the bleachers and

2322
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:34,340
like hurt him pretty bad.

2323
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:38,620
So you can win on both counts because you can still honor your code of being good,

2324
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:41,340
but still get what you want, which is a longer sentence.

2325
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:44,940
It's like still it's crazy because it's like my girlfriend jokes.

2326
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:48,180
Like it's my fantasy to like catch the bad guy.

2327
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:50,460
Like that's beating up like some kid or girl.

2328
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:53,660
And it's so it's so obvious based on what happened to you.

2329
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:56,940
Right. Like when you look back, it's total sense.

2330
02:01:56,940 --> 02:02:00,860
Right. It's like you want to go back and catch that guy.

2331
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:04,300
You want to catch that fucker before he does it.

2332
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:07,460
Yeah. You want to be there to protect the seven year old you.

2333
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:11,420
Yeah. I joke around about like wanting to like beating somebody up.

2334
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:16,820
But like that's why when I was growing up, there was a really, really famous case

2335
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:19,620
guy called the Scarborough rapist.

2336
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:22,500
His name was Paul Bernardo, eventually caught.

2337
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:26,500
He ended up living about three streets over from me.

2338
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,780
I went to the same grade school and everything like that.

2339
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:31,660
He was several years old. I obviously didn't know him.

2340
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:38,340
But he really terrorized Scarborough, which was the borough of Toronto I grew up in.

2341
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:44,500
And. Eventually, you know, he and his wife got caught after they'd killed three girls,

2342
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,540
including his wife's sister being one of them.

2343
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:49,780
I mean, it was the most ridiculous fucked up situation in the world.

2344
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:54,700
And, you know, certainly one of the most infamous cases in Canadian legal history

2345
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:57,140
for reasons I won't get into, actually.

2346
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:02,340
But during the sort of four years when he was at large as the Scarborough rapist,

2347
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:05,940
you know, a lot of these assaults took place really near where I lived.

2348
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:10,540
And I actually only admitted what I'm about to say now for the first time about six

2349
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:14,820
months ago in a sort of group setting, because it didn't make sense before.

2350
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,900
And now it kind of made sense.

2351
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:20,980
But on Friday nights, after I'd come home from boxing or martial arts, like I would

2352
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:24,340
dress up as a girl and go running in this park.

2353
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:29,100
Hoping that he would attack me so I could like, you know, get the bag.

2354
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,940
Yeah. So you could. Yeah.

2355
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:36,180
And I remember telling the story to like my roommate and he was like, he couldn't

2356
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:39,220
believe it. And I was sort of telling it like, isn't that a normal thing to do?

2357
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,340
Wouldn't anybody do that?

2358
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:41,260
Like on a Friday night?

2359
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:42,820
And he's like, sense to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2360
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:45,260
Exactly. You're looking over there going, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

2361
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:47,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2362
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,740
He's looking at me like that.

2363
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:51,500
That doesn't make any sense. But I but I get it.

2364
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,260
I mean, I understand what you're saying.

2365
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:59,180
So how did you fight the urge on that day to not go and correct the wrong?

2366
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:02,060
And unfortunately, I really didn't.

2367
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,460
Like I yelled at him, I knocked him over. Right.

2368
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:06,260
So he knocked him to the other guy over.

2369
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,140
I knocked him over and then I yelled at him like, what are you going to do?

2370
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:11,500
Like, you're not going to do anything. And he didn't.

2371
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:14,940
And then the next day I was like worried because this is prison and like,

2372
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:16,980
you know, hurt egos, hurt people.

2373
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,220
So I was like, oh, shit.

2374
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:22,660
Like so I had some people I know talk to him and tell him, like, just don't go near

2375
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:25,100
him. Like, don't even go near Corey.

2376
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:29,380
And thankfully, I like he didn't and I didn't have to worry about it.

2377
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:33,580
But really, it was like preparation is what eased the fear.

2378
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:37,300
You know, like getting busy, kind of like you said earlier about addictions or

2379
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:41,140
whatever, but like getting busy doing the work to secure yourself,

2380
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:45,980
I think helped a lot. But there's I just picked up a guy the other day,

2381
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,540
dad's little brother. Right.

2382
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:52,340
And and one of the things that connected us like he has this huge smile on his face.

2383
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:54,580
Right. Sweet kid named Edgar. Nice guy.

2384
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:56,660
Twenty four years old. Big guy.

2385
02:04:56,660 --> 02:05:00,260
But he's got this smile on his face and this kind of like glow like like a father

2386
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:03,140
that just had like a baby coming out of a hospital.

2387
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:07,980
But if you look deep enough in his eyes, he's like scared. Sure.

2388
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:10,860
And I said it to him and he was like, oh, yeah, that's right.

2389
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:13,740
You know, that's another example just by admitting it to him.

2390
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:15,140
It's now he can talk about it.

2391
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:17,100
Yeah. So I was afraid and there's not a lot you can do.

2392
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:21,180
I was afraid when I after I got out, I went to I went to a halfway house

2393
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:25,900
for six months like and I didn't want to go there either.

2394
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:28,780
I had a laundry list of reasons why I should go get laid

2395
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,980
and stay with some girls or whatever.

2396
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:32,220
And that was just stupid.

2397
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,860
And so and it was like, well, you don't know how to live, really, dude.

2398
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,220
So you need somebody, you know what I mean?

2399
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:38,540
And it was that like simple admission.

2400
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:42,100
And so I went there and I stayed there, but I was terrified.

2401
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:46,220
I remember like being terrified that when when's Corey going to come home?

2402
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,340
And the other thing that I got to mention

2403
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:53,820
is when I first started like going to these meetings or doing this yoga

2404
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:58,420
or doing all these kind of like explorative new me type stuff,

2405
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:00,300
whatever you want to call it, right?

2406
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:03,540
There would always be talk, self talk that followed.

2407
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:05,180
Like, what are you fucking doing?

2408
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:06,820
Like, dude, stop.

2409
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:10,500
Like you're you're like feeling feeling like you're an imposter or.

2410
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:13,460
Yeah. And like like you're wasting time.

2411
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,940
Why are you doing this?

2412
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,660
Yeah, exactly. You can't change.

2413
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:18,020
You're like you're a fuck up.

2414
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:18,900
Just admit it.

2415
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:21,340
Like all you're going to do is hurt everybody again.

2416
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:22,780
Don't line it up like this.

2417
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:24,140
Just fucking get high.

2418
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:25,140
The narrative, right?

2419
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:30,460
Oh, my God, dude, like I it's why I like cradle like new guys to this

2420
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:34,540
because it's like, dude, like I know you're your biggest enemy right now,

2421
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,140
like all the shit that like and they'll be they'll look at me again

2422
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:38,860
and they'll be like, how the fuck do you know that?

2423
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:40,020
You know, like how do you know that?

2424
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:42,620
I just told myself, why are you talking to this fucking weirdo?

2425
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:44,140
Because you want to succeed.

2426
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:47,220
That's why. So like you because you want a better life.

2427
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:48,740
You know what I mean?

2428
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:51,460
But like it was terrible and it was terrible then.

2429
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:54,940
And I got out and I was terrified and it was like, like, when's Corey coming home?

2430
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,500
I kept looking for me.

2431
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:59,300
So what about that day you went to the this is one of the first stories

2432
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,660
that I remember you telling that day is your first day out, out, out.

2433
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:06,220
You know, you got to report to the parole officer the next morning

2434
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:08,620
at eight o'clock in the morning. What happens?

2435
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:13,220
So really, again, with the this is that kind of duality situation,

2436
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:15,780
the wind at my back and the crazy situations, right?

2437
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:21,140
So my mother picks me up and kind of show you the time.

2438
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,220
She had a bunch of CDs, like brought CDs.

2439
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:25,940
Like, what do you want to listen to? Right.

2440
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:27,820
So she brings me to Buffalo.

2441
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:30,140
And the first thing I have to do is check in with parole.

2442
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:32,180
Like I'm here. I'm in Buffalo.

2443
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:34,580
So Google dolls. Yeah.

2444
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,900
Buffalo. Yeah.

2445
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:39,220
Yes, that's the first CD I want to listen to the Google dolls

2446
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:42,500
on the 4th of July in front of the jail.

2447
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,180
They did a big concert in front of the jail.

2448
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:45,940
4th of July. Don't worry. Yeah.

2449
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:48,300
And I like watch the fireworks and listen to it. Yeah.

2450
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,180
2004, maybe or three.

2451
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:53,980
So we go to parole and I walk in and I have to check in.

2452
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:57,500
And then the way parole works is your parole officer works on a specific day,

2453
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:59,420
whether that's the day you got out or not.

2454
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:00,900
You still have to go there, right?

2455
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:04,260
You may not see your parole officer, but you're going to see a parole officer

2456
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:06,140
and they're going to give you stipulations.

2457
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:08,860
They're going to give you a day and time to come.

2458
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,420
So I check in with this parole officer and he's like a

2459
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:15,820
large athletic built black guy, right?

2460
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:19,380
And I'm looking at him and not the situation you want to stare anybody

2461
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:22,820
in the face, right? Like and I'm staring him right in the face.

2462
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:27,420
And he's like, like he gives me this look and he's like, like, what's up, dude?

2463
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:29,860
And I'm like, I'm sorry, man. Like, I don't know.

2464
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,020
You just look familiar.

2465
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:33,620
Not the thing you want to say to your parole officer, too. Right.

2466
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:34,740
Like, yeah, I know you. Yeah.

2467
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:36,180
I visited your daughter before.

2468
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:37,940
Like, just not where you want to be.

2469
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:40,740
But I don't know why I'm like stepping on my tongue either. Right.

2470
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,820
And because something else was pushing me forward, right?

2471
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:46,900
That wind at my back and he he looks at me and he's like, well,

2472
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:50,260
would you play sports? And I was like, yeah, but I've been in jail for eight years.

2473
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:53,020
So like I like I don't know how I would know you from sports.

2474
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:56,380
And he was like, hold on, like Corey McCarthy.

2475
02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:00,780
And I'm like, yeah, like, oh, shit, Kelly, like Funderbird.

2476
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:04,540
So it's he worked in that childhood rehab. Right.

2477
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:06,740
He brought us to A&M meetings.

2478
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:11,660
He like this dude actually taught me a lot about hygiene as a 16 year old kid.

2479
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:15,220
Right. Like, or a 15 or 14 year old kid. Right. I remember that.

2480
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:18,380
He's like because there were some dirty kids and he brought us all in a room

2481
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:22,660
and he like taught us all about hygiene and how to be like hygienic.

2482
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:27,540
And he's still bringing kids to meetings from that childhood rehab.

2483
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:30,140
But he he looked me in the face and he was like, oh, man.

2484
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:31,940
And it was funny because he says, all right.

2485
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:33,420
So I guess you relapsed.

2486
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:35,420
And I was like, well, a little bit, you know.

2487
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:39,660
And he said, he said, dude, as long as you as long as you stay clean,

2488
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:42,260
this shit will be a breeze like you won't have any problem.

2489
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:47,060
And not everybody like going back, not everybody gets that day. Right.

2490
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,500
Like that's nobody's day, really.

2491
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:53,220
Like that doesn't happen to everybody where it's a familiar face and he's kind.

2492
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,220
And he says, like, you can do this. Right.

2493
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:58,020
I mean, then I went to breakfast with my mother

2494
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:01,740
and then I picked my daughter from school for the first time ever.

2495
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:03,380
And then we went to ten years old.

2496
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,580
Eleven. Eleven. Yeah, she's eleven years old.

2497
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:09,180
And, you know,

2498
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:13,140
were you able to keep it together when you know, I mean, no,

2499
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:17,540
I wrote her school a lot, too, for copies of her report cards

2500
02:10:17,540 --> 02:10:21,020
and to see how she was doing and to see what I could do, if anything.

2501
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:22,660
And it was really embarrassing.

2502
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:25,780
But at the same time, it was like, well, like you got to try anything. Right.

2503
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:29,340
So like I knew some of the people that were teachers there.

2504
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:32,900
And like one of her favorite teachers was that woman who says the rosary

2505
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:36,500
for me sister and like, I mean, that's Buffalo, too. Right.

2506
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,500
But small town stuff. But

2507
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:41,660
yeah, I couldn't keep it together.

2508
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:45,540
Did I wanted to take her to school fucking six years ago?

2509
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,300
And I never could.

2510
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:49,300
So no, I wasn't able to keep it together.

2511
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:53,620
But she was happy, you know, and she wasn't afraid or nervous.

2512
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:55,940
She may have been nervous.

2513
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:58,300
That's her story to tell.

2514
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:02,060
Yeah. But that was that was I mean, that was pretty much my first day.

2515
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:06,140
And I checked in at the halfway house and I remember I couldn't sleep on a bed.

2516
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:09,980
I couldn't sleep on a bed for a couple of months because it was too soft.

2517
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:12,820
Like a mattress was too soft.

2518
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:15,660
Felt like I was falling on that every time I turned.

2519
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,260
So I slept on the floor.

2520
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:20,340
How long? Probably three months.

2521
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:22,460
It was just more comfortable.

2522
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:25,540
Are there any other habits that have kind of stayed with you or anything?

2523
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:28,380
Absolutely. So that fear

2524
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:31,340
when I got arrested, when I was 12,

2525
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:38,420
I continuously cracked every bone in my body in the cell, like my wrist, my my knuckles, my neck, my knees, my ankles.

2526
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:41,860
And I still crack my neck kind of repetitively.

2527
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:43,980
And I think that's from that.

2528
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:46,620
And I also.

2529
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:50,260
How I battled that fear was I talked to some people about it.

2530
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:51,780
They told me it was normal.

2531
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:54,420
They told me it'd be more abnormal if I didn't have that fear.

2532
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:58,860
But then they also told me, well, like you've been home a couple of months

2533
02:11:58,860 --> 02:12:03,580
and you were in jail and everything was going well, like why don't you just keep doing those things?

2534
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:08,100
And so today I still do pull ups, dips and push ups on a regular basis.

2535
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:10,180
I still run on a regular basis.

2536
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:14,020
I still get up in the morning and take time to like take time.

2537
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:17,620
Right. Like whether it's stretching or yoga or meditation,

2538
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:22,100
I still try to read instead of watch TV.

2539
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:25,100
I still try to help people and to listen to people.

2540
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:28,660
Like those things got me through those last three and a half years.

2541
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:31,460
And have gotten me through the past seven years.

2542
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,460
And I mean, to like.

2543
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:37,380
You know, like I have employees and you know what I mean?

2544
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:40,780
Like so. I mean, when we arrived at Kern,

2545
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:46,020
it was kind of an interesting situation because you meet him, Devin, Jason,

2546
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:51,340
like we kind of went up on our own and we got there a few hours ahead of the whole bus of volunteers.

2547
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:56,180
And in many ways, that was kind of amazing because they had to improvise.

2548
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:58,700
You know, they weren't going to start the program until everybody showed up.

2549
02:12:58,700 --> 02:13:01,780
And so it was like we did a bunch of stuff.

2550
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:06,260
But one of them was you kind of getting up and just really briefly telling guys

2551
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,420
a little bit about yourself.

2552
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:11,940
And it was it was amazing to watch the faces of everybody.

2553
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:16,140
As you said, hey, look, today I run a small company.

2554
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:20,500
I've got this many employees were busier than I could ever dream of being.

2555
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,300
We're turning away people.

2556
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:26,220
I mean, it was just these guys were looking at you like, really?

2557
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:27,980
How is that possible, man?

2558
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:31,260
Like it seems so far from where they were in that moment.

2559
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:34,100
But yet you being able to explain

2560
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:40,380
what you did and how you got there is infinitely more interesting and relevant

2561
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:44,220
than, you know, me standing up there saying whatever the hell.

2562
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:47,820
You know, Kat was like, yeah, just tell them what to eat or some shit like that.

2563
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:53,300
And I'm like, Kat, I'm not going to fucking stand up there and talk about nutrition with these guys.

2564
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:57,460
Like it just strikes me as like the fucking least interesting thing to talk about.

2565
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:58,820
Right.

2566
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:00,860
But.

2567
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:05,740
I mean, was there a point when you stopped feeling like an imposter

2568
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:10,500
and stopped feeling like a bad person and realized that all the good stuff in your life today,

2569
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:13,780
your daughter, the relationship you have with your parents,

2570
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:20,140
your girlfriend, your employees, like the people you are helping, like all of this stuff.

2571
02:14:20,140 --> 02:14:22,060
You're not going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be gone.

2572
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:23,500
You know.

2573
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:28,500
There's not someone around the corner waiting to fuck you over.

2574
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:31,540
Yeah, I'm not worried about anybody else.

2575
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:33,700
I don't even know, like literally as a person.

2576
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:36,780
No, I know. There's no dark force that's going to like.

2577
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:37,940
No, I think so.

2578
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:43,620
So bringing it right back to Kern, one of the last exercises we did not even step to the line.

2579
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:47,500
Right. But the one where we kind of gave a blessing and asked and like forgiveness.

2580
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:48,500
Yeah. Right.

2581
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:53,100
You know, I feel bad for a lot of things I've done in life, but the most is like my daughter.

2582
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:54,980
Like leaving my daughter. Right.

2583
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,180
And there's days I cry about that today.

2584
02:14:57,220 --> 02:15:04,180
You know, like if I start thinking about it and like how beautiful she is and like I like she deserved fucking better.

2585
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:11,940
Right. Like that. So there's no matter how good today's is like that kid deserved a father when she was three to when she was 11.

2586
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:16,500
But it's more like there's moments.

2587
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:19,220
There's a lot of moments where I'm like that.

2588
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,500
Like I do deserve this.

2589
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,460
I've worked for this.

2590
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,300
This is nice.

2591
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:23,140
This is good.

2592
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:24,260
And I deserve it.

2593
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:34,540
Right. And I deserve there was a moment where I realized like I deserve somebody that will support me as in a relationship and like as opposed to like somebody else is a gift to me.

2594
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,100
No, no, no.

2595
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,540
Like I'm I bring shit to the table today.

2596
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:40,060
Right. Like in all areas of my life.

2597
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:41,140
And I see that.

2598
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:43,940
But it's more moments than it is all the time.

2599
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:48,460
And there's still moments where I'm like, I don't deserve this.

2600
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,860
And like moments where I.

2601
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:58,540
Where like, you know, I still doubt myself, you know, it's it's kind of like the sliding scale, right?

2602
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:01,820
Like so those moments have gotten smaller.

2603
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:07,300
The ones where I doubt myself and like all that self talk, like I barely ever hear that shit anymore.

2604
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:10,740
And now what I hear is like, no, like you deserve it.

2605
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:11,740
You've worked hard.

2606
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:16,900
You've gotten a lot of fucking gifts and you've had a lot of support that other people don't have.

2607
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:23,740
So maybe you should try to support some other people, you know, maybe you should try to get some people there to, you know, pay it forward.

2608
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:29,020
But yeah, like I know I feel like that voice has really gone away.

2609
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,420
What was the hardest thing for you when we were at Kern?

2610
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:42,380
And I my girlfriend and I, we we lost a baby like she was pregnant.

2611
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:44,060
You know, it's funny.

2612
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:45,260
Minimize, right?

2613
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:50,140
Like it wasn't like a baby that I like I had, but I had it in my head.

2614
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:58,540
Right. And once I believed it, I like, you know, I was in California at Dev's house, like on a surfing trip and like looking at like clothes and shit.

2615
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:00,140
And I knew it was going to be a girl.

2616
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:05,860
And and I as a man or as me or whatever, I pushed it to the back of my head.

2617
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:12,420
I tried to be strong for her and I just kind of went to work and and they asked if you had lost a child.

2618
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:16,460
And it like it fucking shook my my socks.

2619
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:19,060
You know, I was like, Jesus Christ, like I lost it like I did.

2620
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:23,500
I lost what I thought I had, you know, and that hurt.

2621
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,460
And that was hard.

2622
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:26,900
And then the forgiving myself for my daughter.

2623
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:30,260
Those were the two, I think hardest things for me there.

2624
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:32,500
Yeah, that was.

2625
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:35,700
I know Kat was sort of looking out for me that day.

2626
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:38,780
She really deliberately paired me with somebody there who

2627
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:46,860
she knew that what he and I would sort of share in that moment of what we what was our biggest.

2628
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:48,300
What is our biggest regret?

2629
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:49,980
What is the thing we are most ashamed of?

2630
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:55,900
And what is the thing that we want forgiveness for the most that he and I would have such a strong overlap there?

2631
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:59,420
I couldn't believe that experience.

2632
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:04,260
I don't want to use his name, I guess, just to protect his privacy.

2633
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:08,580
But I think about him every day and I think about, you know, like,

2634
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:12,300
you know, I even called Kat a while ago and I was like, can I just send him money?

2635
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:16,860
Like, I want him to be able to buy stuff easily and not have to frickin trade cigarettes and shit.

2636
02:18:16,860 --> 02:18:19,500
And she's like, no, volunteers aren't allowed to send money.

2637
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:24,740
And, you know, I just and it's like he's the one.

2638
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:27,860
So, of course, is he the only guy in that room that was that special?

2639
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:31,820
No, he's just the guy that I got paired with because Kat knew there would be this connection.

2640
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:33,180
And.

2641
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:38,500
I don't know, I just I even now sitting here, it's hard to tell.

2642
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,500
I don't know what to talk about it.

2643
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,860
It's hard to put in words what that experience is like.

2644
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:43,260
I mean, I certainly came away thinking.

2645
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:50,340
I can't imagine the world not being a better place if every single person would go and

2646
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:51,620
spend one day doing that.

2647
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:55,100
All the people on the outside, you know, just go and spend one day.

2648
02:18:56,060 --> 02:19:00,660
Just you want to talk about empathy, you want to talk about compassion, you want to talk

2649
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:05,900
about understanding that we're all not that far from each other.

2650
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:09,540
Which is an easy thing to do.

2651
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:10,860
It's such a gift.

2652
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:13,860
It was such a gift for you and the guys I went with.

2653
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:17,140
I mean, like I can see it on your face now, right?

2654
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:18,860
And it was.

2655
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:24,900
It was such a gift for both like one of the most unique things about it, I think.

2656
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:31,180
I don't know if she created it or what what created it, but it's it's you're selling things

2657
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:33,740
to everybody in the room that cannot be bought.

2658
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:34,540
Right.

2659
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:37,860
Like no matter how successful you are, you can't buy that experience, right?

2660
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:38,820
You can't send the money.

2661
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:39,380
Yeah.

2662
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:39,700
Right.

2663
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:44,100
Like you can't buy that like in no matter like they can't get enough cigarettes to get

2664
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:44,620
that either.

2665
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:46,300
And they can't even believe it.

2666
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:46,540
Right.

2667
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:52,300
So you're giving them a gift of like a possibility, which is an amazing fucking gift.

2668
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:52,540
Right.

2669
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,660
Like it's like I can create a future.

2670
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:56,140
I can create anything.

2671
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:01,180
And then like what we got was I feel like what we got is more than what we gave.

2672
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,340
But you've never been.

2673
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:02,740
I've never.

2674
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:06,340
I know I was just about to say I can't I can only say that as an outsider.

2675
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:10,980
So you're probably the only person who could not that it matters, of course, like who got

2676
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:11,700
gave whatever.

2677
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:17,300
But like I remember thinking when when when it was all said and done, I was like, you know,

2678
02:20:18,220 --> 02:20:23,660
I've never been around another person who's been so grateful for my existence as I was with some

2679
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:24,620
of those men that day.

2680
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:25,780
Yeah, but didn't you?

2681
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:30,220
And yet I felt like I got way more like I left with something that was.

2682
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:34,420
I mean, what you know, like I didn't give enough.

2683
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:38,460
Sorry, I apologize because you that's what you were saying.

2684
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:41,980
Like I was saying, didn't you feel like you left with something?

2685
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:47,420
Because whoever's devised the way that this works, it's the whole thing gives.

2686
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:47,940
Yeah.

2687
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:48,220
Right.

2688
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:50,220
It doesn't take and it takes a time.

2689
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:50,860
It takes time.

2690
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:52,820
That's all it takes is a day or whatever.

2691
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:53,060
Right.

2692
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:58,940
But like like that experience gave you what you just I mean, like you're like for lack of a

2693
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:03,300
better way of saying it or a cuter way of saying it like you're a fairly successful or wildly

2694
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:05,700
successful person in everything that you've done.

2695
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,140
Right.

2696
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:11,180
And you could probably get, you know, some things that you could create in your mind like, oh, I

2697
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:11,660
like that.

2698
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:12,500
I could go get that.

2699
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:14,260
But you can't get that.

2700
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:18,940
Like you can't get what you left there that day with you can't get that form of appreciation for

2701
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:19,340
your life.

2702
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:25,100
Like what I saw you guys get and what I got to write like in all honesty, like what I was able to

2703
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:31,340
leave there with I may even be more powerful than what you got because in its own way, it was

2704
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:36,820
like I found for me like why I fucking suffered for so long.

2705
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:37,140
Right.

2706
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:41,860
Like, I mean, it makes me more like this is why I fucking this so that I could be where I am.

2707
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:44,300
So I could be here talking to you like I'm fired.

2708
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:44,980
You could hear it.

2709
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,220
Right.

2710
02:21:45,220 --> 02:21:51,500
Like so that I could help these guys so that they could have somebody that they could believe in.

2711
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,100
Right.

2712
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:55,180
And like that lady gave me a gift.

2713
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,820
You know, that girl gave me a gift.

2714
02:21:56,820 --> 02:22:01,620
That jail gave me a gift that I've never never been lucky enough to have.

2715
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:02,300
And now I have it.

2716
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,540
I ain't giving a fucking back.

2717
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,300
How's your book coming?

2718
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:05,900
It's good.

2719
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:09,540
I mean, I'm not I'm a writer, but I'm not a writer.

2720
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:10,500
So it's it's coming.

2721
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:12,340
My sister was an editor for a while.

2722
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:12,820
Yeah.

2723
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:15,500
But my guess is those journals are gold.

2724
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:15,940
Yeah.

2725
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:16,500
Yeah.

2726
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:16,820
Yeah.

2727
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:18,060
They are.

2728
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:19,100
I mean, they're golden.

2729
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:22,020
And they're also kind of scary because I was fucking crazy.

2730
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:24,060
And it's funny, too, because stuff's in code.

2731
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:29,460
Like I realized that while I was reading it, like certain stuff's in code because you can't write it, you know.

2732
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:33,460
But it's going to work out.

2733
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:35,260
It's going to come together.

2734
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:38,820
I mean, you don't it doesn't happen by chance.

2735
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:45,980
You don't get on a plane and sit next to the lady like the guy who did your brain surgery on your way to go do a podcast on like an accident.

2736
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:47,740
Like it's just it's not a fucking accident.

2737
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:52,140
Like I didn't help Dev with his brother six years ago on accident.

2738
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:52,540
Right.

2739
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:55,620
I don't I don't that's bullshit.

2740
02:22:55,620 --> 02:22:56,700
I don't believe in accidents.

2741
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:58,940
I didn't you didn't send that to Dev.

2742
02:22:58,940 --> 02:23:07,100
And like you said, like to hear the other side of the story, you bumped into him seeing his bodywork guy and said, hey, like, oh, you know, this is on my brain right now.

2743
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:07,740
Yeah.

2744
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:13,340
And it's one of those things like, you know, you can say that to a million people when they sort of forget about about the time they get to their car.

2745
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:15,220
But like Devon's not that guy.

2746
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:17,180
Like when Devon's in, he's all in.

2747
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:17,380
Yeah.

2748
02:23:17,380 --> 02:23:18,780
He's like, yeah, let's do it.

2749
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:19,180
Yeah.

2750
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:21,060
And then he thinks of me and it's like, yeah, I'm in.

2751
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:21,580
Let's do it.

2752
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,500
Like, yeah.

2753
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:29,140
But Kern, man, Kern and Defy and I want to talk to you more about like the directions that's going and everything.

2754
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:36,700
But. Yeah, I think I think it's a profound experience that we should all have in a lot of different.

2755
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:40,020
You know, I think it should be happening at youth facilities.

2756
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:47,020
I think it should be happening in other places, too, probably in the corporate like world or, you know, like somehow, some way we've got to find a way to

2757
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:54,180
connect to each other as humans or else we're kind of fucked or we just kind of keep enduring and overcoming, which isn't bad.

2758
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:55,900
But like, I'd rather be connected.

2759
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:58,660
One of my best friends is a psychiatrist and I emailed him.

2760
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:09,620
Recently, and I said, Paul, let's I want to do a podcast where we talk about suicide and I want to talk about it in great detail.

2761
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:22,700
And I want to understand how much of suicide could be, you know, evolutionary versus sort of an environmental disease, environmental meaning, you know, a disease of civilization, if you will.

2762
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:30,900
OK. And I do wonder, again, I say this knowing nothing and looking forward to talking to someone who has more experience around this than I will ever have.

2763
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,580
But I wonder how much of what you just said factors into that.

2764
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:39,420
You know, I've heard people say that, you know, you can be in the most crowded place and yet be the most alone.

2765
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:45,500
So I what you're basically saying is, look, it's that connectiveness that sort of undoes that.

2766
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:48,740
And that's not necessarily about who you're around or not around.

2767
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:53,620
Part of it, I guess, comes down to a lot of what we saw at Kern, which is that vulnerability.

2768
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:57,860
And I'm amazed at what they can do.

2769
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:01,940
And, you know, I think probably by the time this podcast is out, I don't even know if there will be a defy anymore.

2770
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:05,900
But the good news is, you know, defy was just a name sort of irrelevant, right?

2771
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:09,740
There will be a cat hoke and there will be all the things that she continues to do.

2772
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:13,740
And it'll be even better than what defy was, which was already amazing.

2773
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:17,980
Yeah, it's nice. I need it like we it's got to happen.

2774
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:20,420
Yeah, it'll it'll it'll happen.

2775
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,980
You hungry? I am. I am.

2776
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,660
And I need to use the back. Yeah.

2777
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:30,300
All right. Well, let's go get some Greek food.

2778
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:32,700
