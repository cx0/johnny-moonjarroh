00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,380
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,640
today's episode. My guest this week is Dr. Mark Hyman. Mark is a family physician,

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,560
a New York Times bestselling author and the director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,600
Functional Medicine. It turns out we're going to talk about pretty much none of that today.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,800
We talk almost exclusively on his new book, which is due out tomorrow called Food Fix,

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,040
How to Save Our Health, Our Economy, Our Communities, and Our Planet One Bite at a

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,480
Time. And if that sounds like a mouthful, it's because it is a mouthful. This is a kind of

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,840
staggering topic. And even by the standards of this podcast, it's probably too much for one

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,840
episode. Mark basically lays out a thesis that if you fix the food system, you fix a lot of problems.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,760
So it's not a one-fer, it's not a two-fer, it's like somewhere between a three-fer and a four-fer.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,760
We don't spend a lot of time talking about the health consequences of fixing food,

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,320
although we open our discussion with that talking about the health impact of food. We talk a little

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,000
bit about gut health, but we spend more of our time probably speaking about some of the social

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,440
consequences and the environmental consequences. And of course, it ultimately does come down to

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,200
health at the individual level. We do get a lot into agriculture, energy usage around food. We

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,040
talk a lot about the impact on climate. We also talk quite a lot about GMO, the strength of the

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,800
evidence for and against it. We go through a lot of the policy ideas around how one might fix

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,040
the food system. And actually we close with a nice anecdote of an explanation that I thought

26
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,800
Mark provided that was pretty interesting around the difference between food in Europe and North

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,200
America. Many people, myself included, have commented on this, which is, why is it that

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,840
when you go to Europe, you seem to be able to eat with impunity things that in the United States

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,800
just feel like they're about to kill you. Anyway, this is a really interesting episode.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,960
I learned a lot in preparing for it. And truthfully, I still feel like there's a lot I just

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,360
don't understand in this system. There's probably a lot I need to go back and get smarter on.

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,720
There are so many big numbers in this type of a discussion that the scale

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,880
doesn't make sense at times when you start to think about what it means to feed the world

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,040
and how making changes in that system can have enormous knock on effects for both good and bad.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,520
So without further delay, please enjoy my discussion with Mark Hyman. And we may end

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,840
up revisiting this topic with other guests. Should people find this interesting?

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Hey Mark, thanks for coming over, man. No, I'm so happy to be here. It's beautiful.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Chickens running around and everything. Ben is in the freezer, my kind of place.

39
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in keeping with a lot of what we're going to talk about today. I think,

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,760
Mark, a lot of people would associate you with other topics that we might get into,

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,200
functional medicine, the role of toxins in the environment, certainly food, but from the

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,160
standpoint of health, what to eat. But what we're talking about today is actually something that

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,960
when you first mentioned to me, you were working on this book. Actually, at the time you were

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,480
putting the finishing touches on it about a year ago, I was like, wow, that's definitely something

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,320
I want to understand more. So I can't wait to kind of have this discussion with you today.

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,360
And that is basically how food is made, how food is delivered and how food is consumed and what

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,480
the impacts of that are. I mean, what made you decide to tackle a problem of this magnitude,

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,840
which is not just a scientific problem, but it's a political problem. Totally. It's a religious

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,000
problem if we're going to be brutally honest. I mean, the nutrition religion. Yes, exactly.

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,800
So it's about as complicated as a topic as one would go after.

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,600
It is. And I think as a doctor, seeing patients day after day for 30 years

52
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,880
as a functional medicine doctor, my focus is on why. Why are my patients so sick? And not always,

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,160
but the majority of them, it has some relationship to food. And then I began to wonder, well,

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,520
I could sit here all day bailing the bucket and the boat with a hole in it, but I have to figure

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,520
out why they're eating the food they're eating. And then you're going to think about it and go

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,520
upstream and well, the food they're eating is caused by the food system. And I'm like, well,

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,080
why do we have the food system we have? Well, our food policies. And then I'm like, why do we have

58
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,880
our food policies? It's the food industry that influences our government policies through

59
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,920
lobbying and other influences that they do across the spectrum of society to drive their products

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,640
to the market and sell them, which are predominantly killing us. I mean, there's 11 million people that

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,120
die every year from eating ultra processed food and not enough for the good food. And I think it's

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,480
an underestimate. So basically the answer to the question is I realized I couldn't treat my

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,760
patients in my office or in the hospital or the clinic. I had to go to where the source of the

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,800
problem was. Yeah. And I want to sort of put this in context, which is the evolution of this. The

65
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:51,240
domestication of crops, the institutionalization of agriculture has for, we're going to demonize

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,840
it a little bit here, but the reality of it is it's been kind of a remarkable transformation.

67
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,360
It would certainly be akin to the printing press when you think about step function changes in our

68
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,640
civilization, when we went from hunter gatherers to an agricultural society. So I want to be careful

69
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,000
that we're not just sort of saying the answer is agriculture is the end of the. The agriculture is

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,880
a solution if we do it right. Yeah. So let's start with what you see as the sort of main pillars of

71
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,640
the problem. How did we get to a point where the food environment is toxic? Because that's

72
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,360
effectively what you're saying, right? If you eat on default, you're going to probably eat the wrong

73
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,080
things. Yeah. It goes deeper than that. The food system as a whole, as I began to dig in this rabbit

74
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,760
hole, I realized it wasn't just causing chronic disease, but it was causing most of the global

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,720
crises that we're thinking about in silos that are all connected. And I'll just sort of quickly

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,920
lay them out and it'd be good to go over them in detail as we go through the podcast. But

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,800
clearly food is the biggest driver of chronic disease affecting six out of 10 people.

78
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,160
It's clearly the biggest driver of economic stress in this country in our $22 trillion debt,

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,360
one third of all Medicare expenses over diabetes alone, and one third of all of our federal

80
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,680
budget is Medicare. If it was a company, it would be the biggest company in the world at a trillion

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,480
dollars annually. It's also driving climate change. A food system end to end and we'll unpack it,

82
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,320
is the number one cause of climate change more than fossil fuels. It's causing massive

83
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,040
environmental degradation, including loss of biodiversity, plant species, animal species,

84
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,960
livestock species. It's driving social injustice in many ways through how it affects our kids'

85
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,400
cognitive development and ability to learn. And there's huge academic achievement gaps.

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,360
It leads to massive health disparities because poor communities are more affected by these

87
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,960
foods and are more targeted by them. It affects even behavior, violence, conflict. We see such a

88
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,160
device of society today. Why do we have that? 40 years ago, it wasn't like that. And I think

89
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,200
our diet has changed so radically, not just in the last 10,000 years, but in the last 40 years

90
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,280
with the advent of massive amounts of ultra-processed food. And that's driving

91
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,240
cognitive behavioral issues, violence, suicide, conflict, and even threatens our national security

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,520
because 70% of military recruits are unfit to fight and are rejected. So we've got these global

93
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
problems that are affecting us. And then of course that leads to massive political instability

94
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,920
because of our food system of climate refugees, because the food system is driving climate.

95
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,600
What is that going to do? I mean, think about it. We had a million Syrian refugees

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,800
and that created a global crisis. The UN estimates that within a decade or a few decades, we're going

97
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,480
to have 200 to a billion climate refugees. That's unimaginable. So how do we begin to sort of grapple

98
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,560
with these problems and think about the solutions? And the beauty is since they're all connected by

99
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,200
food, they can all be solved by going to the root and fixing our food system. And that's the leverage

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,840
we have, which is so exciting to me because it's not, oh, doom and gloom, the world's ending. It's,

101
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,720
yeah, we identify the problem, how it's connected, think of it as a system, and then be able to solve

102
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,360
the problem by going to the root and dealing with these issues collectively. So which one of those

103
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,000
would you like to start with? Would you like to start with sort of the impact of processed food

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,240
on health, which is probably not one that we need to spend a lot of time on? I don't think there's

105
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,200
many people that would debate that, are there? Oh, you'd be surprised. I mean, there's 12 billion

106
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,200
dollars spent by the food industry on nutrition, quote, research that confuses people, muddies the

107
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,840
waters, declares that Gatorade is a great sports drink and that sugar doesn't cause obesity and

108
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,640
that, I mean, I could go on and on. People are confused and certainly our political leaders

109
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,400
certainly don't get this. And I think when you think of our healthcare system, it certainly

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,000
doesn't get that food is medicine. Do you really think that political leaders, I know you've spent

111
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,160
some time interacting with said folks, do you really think they don't get it or do you think

112
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,520
that they're just in a difficult position, which is how do you appease all of these constituents?

113
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,760
On the one hand, a lot of the bills get paid by the entities that endorse these agendas. And on

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,760
the other end, they probably have empathy for the damage that's done. I mean, do you actually think

115
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,040
there's a lack of awareness? I do. I mean, forget about politicians, academics, doctors,

116
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,880
health professionals have no clue how powerful food is to heal disease. I mean, they get that if you

117
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,640
eat too much, you're going to get fat, right? But that's about it. Or if you eat too much carbs,

118
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,800
maybe now, maybe you'll get diabetes, but not even that. I mean, the American Diabetes Association

119
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,400
is still telling people to eat a lot of carbohydrates. I think we have a real lack of

120
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,280
understanding of the power of food to cause disease and the power of food to cure disease.

121
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,480
And so there's a real gap in that. I think it's starting to become in the public awareness that

122
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,240
food is medicine, that there's a food is medicine working group in Congress, Cleveland Clinic,

123
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,400
where I work now is a food is medicine initiative. There's hospitals around the country. They're

124
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,640
talking about this. It's more the exception than the rule. So I do think people don't understand

125
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,520
the magnitude. I mean, if you say to a politician, what is the biggest killer on the planet? They're

126
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,880
going to go smoking or lack of exercise or maybe they're going to get this being overweight,

127
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,000
but they don't get that it's the ultra processed food that kills more people than smoking,

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,880
violence, wars, everything else. So I mean, I think if there was a disease like Ebola or

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Zika that was killing 11 million people a year, I mean, people would be talking about it. And it's

130
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,400
just not in the conversation that's happening. Even for example, Medicare, Medicare for all,

131
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,120
has anybody said the reason we have the trouble with Medicare is because people are eating bad

132
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,800
food and that we need to fix the food? They're no saying, let's get Medicare for all. Let's

133
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,560
repeal Obamacare. I mean, those aren't the solutions. It's like that would be a disaster

134
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,560
if we had Medicare for all because everybody's sick and it's just going to bankrupt the country

135
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,520
unless we fix why they're sick in the first place. What do you think it is about processed foods

136
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,120
that are particularly difficult metabolically for our species? Historically, we ate 800 different

137
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,760
species of plants, a lot of roots and tubers, 100 grams of fiber a day. Now in the average American,

138
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,160
it's about eight grams, which is nothing. And we had a very complex diet, which was very difficult

139
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,000
to obtain sugar. You got lucky if you found a honey thing. I mean, I remember reading this

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
article about these Nepalese honey hunters where they have to climb up a hundred feet

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,040
into the trees with a burning bush and it's like, if you had to climb a tree with a burning bush to

142
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,480
get a cookie, you probably wouldn't eat so many cookies. And I think it's just become so easy for

143
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,640
us to have this abundance of sugar and flour and refined foods. And the good intentions that were

144
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,200
there in the post-war period that led to the development of industrial agriculture were to

145
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,640
provide a lot of starchy, abundant calories to feed the hungry and solve real hunger issues

146
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,120
around the world. And I think that was a good thing, but there was unintended consequences of

147
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,800
the intensive chemical agriculture that we're using, intensive fertilizer use, and the commodity

148
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,360
products, which are wheat, corn, soy, and rice in some other areas of the world that are driving

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,800
this obesity epidemic. So our biology isn't adapted to eating highly refined foods, which

150
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,680
essentially is most of what we're eating now. It's 60% of our calories and every 10% of your

151
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,520
calories that's ultra processed food, your risk of death goes up by 14%. So it's not something

152
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,480
our bodies like, it's something you're adapted to. And then of course there's all the other stuff

153
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,920
in there that may be problematic like refined soybean oil or food additives or chemicals that

154
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,960
are in our food that have all sorts of metabolic consequences like BPA or other metabolic toxins

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,120
that are consumed within the food we're eating. So it's complicated. It's sugar and starch and

156
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,560
flour are the big drivers, but there's all these other components. And then who knows what's

157
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,920
happening with pesticides and glyphosate affecting our microbiome. I mean, it's such a complex web

158
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,440
of different factors that alter our metabolic pathways that drives disease. And just kind of

159
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,000
digging into this a little bit more, how much of it do you think is the energy balance and the

160
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,240
dysregulation of energy balance that comes from these processed foods? So there are certainly

161
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,240
people out there that would argue that part of the trouble with processed food is it sort of

162
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,600
hijacks our energy homeostatic systems. So if you put a human in an environment akin to what

163
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,440
our ancestors evolved in, there was enough auto feedback and regulation that you sort of

164
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
maintained energy balance. You would eat more when you needed to eat more, you would eat less

165
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,520
when you needed to eat less. One of the drawbacks of processed food, if not the biggest drawback,

166
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,960
is it sort of hijacks that system. And if you cut the feedback out of that loop, they're eating when

167
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,120
they don't really need additional energy. Do you think that's the biggest issue or do you think

168
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,720
it's the void of nutrient that then creates sort of an abundance of junk calorie as the body

169
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,680
search for nutrients? Do you think it's this loss of fiber? Probably both. I mean, kids who are iron

170
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,160
deficient eat dirt. It's called pica. And it's well known that if you're looking for nutrients,

171
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,240
you're just going to eat anything. So that may be part of it. I think the main part of it is,

172
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,880
and you've talked about this a lot, is the ways in which these refined starches and sugars affect

173
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,560
your biology. They raise insulin, which has a cascading effect of fat storage in your belly,

174
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,240
which is a dangerous fat. It leads to increased hunger, affects your brain chemistry. It actually

175
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,880
locks the fat in the fat cells so they can't get out. So it gets like a one-way turnstile that gets

176
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,040
in but can't get out. And it slows your metabolism. So you're in this cascade of vicious cycles. So

177
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,080
you're talking about energy balance. I think most people when they hear that think about calories

178
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,960
and calories out, I think I both understand that it's more complex than that, that there's different

179
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,000
effects of food on your biology independent of calories. In a lab, all calories are the same.

180
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,160
750 calories of Coke is the same as 750 calories of broccoli. But to get 750 calories of soda,

181
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,400
you'd have a big gulp, which is 40, 60 spoons of sugar. And 750 calories of broccoli is 21

182
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,800
cups of broccoli with 35 grams of fiber and no sugar. Profoundly different effects on your

183
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,000
biology, same calories. But we don't really appreciate that medicine. And most of our current

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,320
thinking about weight loss is focused on calories in, calories out. It suits the food industry

185
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,960
because they go, well, it's all about moderation. There's no good or bad calories. It's exercise

186
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,200
more, eat less. Like that's their mantra. And it serves them to sell more of their junk food as

187
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,000
long as it's part of a Pope balanced diet. But the truth is that these foods affect our brain

188
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,120
chemistry and create all sorts of metabolic issues that are incredibly difficult. And I was

189
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,240
chatting with my friend David Perlmutter who just wrote a book called Brainwash where he's talking

190
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,560
about, he's a neurologist where the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are uncoupled with an

191
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,320
inflammatory diet, which is what we're eating most of us in America and around the world.

192
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,280
What that means is that the adult in the room, the prefrontal cortex, which is the decision maker

193
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:30,360
that understands the consequences of its behavior is not talking to the impulse part of your brain,

194
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,640
the fight or flight part of your brain, the pleasure seeking part of your brain. So there's

195
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,200
this disconnection and your decisions are not in your best interest. And that's why we have so much

196
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,920
bad behavior and conflict and so forth, because we're eating this inflammatory diet that's

197
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,240
literally disregulating our brain. So the adult in the room is asleep.

198
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,240
Say a bit more about that. What is it about the diet that could be inflammatory and how could one

199
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,240
measure the consequences of that? Because is it possible that two people could consume the exact

200
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,160
same subpar diet and have very different inflammatory responses?

201
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, sure. I mean, there is a, listen, if people are eating junk food and processed food, their

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,360
metabolism, whatever they look like, whether they're overweight or not, is not going to be as

203
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,520
good as someone who's eating a whole foods unprocessed diet. But there is a lot of genetic

204
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,880
variability, but you can actually measure inflammation in response to diet through various

205
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,160
biomarkers. There's new panels of sort of looking at the inflammasome, which is really cool. It's

206
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,320
more than just a CRP or a CED rate, which are blood tests you can do to look at inflammation.

207
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,400
And the ways in which it causes, particularly it was talking about insulin, it also drives this

208
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,160
visceral belly fat, which is a basically metabolic fire that starts in these cells and it spreads

209
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,400
inflammation throughout the body. So just the nature of eating sugar and processed food drives

210
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,160
up inflammation. If a patient has normal biomarkers through the lens of all of those things,

211
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,480
their interleukins and C-rective protein, fibrinogen, if all of those things were normal,

212
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,480
would you still think that there's potentially an inflammatory response that's coming through

213
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,040
their diet? The question is how sensitive are our current tools for assessing the immune response

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,160
to food? And I think they're pretty crappy. And I think there's more and more lab diagnostic

215
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,680
measures that are coming about that are going to help us look at that. I was talking to someone

216
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,160
from the Buck Institute of Aging last week and he said, yeah, there's a whole new panel of

217
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,120
inflammatory biomarkers that are much more specific and much more sensitive and it enabled

218
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,960
us to have a look at the inflammatory response that's happening in the body related to aging

219
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,840
or diet or anything else. How much of that inflammatory response do you think is mediated

220
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,040
by permeability in the gut specifically versus, because I have to be honest with you Mark, this

221
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,720
is an area that I've never understood. It gets talked about a lot. There's lots of hand waving.

222
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,080
Sometimes I see it certainly in patients. I mean, when we see subtle elevations in fibrinogen and

223
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,760
or C-reactive protein or at least two of the interleukins, we usually put patients on elimination

224
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,800
diets till we find out what the culprit was and we're trying to basically titrate symptoms versus

225
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,400
these biomarkers. But I find that to be staggeringly crude. And to your point, I don't know what we're

226
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,760
missing and I don't know what's true, true and unrelated. And then of course it gets back to the

227
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,240
question of what's the mechanism of this. And so one potential mechanism is that the permeability

228
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,920
of the gut is altered. And if bacteria that could normally not translocate across the lining of the

229
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,880
gut do so, that would certainly be a reason for inflammation. A, do you think that that's a

230
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,880
prevalent source of it? Oh yeah, huge. I mean, all our guts are messed up and there's a whole

231
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,840
phenomenon called metabolic endotoxemia. It's been well described and studied. And the fact that your

232
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,000
gut microbiome has a huge role in regulation of weight independent of calories. So they literally

233
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,040
can take the poop out of a skinny rat into a fat rat and make them skinny and vice versa. They've

234
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,120
done in humans. I think the way in which it works is that your microbiome is regulated by what you

235
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,640
eat. A lot of fiber, prebiotics, the phytonutrients, the phytochemicals, the polyphenols all affect the

236
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,000
quality of the garden you have growing inside of you. And you can get a lot of nasty weeds in there.

237
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,240
When that starts to happen, they start to disrupt the gut microbiome. They disrupt the lining of the

238
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,600
gut. They cause what we call leaky gut on top of everything else, which is our low fiber diet,

239
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,200
high sugar, processed food, increases bad bugs in the gut, antibiotics, acid blockers,

240
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,080
anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones, all screw up our gut. And of course, toxins, environmental

241
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,120
toxins, glyphosate is super toxic to the microbiome. And so all these things that we know and those

242
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,320
things we don't know are disrupting the microbiome. And when that happens, the lining of the gut

243
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,360
becomes slightly damaged, the biofilms get disrupted, and you end up absorbing bacterial

244
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,000
products, bacterial toxins, as well as food antigens, things that we should normally tolerate,

245
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,640
and start to create an inflammatory response. And 60% of your immune system is in your gut.

246
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,160
And what's really striking to me, Peter, is the discovery that many of our metabolites in our

247
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,800
blood, probably a third or more, may be from microbiome. In other words, when you check your

248
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,320
blood tests, we're checking human analytes. But when you actually start to do some more sophisticated

249
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,040
metabolic testing and metabolism, you find all these things that aren't human, that come from

250
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,760
bacteria that are regulating your immune system, that are activating your mitochondria, that are

251
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,840
regulating your DNA, that are affecting your brain chemistry, affecting your mood, affecting

252
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,320
all sorts of diseases. So this is like a really exciting area. And I think getting people's

253
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,080
microbiome sorted often happens when you shift to a whole foods, plant-rich diet, not plant-based,

254
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,840
but plant-rich. How can one measure these things? I mean, one of the things that I've found difficult

255
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:48,200
is finding valid commercial tests that can enable patients or physicians to understand if they're

256
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,800
in this sort of regulated state. I mean, to me, the black box is when someone comes in and says,

257
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,520
I have gut dysbiosis or I have poor gut health. And they may be right, but it's very different

258
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,760
than someone who says, I have type 2 diabetes, where we have really clear ways to diagnose it.

259
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,680
We kind of have some understanding what the pathophysiology is here. This is much more squishy.

260
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,920
And frankly, there's an enormous disconnect between people like you and sort of the

261
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,920
stuffy upper-lipped gastroenterologist who makes his or her living in the gut,

262
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,120
but doesn't necessarily sort of see the problem this way, right? They're looking at different

263
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,240
problems. You know, honestly, Peter, the evidence has become so overwhelming that mainstream medicine

264
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,000
is bought into this whole microbiome story. And Cleveland Clinic, for example, they're studying

265
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,560
the microbiome and heart disease and arthritis and cancer. And it's like, they just got a $12

266
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,040
million grant from the NIH to study the microbiome and heart disease, which is pretty amazing.

267
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,920
And yet, if you go to your doctor and say, is there any evidence that I should be on this

268
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,000
probiotic or this? Yeah, they don't know. The clinical translation is challenging. So I'm

269
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,560
somebody who's been practicing functional medicine for 30 years and the gut has been the number one

270
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:10,040
focus of our ability to really move diseases in a powerful way. And they used to call me Dr. C

271
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,200
every poop because I've done literally tens of thousands of stool tests and I've looked at all

272
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,240
the different ones. And you're looking at a moving target. You're looking at an ecosystem. And so,

273
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,400
we look at a lot of different biomarkers to assess what's going on in the gut. Is there adequate

274
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,160
pancreatic enzyme function? Looking at pancreatic elastase, are there absorption issues? Looking at

275
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:37,080
fecal fats? Are there inflammatory markers in there? For example, Calprotectin or eosinophil

276
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,440
protein X, which are standard markers to look at inflammation in the gut. What's your IGA levels,

277
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,800
your antibody levels? And then we look at indicators of dysregulated gut microbiome,

278
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,600
such as short chain fatty acids, which are essentially produced by good bacteria that are

279
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,520
the fuel for the gut and have anti-cancer properties, anti-inflammatory properties.

280
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,440
And those can be low like butyrate and we can see that. Then we look at sort of different microbiome

281
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,520
characteristics using DNA or PCR analysis through the micro RNAs. And that allows us to see, for

282
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,400
example, if there's low acromancia, which is a very important bacteria that regulates your biofilm,

283
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,240
that regulates immunity, that's linked to autoimmune disease and cardiometabolic diseases,

284
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,840
cancer treatment therapy risk. So we can modify those things. And then we look at culture, we look

285
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,120
at other kinds of testing for parasites. It's PCR testing. So there's a lot of things that we look at

286
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,840
and get a gestalt. It changed over time, but you can see if someone's got a good gut or

287
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,360
okay gut or a terrible gut. So if you take a patient who is both symptomatic and by some

288
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,960
consolation of tests has a quote unquote bad gut, what percentage of those are quote unquote fixable

289
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,400
by subtraction? So you take things out of their diet or addition, you add more of certain food

290
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,840
to their diet or the third choice would be intervention based where you have to use

291
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,320
sort of supplements and antibiotics or probiotics or things like that. So that's an oversimplified

292
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,160
look at this. But if there's three levers you have, which means take something out of their food,

293
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,840
add something to their food or add a different type of food or then use a bigger gun like a

294
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,960
supplement, how do those tools fit into this treatment? Well, functional medicine is a very

295
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,600
organized framework for addressing gut dysfunction called the 5R program. The first R is to remove,

296
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,480
remove things that shouldn't be there, whether it's foods that are triggering a problem like

297
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,560
gluten, which affects permeability or dairy, grains for some people, remove bad bugs. So if

298
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,840
you have a parasite, I mean, I just had a patient who had a common parasite. She had stomach issues

299
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,920
for 20 years. She was always waking up feeling like crap. I gave her a linear, which is an

300
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,160
anti-parasitic medication, six days she says she's never felt better. So sometimes you just need to

301
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,440
do that and maybe bacterial overgrowth you have, maybe there's yeast overgrowth. You need to address

302
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,920
that. And so that's the first step. The second step is to replace what might be missing. So fiber,

303
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,120
prebiotics, enzymes, various things that may be needing to support the system. And sometimes

304
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,280
that's just through food, but sometimes that's also supplements. Sure. You can take prebiotic

305
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,160
fibers and prebiotic foods like plantain and artichokes and all kinds of different foods.

306
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,560
And then re-inoculate, which would be provide probiotics where necessary. And that can be

307
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,480
through foods like fermented foods or can be through probiotic supplements. And those are,

308
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,000
that's still sort of a wild west, but there are things that up there that really work.

309
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,400
And then to replace what's missing. So maybe there's nutrients that the body needs to heal,

310
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,600
things like glutamine, vitamin A, fish oil, maybe even things like butyrate and replace things that

311
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,680
might be needed for healing the gut. Like polyphenols, for example, are a wonderful thing

312
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,640
you can get from food, pomegranate, cranberries, green tea, et cetera, that have powerful, great

313
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,920
effects on the microbiome that we didn't really appreciate. So we thought it was prebiotic and

314
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,960
probiotic, but it turns out the polyphenols in plant foods are super helpful for the gut microbiome.

315
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,080
And then the last R is to restore, which means to sort of restore your nervous system because

316
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,080
you need to sort of deal with the way in which your stress level and everything affects your gut

317
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,480
and your gut microbiome. You can get a leaky gut just from stress, for example. So working on all

318
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,480
those in a systematic way that's personalized is really the approach. There's no sort of,

319
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,560
oh, take this or do that, it's going to work. So bringing it back to what you started this point.

320
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah, we got down with the rabbit hole.

321
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,520
Yeah, well, it's such an interesting topic. You've laid out basically the enormous health

322
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,760
consequences of eating poorly. Six out of 10 Americans have a chronic disease, four out of

323
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,160
10 have two or more. In 10 years, 83 million Americans are not three or more, which is

324
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,200
bankrupting our country. And one in two Americans has prediabetes or type two diabetes. These

325
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,680
statistics are staggering. 75% of us are overweight. Most states now have 40% obesity

326
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,120
rates. I mean, when I graduated medical school, there wasn't a single state that had a 20%

327
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,000
obesity rate now. Everybody's got 30 or almost 40. These are massive things that are happening

328
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,600
at a scale that we've never seen in human history that we haven't been equipped to deal with,

329
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,680
that we haven't really thought of how to address, and it's like we're trying to scramble to fix it.

330
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:07,240
And you certainly in the book talk about how there are racial differences in terms of the

331
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:14,200
susceptibility to the bad policy, which we'll get to down the line. Is there also sort of racial

332
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,480
variability and discrepancy in the actual physiology in response to this? There's clearly

333
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:26,600
economic health disparities. Health disparities are a result of targeted marketing from the food

334
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,480
industry that are driving various problems, or obviously the food swamps and the food deserts

335
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,880
and food apartheid, all of that is true. But genetically, there's certain segments of the

336
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,160
population that are much more likely when they are in an abundance of sugar and flour

337
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,720
to get diabetes and obesity. And that includes Native Americans, probably the worst,

338
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,520
African Americans, Latinos, and of course, the people from the South Pacific, and even Indians

339
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,400
from India, Chinese, and Asians often are at much higher risk, even at lower body rates. So

340
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,160
this is really a global problem, and that's why we're seeing 80% of the world's type 2 diabetics

341
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,840
in the developing world. Is there any country or government in particular that seems more

342
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,320
attuned to this problem than the American government? Many, in fact, most. Chile, for

343
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,360
example, was seeing massive obesity rates in kids and adults, healthcare costs staggering for that

344
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,040
country. And again, we're inundated by all the processed food from the food industry and soda

345
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,480
industry. And it took a doctor who was elected to the Senate, who was vice president of the Senate,

346
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,960
and a doctor who was elected president, Michelle Bachelet, who was a pediatrician,

347
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,280
to stand up and say enough and put in a set of regulations to try to stop the onslaught of

348
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,720
these conditions on their population driven by the food industry. So they did a number of things.

349
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,040
One, they put in an 18% soda tax. Two, they put on warning labels on the front of bad food. So

350
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,640
on your Frosted Flakes cereal box, there's black warning labels. They eliminated any cartoon

351
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:07,720
characters from all the kids' food. So no Tony the Tiger, no Toucan Sam on Fruit Loops. They

352
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,640
eliminated any processed food from schools and they made the school lunches healthy. They

353
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,840
eliminated any advertising on junk food from six in the morning till 10 at night so kids wouldn't

354
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,360
see it. And then they measured these outcomes based on that and they see tremendous improvements. And

355
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,920
it was surprising to me. I talked to Barry Pockin, who's from UNC, who worked with them on developing

356
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,200
and Michael Bloomberg, I think gave him $30 million to assess the impact and so forth. So

357
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,840
they're studying this. And even more than the 18% soda tax, the restriction of food marketing

358
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,000
and the warning label and so forth had a fourfold increased benefit compared to the soda tax,

359
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,560
which is being heavily fought here. There's incredible opposition to any limiting

360
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,120
of marketing to kids. And the saying it's the breach of the First Amendment and free speech

361
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,080
and so forth. The First Amendment doesn't have to keep our responsibility to protect our children.

362
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,560
If a foreign nation was doing to our kids what the food industry is and our government is who

363
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,920
has policies, we'd go to war to protect our kids and we just sort of sit back and let this happen.

364
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,200
It's interesting. I'm not a constitutional expert, which would be such an overstatement.

365
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I know nothing about the constitution. There is a constitution.

366
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:21,720
I know. My understanding of the First Amendment is provided the advertising is quote unquote

367
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,040
honest. It is constitutional. And that's a gray area because if you say fruit loops are part of

368
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,920
a healthy breakfast, how do we know that's honest? I can't help but think about the analogous

369
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:39,000
situation, which is tobacco. And what I think most people don't know, and it's possible I'm wrong,

370
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,320
but I believe everything I'm about to say is correct. Because at one point I knew this story well.

371
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,880
When the surgeon general came out with his declaration of the harm of tobacco, which was

372
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,960
in about the mid sixties, and that was the peak of smoking in the United States. I believe something

373
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,040
to the tune of 50, 55% of people over the age of 18 smoked cigarettes. At the time the surgeon

374
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,000
general came out and said definitively cigarettes are causing lung cancer. A number of things took

375
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,960
place that got us to where we are today, which is somewhere below 20% of people. Last time I looked,

376
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,520
it was about 18% of adults smoked. Yeah, a lawsuit is what worked. Well, but here's a big one. A big

377
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:25,080
one was the removal of advertising. But here's the part that I was surprised to learn. It was

378
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:33,080
voluntary on the part of tobacco. In other words, the tobacco industry was not banned from advertising.

379
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,440
What the policy makers said is the law is now that every time a tobacco commercial airs,

380
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,800
it must be followed by an anti-tobacco commercial. So they didn't ban tobacco, they added anti-tobacco.

381
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
So every time you have a McDonald's commercial, you say how bad the food is, it's going to kill you,

382
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,080
right? I think that's not a bad idea. Well, what's interesting is the anti-tobacco ads were so

383
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,720
devastating that the tobacco industry voluntarily withdrew its ads. They were getting hurt so bad

384
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,800
by the anti-tobacco ads that they said enough is enough. And that's to this day, we don't have

385
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,800
tobacco ads on television. So A, someone needs to fact check that to make sure I have that story

386
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,640
correct, but I believe it is correct. And secondly, if it is, it at least suggests another angle to

387
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,000
this problem, which is rather than go down the First Amendment fight, maybe great. Okay. I love

388
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,360
that idea. Keep all the commercials you want on, but we're going to come up with something different.

389
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,720
Now, of course, it's like a drug ad. You can eat this soda, but it's going to cause obesity,

390
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,720
diabetes, cancer, dementia, and kill you early. Fine. Maybe that's a good idea. Yeah. And of course,

391
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,760
tobacco is the easiest thing to demonize because you just show somebody a hole in their throat

392
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,840
after they've had throat cancer or a black lung or a corpse. I mean, there's so many grotesque

393
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,240
ways that you can make the point that are more difficult with food. A lip cigarette. Yeah, yeah,

394
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,640
exactly. But nevertheless, I've always found that to be a very powerful point because it's true that

395
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,200
eventually taxes were introduced into tobacco and they turned out to be quite powerful. Additional

396
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,760
measures in 1989 was also a big step when secondhand smoking became well enough understood that they

397
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,520
banned tobacco in airplanes and things like that. But I wonder how much of a playbook there is there

398
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:25,720
on tobacco to copy. Well, there is, but guess what? The food industry is copying tobacco's playbook

399
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,800
to slow or stall or stop this. And one of the most egregious things was something they've picked up

400
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,200
recently, which is from the tobacco playbook. There have been soda taxes that passed predominantly

401
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,880
in the 2016 election in California and other States. And the soda industry is a Vietnamese

402
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:50,120
opposed to this. They passed in California. They spent about $38 million avoiding these taxes

403
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,480
against these taxes. Bloomberg and the Arnold Foundation spent about 20 million and it didn't

404
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,680
pass. I mean, it did, taxes did pass and it freaked out the soda company. So the American Beverage

405
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,720
Association essentially went and tried subversive tactics. So they went to California where most of

406
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,880
these taxes were passed and they put in a ballot measure, which was designed to prohibit local

407
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,800
taxes unless there was a two thirds majority, meaning you couldn't fund your school, your police

408
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,520
department, your fire department, your cleanup, road cleanup, unless there was a two thirds majority.

409
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,960
That would hamper local governments dramatically. And they spent millions of dollars pushing this

410
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,960
ballot measure, even though it had nothing to do with food. And at the last minute before the

411
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,800
election, they went to Governor Brown, who's probably the most liberal governor in the history

412
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,200
of the United States, Governor Moonbeam. And they said, look, we'll pull this measure, but you have

413
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:50,040
to put in place a preemptive law that prohibits any future taxes on soda or junk food. And it

414
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,520
happened all behind closed doors, completely co-opted the government, impression them to do

415
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,240
something that they didn't want to do. And they're doing this in state after state after state. And

416
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,120
this is exactly what tobacco did. So we can say, oh, they're not bad actors are trying to do things

417
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,000
that good. They're making water, they're making low sugar beverages. They know exactly what they're

418
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,040
doing and they have an existential threat and they're trying to fight it in every way possible.

419
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,120
That's just one example. There's another funny example, which is an initiative called the Global

420
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,600
Energy Balance Network Gurn or something like this. Right. Yeah. Yeah. On a hot O'Connor, I believe

421
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,880
played a pretty important role at the New York times exposing this for what the sham it was.

422
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,400
Do you want to tell people a little bit about the Global Energy Balance Network? So the whole idea

423
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,600
of this is that energy balance is the mantra of the food industry. And what that means is all

424
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,760
calories are the same. Soda calories, broccoli calories, no difference. So it's just a matter

425
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,600
of balance, calories in, calories out, moderation, et cetera, et cetera. And so they essentially

426
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,200
run Apple bomb, who was one of the top BPs at Coca-Cola put together a strategy because you saw

427
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,480
the vilification of soda and all these horrible outcries against sugar that were unmet by enough

428
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,400
aggressive force from the sugar industry and the soda industry. And she said, look, let's start

429
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,680
with something called the Global Energy Balance Network. She found a bunch of scientists who she

430
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,400
could co-op, paid them lots of money, funded their research to actually promote the idea that all

431
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,120
calories are the same. Like James Hill, for example, who was part of an NIH study, legitimate

432
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,400
scientist, but completely co-opted and they funded about 20 million and they built the website. They

433
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,960
organized this messaging and the talking points and they did it all sort of behind the scenes.

434
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,600
And when there was discovery and so the FOIA Freedom of Information Act, it was a public

435
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,360
university, we got all the data. It was really clear how they were behind the scenes, manipulating

436
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,880
all this to fund millions of dollars of corrupt research to prove their point and tell a different

437
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,160
story. And then as soon as the New York Times article came out overnight, it was disbanded

438
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,200
saying it's run out of resources. I mean, come on, Coca-Cola has what billions and millions of dollars

439
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,240
over here. They have plenty of resources and the whole thing collapsed because of investigative

440
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,800
journalism. But it just goes to show how these food companies are co-opting scientists,

441
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,720
co-opting professional associations, co-opting social groups, co-opting the government, putting

442
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,680
forth front groups and spinning all kinds of misinformation in a very coordinated strategic

443
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,640
strategy to disrupt public opinion, to confuse the public and to allow their shenanigans to keep

444
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:28,440
going. Is the opposition to this industry that you can't fight this at the individual level? In

445
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,960
other words, it has to be solved structurally because of the economic disparity. Let me ask

446
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,760
the question another way. Why not focus all of the efforts on helping people understand so they can

447
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,480
make the informed choice, which is if you have to have a Coke, make it a diet Coke. That may not be

448
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,480
as good either. Yeah, but using that as an example, right? But in other words, do we really believe

449
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,840
that this has to be solved at the level that seems almost unwinnable, which is

450
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,280
fighting an unethical opponent with infinite resources? I mean, that's a very dangerous

451
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,880
combination. Yeah, well, look what happened to tobacco. I mean, think about this country.

452
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,560
But you don't need tobacco to live, right? The advantage that you would have as an anti-tobacco

453
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,920
crusade person is the ground is not muddied by the notion that tobacco is part of a group

454
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,760
called food that you need to live. Although it depends how you define food. Our Fruit Loops food,

455
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,400
I don't think so. I mean, they're a highly industrialized processed product. But they still

456
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,520
fit into this bucket of food. They do. And therefore they sort of they ride a little bit of the coattails

457
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,200
of they're still riding on the, hey, we're putting B vitamins in these things and they're fortified

458
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,480
and all this other sort of nonsense. So you're asking is do we need just a grassroots effort to

459
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,600
focus on individual choice and action or do we need a public policy change? Well, and I wouldn't

460
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,280
even ask it as either or because the obvious answer to that would be you could do both. I guess what

461
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,880
I'm getting at is would you be better off putting more effort into sort of the grassroots campaign?

462
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,840
It's complicated. When you think of the big changes that happened in policy in this country,

463
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:13,160
the abolition, I mean, there were a few people running people on the underground railroad and

464
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,280
pushing for abolition back in the early 1800s. And it took decades and decades for change. But

465
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,600
eventually, our entire agricultural and economic system collapse that was founded on slavery and

466
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,480
it was reimagined and rebuilt. And I think look at women's rights, same thing, gay rights, civil

467
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,360
rights, all those things are things that were really starting on the periphery through grassroots

468
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,960
movements, but had to push Congress to make different laws. And I think that's what has to

469
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,400
happen. But I think we have to be smart about it as well. I mean, yes, consumers make a difference.

470
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,640
That's why we're seeing General Mills commit a million acres to regenerative ag. It's why we're

471
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,240
seeing big companies nextly reformulating their products and why there's sustainable regenerative

472
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,640
ag initiatives at Danone. I mean, these companies are starting to see that the consumers want

473
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,920
different things and they're starting to shift their product lines. They're starting to shift

474
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,840
their focus on how their supply chain works and where they get and source their products to

475
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,480
regenerative agriculture. So I do believe that the individual has a huge impact through their

476
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,600
vote with what they're eating, their fork with their wallet, and of course, even with their vote

477
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,480
and their voice. And I think we don't use a ladder enough. That has to all happen. And unfortunately,

478
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,520
I do believe that individual choice matters. Yes, we can all have compost piles. We can have community

479
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,120
gardens. We can have a garden in our backyard. We can choose to eat, we generally meet. We can

480
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,760
be like you, Peter, and go hunting our wild deer. I mean, I'm jealous, but that alone is not enough

481
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,600
because there are structural problems that are not solvable unless we change how we grow food,

482
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,720
what we grow, how we process, distribute, market, sell, eat, and waste it. And if we don't deal with

483
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,040
every aspect along that food chain, we're really not going to solve this problem. And we haven't

484
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,600
really talked about it yet, but things like climate change are an increasingly important

485
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,400
part of the conversation about food. And that is something that's just not in the radar. Like,

486
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,440
how does fixing food fix climate? It does. It's actually one of the only ways to really reverse

487
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,000
climate change. Let's talk about that. Some people don't think climate change is real. They call it

488
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,520
weather. I mean, whatever you want to call it, there's stuff happening. We're having a million

489
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,040
acres flooded in the Midwest, cropland that's destroying farmers' livelihood. We're seeing

490
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,760
increasing weather patterns of hurricanes and wildfires in Australia and California. We're

491
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,880
seeing melting of 3 trillion tons of ice from the Antarctica. These are just undeniable facts.

492
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,840
Can I give you my two cents on this? Yeah. I think the term climate change, global warming,

493
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,960
were sort of in retrospect not the best ways to describe this phenomenon. And climate volatility

494
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,360
would have been a better way to have explained it because one, it's actually more accurate.

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,240
And two, it provides a better explanation for what you're describing. Because when you say

496
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,080
global warming is a problem, well, then how do you explain a record cold year?

497
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,720
It's the high highs, the low lows, and the frequency with which they're cycling,

498
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,600
both through hurricanes, fires, things like that. So I wish we could have gone back in time and said,

499
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,160
look, the problem is climate volatility. Yeah, it's instability. 2019 was the hottest year on

500
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,040
record rather than 2016 in human history. So all of us can feel it. We know it. And I think,

501
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,920
so the question is, why is it happening? And what's the cause of it? And clearly,

502
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,880
most people think it's fossil fuels and taking up all the carbon that was stored in the earth's

503
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,920
crust and burning it and releasing that carbon through fossil fuels. And that's a big part of it,

504
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,040
maybe a third, but half of it comes from our food system through all sorts of different mechanisms.

505
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,280
One, deforestation, you lose the carbon capture from the trees. The soil destruction from

506
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,800
destructive agriculture, which we have, which essentially is a method of industrial growing of

507
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,920
food that tills the soil, which disrupts the normal organic matter, causes soil erosion,

508
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,040
releases carbon, the environment. It also, when you look at the soil as an issue itself,

509
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,480
it's probably the biggest cause and the biggest solution to fixing climate change. And most people

510
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,720
don't think about that. They think about oil, not soil, but a third to 40% of all the carbon

511
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:19,160
in the atmosphere today that's causing climate volatility is from the loss of soil. That's a

512
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,840
staggering amount. Explain how that's the case. Yeah, well, the soil, when it's alive and has

513
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,920
living matter and carbon in the soil, organic matter, which is carbon, it can hold three times

514
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,880
the amount of carbon that's in the atmosphere today, which is a trillion tons of carbon.

515
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,480
It can hold three trillion tons. The UN estimated that if we take two million of the

516
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,560
five million degraded hectares of land around the world and we intensively use regenerative

517
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:53,240
agriculture, which I'll explain in a minute, and restore the soil, we could stop climate change and

518
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,800
delay the progression for about 20 years. And it would cost $300 billion, which is essentially what

519
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,240
we pay every year for diabetes in America through Medicare. And it's basically the amount of budget

520
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,280
for the total global military spend for just two months or 60 days. So this is a solvable problem.

521
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,440
And the reason that the soil is such an issue is that it basically takes when the grasses are on

522
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,520
there and the plants are on there, it sucks the carbon out of the environment. Can you explain

523
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,880
the difference between soil and dirt? Yeah, soil is alive. Soil has all kinds of bugs in it,

524
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,120
mycorrhizal fungi, it has all kinds of bacteria, it has all kinds of carbon in it from the plants,

525
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,680
and it holds a huge amount of water. For example, for every 1% organic matter, it can hold 27,000

526
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,280
gallons of water, which would prevent floods and droughts, which it does and creates more

527
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,320
resilient farms. Explain that again. When you have soil, it's like a sponge. So when it rains,

528
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,240
instead of the rain running off or running through, gets stored like a sponge in the soil

529
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,240
so that you don't need to irrigate, that you don't have to worry about floods and droughts.

530
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,640
Now, the reason we had so much of these floods and these flooded farm fields in the Midwest was

531
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,800
because these soils are just dead and you have to do more and more fertilizer. So we're killing

532
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,120
the soil by using fertilizer, by pesticides, herbicides, tilling, not using cover crops,

533
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,320
not using crop rotations, not using animals in an integrated way to actually create more soil.

534
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,600
And everything we're doing is just destroying the soil. When you have a live soil, when you have

535
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,360
the ability of these plants to suck out carbon dioxide, because they breathe carbon dioxide,

536
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,560
that's what plants do. They breathe out oxygen, which we breathe, and it's a vicious, I mean,

537
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,600
a beautiful virtuous cycle. And the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere gets pulled through

538
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,320
the plants into the soil and stays there. And you can build soil simply by using this technology

539
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,720
and integrating animals that poop and pee. So I don't think I was aware of that. I'll put my

540
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,480
ignorance on full display. I always assumed that the majority of the carbon that came in,

541
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,360
that the plant brought in through the photocell, was for carbon fixation, which was creating

542
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,320
bio matter. So in other words, carbon and oxygen are coming in the form of carbon dioxide. That

543
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,480
carbon is being fixated to other carbons. That's how we make hydrocarbons within the plants.

544
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,440
Yeah, carbohydrates.

545
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,360
That's right. And then the oxygen is being released. But I didn't realize that there was

546
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,840
any carbon dioxide stored in soil.

547
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,920
Yeah. And if you look at the mechanism, it goes into the plant, but it also goes into the roots.

548
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,080
And so you've got this incredible root system and you've got micro isofungi that are fed off.

549
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,440
I see. So you're just saying the hydrocarbon within the roots of the plant is the storage,

550
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,640
not in the soil per se, not in the actual dirt and bacteria.

551
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,160
No, no. Then it gets eaten by the bacteria, eaten by this massive micro isofungi, and it creates

552
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:42,040
a lot of necrotic dead, but like actually organic matter. It's an incredibly rich living organism,

553
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,160
and dirt is just dead. Dirt doesn't hold water. It doesn't have much carbon in it. It doesn't have

554
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,680
much nutrients. And in order to actually to extract the nutrients from the plants,

555
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,880
you have to have organic matter, which allows this and bacteria and all these micro isofungi,

556
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,720
which make the nutrients in the soil available to the plant. And since we are growing food in dirt,

557
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:08,280
we see 50% less nutrient density of even healthy food. Like broccoli has less minerals than it did

558
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,920
50 years ago. So you have all these complicated factors that are driving the destruction of our

559
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,240
soil. Fertilizer is another one. I don't think people really understand the fertilizer story.

560
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,920
There's 400 billion pounds of fertilizer used everywhere in the world. It's a seven-fold

561
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,120
increase over the last 40 years because they're two thirds as effective. The way you make fertilizer

562
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,720
is a chemically intensive process that uses energy. It's one of the biggest utilizers of energy and

563
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,360
the number one utilizer of fracking produced natural gas, which I didn't even know. So when

564
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,960
you look at the fertilizers, they use more natural gas than Exxon. And in order to make the gas,

565
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,200
they use more fertilizer than Exxon produces. So they use more energy than Exxon produces.

566
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,560
Yes, they use more natural gas than Exxon uses. So the Yara and Mosaic, these big fertilizer

567
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,120
companies are making fertilizer using this intensive energy process that needs natural gas.

568
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,560
When you frack, you actually release methane from these methane leaks that come out of these

569
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,920
fracking wells. Recently, there's one in Ohio that you could see from space. And that actually

570
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:21,240
is about a quarter of all methane-releasing gas in the environment today, which is as much as

571
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,560
factory farm cows. And that's from growing plants. Do you know what percent of, I don't know the

572
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,640
numbers anymore, but there was a day when the United States was consuming 20 million barrels

573
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,000
of oil and oil equivalent per day. It's probably a bit less than that today. Do you know what amount

574
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,080
of that is in the production, transport, consumption of food? Oh, yeah, sure. One fifth

575
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,760
of all our oil consumption is for the food system. That's more than all cars, planes, boats,

576
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,800
transportation combined. So it's a staggering amount of oil and part of it is-

577
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,640
It can't be combined though, because those-

578
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,880
No, combined. All transportation combined-

579
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,440
Is less than one fifth of our total oil consumption?

580
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,400
Mm-hmm. Because a lot of it's industry and other things. So yeah, it's pretty staggering.

581
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,440
And so the fracking-

582
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,920
So 20% of our energy utilization is to make fertilizer, deliver seed, harvest-

583
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,720
Yeah, pesticides, herbicides, all come from fossil fuels.

584
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,200
Stribute.

585
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,960
So the fertilizer starting gets even worse because once you, now you have all the gas you're using,

586
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,320
the methane release from that, when you put on the soil, it kills the soil.

587
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,000
And sorry, the purpose of fertilizer is to provide-

588
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,400
Nitrogen.

589
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,680
Generally nitrogen phosphorus, right?

590
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,520
Nitrogen, yes, nitrogen to the plants.

591
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,120
So again, just taking a step back for the biochemistry understanding of this.

592
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,280
I think plant biology by the way is so incredible.

593
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,920
Great.

594
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,600
Because I don't think people appreciate the significance of carbon fixation,

595
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:47,160
how complicated a chemical reaction it is to take carbon and join it to carbon like a plant can do.

596
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,600
So, I mean, it's very energy intensive, which is why it requires sunlight.

597
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,360
So you've got this photosynthetic thing. But basically plants need carbon,

598
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,480
which they're getting from the air. They need nitrogen and phosphorus,

599
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,720
which they're getting from their soil and they need energy and water,

600
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,800
which they're getting from the environment. And then they make biomass.

601
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,840
Yeah, exactly.

602
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,360
So the fertilizer is where we give them the nitrogen and the phosphorus, correct?

603
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,920
Yes, but most of the fertilizer that was growing plants historically came from

604
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,920
either nitrogen fixing plants like the legumes or from the animals.

605
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,360
The reason we have 50 feet of topsoil in some areas in this country,

606
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,600
150 years ago, is because of all millions of bison running around.

607
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,720
There was like bison and elk and all these ruminants that were running around in big herds,

608
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,400
chomping things down, moving on to the next spot, peeing and pooping, digging the thing,

609
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,400
saliva makes the grass grow. So it's this beautiful symbiotic system that built

610
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,800
literally tens of feet of topsoil. And it's not that we have too many cows, it's how we're growing.

611
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,760
I mean, I think it's worth pausing for a moment to explain for folks.

612
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,880
I'll try to do it quickly. There was a day, believe it or not, like 10 years ago when

613
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,160
I was obsessed with understanding agriculture. So everything I'm saying is 10 years old.

614
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:01,400
So you can correct me if I'm wrong. But basically, if you use corn as the model system,

615
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:07,320
and you look at the only metric that really matters, which is bushels per acre per year,

616
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:15,560
yield, it all comes down to yield. Basically, from the Civil War to about the end of World War II,

617
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:22,040
if you look at crop yield and you see the plot, it was about 20 bushels per acre per year.

618
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,800
So every acre could produce 20 bushels of corn per year. Obviously, it fluctuated quite a bit

619
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,480
from year to year, but it was a largely horizontal jagged line from about the end of the Civil War

620
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,520
to the end of World War II. And then something really interesting happens. At the end of World

621
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:48,200
War II, that line just turns up and just almost in a linear fashion rises to 200 bushels per acre

622
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,040
per year. And I think what a lot of people erroneously assume is, oh, it's the goddamn GMO.

623
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,000
Well, actually, no, not at all. GMO didn't even kick in until that number was 160.

624
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,360
It was nitrogen-based fertilizer, crop rotation, industrial farming, meaning the ability to actually

625
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:12,680
use machines to not just have a farmer out there doing something. It was selective breeding,

626
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,440
crossing. So it was a bunch of things that came in. Then basically, GMO has put a 10%

627
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,720
plus up on that from a yield perspective. Maybe, maybe. That's debatable.

628
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:28,120
So yeah, anyway, the point here is this process really began in earnest about 70 years ago.

629
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,720
And prior to 70 years ago, it's been remarkably flat. So of course, this goes back to something

630
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,240
you said earlier, which is post-World War II, we had to figure out how to feed a bunch of people.

631
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,840
And 20 bushels per acre per year was not cutting it. We're now 10 times the yield,

632
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,400
as you're pointing out, at quite a cost.

633
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,280
At quite a cost, yeah.

634
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,960
So the question then is, I mean, you talk about in your book how we're wasting a third of the food

635
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,520
produced. So we don't really need 2200 bushels per acre per year if we stop wasting. Have you

636
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,000
figured out or at least calculated what you think the sweet spot is, which is if you were to back

637
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,120
off the aggressive yield measures, not waste, how much of the benefit could you recapture that was

638
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,200
there when, for example, we used animals as our fertilizer?

639
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,240
That's right. There's sort of a fallacy in the idea that we can't produce the same amount of

640
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,880
food using regenerative methods. I think that's been disproven.

641
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,320
Do you believe, in other words, there is 200 bushels per acre per year using regenerative methods?

642
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,760
Well, let me just share a quick story. Now I want to share this story and I'm going to come back to

643
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,360
the fertilizer and talk about the rest of the different aspects that are causing climate change.

644
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,280
I think people need to understand that. There's a guy named Gabe Brown who was a North Dakota farmer,

645
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,840
5,000 acre farm, devastated by hail, devastated by weather, and was about to go bankrupt and then

646
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,200
decided he wanted to try regenerative agriculture. And many years ago, he started it. And now he says

647
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,040
he's built 29 inches of soil. He uses no chemical inputs, makes his own fertilizer from the animals

648
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,840
and the plants that he plants, the nitrogen fixing plants. He produces more food, better

649
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:14,040
quality food, and makes 20 times as much money as his neighbor. So in terms of productivity,

650
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,200
a regenerative farm is far more productive. And I think there's this fallacy that we need

651
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,160
green revolution, we need industrial agriculture to feed the world. That's really been disproven.

652
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:29,160
And I think that's the mantra of Big Ag. It's the mantra of Monsanto and now, which is bare,

653
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,960
and a lot of these big agrochemical companies that are trying to push their products on the

654
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,640
marketplace. And so I think we have to sort of be smart about going, wait a minute, it's not just

655
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,680
about trying to sort of go back to some old form of agriculture that isn't going to produce the

656
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,240
yields. No, I think this is not what was done. This is a sort of a new way of thinking. It combines

657
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,040
organic, but it also goes beyond that. And the reason is it sort of interrupts all these problems

658
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,520
that are actually driving climate change. So we talked about the fertilizer. Once you put it on

659
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:02,840
the soil, it damages the soil and it releases nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more potent

660
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,840
of greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So you're getting all the fracking, you're getting the

661
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,720
destruction of the soil on top of that. It's like a triple threat. As a backend side effect,

662
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,360
all that runs off into the river streams and lakes and goes into the oceans and has created dead

663
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,920
zones in 400 areas around the world the size of Europe. There's one the size of New Jersey in the

664
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,160
Gulf of Mexico that kills 212,000 metric tons of fish every year. It's a lot of gumbo and sushi.

665
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,320
And there's 400 of those around the world that are feeding 500 billion people. So this is what

666
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,360
fertilizer does alone. And then of course you have deforestation, the soil erosion, so forth.

667
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:45,960
And why is that not a problem when the fertilizer is coming from an organic nitrogen source versus

668
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,600
an inorganic one? Well, of course, right. So an organic nitrogen source poop goes in there and

669
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:57,400
nitrogen fixing plants and it stays in the soil as opposed to running off through this degraded soil

670
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,720
into the river stream. So is the issue the fertilizer or the nature of the soil that can't

671
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:08,040
hold the fertilizer? It's both. In order to get dirt to produce plants, you need to put on huge

672
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,080
amounts of fertilizer. Like I said, the increase in the use of fertilizer is seven fold compared

673
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,680
to 40 years ago. So if I'm understanding what you're saying, the problem with fertilizer

674
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:25,640
is it allows us to be lazy and rely less on healthy soil and because you can dump fertilizer

675
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:31,640
on dirt and eventually grow. Beating a dead horse. But if you actually want the healthiest soil

676
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:38,360
possible, you will get your nitrogen contribution from an element that stays within the ecosystem

677
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,000
of the soil because it's a part of it. And therefore you're not going to have the runoff.

678
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,360
Is that accurate? Exactly. And so you've got deforestation, you've got damage to soil and all

679
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,080
the ways we talked about and you've got transportation, refrigeration, processing,

680
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,280
distribution, those all cost energy and then food waste, which is a big cost. So how do you estimate

681
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,320
that? That is a staggering number that a third of our food is wasted. That is just what the sort of

682
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,120
conventional assessments are around food waste in the world. It's not in my opinion, it's what the

683
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,640
UN says. But I mean, what's the methodology by which one calculates that? Good question. I don't

684
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,560
know the answer to that question, but that's a good question. But I think it's a generally

685
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,960
accepted thing. It's between 30 to 40%. It's different for different reasons in the developing

686
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,880
world versus here. We throw out food in our kitchen, they have lose food in the food chain

687
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,680
because of lack of storage and transportation, refrigeration. So you've got all these causes

688
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:31,400
which add up to about 50% of climate change. And by shifting how we grow food and focusing on

689
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,320
regenerative agriculture, which specifically means regenerating soil and ecosystems, in other words,

690
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,560
increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil, increasing water retention, using crop

691
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:48,040
rotations, using cover crops so there's no bare soil, so using animals in very specific

692
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,840
grazing patterns that mimics nature to actually intensively graze the land and move the animals

693
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,760
around to actually stimulate the growth of the plants, stimulate the soil and so forth. So

694
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,120
all those techniques could be easily applied and are done in literally millions of acres around

695
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,840
the world with great benefit and high productivity and mitigating climate at the same time.

696
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:12,520
What's the obstacle to it? The obstacle is you've got a $15 trillion food industry that's

697
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:18,120
dependent on the products of industrial farming and is actually selling the seeds, it's selling

698
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,440
the fertilizer, it's selling the pesticides and herbicides, it's selling all the...

699
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,240
Is it the convenience? For example, when you talk about the gentleman you alluded to earlier

700
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,120
who basically switched, how many acres does he have?

701
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,000
5,000.

702
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,080
5,000 acres and he switched over to fully regenerative. Sounds like he's increased his

703
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,200
profitability.

704
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,840
Dramatically and resilience.

705
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,200
Has that increase in profitability come through higher price, higher volume or lower cost?

706
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:50,280
I mean, these farmers lose an average in this country about $1,600 a year. That's their net,

707
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,960
is minus $1,600 a year.

708
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,840
Per acre.

709
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,880
No, per farm. Like if you're a farmer, the average farmer, according to the USDA and other statistics,

710
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,960
loses money every year. He's making money because...

711
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,920
On the subsidies.

712
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,480
What do you mean?

713
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,080
Is the only reason he can make a living because of the subsidy?

714
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,120
This guy in North Dakota?

715
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,440
No, no, no, no. The farmer who's losing $1,600 a year.

716
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,840
Yeah, I mean, they have write-offs and subsidies and so forth. I mean,

717
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,760
Trump just bailed them out for $20 billion, which is almost as much as all the subsidies

718
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,800
that exist in the country annually, which is a lot of money. And the farmers struggle and they're

719
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,200
caught between basically the big ag and the government. The government's saying, you need

720
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,920
to produce these foods, here's the money to support you to do it. But that money then goes

721
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,280
to buy the seed from Monsanto or the glyphosate from Monsanto or the other agrochemicals and

722
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,200
fertilizer from Yara. So they're taking... They're just sort of the pass-through of the money from

723
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,000
the government to big ag and the industry. And that's the problem. Whereas this guy,

724
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,160
Gabe Brown in North Dakota, he doesn't have to buy seed. He doesn't have to buy fertilizer.

725
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,920
He doesn't have to buy glyphosate. He doesn't have to buy pesticides. He doesn't eat a lot

726
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,920
of irrigation because his soil holds so much water. He has a diverse ecosystem of animals and plants

727
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,240
that he can grow and sell and make a profit that's more than the others. And how long would

728
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,640
it take someone like him to make that transition? So it's about three to five years, depending. So

729
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,040
we need a massive effort for supporting and transforming our agricultural system to a

730
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,720
regenerative ag. And there's groups that are working on this like Kiss the Ground and

731
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,080
Carbon Underground that are consulting with governments around the world to help them

732
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,280
understand this. And the UN gets this. There's a huge report called Climate Change and Land Use

733
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:30,840
that came out in August 2019, which laid these problems out and how we are degrading our land

734
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,640
that's contributing to climate. And the solution is multifaceted, but includes restoring these

735
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,400
degraded lands. And people say, oh, we can't do this at scale. It's too expensive. The truth is,

736
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,200
if you look at all the conservation land in this country, if you look at all the conservation land

737
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,040
in this country, if you look at degraded lands that aren't being used properly, if you look at

738
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,760
land that's used to grow corn and soy for factory farm animals, that could be converted. And we

739
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,400
can literally double the amount of cows we produce every year on regenerative farms than we do now.

740
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,160
Not that we should, not that we need all that meat, but I'm just saying the argument that it's

741
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:07,080
not scalable, that it's not cost effective, it's just not true. And the truth is you can say you

742
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:11,560
can be vegan, fine, but we should all grow more plants. But there's a lot of land on the planet,

743
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,560
about 40% of the arable land, you can't grow food for humans. So these animals upcycle

744
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:23,000
inedible food and put it into a form that we can eat that's extremely nutrient dense. There's a

745
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,320
beautiful symbiotic ecosystem here. And you don't have to eat the animals if you don't want to,

746
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,000
I don't care, but they're needed for the regeneration of soil.

747
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,200
Who has done the most comprehensive life cycle assessment on this transformation as you describe

748
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,120
it? So how many acres are there of agricultural land in the United States, approximately?

749
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,240
Oh, good, Lord, I should know that. I don't, it's a lot of millions.

750
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,360
It's a lot of millions.

751
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:50,840
So if you take that number and on a per acre basis do the calculation of over five years,

752
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:57,320
everybody transitions to a more regenerative, appropriately rotated, covered ag position.

753
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,720
How many tons of CO2 can be sequestered per acre under those scenarios?

754
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:11,160
A lot. So the book called Drawdown is a wonderful explanation of the top solutions that exist today

755
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,520
that don't need to be invented that can draw down carbon out of the environment. And collectively,

756
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,280
the food solutions, Paul Hawken, yeah, he's a good friend of mine.

757
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,080
Yeah, actually, I'd like to interview him. He looks like someone who would be interesting

758
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,040
to interview on this topic.

759
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,000
Yeah, he's coming up with a new book called Regenerate, which is how do we regenerate

760
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,880
our health, regenerate the soil and so forth. And unexpectedly found that the food solutions

761
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,960
were the top solutions to fixed climate change that aren't really being implemented. And it's

762
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,840
been estimated that this much investment in billions results in this much value in trillions

763
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,480
and it reduces carbon by this many gigatons. And it's all in the book. So the calculation

764
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:52,120
has been done, the analysis has been done. And I think it's been estimated by some that we could

765
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,840
draw down anywhere from 30% to 100% of all the carbon that's been released since the Industrial

766
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,000
Revolution if we can scale this up. What's the biggest counter argument to this?

767
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,720
There isn't any. I mean, I think the argument is we need to have industrial agriculture to

768
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,880
feed the world. That's the mantra. It's like calories are all the same. It's that same mantra

769
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,600
that isn't science-based, but that suits the needs of agrochemical and agribusiness.

770
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,160
But there's no one that's got a pushback argument that says, no, these calculations are overly

771
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,720
optimistic and you would introduce a new problem if you do this.

772
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:29,000
Of course, there are people all the time who are trying to refute this. And whether it's

773
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,240
agribusiness or even the vegan communities come out and say regenerative agriculture is not going

774
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,280
to solve a problem. People like Pat Brown from Impossible Foods has been really clearly stating

775
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,120
that we need to get rid of all meat, that even regenerative meat doesn't work in terms of

776
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,680
protecting the environment. And he quotes various studies that were, I do analyze in my book Food

777
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,640
Fix, talk about how they're flawed and actually miss a lot of the data. So I think it does take

778
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,200
time to create regenerative agriculture. It does take effort. But once you do it, there's an

779
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,400
incredible value chain that gets put in place. And there are countries that are understanding

780
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:08,280
this. We take out of the earth a lot of natural capital, about $125 trillion a year of resources

781
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,840
and soil and everything else that we steal from the earth. We don't put it back and it's running

782
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,640
out. How much did you say? 125 trillion. And the global GDP is probably 80 to 90 trillion.

783
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,480
I was about to say that's more than the global GDP.

784
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, which is about 80 to 90, right? It's more than that every year. And there's a lot of people

785
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,760
working on this. For example, there's a private equity company called Farmland LP that's buying

786
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,160
up conventional farms, converting them to regenerative agriculture and moving those farms

787
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,240
from single digit profits to high double digit. Their first fund had a 67% return. And when they

788
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:45,960
look at the benefit they provide to the environment, we call ecosystem services. That's the $125

789
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:52,040
million of ecosystem services, the natural capital we borrow. They add $21 million of value on their

790
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:57,320
farms versus a similar amount of conventional farms would actually steal $8 million of value

791
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,120
from the earth. And countries like Costa Rica are paying for ecosystem services for their farmers

792
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,760
or paying them to produce more soil to actually conserve water, to increase biodiversity, which

793
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,440
we haven't even talked about, which is a whole other topic.

794
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,600
I want to get to it. Let's see. Talk to me a little bit about, it's funny, Pat Brown was one

795
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,760
of my professors in medical school. Oh, geez. Okay. So I mean, I don't know if a lot of people

796
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:24,440
realized what a prominent scientist Pat was. And if you look at the type of work Pat did in the 90s,

797
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,120
I mean, it's not inconceivable. He could have gone down the path of a Nobel prize.

798
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,400
Yeah. I mean, they're a smart guy, but the challenge is you don't have to vilify

799
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,000
people wanting to do regenerative agriculture. Yeah. And I was just going to say, I don't know

800
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,280
anything about Pat. I know very little about their philosophy around why they've created the,

801
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,840
is it the impossible burger? There's two of these out there. One's-

802
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,800
Beyond burger, beyond meat and impossible burger.

803
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,480
Okay. And I can never get the two of them straight, but-

804
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,880
I mean, one is pea based, which is the beyond meat and one is GMO soy based, which is-

805
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,040
And that's up the GMO one must be Pat's.

806
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,400
If you look at the light, you last about a life cycle analysis, Qantas, which is an

807
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,560
independent life cycle analysis company did an analysis of the impossible burger compared to

808
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:09,800
regenerally raised beef burger. And the impossible burger was far better than a

809
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,760
conventional factory farm burger, but it added three and a half kilos of carbon for every burger

810
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,200
you ate. Which one did?

811
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
The impossible burger.

812
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,120
So say that again.

813
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,560
So the impossible burger was better than a factory farm burger by far,

814
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,200
but it still added three and a half kilos of carbon to the environment for every burger.

815
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,200
A regenerally raised burger, including methane, everything, all the inputs,

816
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,880
took out three and a half kilos of carbon. Meaning you'd have to eat

817
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,600
one regenerally raised beef burger to offset the carbon emissions of a impossible burger.

818
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,480
So I'm not against plant-based meats, but I think we can't overstate the importance of-

819
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,720
And what, by comparison, what was the factory farm burger? Do you remember how much carbon was added?

820
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,960
Three and a half kilos of carbon were removed-

821
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,840
No, no, no. Sorry, the factory farm-

822
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,560
The factory, oh, it was a lot. It was like 50 or it was a lot. It was significantly less.

823
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:01,080
But still, it's not the only answer. When you think about scaling up impossible burgers on a

824
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:06,520
GMO monocrop soy field using tons of glyphosate, which has all sorts of harmful consequences,

825
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,960
causing soil erosion to the way we farm, damaging the waterways, damaging everything else. I mean,

826
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,000
just it doesn't even add up, right? So let's do it right.

827
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,440
So let's talk a little bit about GMO. This is a loaded topic.

828
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,480
Again, I think people don't understand what it means. And that's sort of, I want to talk about

829
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,760
it, but I also want to just put it in context for people so that we understand what GM means

830
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:36,280
and why it came about. So we go back to the 1940s, we had growing old maize on 20 bushels

831
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,920
per acre per year. Well, we got to remember that used to be something called Tia-cente.

832
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,720
That was like this little tiny, silly crop that was the size of our finger. And it had like four

833
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,920
little kernels on it. That's where corn came from. So I was explaining this to my kids the

834
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,400
other day, because we were, my kids are obsessed with gardening and stuff. And I was saying, look,

835
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:01,160
there's four things about a plant that really matter. If you're planting crops, yield matters.

836
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:06,840
How much do you have? Product profile. I mean, is it good to eat or not? Yeah. Or in the case of

837
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,960
Tia-cente, it had a lousy product profile because it just had four kernels on it. Harvestability.

838
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,200
The other problem with Tia-cente is the little kernels would always fall off it. You actually

839
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,920
wanted the kernels to stay on the thing so you could harvest the whole plant. And crop protection.

840
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:28,040
Can you keep it away? Can you keep the critters away from it? So GMO has had by far its greatest

841
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:37,000
impact in crop protection. The BT insertion is basically what allowed Roundup Ready crops to be

842
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,080
resistant to glyphosate. We'll use the terms glyphosate. The BC is for the cotton, right?

843
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,200
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's pesticide resistant. Yeah, pesticide resistant. So there's a glyphosate

844
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,160
resistance that, and we'll use, like I said, we'll use glyphosate and Roundup interchangeably.

845
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,440
But if you could basically genetically modify a plant to be resistant to the thing that you use

846
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,320
to kill the pest, you can use that thing liberally, right? I mean, for all the promise of GMO,

847
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:04,920
basically the only two inventions have been the BT pesticides. The BT and the glyphosate resistance.

848
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,960
Yeah. That's it. And that's led to massive increases in the use of pesticides.

849
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:16,280
The first point to make here is most of the yield gains came long before this. So obviously you do

850
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,480
get some yield gain with crop protection. So there's an overlap, but virtually all of it came

851
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:26,920
before this. All of the harvestability, to my knowledge, there's been no GM addition to

852
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:32,760
harvestability and no GM addition to product profile. Although some might argue that it's

853
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:39,000
low hanging fruit. For example, I know Monsanto was very aggressively looking at trying to

854
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,000
engineer tomatoes that could grow in brackish water. And that way you would obviously open up

855
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,120
the ability to grow it in areas that where you don't have fresh water. Okay. So with all of that

856
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:55,160
said, the next question for the person to be thinking about that you're going to take us through

857
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:02,840
is there are at least two things about GM that could be problematic. The first is it could be

858
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,640
problematic that you are eating an organism that now has a gene that looks different from the

859
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,400
gene that we evolved to consume it. In other words, it now makes different proteins that it

860
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,360
didn't make that are foreign. And cause food is information. So how is that different information

861
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,960
affecting your biology and how's it regulating the different body functions? I don't think we

862
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:31,560
know much about that. The second thing that could be harmful about GM is that by its very success,

863
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:37,000
it enables the use of chemicals in a higher concentration than you would be able to use them

864
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,400
in the absence of GM. And we'll use Roundup or glyphosate as the poster child for that.

865
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,080
Can you talk through both of those and what the state of the evidence is for the harm of GM?

866
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:53,320
Because it should be noted that what you're about to say is that the backdrop or stands at odds with

867
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:58,920
what the USDA would tell us, what the National Association of Scientists would tell us, which is

868
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:04,440
GMO is safe. Feel free to consume it liberally. And so tell us where you think that might be

869
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,360
questionable. Well, there's a bunch of issues there. First is it's a large uncontrolled experiment

870
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:14,680
on humanity. Just like Crisco was invented in 1911 as this great new invention was in our food supply

871
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:20,360
for, I don't know, 80 or 90 years more before people were like, wait a minute, this isn't good

872
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,760
for us. It's killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Let's get it out. So we don't know.

873
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,800
I think there's animal studies that looks concerning. There's various issues. I think

874
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,800
in terms of the use of these chemicals, there's two issues there. One is the plants are

875
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:42,040
increasingly mutating to be resistant to these substances. So you need more pesticides and more

876
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,120
glyphosate to do the same job. So there's all these weeds that are becoming resistant to glyphosate

877
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,000
that they're trying to fight. And then that's a problem because we're using more and more of

878
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,360
these chemicals. Europe followed a different path. It didn't allow GMO foods, didn't allow any of

879
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,480
that. And so what the comparative analysis of agriculture in the US versus Europe was no

880
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:05,080
difference in yields and far less use of pesticides and herbicides. It sort of didn't fulfill its

881
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:10,360
promise of yields and decreased use of chemicals. It was transient. I believe there was a transient

882
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,720
reduction in pesticide use until we started to see resistance. Is that correct? Yeah. And we're

883
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,800
using more and more of these chemicals. And glyphosate is 70% of the agrochemicals used on

884
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,240
the planet. It's increasingly being linked to harmful human effects. So forget about the

885
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,000
insertion of the gene as an issue. We know that these chemicals are harmful to this. Do we know

886
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,680
this? This is an important point. Yeah. I mean, aside from the litigation, which is not a scientific

887
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:39,640
judgment, it's a traditional judgment, but there's 14,000 lawsuits around glyphosate. There's been

888
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,560
billion dollar settlements. A friend of mine's a lawyer is involved with those lawsuits. He told

889
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:49,240
me that on Discovery, they found that the Trump administration said to Monsanto, now bear, we have

890
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,680
your back. And the EPA recently is trying to shut down any further lawsuits on glyphosate,

891
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:00,040
which is fascinating because it's sort of disclosed emails. And I think the effects on animal studies

892
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,240
are really clear. I just read a study in epigenetics in glyphosate where they looked at

893
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:08,440
interventional studies on rats, where they looked at giving the generation zero glyphosate and

894
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:15,880
infected their grand rats in multiple ways through prostate disease, cancer, various things.

895
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,800
But we've seen this before, Mark. I mean, we've seen lots of things where in the lab,

896
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:25,320
they're using doses that are significantly higher than the human exposure and or laboratory animals

897
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,600
behave differently than humans. Okay, fine. But are we willing to take that risk? I know it's

898
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,080
another study where glyphosate disrupts the microbiome in significant ways in animals. And

899
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,600
the dose that's in one impossible burger is 110 times the dose that was used in the animal studies

900
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,680
to totally disrupt the microbiome of the rats. But do we know how bioavailable it is and how

901
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:49,480
much it remains? Well, it's on the food. I mean, I try to eat organic. I try to eat non-GMO. Like I

902
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:55,400
travel, I'm not perfect. And I did my urine test to look at my glyphosate levels. And I was shocked.

903
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:00,200
I have a 50th percentile glyphosate in my urine. How do we do this test? You could pee in a bucket

904
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,760
and you send it into the lab. Great Plains Lab has this test available and you can check your

905
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:10,360
glyphosate levels. I was shocked. And I think most of us are sort of walking toxic dumps. And if you

906
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:17,480
looked at average fat biopsy of a human, it's full of DDT, dioxin, pesticides. It's pretty

907
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,760
bad. So I think we are still in an uncontrolled experiment. So your view is basically to take the

908
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,640
precautionary principle, which is look, we may never know this definitively. There's enough

909
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,920
suggestion that this could be harmful through animal models or other things like that. I mean,

910
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,840
for example, I mean, again, I'm just, I'm pushing back not because I don't necessarily agree with

911
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,240
you on a personal level and make a lot of the same choices myself. You're not sprinkling glyphosate

912
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:47,000
on your salads. You know, I stopped a couple of weeks ago. I used, I just, I love the taste of glyphosate.

913
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You're like putting it all over your lawn. But again, I always think it's important to sort of

914
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,800
at least let people understand when something is where our level of confidence is very high versus

915
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,920
modest, but there's a precautionary approach to take out of it. In other words, I feel much more

916
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:09,880
comfortable saying tobacco is causally responsible for lung cancer than I feel saying glyphosate is

917
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,800
causally responsible for human disease. I just don't, I just haven't been convinced by the data.

918
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,240
If it was the only way to grow food, fine. We deal with the risk. It's not, it's not the best way.

919
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:24,760
It's not the most effective way. And there is potential risk. And there's real concern about

920
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,400
our industrial agricultural system on the earth and soil biodiversity. And also,

921
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,520
I sort of interrupted you when you were about to make a point about biodiversity.

922
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,920
That was something I learned recently. Yeah, it's an important issue. But before I get to that,

923
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,240
I just want to finish this thought about how this industrial system has sort of usurped

924
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:45,640
small farmholders, which are the majority of farmers that feed the majority of the world.

925
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,960
And these farmers are getting squeezed by these big ag companies are coming in and saying they're

926
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,360
going to improve their livelihood, but then forced them to buy their seed, forced them to buy their

927
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:02,520
chemicals. And there's increasing suicides and terrible economic consequences from these

928
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,920
farmers around the world because they're not able to maintain a livelihood doing what they're doing.

929
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,960
So it's not just that it's an issue around health. It's also an issue around squeezing a lot of the

930
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,400
people who do grow most of the food in the world. So it's another issue I talked about in the book.

931
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,560
Before we leave that then, do you know what the median farm is in the United States

932
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,760
in terms of acreage? I don't. I did know, but I don't, I can't keep all the facts in my head.

933
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,480
And what is approximately most farmers in the world, it's like less than five acres is most of

934
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,000
the farmers in the world that feed most of the world. Does that include the United States?

935
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,240
No. We're more industrial. Yeah. More industrial. Yeah. For sure. I mean,

936
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:42,040
either less and less farms for you and for farmers, it's increasing all the time, bigger and bigger

937
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,880
farms. I mean, girl, but said it under Nixon, go big or go home. In doing the research for your

938
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:51,400
bookmark, did you spend any time with these farmers and did you sense in them a degree of

939
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,520
dissatisfaction or let down with this promise of big ag that came about 20 years ago?

940
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,040
Oh my God. Yeah. I think more and more farmers are thinking about this. There was an article

941
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,880
in Time Magazine where all the Democratic candidates in Iowa were going out of the farms

942
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,720
and the farmers were like, look, our livelihoods are being destroyed. We're having floods. We're

943
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:12,040
not able to grow food. The system isn't working. We want to explore regenerative agriculture. So

944
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,760
it's definitely happening, not because they're hippies who want to go back to the land. It's

945
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,640
happening just from an economic imperative and the way to restore and save their farms.

946
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,440
But do farmers feel captive now to Monsanto and Pioneer and these other companies?

947
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:30,760
They do. They have a system and they don't have a way to get out of it. So they're in a vicious

948
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,160
cycle. They've got all this capital and their equipment. They're stuck in this vicious cycle

949
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,880
of growing the same crops and they have no way out. So we do need a bridge for these people and we do

950
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:44,680
need mechanisms through government and private equity and others to actually help fund the

951
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:49,240
transition. I think, like I said, the UN said $300 billion, boom, we could solve the problem

952
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:53,880
of climate change and give us 20 years more runway to solve the bigger issues.

953
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:59,960
So it's a massive effort that could actually transform our quality of our food, quality of

954
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,320
our soils, save our water, increase biodiversity, which we'll talk about, and so many of our global

955
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,200
problems just starting at the seed. So back to biodiversity. So what that means is that we talk

956
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,960
about extinction of species, but it's not just some frog in the Amazon. We've lost 90% of our

957
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:22,200
edible plant species. Basically 60% of our calories comes from corn and wheat and rice and soy,

958
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:27,400
and mostly from 12 species. We've lost 90% of our edible plant species, half of all our livestock

959
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,240
species. There's a lot of weird animals all over the place and you travel to foreign countries,

960
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,800
you see these weird cows and weird pigs and weird goats and they all look different. Now they're

961
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:42,040
all the same that we produce in this country. And we have lost 75% of our pollinator species,

962
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,240
which our agriculture depends, which Einstein said, if we lose bees from the face of the earth,

963
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,120
humans have four years left to live, which may be true or not, but it's an existential threat.

964
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,720
Butterflies, pollinators all damaged also by these pesticides and chemicals that are indiscriminate

965
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,800
in what they kill. They were basically nerve gases that were produced in World War I and II that were

966
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:08,680
factories retooled to produce agrochemicals. That's what the bombs were. I mean, how Timothy

967
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:15,560
McVeigh bombed in Oklahoma, that building was through going to a farm store and buying nitrogen

968
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,960
fertilizer and turning into a bomb. That's where it actually came from. So these chemicals that

969
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,920
we use in the soil, the methods of farming destroy the ecosystems, both from all those,

970
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,520
but also the biodiversity of the soil, the organism, the soil that are so critical,

971
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,520
the mycorrhizal fungi, the bacteria, the nematodes, the worms, all these different animals that live

972
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,800
in the soil that are necessary to actually create food and to create sustainable agriculture. And

973
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,760
so I think we're sort of asleep to the idea that we're sort of running out of soil, running out of

974
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,920
these biodiverse animals that are essential for our health and our survival. I mean, coral reefs,

975
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,960
I mean, with climate change, we're destroying all the coral reefs. And again, 500 billion people

976
01:20:53,960 --> 01:21:00,440
depend on these coral reefs for food. So how would one go about moving the needle on this?

977
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,280
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying. So I wrote the book Food Fix, How to Save Our Health, Our Economy,

978
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,280
Our Communities, and Our Planet, one by at a time in order to lay out the problem and lay out the

979
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,440
solutions. And they're multifaceted. They're what citizens can do, they're what can happen in

980
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,040
business innovation, like I mentioned. We're going to come back and talk about an example around food

981
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,960
waste. And they're what policymakers need to do. And there needs to be the political will, but it's

982
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,720
really tough. So can we start at the bottom of that? And let me ask you another couple of

983
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:30,440
questions. What does organic really mean when it comes to plant or meat? If a person says,

984
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,640
okay, Mark, you've definitely convinced me that I want to be more mindful of what I'm buying.

985
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,480
Let's just assume that this is a person who has the economic flexibility to make the food choices

986
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,120
that might even increase their budget on groceries. So first of all, what does it mean when you go to

987
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:50,200
the grocery store and you see two boxes of strawberries, one's organic, one's not?

988
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:55,320
Well, organic is a certification that's delivered by the government that means no antibiotics,

989
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:02,760
no pesticides, no herbicides, and has to be certified that it's clean of all of that. However,

990
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,720
it doesn't certify the method of growing the food. So Michael Pollan, his book, Omnivore's

991
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,200
Lemma, talked about industrial organic. So if you have these massive monocrop lettuce fields,

992
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,720
you're doing tillage, you're not doing cover crops, you're not doing crop rotations,

993
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:21,800
you're also not super helping the soil. It's better than industrial farming, but it's not

994
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:27,000
fully regenerative. Regenerative is a method of farming that actually includes organic,

995
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,080
but goes beyond it. And there is now a regenerative organic certification, which you can look up,

996
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,600
and I talk about in my book. But the chemicals and the pesticides that we consume have an impact on

997
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:42,120
our health. It's been estimated that pesticide exposure just in children is responsible for

998
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:49,000
an average loss of seven IQ points or 41 million IQ points in kids. So there's a lot of brain power

999
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,480
that's killed, and not to mention how many per kid. I think it's like seven IQ points. There's

1000
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,720
literally millions of pounds of these pesticides and herbicides that are in our food supply and

1001
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:02,040
our water. And some plants have more than others. So I'm on the board of the Environmental Working

1002
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:08,360
Group, and they produce a really great guide called the Dirty Dozen and the Clean 15. So you can

1003
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,920
look at that list, and if you're having economic issues or whatever, you can say, well, strawberries

1004
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,960
are the worst thing I could buy if they're not organic. Whereas, you know, banana or an avocado,

1005
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,680
maybe not a big deal if it's not organic. So you can look at that list and go,

1006
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,920
I'm going to save money by buying organic of the things that are the worst contaminated,

1007
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,960
and I can cheat on the other ones that are not. And it's part of that because in the case of

1008
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,960
bananas and avocado, you're eating what's inside and not outside. Whereas in the strawberry,

1009
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,800
it's like got this surface that you collect it all. Celery is terrible. Never have anything

1010
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:48,520
but organic celery, for example. In meat, besides not using hormones in the animals and not giving

1011
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,920
them antibiotics, is there anything else that comes in the distinction of organic meat?

1012
01:23:53,560 --> 01:24:00,680
Again, it's not using the inputs that are chemical inputs that are on the corn that you have or the

1013
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,400
soil that they have. So that's good. But again, it doesn't mean that they couldn't be fed organic

1014
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,280
corn that's still grown in ways that are destroying the soil. So we really have to sort of think more

1015
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:14,920
nuanced about what that means. That's why regenerative is sort of organic plus, you know,

1016
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:20,360
it's like a whole next level. How ubiquitous is that regenerative organic label? It's not.

1017
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,040
It's not. It's not. It's not even a label yet. There's just a proposal for a regenerative organic

1018
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,120
certification. And yet there are farms who are doing this, and there's ways to regulate it and

1019
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:32,040
measure it. And I think the government's going to be able to sort of put out field service workers

1020
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,600
to measure soil, to measure these things, to look at is it regenerative. And places like Mariposa

1021
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,480
Ranch in California, you can buy half a cow with a bunch of friends and it's eight bucks a pound,

1022
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,880
which for a four-ounce serving is less than you'd pay for McDonald's hamburger. So you can, with

1023
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,280
little ingenuity and effort, you can actually start to sort of find how to get these things.

1024
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:54,600
But it's the demand that's going to increase. And that's why, for example, General Mills and

1025
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,160
Danone and Nestle and Pepsi even are looking at how do we get our supply chain to be more

1026
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:03,000
regenerative and how are we going to move that needle. It's kind of exciting to me.

1027
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,080
Is there anything else a consumer can do absent the types of bigger changes that you're pushing

1028
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:14,840
for and hoping for? I mean, I think being really focused on what you eat and where it comes from,

1029
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,520
buying at local farmers markets, joining a community supported agriculture,

1030
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,960
looking for regenerative sources online, buying things together with friends.

1031
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,880
What are the resources people can use to find those things? Are these centralized in any way?

1032
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:30,200
Yeah, they're on my book, Food Fix. And they're on our website.

1033
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,000
What's the URL?

1034
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,560
Foodfixbook.com. And there's a video on there and five steps to heal the planet and yourself. And

1035
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,560
there's an action guide that is good for citizens, businesses, governments, and so forth. So that it

1036
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:48,840
says, what can you do? And so, yes, you can vote with your fork and all the ways I just mentioned.

1037
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,120
You can be active in your community. Maybe you should have a compost pile. I'm talking about

1038
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,240
that, but you can be active to sort of have community garden to get it.

1039
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:59,720
You know, my son for his fifth birthday, it's like, okay, what do you want, Reese?

1040
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,480
He wanted a compost box. All right. There you go.

1041
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,960
You know how hard it was to find one? You couldn't go to Home Depot and get one. You couldn't go to

1042
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,880
the local garden store. Like it took... Really? They have them on Amazon. You can buy them and

1043
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,720
have them shipped to you. I think ultimately, it sounds silly. I think ultimately we did that,

1044
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,480
but I was, I think with kids, sometimes it's fun to take them to the place and get the thing.

1045
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
I was amazed how hard it was to get a big compost.

1046
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:24,760
You don't even need that. I just put a little fence, a little kind of some two by fours and

1047
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,920
built a little box and you just throw it in my backyard and just throw it in there year after

1048
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:35,240
year. And I've got like tons of feet of this dark, rich soil, like a humus that goes on the garden.

1049
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:40,120
It's great. If you want to be politically active, you can go in your municipality and say to your

1050
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,960
local government, say, look, let's have a composting law. Let's make it mandatory,

1051
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,960
like San Francisco did. You can't go and throw your garbage in San Francisco anymore.

1052
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:53,240
I just don't know if I want to do anything San Francisco is doing. I gotta be honest with you.

1053
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:58,280
No, whatever. But I mean, France, if you have mandatory composting there and if you don't,

1054
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,760
you get a fine, you go to jail. In Massachusetts, they passed a law that if you make a ton of

1055
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,480
organic waste every week, you can't throw it out in the landfill. And they actually created

1056
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,880
innovation there. There's people coming up like dairy farmers are making less money struggling.

1057
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,600
The dairy farmer creates these anaerobic digesters, which gets food waste. They get

1058
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,200
about a hundred tons of food waste every week in this one farm from like Whole Foods and other

1059
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:26,120
grocery stores. They put in their manure from the animals. It basically combusts in this digester,

1060
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,280
produces electricity for 1500 homes and makes the farmer an extra hundred grand a year.

1061
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:35,560
And it's a win-win-win for everybody. To me, I always feel like that's the better. Whether

1062
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,360
that particular example works at scale or not, I have no idea. But it seems to me the we're going

1063
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:45,960
to put you in jail if you don't compost approach is the wrong approach versus the let's economically

1064
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:52,600
incentivize you to do this thing differently. And I worry that there's too much emphasis on the

1065
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,120
punishment side of things. I don't think humans work that way. And it's also a slippery slope

1066
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:04,840
because the government doesn't exactly have a track record of great competence. So for everything

1067
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:10,360
that they do right, they're probably doing three things wrong. And therefore, I mean, again, I don't

1068
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:15,400
want to sound like too much of a libertarian anti-nanny state guy, but I feel like I kind of need to

1069
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:20,920
sound like the libertarian anti-nanny state guy when it comes to these things. Because the government,

1070
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,520
as you point out, is a big part of the reason we got in this mess. And to quote Einstein again,

1071
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:30,840
and I might be bastardizing this quote, but the same level of consciousness that produced

1072
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,000
these problems will be incapable of solving them. That's true. But we do have a lot of regulations

1073
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,920
that protect citizens, right? We have seatbelt laws and emission controlled laws and cars. We have

1074
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:46,440
baby seats and all sorts of things that we mandated that now people accept. And we have airbags, which

1075
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:51,000
the industry didn't like, and seatbelts, which they hated. And we just sort of accept that. And I think

1076
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,720
there's a role for government in actually helping incentivize the right thing. And I think the law

1077
01:28:55,720 --> 01:29:00,360
making it not okay for big companies to throw out all their waste in a landfill. And the reason to

1078
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:05,160
back up a little on that is food waste, incredible problem. Like we said, 30 to 40% of all food

1079
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:10,520
producers wasted. If it was grown on landmass, it would require the entire country of China

1080
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:15,480
to grow all that food that we throw out. The average family throws out about a pound a day

1081
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,400
or about $1,800 a year of food. And if it were a country in terms of the greenhouse gases that get

1082
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,120
produced when you throw it in landfills and it rots and emits methane, it would be the third largest

1083
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:31,320
emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China. And it's about $2 trillion of resources

1084
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:36,120
that we waste in throwing out all the food. And we produce more than a food for 10 billion people

1085
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,160
on the planet. It's just not equitably distributed. It's a big problem to solve and nobody's for it.

1086
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:47,880
Even Trump administration has created a food waste initiative with the EPA, the FDA, and the USDA. And

1087
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:53,320
they basically like, oh, it's the FDA, the EPA, yeah, and USDA to actually deal with the food waste

1088
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,280
issue. So I think each of us can stop that. That's an easy thing to do. And there's a lot of other

1089
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,760
things we can do to get involved in our political process through being involved in communicating

1090
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,760
with your Congressman senators or something called the Food Policy Action Group, which is

1091
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:11,000
foodpolicyaction.org that rates your senators and congressmen on their voting records on food and

1092
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,520
ag policy. So you can see, and they can, they've literally unseated congressmen who are doing bad

1093
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,760
things and voting the wrong way around food and policy issues that people care about. So there's

1094
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:28,200
a lot of things we can do as individuals. USDA, what's their role in this? Oh my God,

1095
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,200
you have another couple of hours. I go through all this in the book, but just at the high level,

1096
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:38,200
the USDA is responsible for a number of different food and ag policies that are the majority of the

1097
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:43,320
things that are going on. Our dietary guidelines, which are messed up. Our school lunch guidelines,

1098
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:48,760
which are messed up. Our SNAP program or food stamp program, which is 75 billion a year. It's

1099
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:53,080
one of our biggest government programs that feeds 46 million Americans, including one in four kids

1100
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,640
who are food insecure. Great idea, but there's no nutrition guidelines in that. So there are

1101
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:03,080
$7 billion a year just in soda that we spend, about 30 billion servings a year. You can buy

1102
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:09,240
soda with food stamps? Oh yeah, of course you can buy anything except alcohol and cooked food. So

1103
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,320
you can buy a two liter bottle of soda, but you can't buy rotisserie chicken in the grocery store.

1104
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:22,120
And 75% of the food stamps is junk food or soda. That's about a $730 billion program, which is

1105
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:27,960
massive over a period of 10 years. And so there's no nutrition guidelines in there. And so you've got

1106
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:34,200
all these government programs, plus the crop insurance and agricultural supports that support

1107
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:39,400
an industrial agricultural system. And those are harmful in sense. So if you have a big soy and

1108
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:43,720
corn farm and you want to grow a whole bunch of veggies, you can't, even if you want to,

1109
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:48,760
because you will get penalized and not get your crop insurance. So farmers are disincentivized

1110
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,360
from growing fruits and vegetables. And the government tells us on the one hand to eat half

1111
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:57,720
of our plate as fruits and vegetables, but less than half a percent of industrial supports,

1112
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,960
of agricultural supports from the government are for fruits and vegetables. So it's like,

1113
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:07,080
basically, if we were eating what the government actually funded in agricultural supports,

1114
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:13,240
we'd be having a giant corn fritter, deep fried in soybean oil. And it's like, that's not exactly

1115
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:17,960
what we should be eating. That's a very powerful image, Mark, is that not that necessarily the

1116
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:25,320
USDA's recommendations on nutrition are correct, but even if you took that as an aspiration,

1117
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:30,520
it's interesting to note that the funding doesn't align with that. So how does the USDA respond to

1118
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,520
that, especially because it's not a subtle, they're not off by a little bit. They're off by an order

1119
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:39,800
of magnitude. A quarter of less than a half a percent versus 50%. So what is their response to

1120
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:46,120
that? I don't know. I just think it's just the right hand is not talking the left hand. And so

1121
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,960
there's all these disparate policies. I was working with Tim Ryan and my friend Dariah

1122
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:56,440
Mazafarian from Harvard Tufts to get an analysis by the government accountability office to look

1123
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:01,720
at what our disparate policies were doing to our public health and to our economic health as a

1124
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:07,080
nation because they're all cross purposes. We say, don't drink soda, eat healthy diet,

1125
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,680
so forth with dietary guidelines, but then we pay for 75 billion a year in junk food for the poor.

1126
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:16,920
How does that make sense? And so I think we have all these government agencies, which the FDA that

1127
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,880
has confusing food labels or that allows antibiotics in our animal feed or that allows

1128
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:26,280
substances that are banned in other countries to be, they're toxic to be in our food supply like

1129
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:31,880
Azodicarbonamide, which is basically a softener for flower products for bread. I mean, if you use

1130
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:38,440
that in Singapore, you get a $450,000 fine and you go to jail for 15 years. I mean, Singapore is

1131
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:44,840
Singapore, but still like it's not even allowed. And we have the FDA, the FTC, which regulates the

1132
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,000
airwaves allows all this unrestricted marketing to kids. So you've got all these different agencies

1133
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,920
that are working cross purposes that aren't coordinated and aren't creating a coherent food

1134
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:57,960
policy. So we need a national food policy. We need activism to change some of these food policies

1135
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,760
and support regenerative ag and to reform food stamps and dysfunctional policies to reform

1136
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,640
school lunches and to actually help advance in healthcare food as medicine. All these things

1137
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:12,520
can be done. And I'm actually working on a campaign with some extraordinary people who are

1138
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:17,800
launching a nonprofit and an advocacy group, otherwise known as a lobby group for the good

1139
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,440
guys to start to work on these issues in Washington. Because while it may seem like

1140
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,680
nothing can be done, I think behind the scenes a lot can be done. And I think there are a lot of

1141
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:31,400
these issues are bipartisan issues. I just think people are ready for this. There's a movement and

1142
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,480
a readiness around the country and even in Washington to address these issues. I mean,

1143
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,360
I just gave a talk at somewhere and someone knew one of the centers from Maine and they called me

1144
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,440
the next day and was like, what can you help with this? And I said, well, 70% of the military recruits

1145
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:49,800
are unfit to fight and 70% of the evacuations from Afghanistan and Iraq were not for more

1146
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,440
injuries, but were for obesity related injuries and the soldiers. And then they want to figure

1147
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:58,680
this out. So I am hopeful because I see that despite all these issues, people are waking up

1148
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:04,920
to these problems. I see these big food companies like Nestle, Denone, Unilever, and so forth,

1149
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:09,240
General Mills actually starting to take on these issues. I mean, they still are part of the problem,

1150
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:14,920
but they are trying to move their super tankerships and it takes a while, but I do see room for hope.

1151
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,480
I see business innovations, food and act tech companies are billions and billions are flowing

1152
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:23,160
into these areas for innovation, which is all a good thing. What do you think are the

1153
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:29,640
top three changes? If you were foods are, and you had to rank order sort of the biggest,

1154
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:35,080
are there three things that could make 70% of the difference? Yes, I would immediately transform

1155
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:41,240
healthcare reimbursement to focus on food as medicine through paying for food for those who

1156
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,640
are food insecure, for reimbursing fruit and vegetable prescriptions, for making food a

1157
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:50,360
central part of the government. And that would include having all the government is probably

1158
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,880
the biggest food purchaser in the country. Have them only purchase food that is going to promote

1159
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,320
health and not disease. I would then secondly, reform these dysfunctional food policies. I would

1160
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:06,440
transform SNAP, transform school lunches, transform the dietary guidelines to be science-based.

1161
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:11,960
And lastly, I would actually support Regenerabag in every way possible through government policies

1162
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,040
and through business innovations, incentives and other things. So those three pillars,

1163
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:21,080
one fixing food is medicine into the healthcare system and reimbursement policies and in every

1164
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:26,760
government institution, reforming dysfunctional government food policies and supporting Regenerabag.

1165
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:32,040
And that's really the whole agenda of the Food Fix campaign. We've sort of glossed over it a

1166
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:37,000
little bit, but I guess no discussion on this would be complete without coming back to maybe

1167
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:44,680
some of the confusion that exists around a plant-based diet exclusively as a solution for, and let's

1168
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:50,600
put aside the health issues for a moment, because there's obviously lots to debate around whether

1169
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,120
animal-based products have deleterious health consequences. And let's put aside also the sort

1170
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:02,920
of egregious cruelty to animals that takes place under farmed conditions. And factory farming should

1171
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:08,040
be banned period, full stop. Yeah, I don't think anybody that spent any time actually going and

1172
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,920
watching how animals are harvested in that way would disagree with that. So let's instead focus

1173
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:17,320
on specifically the environmental concerns. You've already talked about it a little bit,

1174
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:21,320
but can you say a bit more about it? Yeah, you know, this interesting report came out

1175
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:26,600
called the Eat Lancet report, which was very well-intentioned and had a lot of great

1176
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:32,280
science in it that talked about how we link climate and diet and food and what is a healthy

1177
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:36,520
diet and how do you define that. There's a lot of great science in there. There were challenges

1178
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:41,720
though, because some of the language in there was really driven through the food industry,

1179
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:47,560
and a lot of the sponsors for that were Big Food and Big Ag. One of the, for example,

1180
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:52,680
messages is we need to grow more plants, more grains and more beans through something called

1181
01:37:52,680 --> 01:38:00,440
sustainable intensification or climate smart agriculture. These are buzzwords sort of like

1182
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:07,800
clean coal, which sound good, but when you look behind the curtain, who funds those organizations?

1183
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,920
60% of the members of climate smart agriculture are the fertilizer companies. Sustainable

1184
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:17,720
intensification means using more and more chemical inputs on farms in the developing

1185
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:24,280
world to grow more grains and beans. That's not the solution. And lastly, without animals integrated

1186
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:31,480
into regenerative agricultural systems, you cannot restore soil in the way we need to restore it as

1187
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,240
fast as we need to restore it. It's just a scientific fact. So what you... Is that based on

1188
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:39,880
the need for the, basically the transfer of nitrogen through the animal? Pooping, peeing,

1189
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:47,160
digging, the saliva makes the plants grow. It's a whole symbiotic ecosystem. And when used properly,

1190
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:53,320
not over grazing, but proper management, which is called holistic management or managed grazing or

1191
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:58,520
adapted multi-padded grazing, there's a science to it. You can dramatically increase soil. So it

1192
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:03,240
takes like, I think a thousand years to get three centimeters of soil, naturally. Gabe Brown in North

1193
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:08,760
Dakota got 29 inches of soil just through these methods that are sort of supercharged methods.

1194
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,400
They're like sort of agriculture 2.0. It's not about going back to old waste. It's about inventing

1195
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,720
new ways, using all the science to actually grow soil. Because a lot of, I mean, through human

1196
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:22,520
history, we were destructive. I mean, we would grow food on land and we would deplete the land

1197
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,680
and we'd move to the next plot of land. Problem is now we're running the land. There's no more

1198
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:31,960
place to go. So I think we absolutely need to actually scale this regenerative agriculture

1199
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:36,920
model in order to solve all these global issues. Can regenerative ag be superimposed on fallow

1200
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:41,880
land? Yeah, then people are basically taking degraded land, which is almost desert and turning

1201
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:47,480
it back into lush fields and lush agricultural practices. So when those people say we have to

1202
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,280
be vegan to save the planet, it's actually not accurate. Whether you eat meat or not is a personal

1203
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:58,120
choice, a moral choice. If you think it's a health choice, fine. But whether or not you believe in

1204
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:03,960
eating meat or not, from an environmental, from a regenerative, from an climate standpoint, we must

1205
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:09,000
have animals integrated into the process in order to restore soil, which is the biggest carbon sink.

1206
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,160
So the take home message here for people is there are a lot of ways to fix climate change,

1207
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:19,720
but the quickest, fastest, and most effective and scalable way, and using ancient carbon capture

1208
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:25,240
technology that is more effective than anything that exists today is free, called photosynthesis.

1209
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,600
It's basically sun and carbon dioxide in the air. We can solve a lot of the global issues we have.

1210
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,040
So Mark, how are you spending your time today? You wear a ton of hats.

1211
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:34,040


1212
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:40,280
Yeah. I mean, you're involved in the education of functional medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

1213
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,800
You commute there and back from your home in New York. You're obviously very involved in this

1214
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,520
initiative. What does the pie graph look like of how you allocate your time?

1215
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:53,320
Well, I'm always doing the same thing in my mind. I'm trying to end the need and the suffering

1216
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:59,240
through the power of functional medicine, systems thinking, and sort of restoring communities and

1217
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:04,520
behavioral change through that. And this is just part of that story. Like I said,

1218
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,160
there's so much suffering that's unnecessary, whether it's chronic disease or poverty or

1219
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:14,440
mental illness or kids struggling with learning in schools or violence. These are all needless

1220
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,680
suffering. If we have the solutions, then we need to focus on them. And as I began, began at the

1221
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:23,480
beginning, talk about, as I sort of went down the rabbit hole of why are my patients sick,

1222
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,720
I came to this bigger conclusion that unless we deal with the systems issues, unless we go

1223
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:33,320
upstream, we're just going to be treading water or bailing a sinking boat. And the acceleration

1224
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:38,680
of these problems is so big that I feel like I'm focusing more and more on these bigger issues in

1225
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:42,920
order to solve them. So yes, I write books and I feel like this is my last one for a while,

1226
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,160
but like to write books and teach and speak and do all these things, have clinics.

1227
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:52,360
But at the end of the day, this is an existential threat. And once you've seen it, you can't unsee

1228
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,680
it. I just were researching the book for the last two and a half years. I just sort of was shocked

1229
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,640
by a lot of things that I learned that are not really common knowledge, even with really

1230
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:05,960
educated people. If I go in a room of highly educated people and say, what's the number one

1231
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:10,280
source of climate change? They're not going to say food, but when you actually unpack it,

1232
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:14,600
that's the biggest threat. Well, Mark, thank you very much for making the time today. And more

1233
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,600
importantly, of course, for doing this work and bringing it to our attention. This is an area that

1234
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:24,600
I have become increasingly interested in. And my views are kind of constantly evolving. I mean,

1235
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:32,280
I think there was a day when I didn't question the health of GMO. I'll just share with you an

1236
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:39,720
anecdote, which is when I went to Europe a year ago, I just made the glib observation, which was

1237
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:46,520
sort of the bread, the pasta, all of the food that I ate in Europe, which I actually went out of my

1238
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:52,680
way to eat, did not seem to produce the same effect as it did here. And that was actually kind of the

1239
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,720
thin end of the wedge in my mind that said, what's going on? What is the difference between the crops

1240
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:05,080
that they are using in Europe? And it's funny because it reminded me of my childhood because

1241
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:09,720
when I was a kid, we used to go to Egypt every year. And because my parents are from and I've

1242
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:16,760
got my mom each year and usually spend two months there. And I remember the way bread tasted there.

1243
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:22,120
It had a very distinct taste that you'll never taste, even if you buy like pita bread or other

1244
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,840
Middle Eastern bread here in the US, it tastes very different. And I remember sort of having

1245
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:31,560
those neurons tickled again when I was in Europe going out of my way. Because most of the previous

1246
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,400
times I'd gone to Europe, I kind of don't eat that sort of stuff. But on this trip, I was like,

1247
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:39,560
hey, I'm going to win in Rome. So yeah, tell me about what you think those four differences are.

1248
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:43,320
So you're talking about wheat products, right? So what's happened to wheat is that we've

1249
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:50,680
hybridized the wheat to make it extremely drought resistant and hardy. And it's called dwarf wheat.

1250
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:57,720
And the guy who invented Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Prize and increased in yields. But what was

1251
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:03,240
sort of the unintended consequences is the starch in there is called amylopectin A. It's a super

1252
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:07,320
starch, raises your blood sugar more than regular sugar. So one, it's basically just like eating

1253
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:14,760
sugar worse. Two, when they breed plants, it's not like humans, you get 23 pairs of chromosomes,

1254
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:20,280
one from your mom, one from your dad, 46 chromosomes in plants is 46 plus 46. It was like 92.

1255
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:24,040
And so there's extra proteins that are formed and there are many more gliding proteins,

1256
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:29,000
which are inflammatory and more active in terms of causing disruptions in the gut. So they're

1257
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,200
more likely to cause leaky gut inflammation. The third thing is they spray wheat, even though it's

1258
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:42,200
not a GMO food plant, they spray it with glyphosate at harvest. Why? Because it defoliates the plants,

1259
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,360
it gets rid of all the sort of leaves and stuff. So it makes it easier to harvest. So right at

1260
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:51,400
harvest, they spray this with glyphosate and your Cheerios have more glyphosate than vitamin A and

1261
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:56,280
vitamin D they're adding their per amount of weight. So even if you buy organic wheat?

1262
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:01,240
Organic wheat, no. Organic wheat could still be the dwarf wheat. And then lastly, this is

1263
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:05,480
interesting, maybe five reasons. But second to last, the calcium propionate, which is a

1264
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:11,320
preservative, is added to the wheat in this country and it's known to cause toxic neurological

1265
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:16,680
effects, behavioral hyperactivity, and even linked to autism. In fact, when you give babies

1266
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:21,160
breast milk, it increases butyrate, which is an impactful short chain fat in the gut that makes

1267
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:26,360
your gut healthy. When you have formula, it causes high propionate levels, which can cause neurotoxic

1268
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:31,240
effects. And in animal models, it has caused autism if you put propionate in rats' brains.

1269
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:35,480
And then lastly, in Europe, they have different methods of making them. But here it's like quick,

1270
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,880
quick, quick, quick. They want it to level and rise in a couple of hours. There it can take overnight,

1271
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,880
12 hours, 14 hours, and it tastes very different. And it's a very different structure and it does

1272
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:48,120
different things to the gluten and so forth. So there's a lot of reasons that that happens, but

1273
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:53,080
I would say over and over, I see this happen with my patients who can't eat this stuff here and they

1274
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:57,080
go over there and there's no GMO over there. It's a complex web of things.

1275
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:02,120
Can one make bread here in the US on their own using wheat, like an actual wheat that comes from

1276
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:07,400
Europe? Sure. You could, or you could get heirloom wheats, like ankhorn wheat, which is very different.

1277
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:12,120
Or now there's new forms of wheat, like kerns of wheat by Wes Jackson was developed in the Midwest.

1278
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:17,400
It has incredibly deep roots. It's a perennial wheat, super nutrient dense, really amazing,

1279
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,880
amazing product. So there's incredible grains out there that I was talking to my friend,

1280
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:25,560
Jeff Bland the other day, who's developing this company. And he's working with this guy

1281
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:31,960
to develop these phytochemical rich foods, super foods. And he got a bunch of things from the USDA,

1282
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:36,840
a bunch of seeds. And one packet came in, it was like 4, 3, 2 on 6 or something. He's like,

1283
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,520
what's this? I don't know what this is. And they sent it to him by accident. And it was this

1284
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:47,560
Himalayan buckwheat, which apparently is one of the most protein rich, low glycemic, phytochemical

1285
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:53,480
dense, hearty super food on the planet. And they're now, they have this sort of seed because, and

1286
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,440
they're not selling it, distributing it, but they couldn't give it back. So he's like literally

1287
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:00,760
taking this packet of seeds and turning it into a whole business, which is pretty amazing. So

1288
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:05,000
there's a lot of stuff out there that we could use. It's much better for us, but we just kind of

1289
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,480
homogenized our food supply and we've taken out all, like I said, we eat 800 species of plants

1290
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:14,120
before when your hunter gathers. Our bodies need all those different phytochemicals and nutrients

1291
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:19,400
and minerals and so forth and vitamins to actually run itself. And we're now just in this

1292
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:24,200
sort of nutrient devoid diet, even if we're eating organic stuff, if it's not grown in good soils,

1293
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:28,840
if it's hybridized plants, it's just not great. I always say eat weird food. So I always try to

1294
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,120
eat weird food. I gotta tell you, I'm hungry right now. I know. All right, Mark. Well,

1295
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:39,160
thanks very much. Sure. Thanks a lot, Peter. Have me. Thank you for listening to this week's
