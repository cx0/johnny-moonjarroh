00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,840
All right, Jake. Looking forward to talking about a lot of things today here. Thanks for

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,360
taking time out of work today. I know it's a busy time of year for you guys.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,640
My pleasure, man. I'm definitely looking forward to it.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,320
So I don't even know where to begin, man. I almost feel like the easiest way to begin

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,880
this is to have people get to know your story a little bit the way I've gotten to know it.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,320
We're both Canadians. I guess we have that going for us, for better or worse.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,280
Yeah. I was reading my son a book yesterday about Canada that one of his Canadian cousins

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,080
got him. I was trying to explain to him, Canada is like the United States. It has provinces

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,200
instead of states. He wanted to know which one I was from. I'm pointing to

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,760
Toronto and all this stuff. Then he's looking at the northern part and he's like, well,

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,600
what's up there? I was like, yeah, that's the Arctic. Most people don't live up there,

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,040
but of course most people isn't Jake. You're growing up in the Arctic, right? Which is not normal.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:26,920
Yeah. We grew up in a small town called Rainbow Lake. Rainbow Lake was technically in the Arctic

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,480
circle right up on the northern Alberta border, closer to the North West territories. Who was it?

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,760
I was just having a conversation yesterday with somebody about ice fishing. You try and explain

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,400
ice fishing to your kid and they're just like, what are you talking about? You just sit in a box,

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,640
like in a hole that's potentially like four feet deep. Oh, that was the conversation you were having

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,080
yesterday was, I remember my dad at six feet tall having one of the ice augers where you cut that

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,880
hole in the ice and him going all the way down, like burying it at six feet and being like, damn

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
it, and like pulling it out of the hole and not getting to the water. Like that's how cold it

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,360
was. And we were, it was a great conversation because I can't wait to introduce my kids to

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,360
that. It's such a, it's such an amazing experience and obviously lots of resilience comes from living

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,880
in a place like that. But yeah, we started out, my dad was in the oil industry and he, we moved

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,560
around a lot, but it was mostly in northern Alberta and we ended up in a town called Rainbow Lake.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,000
That was a seven hour drive from any other town. Meaning you were seven hours north of Edmonton?

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh no, we were, we were 14 hours north of Edmonton. So you weren't going to like Oilers games or

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,320
anything. I went to one Oilers game. I got to, I got to see, I would have been eight or nine and we

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,720
drove all the way down. It took like a day and a half and I got to see Gretzky and Messier and like

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,880
I can still remember walking in and not under understanding why they were so big. Like having

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,040
never been to like a professional sports game before and, and like just seeing on TV, like you

32
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,240
walk in and the players are huge. Like they just look like giants. So yeah, it was, but part of

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,880
that isolation was, my dad was a subsistence hunter. And like, I mean, ultimately I think where

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,720
this, that's where this conversation goes, but we, like my dad every single year would shoot a moose

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:44,080
and that's what we ate all winter long. And we would go down to a place closer to Calgary for the

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,160
summer, just to get out of the, like, you remember you got mosquitoes like this big, right? Just to

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,840
get out of there. And I remember my mom having to essentially pack for eight months, like eight to

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,680
nine months, she would be collecting groceries like all summer long. And we'd had a huge trailer

39
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,240
that we'd take back up with us to this small town. I think it was only a couple thousand people. And

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,800
part of that was she wasn't bringing any stakes. Like she, like I remember telling a story, like we

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,920
ate pheasant pablum as kids and moose meat. And yeah, so we were definitely, we were definitely way

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,200
up there. What kind of chores did you have as a kid? Cause I'm like, this morning I asked my

43
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,240
daughter to do the dishwasher and then it's like taking the trash out. Like these are sort of the,

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,520
these are the chores you do if you live in Toronto or Austin. What are the chores of the Arctic?

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, there was always the inside chores and I remember getting relegated to the bathroom and

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,080
with three boys, that was always a mess. But like, I remember having to clean bathrooms, but I remember,

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,000
did you ever have to shovel the roof? No, I never, I was the snow shoveler and I loved shoveling snow

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,520
growing up because it was such a good workout. It was amazing, but I never, I guess we never had

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,600
enough snow that the roof was at structural risk. So one of the regular chores was you had to shovel

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,960
the roof. And so you had to like get up there and you would like, you could never do it like from the

51
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,040
top. Cause like, if everything came, you'd like do it in the bottom. Yeah. And then you would of

52
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,560
course strategically do it. So you would pile it all up so you could jump off after and have fun.

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,040
But I remember several winters, the, like the snow bank connected to the roof and we were able to like

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,200
snowboard off the roof into the snow bank. And like we had all like igloos and it was such a,

55
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,680
yeah, such an interesting experience to live up there. And then you remember, like I can remember

56
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,080
being so cold, like you would stop moving. Like I think the early on sets of like hypothermia and

57
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,080
like having to like come in the house and get warmed up and then go back outside. Like I remember

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,720
my dad telling us like, if you start to feel tired, you need to come in the house. And he realized that

59
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,960
was potentially like the early onset of hypothermia. And we just thought like, oh, if we're tired,

60
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,320
we should come in the house. Did you live in proximity to people who were generationally there,

61
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,600
Inuit? I don't know what we would call, I don't know. I mean, we called them Inuit when I was

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,920
growing up. I don't know if there's, there's maybe some new politically correct term for Eskimo Inuit.

63
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:44,360
No, we didn't. I think we were primarily in these oil towns. I remember meeting them because it was

64
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,720
odd as like a function of diversity. I mean, it was amazing, but no, it wasn't something that we were

65
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,600
really connected to at that point. Yeah. The reason I was asking is I would have been so curious to

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,200
know what their hunting methods were and what their, you know, cause you want to talk about

67
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:08,680
people who have truly adapted to that climate. Yeah. And for eight to 10 months, there's not a

68
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,400
single leafy green available. Like you want to chew on a pine cone, it's fine. But, and I, and I

69
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,640
think, and I don't know this fair, obviously the vast majority of their diet was meat. Cause that

70
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,880
was the only thing available. I, I can remember the taste of moose meat, like moose, moose, the

71
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,200
nickname up there was, they were called swamp donkeys because the vast majority of the summer,

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,960
they spent their time in swamps and they're eating all of these like legumes or lily pads or all of

73
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,840
these things that were floating around. And there was like a really distinct taste to them. It was

74
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,640
so interesting. So, and then all of a sudden everything would melt. Like it was this extreme

75
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,000
melt off. Everything would be like absolutely muddy for an entire month. Like you couldn't move

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,440
anywhere. Like it was such a mess. I just remember my mom yelling at us about like mud being in the

77
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,520
house and then we'd pack up and head south for the summer. And it was this, this, this cycle for

78
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,040
several years before I moved out to Nova Scotia, Canada on the East coast of Canada. When we were

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
16.

80
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah. So, uh, the other thing that came out of reading my son, this story yesterday, um, was

81
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,840
explaining to him that I'd never been East of Quebec city, which is kind of weird. Like I grew

82
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,800
up in Canada, but you know, go to Montreal, went to Quebec, Quebec city once, never been to Nova

83
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,640
Scotia, which I always, is something I always want to see. Um, because the East coast of Canada

84
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,280
looks breathtaking to me in many ways. Uh, you know, I'd love to see, you know, St. John's, I'd like

85
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,600
to go to the very tip of Canada. Um, so Nova Scotia is obviously like, you might as well be moving to

86
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,840
the Caribbean from the Arctic. Um, but it's still cold water, right?

87
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's, it's, there's still like slush that forms in this, like in the sea

88
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,720
water during the winter. It's still absolutely freezing and there were still tons of snow, but

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,360
the temperatures were just so much more moderate throughout the year. There was like, there wasn't

90
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,520
these crazy, you know, ups and downs. And that was where, uh, talk about freezing. That was where we

91
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,400
started. I started surfing. Like you've, you've experienced this in the great lakes. Like the

92
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,440
biggest waves were like these wind waves and went like wind swell on a lake was like the greatest

93
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,320
thing ever as a kid. You were just like, these are the biggest waves of my life. And we showed up in,

94
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,240
I remember like getting to Canada and one of the first things my dad did was take us to the beach.

95
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,040
And I think he already knew what was going to happen and took us to the beach and we just

96
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,720
couldn't believe like the size of these waves and we were playing in the waves. And then

97
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,200
we thought we saw seals out at one of the points. And then one of these seals stands up on a surf

98
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,480
board. Cause they're in like a full black wetsuit. And one of these seals like stand, and I can

99
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
remember it. Like they stand up on the surfboard and me and my like little brother looked at each

100
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,840
other and we were just like, like we were done. We were like, we need to do that. And that started

101
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:18,400
a long and, um, semi dangerous career in surfing in Nova Scotia. It was just so cold and the best

102
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,920
swell was always during the winter months. And we couldn't afford like good wetsuits and we used to

103
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
wear toques. What are they called? Beanies here in Hawaii. We used to wear a toque in the water

104
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,400
and try not to duck dive thinking that like that would help. And how many millimeters were your

105
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,360
wetsuits? Well, we didn't have any to start. So we would go for as long as we could like

106
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,680
end of September, October, and then like you literally couldn't even get in the water. It

107
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,360
was so cold. And then I remember getting the first, the first wetsuit I got was an old Navy dive suit

108
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,960
and it was four millimeters and like literally could not move my arms. Like it was just like,

109
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,480
it was so thick. And, um, but we, I mean, we didn't, my parents couldn't afford any of that stuff. Like

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
I wasn't even, I wasn't, I couldn't extend my hockey career because my dad couldn't afford

111
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,880
skates fast enough. We were growing out of them. Like, um, the first surfboard we made, we went to

112
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,080
what is Canadian Tire, went to Canadian Tire and bought a bunch of styrofoam and duct taped it

113
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,960
together. And that was like our first surfboard. Um, and then gradually things got better. Like

114
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,920
we started, instead of shoveling snow for money, I started a little grass cutting company of my own

115
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,720
in our neighborhood and we started saving money and we were able to buy like our first real wetsuit

116
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,600
and then buy like our first like real surfboard. And, um, yeah, it was, and just fell in love with

117
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,640
the ocean. And then obviously, I mean, it's jumping forward, but the move to Hawaii after that,

118
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,320
you can imagine the university of Hawaii calling and saying, who wants you to come out here?

119
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,720
I was like, wait, where, where do I sign? Well, so let's, yeah, let's, let's back up for a second

120
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,280
in all of this business. Where do you discover your passion for volleyball? Because that's

121
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:22,240
obviously what got you out to Hawaii. Yeah. Um, the last year we were in Northern Alberta. Um,

122
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
you know how it goes. You always do what your older brother does, right? You've got, you've got

123
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,240
an older brother or is it younger? No, no, I'm the oldest. You're the oldest. So whatever Josh did,

124
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,560
I did. And Josh started playing volleyball. And, um, I remember just going to a couple practices

125
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,960
and I don't know if it's cause we jumped on the trampoline so much as a kid or I did martial arts

126
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,400
for a while. I did Taekwondo. We picked it up pretty fast cause we were coordinated and then we

127
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:00,240
moved and it was probably my saving grace when we moved to Nova Scotia because it was a skillset I

128
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,880
had that let me meet a whole bunch of people. And I think my parents just doubled down on it saying

129
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
like, we're just going to stick them in a whole bunch of volleyball. Like whether it was, you know,

130
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,840
middle school or club ball, it was just, it was just such a great way to integrate us into a new

131
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:24,160
community at the age of, you know, 15, 16 when it's pretty awkward. So, and, and that was it. It was

132
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,600
just a sport that, and I did, I think every other sport under the sun, like through high school,

133
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,640
but it was the one that stuck. And it was one of those things like, you know, driving or bow

134
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,920
hunting for, for you. Like you just, you, you just never hesitate to do more and more and more of it.

135
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,560
So it was something that we fall in love with and got to do that at a really high level for

136
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,200
like through the teens, including like Canada's youth Olympic program and then like junior Olympic

137
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,800
programs. And then it was actually at a junior Olympic program that the university of Hawaii

138
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,360
saw me play. And you know, what was hilarious is I found out later what sealed the deal was

139
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,920
I sent them. So Tino Reyes, who was like the assistant coach, I sent him pictures of us

140
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,160
surfing with icebergs in the background. And, and I, I guess they were on the fence about me

141
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,440
because I'm small, like I'm only six feet tall. And he had to, like he fought for me saying,

142
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,880
if this kid can do this, whatever we're going to get, like the level of resiliency we're going

143
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,280
to get out of him is going to be like, it's going to be worth it, even if we're losing a couple

144
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:45,440
inches. So he had helped me get there. And I'm, volleyball has taken me all over the world. It's

145
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,360
been, it's been amazing. So, so you arrived to this amazing division one volleyball school at

146
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,600
literally the furthest place you can go. I don't think you can stay in North America and go further

147
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,360
than Nova Scotia to Oahu. Can you, I mean, I guess you could have gone to, you know,

148
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,320
maybe somewhere or something. Yeah. Yeah. But, but, okay. So you've gone as far as possible.

149
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,720
How much of a culture shock is that? And how quickly do you kind of assimilate?

150
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
Because, because there's actually kind of some similarities, I think, in the culture as well,

151
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,200
yeah, absolutely. I think the initial shocks were tiny. Like, I remember, oh, here's a good one.

152
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,960
When I came on my recruiting trip, they were obviously really smart. They were like,

153
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,560
here's the university. Here's this amazing stadium that holds 10,000 people. They got like their best

154
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
attendance for volleyball in the country. And then they take me to the beach and they're like,

155
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,560
here's a pair of board shorts and here's a surfboard. Go for it. We're going to pick up

156
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,160
like tomorrow. And they had dropped me off at my hotel and you'll love this as a Canadian.

157
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,880
I go to put the board shorts on and I'm like, well, where's the liner?

158
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,840
Like, where's the white stuff? Like, where's the liner? And obviously every pair of shorts

159
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm wearing, like we didn't even, board shirts didn't exist in Canada in 1999. And like,

160
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,880
I remember like being so confused and I was like, well, must mean I have to wear my underwear with

161
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,160
these things, which of course you're not supposed to do. So I put the tighty whities on underneath

162
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,280
the board shorts, tie them up, head out to like Kaiser bowls, which is like a straight local break.

163
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,880
Like it was right in front of the hotel and I'm paddling out with like the tighty whities hanging

164
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,800
out the back and like locals are looking at me and just shaking their head like, oh, what are we,

165
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,040
like and pasty white. So like there were definitely some incremental culture shocks,

166
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:52,880
including realizing that your shorts didn't have to have liners in them. And then when I got to

167
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,280
the University of Hawaii, so that would, recruiting trip was the spring before. And then when I arrived

168
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,080
in September, also like a accidental shock, which turned out to be the best, probably the best thing

169
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:12,880
in my life was they, they messed up my dorm assignment and they put me, and this is where

170
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,880
like all of the folks you know, come into play. They put me in the dorm for all of the local kids

171
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,880
that didn't have good enough grades. So they were taking the summer program to get into school and

172
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:35,840
they happened to throw me in the wing with all the Molokai kids. And I mean, hey, like I had never

173
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,040
on the recruiting trip was so short. Like I remember seeing different things, but like

174
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:47,440
I had never been around a Polynesian population before. And you're astounded how big these people

175
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
are. And so I remember walking in the front door at Johnson Hall and opening up the door.

176
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,880
They're all sitting around playing music. They're playing like playing their ukulele and one of the

177
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,640
the biggest person I've ever seen in my life, like six, two, 300 pounds had an ukulele that looked

178
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,760
like this big, like he's playing music. And they're like, you in the right place? And I was like,

179
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,240
Johnson Hall B they're like, yeah, I was like room 201. And I was like, yeah. And there's just like

180
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,640
dead silence and there's like eight of them. And they're like, the biggest one was like, boy,

181
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,720
we're going to eat you. And I was just like, and true Molokai fashion, true Aloha fashion,

182
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,960
best friends, like literally after that statement, they're like, well, you're here. We're going to

183
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,360
take care of you. And that's like, there's this resounding theme here that they'll always give

184
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,960
somebody the chance up front. They will always assume you have your like everybody's best

185
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,840
interest in mind until you don't. And it was the best thing that ever happened in my life.

186
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Like they, they took me under their wing and I mean, everything like all of the best parts of

187
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,240
my life have come from walking into the wrong dorm for sure. Let's hit pause for one second and give

188
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,840
people a little bit of an understanding about what is so unique about Molokai because for many

189
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,520
people listening to this podcast, they'll certainly understand the big Island Kona and most people

190
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
have, you know, they've gone to Hawaii, they've probably been to Maui and people understand that

191
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,560
you know, Honolulu sits on Oahu and that's the most populous Island. So, you know, you've sort

192
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,360
of got these three islands that get all of the attention. But then there's some other islands

193
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,080
that are a little less understood and sort of, you know, you go into the more exotic, you go out to

194
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:45,120
Kauai and people would maybe even go to Lanai, but Molokai is very rarely touched. I feel privileged

195
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,360
to have been there several times. It to me is a very special place, but I don't think,

196
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,920
I think it's worth spending a few moments diving into what you just talked about, which is tell us

197
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,360
about this island both from its geography and perhaps more importantly, its culture and why

198
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,600
you would, you know, why that would lead you to conclude what you've concluded since.

199
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,720
Sure. I mean, no part of what I'm about to say is going to justify how special that place is. I'll

200
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:28,400
start there. It's 10 miles by 30 miles. I think it's about 180,000 acres and there are 7,000 people

201
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,120
and that population has, I think, stayed the same for a long time and of those 7,000 people,

202
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:46,880
I would guess 6,000 of them are true locals. Like it is very much an island of like a local

203
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,440
population and certainly one of the higher per density populations of Hawaiians as well.

204
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:04,960
It is what makes it so special is they have fought for years and years and years to keep Molokai

205
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,640
the exact same way it has always been. There isn't like, there's no stoplights.

206
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,360
There's no major resorts. I mean, there's a few that came up in the 80s.

207
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,880
No escalators. There's actually a town ordinance that says no building can exceed the height of

208
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:36,640
the tallest palm tree on the island. Yes. The people there are so active in maintaining this

209
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,440
community. There's no people on Molokai that are hungry, but you don't see homeless people

210
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,560
downtown. It's an extraordinary place. They really do care for all of the members of their community

211
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,600
as best they can. And on top of that is I think the vast majority of the food there,

212
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,320
maybe not vast majority, but I'd say 50-50 comes from the ocean or comes from the land.

213
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:13,520
So they're either a subsistence hunting. So there's deer, black buck, goats and pigs on that island.

214
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,480
Or more importantly, the ocean, they have the longest standing reef in Hawaii on the south

215
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,880
shore of Molokai. The ocean is teeming with, I mean, it's still teeming with fish and people

216
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,560
are constantly eating it. So all of these things, like they've fought to protect all of these natural

217
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:42,240
resources. They fought to protect their way of life because Molokai's beaches are extraordinary.

218
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,680
There's no, they're probably the nicest in the state. You could easily put up a Ritz Carlton

219
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,080
or something else there, but the community has said no. And they've taken-

220
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
There was a failed attempt to put up a fancy resort on the north shore, wasn't there?

221
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,920
Yeah. Yeah. La'al Point, and they fought for years and years and years and they won. And

222
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,160
that comes with consequences as a function of economics and they don't care.

223
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,120
Like everybody said, this is the way we want to live. The community at large has said,

224
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,760
we don't need to look like a Waikiki. We don't need to look like a Maui.

225
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:30,960
And coming from northern Alberta, coming from a place that you're eating, and Canada as a whole,

226
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,160
I think, there were so many similarities in culture. I think that's what made it really easy for

227
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,640
me to assimilate into that place and find so much comfort in those visits. And part of that was

228
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,200
the east coast of Canada was so damn far that I couldn't afford, but I couldn't go back. It was

229
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,880
just too much of a haul to go back and forth. So every long weekend or Christmas break or

230
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,920
anything, they picked me up and the family said, you're coming with us. And it was just an

231
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,440
overnight, they call it Hanai. It's a Hawaiian word for adoption. So I was Hanai by the same family

232
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,320
as Mike, good friend of mine, incredible human being, incredible hunter. So I was Hanai by that

233
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:30,080
same family. And it's history. I've been a part of that family as long as I've been a part of

234
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,040
that family in Canada. So yeah, just so lucky and so fortunate to get to be a part of that place.

235
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,800
I grew up, I think, part of my adult life. I grew up as a function of that place and the cultural

236
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,240
values it has. Yeah, well, we're going to come back to Mike, I'm sure, because he's certainly one

237
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,440
of my favorite people on the planet. And some of my favorite images are just the thoughts of Mike as

238
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,680
a teenager. Like the concept of high school Mike is so funny to me. Just, oh, man, it was the best.

239
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,360
Yeah, I love that idea. And yeah, we can, we'll definitely get back into that for sure. So,

240
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,360
let's just briefly kind of get through. So you end up having a very successful career at the

241
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
University of Hawaii. Do you guys win the NCAA title during one of your years, right?

242
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,840
Oh, man. Yeah, we win it and then it gets taken back. Oh, I don't think I knew that part.

243
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:35,360
A little bit of a, like, well, it's a long story, but we win the title. Some rules get changed

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,440
after the title is won for political reasons. Then they take the title away. It was a mess,

245
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:52,640
but yeah, we were top three in the country every single year. An incredible program,

246
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,680
you know, integrating that into like just regular college life as a whole,

247
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,120
tossing on top of that, like a student athlete schedule. I think lots of lessons learned there

248
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:13,680
as well. And then obviously post college, I continued that career into Europe. But that

249
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,680
entire time, like being, you know, being able to go to Molokai and learning more about that culture,

250
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,640
learning more about access to your, um, yeah, it was, it was, it was an amazing experience.

251
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,840
And as an athlete, and I don't think I really realized this till like the third year,

252
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,040
because your first two years, you're, you're still 19 and 20. You're probably, you're an idiot. Anyway,

253
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,320
I remember in my third year thinking, I feel so much better when I have deer meat in my freezer.

254
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,200
So we were going back and hunting and bring it like we're broke, like I had to starve through

255
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,240
college without access to your like, we were going back hunting, jumping on like the super tiny plane,

256
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,720
like filling up coolers that were way overweight. And then like bargaining with people on our floor

257
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,200
for freezer space. We're like, Hey, we'll give you a couple pounds if like you store 10 pounds in your

258
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,240
freezer. Um, and I remember in my, in my third year, as I like, I think I started like realizing

259
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,680
how the benefits of building strength and lifting weights and all of those things. And I remember

260
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,160
thinking like, man, I feel so much better when I have access to your year. Um, yeah. So they kind

261
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:32,800
of all got intertwined and, and, um, college was, yeah, college was just such an amazing experience

262
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,680
to combine those two things. You know, obviously we're going to talk in such depth about access

263
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:44,880
to your, at the time, how much did you understand? Was it frankly, just like, Oh yeah, this is kind

264
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,160
of a local pest here. And you know, this is something that we hunt here because it's so prevalent or did

265
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,000
how much did you understand the history of how they got there and what the true significance

266
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,360
ecologically was? But did you, did you know any of that at the time? I honestly didn't. It was,

267
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:08,960
it was, it was entirely recreational. It was only later. It was only later when I saw like the first

268
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
instance of like, there's these, there's these periods where there's too many access to your,

269
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
and essentially they'll lay down and die. They don't have any feed. It was only when I started

270
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,640
seeing the impact that I started saying, wait a second, because that, that animal on the island

271
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,000
of Molokai is, is, is revered. Like nobody's running around Molokai calling it an invasive

272
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,880
species. That's been a part of that culture for a hundred plus years. They find extreme value in it.

273
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,160
They understand the detriment that it's there. And I think there's hope for better,

274
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:52,000
more or better management options in the future. But the family, when the family introduced me to

275
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,040
it, they didn't introduce it to me as the idea of it's an invasive pest we need to control.

276
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,040
It was introduced as this is an amazing resource that we get to utilize and something we really

277
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,520
enjoy recreationally. And so that, and I didn't know anything more than that. It wasn't, again,

278
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,640
it wasn't until I experienced or saw some of those things that started to kind of put it together.

279
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,920
So post-college, you go off to Europe, you're playing professional volleyball and you,

280
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,560
you decide you're going to try out for the Canadian Olympic team. Obviously you don't get,

281
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,080
you don't get to make that choice just willy nilly. You have to be invited. You're good enough.

282
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:37,520
You, you go to camp and you come up one short, right? Yeah. Which by anybody's standard is

283
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,720
remarkable, right? To be the, to be the, the last guy that almost made it to the Olympic team.

284
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,120
And Canada's a very good team in volleyball, right? Like it's not like, you know, it's sort of,

285
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,400
I always say like, yeah, it's like in swimming in the United States, that poor person who finishes

286
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,120
third at the Olympic trials, because the United States only takes two per event. That person who

287
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,720
finishes third would easily be in the finals for most events in swimming. So it's sort of similar.

288
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,240
Yeah. Is, is it, how heartbreaking is this?

289
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,680
I mean, I was, I was honest. I don't think I've ever talked about this with anybody. I was

290
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:31,040
devastated. Like I flew, I closed my contract in Bali a month early, flew back to Canada to like,

291
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,600
make it to tryouts. I thought I had like an incredible tryout and they just had this guy

292
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,160
that it, and his guy had looked up to, he just had this guy there for eight years and he was

293
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,720
so calm and such a phenom and how, and Canada had one of its best teams ever. So it wasn't like,

294
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,520
this is going to be a building year. This was like, we're going to try and get our best placement in

295
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,920
the Olympics ever. And they did. And they just, yeah, they said, you're one short. And it was

296
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,200
amazing because that was the last goal I had. That was the last goal I had for my volleyball

297
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,120
career after, who even knows hundreds of thousands of hours. I just remember thinking like, what now?

298
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:23,840
Like, and the first thing was, well, I'm going to Molokai. Like, it was like, I had zero plans.

299
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,760
Like my plan was I was going to stay in Canada for the indefinitely and trained with the Olympic

300
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,760
team. Like that was the plan. Like I had, had you thought past that this was Oh four, I'm guessing.

301
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,960
Yeah. Yeah. So this is Athens game. So it was your, did you think that, okay, I'm going to make the

302
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,000
Olympic team. We're going to go off to Athens. I'm going to come back and then I'm going to do what

303
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,120
did you think I'm going to coach or did you always think you were going to go back to Hawaii?

304
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:57,440
I, so I had to take a little step back because my, my capstone class in college

305
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,440
for marketing and management. I wrote a business plan that actually one to

306
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,720
mimic the model of New Zealand and domesticate access to year. And so, and so near the end of

307
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,600
college, I started to formulate these ideas of how I was going to manage or what, what could we do?

308
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:26,320
That was a better option. And so the two years in Europe, I started, I started a nonprofit called

309
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,280
the access dear Institute. And well, you're, you're a good buddy. So I can tell you this.

310
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:38,320
It was a complete, it was a complete farce because nobody would give me any of the studies out of

311
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,600
India. So now you get like those little snippets. When you go on Google, you can like pull up a

312
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,080
study and you get the snippet, but you can't download the whole thing. Well, like through the

313
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,040
capstone class in college, I was trying to collect all of this like population information on access

314
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,920
dear or biological. Like I was trying to, like, I was trying to figure it out and nobody would give

315
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,760
me any information. So I started a nonprofit called the access to Institute. So when I emailed

316
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,320
somebody, I could say, Hey, this is Jake Mus with the, I'm the executive director of the access dear

317
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,200
Institute. I'm still in college now. We'd love to get this study to incorporate with what we're

318
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
doing here in Hawaii. And all of a sudden, like, I just like all of these studies started flooding

319
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,840
in. I was like, this is amazing. So I had all of this information and that came with me to Europe.

320
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,640
That was like kind of my pastime in Europe was digging into all of those things. So to answer

321
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:38,160
your question of what was the plan after that? It was at that point, it was, okay, what can, what can

322
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,880
we do? That was like the next obsession and passion was what can we do to better manage access dear?

323
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,080
So that was already a thought part of the thought process. So there was a little bit of a backdrop

324
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,920
when, you know, I remember sitting in front of the two coaches and them saying, yeah, you're, you're

325
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:02,320
not going to make it. And like, I didn't even have a return flight. Because like, this is one way.

326
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,520
And I called my mom and I said, I'm going to Hawaii. And interestingly enough,

327
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:18,640
I landed, went straight to Molokai and four days later, met my wife on Molokai.

328
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,600
And that started, I mean, started a whole bunch of things, but spent the summer there,

329
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:34,080
played another year in Europe. And while in Europe, she said, well, what are we doing? Like,

330
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,960
let's go home and let's go home and do this thing. Let's make babies. Let's just do it. And that was

331
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,320
it. Like, that was the trigger to say, okay, like we're going home. So that's how I found my back,

332
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,360
my way back to Hawaii permanently was, I mean, through that, like through Molokai and my wife is

333
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:58,240
from Molokai. And access to was already like, it was already there. Well, I didn't know, I didn't

334
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,560
know what I was going to do, but it was there. So let's, let's now go back and explain to folks

335
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,080
what these access dear are, how they got to Hawaii, how many of them there are, where they are,

336
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,120
because again, now it starts to kind of dovetail into my obsession, which is relatively new. This

337
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,800
is an obsession for me personally, that's only been going on for two years. And that coincides

338
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,760
with when you and I met. So before you give the real story, I will just say at a distance that

339
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,600
my attraction to access to your can only be described as a love at first sight.

340
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,600
It's, you know, growing up in Canada, you see white tail all day long.

341
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,520
I mean, I basically just saw them as things not to hit with your car.

342
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,680
That was basically like, you know, this is like, this is a thing you don't want to hit. Right.

343
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,200
And they weren't an issue in Toronto where I grew up, but because my dad had a quarry outside of

344
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,280
Toronto, my dad had a couple of quarries north of Toronto where we would spend some time.

345
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,120
That's where you would really see, you know, the white tail. But it was something very different

346
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,040
the first time I laid eyes on an axis deer, which was, oh, that's a totally different animal.

347
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,800
Like that's regal. Right. That's, that's breathtaking. And obviously, as we get more

348
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,640
and more into this discussion, when you start to talk about what it means to hunt that deer and

349
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,520
what it means to harvest that deer and what it means to eat that deer again, it just lives in

350
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,000
kind of its own category. But this is obviously not a species of deer that is native to Hawaii.

351
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:41,280
So how did it get there and where did it come from? Okay. 1868, King Kamehameha V

352
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,000
hired the Mathison Trading Company to get them out of India. My wife, Ku'u,

353
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:59,280
she translates Hawaiian newspapers. Odd sidebar here, only 5% of Hawaii's newspapers are

354
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,120
translated. So 95% of their history is buried in there. So she helps translate newspapers,

355
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,680
but she's found she can search them digitally by Hawaiian words. So she's found all these incredible

356
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,840
articles and the article explains them like coming down the Yangtze River on a boat called the Lakh

357
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:27,680
Nagar, them arriving on Oahu. There were, there were two bucks and five does. And just for folks

358
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,400
who maybe aren't familiar with deer, the bucks are the males, the females are the does.

359
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:42,400
Yeah. And so they stay on the ship on Oahu. And actually, on the way from Oahu to Molokai,

360
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,040
a baby buck was born and they named it King Kamehameha V. And they arrive on Molokai. And

361
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,200
so they're only placed on the island of Molokai. None were put on Oahu. And they put a kapu,

362
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,240
they put a restriction on harvesting them for the local people there. They were there at that

363
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,920
point, the King's deer. And they didn't understand, like they didn't understand this animal. I don't,

364
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,800
I still don't know why he sought this particular animal. At that point, Hawaii was trading with

365
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,960
people all over the Pacific and they could have done whitetail or else. I mean, who knows?

366
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,160
So it's really interesting to understand, like, I don't know why he picked that particular animal,

367
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
but I mean, it is beautiful.

368
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,960
It's exactly. Yeah. And maybe that's what it was. But they get to the small island of Molokai and

369
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:46,800
they start to proliferate very quickly. And I think as early as, I think it was 1898,

370
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,960
there's articles about them thinking there was estimating there were 7,000 deer and they were

371
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,880
already decimating what they were describing in the upland forests. And the subsequent year,

372
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,200
there's an article about them hiring shooters. They called them sharpshooters from California.

373
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,000
And the sharpshooters from California recorded killing 5,000 deer. And it's amazing, like,

374
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,920
at the same time, a couple of years later, there's an article in the then, what would have been like

375
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,040
territorial government about them arguing over the management of access deer. And two of actually

376
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,720
the Hawaiian reps were saying, we have to do something about this. Like, they're going to

377
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,760
continue to destroy our upland forests. So as far back as, what is that? That's a hundred years ago.

378
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:47,040
As far back as a hundred years ago, people were already recognizing the impacts access deer were

379
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,880
having on the communities. And then- What's their replication cycle? How long is their gestation

380
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,880
cycle? How many babies and, you know, blah, blah, blah. Gestational period is 238 days.

381
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,800
It's very similar to humans. Yeah. Right? Yeah. So three fawns,

382
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:16,480
sort of three baby deer every two years. They don't do twins. But what makes access deer so

383
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
prolific, and they're one of the very few deer species on the planet that are like this, is

384
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,080
a deer every year, it's called casting their antlers. So a deer every year, their antlers fall off.

385
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
And during that period where the antlers fall off, their testosterone levels drop,

386
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,160
and their sperm is not viable for reproduction. And so you'll see those long periods. And I'm sure

387
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,600
that's evolutionary of throw. So throughout the winters, et cetera, et cetera. So access deer are

388
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,000
a tropical species. And when they cast their antlers, their testosterone levels stay high

389
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:01,440
enough to breed year round. So their population dynamics look like 33% a year. Like they look

390
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,240
like those hockey stick curves once they get started. And I'm sure Kim Kimeh, Kim Kimeh,

391
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:16,960
the fifth had no idea that was the case. And you toss in, I mean, you've seen these animals,

392
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,800
they're extraordinarily healthy. The worst, we take data on every single animal we harvest.

393
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:34,800
And of the 15,000 deer we've harvested of those those of those females, 89% are lactating or

394
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:44,320
pregnant at the time of harvest. So they are such a prolific species. And then you put them in Hawaii

395
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:51,520
where there's obviously no predators, perfect feed, they can jump six to eight foot fences and move

396
00:41:51,520 --> 00:42:00,960
wherever they need to maintain their own health. And you've got a pretty astounding invasive species,

397
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,480
but also resource. So, well, that's part of the thing too, is they, I sort of try to, the other

398
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,480
day I posted something on Instagram, something archery related, and someone asked a comment,

399
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,800
which was, I don't see the sport in this. Like I don't, how hard can it be to shoot a deer with a

400
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,440
bow and an arrow? But they didn't, they were, they were actually very inquisitive. Like it,

401
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,840
again, I'm not normally one to get into discussions on Instagram, but you could tell this person really

402
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:38,960
asked from a point of inquisition. And that's not an uncommon question. And I say, I didn't get into

403
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,120
it on Instagram, but if someone asked me that question, I typically say, look, you're absolutely

404
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,680
right. I mean, there are some animals where, you know, shooting a pig isn't the hardest thing in a

405
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,280
world, but every animal does have a superpower and you need to know that. So for example, with pigs,

406
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,480
their superpower is smell. They can smell you at a very great distance. And so if you are not down

407
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,960
wind of them, they will sniff you out. You don't just walk up to a pig and take a shot at it. You

408
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,760
have to at least use the smell, its capacity for smell, which is so far in excess of ours, your

409
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,840
advantage. We've talked about Muflon, right? Muflon have a superpower of sight. It's sort of

410
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,400
comical what they can see. The thing I sort of explain to people when they ask me, why are you

411
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,520
so interested in this axis here is I say, as far as I can tell, they have three superpowers.

412
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,320
Their sense of smell, their vision, and their hearing. They're, they're preternatural. I mean,

413
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:43,280
this animal is so superior to us on at least those three senses that it's about as hard as

414
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:51,040
any animal to get within a hundred yards of. It's, it's, you know, it's, it's, you have to be doing

415
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,640
everything right to get within a hundred yards of it. And that's not close enough to take a shot,

416
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,760
by the way, with the bow. So then you really have to do something heroic if you want to be able to

417
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,080
take that shot. So that's sort of an aside, but I think it comes to this point, which is this is

418
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,480
an animal that spent a billion years evolving to escape tigers and, you know, and jaguars.

419
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,240
Yes. It's like it, it honed its skill in an evolutionary environment that was remarkable.

420
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,840
And, you know, when you consider how clumsy we would be relative to the animals, it evolved to

421
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,920
avoid the, you know, in some ways, you know, it's, it's amazing. We can ever get near them.

422
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah. And it goes a little bit deeper because you look at, I mean, tigers are probably

423
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,040
one of the most efficient predators on the planet, but then you look at how access deer,

424
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,400
like what their natural habitat is. And there are these, there are fringe grazers throughout the

425
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:57,600
Indian like forests and plains. So they had to evolve all of these evasive skills in thick jungle.

426
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,360
And like I see it some, like, I think there's a fourth sense sometime because I'm like,

427
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,920
they didn't see me. They didn't hear me. The wind's perfect. I'm like, they're like, there's no way.

428
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:18,000
And I think they like to evade tigers in dense brush and foliage and like they would have had to

429
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,240
have such incredible observational skills. And I think that's where you see it in, like in India,

430
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,600
they team up with monkeys and they use like monkeys as alarms in Hawaii. They'll team up

431
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:40,400
with like minor birds. Like they are so advanced and you're right, like a hundred yards and you're

432
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:48,960
like, this is amazing. And then even if inside of 50 yards, they can dodge an aerial unless they are

433
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,240
completely oblivious. So you, I mean, we've, how many times? We'll come back to that. Yeah. Yeah.

434
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,080
We'll come back to that for sure. I agree with you, by the way. I think there's a pattern

435
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:06,560
recognition that they have that other animals might not have to the same extent, which is

436
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,120
it's like they know in a certain situation, even if they can't smell, see, or hear you,

437
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,560
there's the potential risk that something could be there and that's enough to make them skittish.

438
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,680
And yeah, they are, that's amazing. They are relying on third party information.

439
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,040
Like they're not relying on just their own. They're so tuned in to their environment. And I think it

440
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,440
plays into, they have one of the smallest home range of deer as well. So they encompass and

441
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,840
they're highly opportunistic. So they'll bounce around from area to area. So I think when they

442
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,040
find places that are safe and they recognize that both as a function of probably like feed and water,

443
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,120
but what inputs they're getting from their surrounding environment, they stay there.

444
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,680
Yeah. So to the person's point on Instagram, I mean, you hear this from every hunter, like if you can

445
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,960
successfully harvest an axis deer, you can, you can, with a bow, you can do almost any other animal

446
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,680
on the planet. And to your credit, you're getting pretty good at it, my friend.

447
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:27,040
So when did you, so let's go back to your arrival to Molokai. Are you now back in contact with Mikey?

448
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:34,720
Have you guys decided, hey, like, what is he doing at this point in time? Because obviously I know

449
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,880
where I want to go with this story is how you guys get into basically the rescue side of this.

450
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,400
And the most amazing story is where we're going to go with those axis deer that make their way

451
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,280
over to the big Island. So, so, so help me, you know, help me with that path.

452
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,800
Well, Mikey is always my first call. And so, and so for the folks listening, like Mikey is

453
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,080
the second adopted son to this family. So we're both like an adopted son to this family.

454
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,640
And Mikey's my first, one of my first phone calls after knowing I wasn't, I was going to Molokai

455
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,280
because I'm like, Mikey, what are you doing? I'm coming home. The plan was we were going to put

456
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,760
our backpacks on and we were going to go hunt at least four or five areas that we'd never been to.

457
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,840
We weren't even sure if you could walk to, but we're like, we're going to find out what's over

458
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,920
there. And I met my wife and Mikey was like, what happened to our plans? And I'm like, well,

459
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:43,440
but the, the Mikey was always that first call for me. He was, he was my partner. And so in,

460
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,600
in coming back, it actually took a little while. I, there was no opportunity rate in front of me

461
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,040
and I didn't have, like I had a little bit of money saved up via, via volleyball, but

462
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,600
there were, I also didn't have like the answer yet. I didn't, I didn't quite know what, what was

463
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,920
going to do. So like it was always this like instance of learning more. And Mikey was my

464
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:13,440
hunting partner and Mike actually great story. I actually bought and sold a real estate publication

465
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:22,800
for a year. Who knows? I then got a job managing a pest control company and the, the, so doing

466
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,400
fumigations, those huge tarps on your back. And the place was a mess. Guess who the first

467
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,600
person I called was, I was like, Mikey, you're going to be my lead fumigator. We're going to

468
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:40,240
show everybody like Mikey's putting like 200 pound tarps on his back and like going up and down

469
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:47,440
ladders, like he's a squirrel. And we, me and Mikey crushed that business for three or four years

470
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,520
or about three years. And then in and amongst doing all that, somebody, the access to your

471
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,880
interest, it was still going. We were collecting all of this information. We're starting to actually

472
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,040
help other folks better understand access to your, with the information we were collecting.

473
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:13,440
And then somebody illegally dropped off deer on the big Island, which is, you know, all of the

474
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,800
islands can fit within the big Island. It's the big Island for a reason is Hawaii Island.

475
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,920
Somebody illegally drops off access deer. And we happen to be, you know, the access deer Institute,

476
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:32,320
but me and Mike happened to be the experts on access deer maybe accidentally.

477
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,440
Okay. Wait, pause. I want to come back to this right away, but I, I don't think I knew that,

478
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,040
I think I didn't know the story about you being the access to your Institute. I love that. And

479
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,640
we're going to come up with a logo. Nick is going to come up with a logo for that.

480
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,320
I've got a t-shirt. It's so old. You can have it. Like I actually like made t-shirts.

481
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,000
But, but I think one part of the story we missed was that by this point in time,

482
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,400
two other islands are now inhabited by access deer. Lanai and Maui. How and when did that happen

483
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,600
relative to the 1860s with the initial introduction to Molokai? Yeah, great, great step back.

484
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,560
In the 1920s, the then I, the then owner of the Island of Lanai, a really amazing story

485
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,280
about how they round up all the deer, but they chose to introduce deer from Molokai to Lanai.

486
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,000
And Lanai is half the size of Molokai. Very, very shortly that population became

487
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,720
fully established at what we can, like what we call carrying capacity.

488
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,400
The overall population of deer is only going up and down each year with available feed and,

489
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:56,880
or how many fawns are surviving. And a survey, five years ago, there was 21,000

490
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,520
access deer on this very, very small Island. Which topographically doesn't have anything

491
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,440
in common with Molokai. I mean, Molokai, I believe has the tallest, the highest freshwater

492
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,400
waterfalls in the world. I mean, it looks like something out of Jurassic Park. It is not,

493
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,080
it is not anything like what people think of when they think of Hawaii.

494
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:28,320
Yeah. So yeah, absolutely. And I think to that point shows how adaptable access deer really are

495
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:37,040
to become established so quickly, regardless of the environment. So the next phase, which is

496
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:45,520
really interesting. So deer are introduced to Maui in the 1960s, but under controversy,

497
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,280
you think by now there's common knowledge that this is not, like there are issues with this animal.

498
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,120
And they had, if I remember correctly, they had about 20 deer in a pen on Ladei

499
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,840
and 10 of them were slated for Maui and 10 of them were slated for the big Island.

500
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:11,360
And the Cattlemen's Association on the big Island. And I remember reading stories about like

501
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,240
national park reps from across the country. Like there's this huge outcry on the big Island that

502
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,800
said, no way, we're not bringing this animal to the big Island. It'll be detrimental. And

503
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,400
this is the state now. So this isn't like a private introduction. This is the state saying,

504
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,320
we think it's in the Island's best interest to move more of these access deer around.

505
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,160
So long story short, the big Island says, no, they get introduced to the Island of Maui. Maui is

506
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:52,400
460,000 acres. So the population on Maui is still what we consider an emerging population. So they're

507
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,840
continuing to grow. They haven't reached carrying capacity. And in, so this year we estimate the

508
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:08,560
population on Maui to be about 60,000 deer, but the population will max out at 210,000 deer.

509
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,560
And essentially Maui is another very dynamic landscape that looks in some areas completely

510
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:22,000
different than Molokai. But they'll find all of those places and they'll fill themselves in unless

511
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,480
we're able to, you know, get ahead of that. So, and just to round it out, where is, where is

512
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:34,720
Molokai today? Population wise? It's an estimate. So, cause we don't have a full survey, but I would

513
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:43,440
say Molokai is at about 60 to 70,000 deer. And remember there's only 7,000 people and probably

514
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,200
the best way, Oh, this will be really interesting. How far are you from what they consider Texas

515
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,920
Hill Country? Isn't it outside Austin? Yeah. We're three hours from, I mean, we're, we're,

516
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,840
it depends a bit, but we're three hours from where the access deer are in Texas, which is,

517
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,880
I think the only other state that has access deer, right? I don't think any other state in the U.S.

518
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,600
has access here besides Hawaii and Texas. No, where I'm going with this is I remember reading

519
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:18,000
a whole bunch of studies on deer densities per acre and Texas Hill Country had the densest deer

520
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,640
acreage or densest number of deer per acre at about six per 100 acres. And like Wisconsin and

521
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:37,120
Mississippi was behind that Hawaii in established areas has 25 deer per hundred acres. So at least

522
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:47,040
3X, whatever the densest deer populations on the continent are. Well, so, so yeah,

523
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:59,120
that's how they get to the three main islands. And then in 2000 and I think it was 2010 or 11

524
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,720
was when that introduction by private individuals, it wasn't the state. They decided they were going

525
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:14,080
to trap deer on Maui, fly them to, excuse me, the big island via helicopter, drop them off.

526
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,840
How many deer did they take?

527
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,120
They dropped off four.

528
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,840
Two and two.

529
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:27,760
And three and one, three does in a buck. And nobody, and they do it quietly

530
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,840
and nobody finds out about it till about a year and a half later.

531
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,720
And that's when it started, like, that's when there was like, wait, there's a camera trap image.

532
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,280
Actually, a rancher saw it. They called me and Mike because we were already closely tied to,

533
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean, both my wife's family and my Hanai family are in the conservation community. And so we found

534
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,800
out about it right away. And everybody said, if you got any chance of like finding these things,

535
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,480
here's the two guys to ask. And we went out and looked in the area. Now, remember,

536
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,640
it's actually, actually, I remember doing this, the area they dropped them off, they didn't know

537
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,400
where they were. Somebody had just seen one in passing on the road. The area was the size of

538
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,600
Molokai. It was 70 square miles was like the management area. So I remember like getting to

539
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,720
the first one and be like, we think there's deer in here. And then they were like, oh,

540
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:34,560
it's like a 70 square mile area. And I just remember thinking, how the hell are we going

541
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:41,520
to find these animals? And we're and me and Mike already knew how, how extraordinary these animals

542
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,960
were to find even when there were there's thousands of them. Yeah, I mean, it's safe to say at this

543
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,280
point, you and Mike know almost as much as any two people about their behavior. Now going back to Mike

544
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,400
growing up on Molokai, I mean, literally walking to school every day hunting, eating this animal

545
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,600
every day. I mean, and I've hunted with Mike, which is one of the most remarkable experiences

546
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:11,360
anyone can have. This is basically a guy who knows everything. This is the closest human to an

547
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:18,080
axis deer. Like he's almost able to sprout antlers of his own. That's as close as we will get in our

548
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:26,800
evolution to them. He just knows where they go. Yeah. So they reach out to you guys, but this is

549
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,160
the government that this is basically the state is saying, we have a problem because we've got these

550
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,720
three potentially more deer on the big island. And if this thing's left unchecked, it's going to be

551
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:46,160
a catastrophe. Millions of deer. Yeah. And the big island being like our primary egg hub, our primary

552
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,560
food hub for, and these obviously acts of deer eat almost anything. So it started a three year

553
00:58:52,560 --> 00:59:02,160
project and it took us three years to find those animals. And I mean, you, you know how difficult it

554
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:11,600
is like to wake up every morning and either like walk quietly enough and in tune enough to like

555
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,360
assume you're going to see something or sit quietly enough. Like, so you can like the,

556
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:26,960
the level of like, I just remember being so exhausted mentally and we went a year and a half

557
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:34,080
before we saw a deer and you know, Mike, like, so it's like, they're not here. There's no way.

558
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:41,280
Like it was this constant mental battle. It was like, we literally hunted almost every single day

559
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,560
for a year and a half without seeing an animal. Yeah. What I think is amazing about that is

560
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:52,240
everything you just said, which includes the idea that at some level in the back of your mind,

561
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,960
you have to be entertaining the thought they didn't survive. Right. And you could be sitting

562
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:05,920
here looking for a skeleton. Yeah. And, and I remember like sitting across, like I remember

563
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,560
me and Mike being probably the perfect partners for this. Cause whenever I was like, there's not

564
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,480
a chance, man. We've walked this place eight times, but part of it, it was so big and it, it's these,

565
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,200
it was an area that has, it's very, very windy. So there's windblown trees over the vast majority

566
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:31,840
of the area. So think about a Briar Grove or what are they called? It literally was like doing yoga

567
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,240
all day long. Like you were crawling in and through all of these trees, which deer love.

568
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,200
So it was like physically exhausting, but then it was mentally exhausting. Cause you're only

569
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,640
covering a certain amount of acres. You're looking for like a single piece of scat or like deer

570
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,280
feces. You're looking for like a single rub. You're looking for like anything that would tell you

571
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:59,600
that they're there. And what we didn't know was they had found a safe spot and were encompassing

572
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:09,280
like it was less than a hundred acres, Peter. And so we were looking in like, but part of,

573
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,800
I think what's important of this story is at the point we were like, there has to be a better way.

574
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:21,120
That's when we learned and started like working with the military for the Fleur equipment.

575
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,600
And the Fleur equipment was ultimately what found them for us. So Fleur equipment picks up

576
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,160
infrared or heat signatures from bodies, and then they'll translate that into an electrical

577
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:38,000
optical image for you to be able to view. And the military was involved. Like it was such a big deal.

578
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,280
And the military loaned us one of their binocular units. And me and Mike were like,

579
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,400
it was that instant realization. Like, how did we ever do this without this thing? And that

580
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,880
ultimately over a period of a couple of months, we were able to start chunking off huge areas of land

581
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,120
in being able to view with great detail these areas from a thermography standpoint. And that's

582
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:10,880
how we found them. Do you remember that first day that you actually saw one? Oh, it was crazy

583
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,560
because Mike was looking through it and it was, we're doing all of this in the middle of the night

584
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,880
because you can only really use Fleur effectively in the middle of the night. And I'm kind of have

585
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,600
my seat back in the Tacoma. And I see Mike take his eyes off the binocular unit and then put his

586
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,200
eyes on and then take his eyes off. And he turned around and he looked like he'd seen a ghost.

587
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,440
He looked so purple. I didn't even know what it was. I thought he saw a dead body or something.

588
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:47,120
And the only reason we saw it, it was a buck in velvet. And the velvet antler has so much blood

589
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:55,600
in it. It's so hot. And it was like five miles away. And we just saw this velvet antler in this

590
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:03,520
super dense cover. And Mike was like, that's a deer. I think that's a deer. And so I got on

591
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:16,960
the binocular and we had been training for this forever. And so I stayed there and we got on the

592
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,880
hooked up via radio. And basically over the next four hours, Mike went down. I guided him in like

593
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,880
via binocular unit. And while he was going down there, we saw several other deer. I think it was

594
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:38,560
two, three more. And yeah, Mike was able to find and get that buck. He just missed the doe that

595
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,440
was with it. But we then knew like, it was a brand new realization. Like they're here.

596
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,840
How many deer were there at the time? Was it still just four or had they reproduced like crazy?

597
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,120
It was still just four actually. It ended up being five. But at the time,

598
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,640
there were only four that we knew of. And it still took you another year and a half to capture them

599
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:07,440
all. Yeah, because we weren't smart enough. We bumped their home range and they moved several

600
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,720
miles away and we had to go find them again. Like, I mean, at some point like the state of Hawaii

601
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:19,600
forgotten that they've hired you to do this. Like, I mean, this is three years. This is the longest

602
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:28,720
contractor job ever, right? I think everybody assumed we weren't going to do it. And for a

603
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:39,200
couple of reasons, one, and this is not me. I don't want to talk poorly about invasive species are such

604
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:45,920
a prolific issue here in Hawaii. You think everything evolved here over millennia, like

605
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,920
anything we introduce is just like, it's such a disaster. It doesn't matter if it's a frog or a

606
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,560
plant. There's so much money spent on invasive species every year. And the vast, vast majority

607
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:03,760
of it, I would say the projects aren't what we would consider to be successful. Like we don't

608
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,720
eradicate that animal. And then you talk like on top of that, you assume like everybody's

609
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,880
basic knowledge of access to your were like, these things are impossible to find.

610
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,320
I think everybody assumed it wasn't going to happen anyway. So we had like a minuscule budget,

611
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:25,440
because me and Mike rolling around like in an old Tacoma that we actually wasn't like that was

612
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:31,120
lended to us with like half ass equipment. Me and like Mike's shoes have duct tape all over them.

613
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,400
Funding boosted pretty quick after we got the first year, but

614
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:43,440
I think everybody just assumed we would fail. And I think we would have had it not been for

615
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,680
like, I think just some of the resiliency with came with my and Mike's partnership.

616
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,440
Like I would be like, there's no like, this is it like there's this is a waste of time and Mike

617
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,800
would be like, ah, let's just check over here. And then Mike would be like, this is ridiculous.

618
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,880
Like we're not going to find anything. But like, you know what, let's like, and I think that

619
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,680
partnership was what ultimately got us to the first year. And then once we like once we knew

620
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,880
there were more deer, it took 10 years we were going to find the rest of those deer.

621
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,760
And so part of that process with that Fleur equipment was now we were able to

622
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,520
and we didn't realize how important the Fleur equipment would be for us in our lives.

623
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,880
Is that because you didn't appreciate how nocturnal they were or you didn't realize

624
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,600
what an advantage you could have with that asymmetry of information at night?

625
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:41,360
You nailed both of it. We didn't understand how much more active they were at night. We didn't

626
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:47,280
understand all of the behavior cues of what was happening at night. And then on top of it,

627
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:56,320
we started to realize really quickly through repetition, wait, that's the same pig we saw

628
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,960
via like we're doing these surveys via helicopter. That's the same pig we saw three days ago.

629
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,880
Wait, that's the same goat we saw three days ago. So there was like we started to then realize how

630
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:14,000
accurate their equipment was in its detection rates. And so on top of being able to find more

631
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,240
animals, we're also getting significantly more confident in what we weren't seeing,

632
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,760
that we weren't missing anything. So we were able to start a certification process to be like,

633
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,880
we know they're not here. And ultimately, when me and Mike realized, wait, this thing is accurate

634
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,520
enough that we can trust it. It started like narrowing down thousands of thousands of acres

635
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,520
to like, wait, they're not here. We know we can go to the next place. When you're walking on the

636
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:47,520
ground, and me and Mike are 20 feet apart, and I can't see him, like you're constantly

637
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:52,880
questioning, did I miss something, right? So that was ultimately what led to finding the rest of

638
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,360
those deer. And then that tool equated to like developing survey procedures for it,

639
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:08,160
which didn't exist anywhere else. And I remember, and that also me what brought it to my but I

640
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:14,400
remember like finding and like removing that last deer. And me and Mike looking at each other, like,

641
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,960
and we knew we were like, oh, shit, we got them all.

642
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,920
How did you know that was the last one? Because it would suggest that these animals were so under

643
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,560
stress that they didn't reproduce if they were together, but not, I mean, they certainly had

644
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:37,120
ample time to reproduce, right? Yeah. We were confident that was the last one in that area.

645
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,760
During the process of those three years, we had sightings all over the Big Island that

646
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,600
people thought were deer. There's no way I can say there's no deer on the Big Island.

647
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,360
I can confidently say at the time we were done that project, we were,

648
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,240
well, the guy, the helicopter pilot that dropped it off, who ended up being our best friend,

649
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:04,800
got his restitution was 300 hours in a helicopter with us.

650
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,280
So like, think about when you sit in your car, like how much area you can cover, like we can cover

651
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:18,880
10,000 acres in an hour. We were, we were recertifying acreage almost 10 times over

652
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,200
with equipment we believe was like 95% accurate in detection rates. We knew we did like,

653
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,920
we were getting so confident, like we were getting so good. We were marking beehives

654
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:38,320
as our detection protocol. Okay. We're going back into this area. If we find the same beehive,

655
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:43,760
we're at a thousand feet in the air. If we can find that same beehive in this area,

656
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:50,560
we'll consider that we didn't miss anything. Wow. So, so we're starting to, yeah. I think

657
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:57,520
ultimately that's what gave us the confidence to say we're done. And I'm not sure, but anecdotally

658
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:07,280
now eight years later, there hasn't been another sighting in the area. And man, talk about life

659
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:13,040
lessons. Like waking up every morning or actually to the second half of the project, waking up every

660
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,880
night at like six, eating dinner with your family, and then rolling out for 12 hours of using that

661
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,080
floor equipment, like not knowing what you were going to find, you know, for three, like a three

662
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:32,880
year hunt. It was any, yeah, apart from athletics, I think any level of resiliency I have

663
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:39,200
probably came from, came from that project for sure. What did your wife think? I mean,

664
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:45,840
was this what she had signed up for? The, the nighttime working husband and you're on the big

665
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,400
island. Was that something that she, is that a, is that a, has she always wanted to stay on Malakai?

666
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,640
Her family in her teenage years, some of them moved to the big island, most importantly her mom

667
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:08,240
and her mom are very close. And we love Malakai, but it takes like, there isn't, there wasn't,

668
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,080
there wasn't any opportunity at that point. Like after we were married, we had, we were married on

669
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,880
Malakai. Like there wasn't, there wasn't anything for us to do. Like there were no, there's no jobs

670
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,040
on Malakai. Like, and if they are, they're, they're, they're like, somebody's already lined up for

671
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,240
whenever that position opens up. So part of it was we needed to, we had planned to start a family

672
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,920
and wanted to start a life and we knew we needed a little bit more opportunity to do so. We went to

673
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:39,360
the big island and a lot of her family were here. So we did that. My wife, and I'll give her a shout

674
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,000
out here. And maybe, you know, it's interesting because I remember you telling me something about

675
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:55,760
Jill, like unrelenting support. It, like there is no way I'm where I'm at. I think I could probably

676
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,720
say this about you without that level of support. Like it was always, if that's what we're doing,

677
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:08,320
that's what we're doing. And she is extraordinarily talented. She's one of the best writers I know.

678
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,400
She's a graphic designer. She's a genealogist. Like she constantly is putting things aside for,

679
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,000
and now, and she's, she's our co-founder at this company and one of our most important people, but

680
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,920
she constantly put things aside for what this was. But part of it was, these were huge

681
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,840
ecological and community issues. And, and she was behind me a hundred percent.

682
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:40,480
Um, yeah, it would have never happened without her. Cause no, I mean, convincing any

683
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,680
significant other to sleep by themselves every single night, and then you roll in

684
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:52,000
an absolute mess in the morning is not, is not conducive. So, and, and, and I remember you telling

685
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,640
me a long time ago that you didn't even take a day off for the first year, right? Oh yeah.

686
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:06,240
It was seven days a week. It was a contract. Yeah. Yeah. Because, well, I mean, we thought we were

687
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,400
going to find him in the first week. We're like, Oh, they saw him over here. Me and Mike, you were

688
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:16,880
like, we're going to walk every single day for 12 hours till we find them. And I can remember like

689
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,640
finishing the first month, like by the end of the first month, we were already like, Oh, there's no

690
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,880
deer here. That guy didn't see something. But what, what ended up spurring on the rest of it was

691
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,040
me and Mike look through the entire, and this is why Mike is so good.

692
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:36,720
Mike said, if there is a deer here, it's going to walk right there. We're going to put up a camera

693
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,240
trap. So not like we're going to put up a hundred camera traps and see, I think we had three camera

694
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:48,240
traps. Mike was like, if there is a deer here, he's going to walk right there. I think like

695
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:53,120
thousands of acres and sure enough, like month four, we got a camera trap image of a deer.

696
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:00,240
And that's like, that was hard evidence. And we were, we were honestly as surprised as anybody

697
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:07,520
at that point. And we're like, there's deer here. And so that obviously spurred on everything else

698
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:14,000
that went along with it. So it was, yeah, I mean, you think, oh, me and you've done some really hard

699
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,480
four day hunts together. And at the end of that four days, you're just like, it was,

700
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,880
it was, it was,

701
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,040
Now I have a better understanding of why after a hard four day hunt, that's hard for me.

702
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,760
You look like you've been sitting at the beach all day. That puts that into perspective.

703
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:42,880
So you guys go back to Maui and is there something about the burden of access deer there that has you

704
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,360
start to focus your effort and refine your thinking about what you and Mike can be doing

705
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,720
specifically there? Because at this point in time, it's safe to say there's no real concerted

706
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:03,760
strategy around what to do. Right? You have this animal that, and by the way, in Maui,

707
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,520
I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the relationship between

708
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,320
the people of Maui and the access deer is as affectionate as it might be on Molokai. Right?

709
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,480
I mean, I think the destruction is much greater.

710
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:24,080
Yeah. I mean, the first meeting I went to on Maui, they were, won't mention the person, but

711
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:30,640
calling them spotted rats. Like I think they had already for sure found value within the subsistence

712
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:37,280
community as that, but they were dropped off in the central area for all ranching. And so they,

713
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,480
they obviously directly compete with cattle for feed and they break fences and, and they started

714
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,560
to see that, that population grow pretty quickly. And so the, excuse me, the move from

715
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:57,600
the big Island to Maui was primarily because of opportunity. What ended up happening is the

716
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,480
ranchers on Maui who were of course watching this closely and saying, don't let these things get

717
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:09,840
established on the big Island. One particular rancher on Maui said, wait, you guys actually got

718
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,120
it done. Like you guys might know what you're doing. Like right as we closed that project,

719
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:21,200
they said, we've got tens of thousands of deer over here. We don't care what you do with them,

720
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:29,520
just come and shoot them. And I mean, we couldn't do that. Like all of the,

721
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,320
all of the learnings and experience and like cultural values that we, like that came from

722
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,920
Molokai were still very much like a part of who we were. And so for a rancher to be able to say like,

723
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,480
well, just shoot them all, like bury them. We don't care. That was like, and we had already had,

724
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,600
like I'd already done some research on like Europe has an extensive venison industry. New

725
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,480
Zealand has an extensive venison industry and already had like thought that thought process.

726
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,520
And that, but that was the trigger to say, wait, there's gotta be a better way.

727
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,280
Because by this point that was already happening on other, on Lanai. They were basically shooting

728
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:12,720
these things out of helicopters and just letting them die on the, I mean, it, it sort of became

729
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,800
this issue of, look, these things are causing so much damage. And I also want to get into some of

730
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,560
the specifics of the damage, because as I would learn, and I was surprised to learn this, it wasn't

731
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,800
just, Hey, they're competing for the same resources as the cattle, which is the, you know, the business

732
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,720
here, but it's how that would even trickle into the ecology of the ocean. That was completely new

733
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,120
to me. And I, I simply wouldn't have understood the nitrogen balance and the change and all of that.

734
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:46,880
Um, so yeah, it's the, the farmers understandably are saying, look, I don't care what has to happen

735
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,720
if the government is willing to get into helicopters with AR 15s and shoot these things out of the air.

736
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:59,200
I'm happy to have the carcasses laying around and, and explain a little bit more about what the

737
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:05,920
full extent of the life cycle is in terms of the disruption to the native species there from

738
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:15,840
basically land to water. Um, yeah. So, I mean, we have to take a little bit of a step back in terms

739
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:23,440
of evolution in that Hawaii is the most isolated landmass on the planet. Everything here evolved

740
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:29,040
like kind of textbook adaptive radiation, like everything over here has evolved over millennia

741
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:37,120
to, to be best suited for its environment right here, which included no large mammals apart from

742
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,920
a bat and certainly no grazing herbivores. So like we have mints that are mintless, like we are,

743
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,560
and now we are the endangered species capital of the world. We have more endangered species

744
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,800
per acre here than anywhere else in the world. I think we're, I think 30% of the endangered species

745
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:06,960
list in the U S is all plants, birds from Hawaii. And that is a function of the introduction of

746
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:15,440
non-native species and how they affect biodiversity. So the impact of access deer, you know, Peter,

747
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:21,760
probably the most influential impact to our communities as a whole is at the very top of

748
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,880
our mountains. And you've been to one of those places. They are, again, as one of the most

749
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,320
isolated land masses, water is probably, I mean, you guys had some issues with water this week.

750
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:37,680
Like water is one of the most important things for us as a community. And you guys had snow on

751
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:47,040
Haleakala recently, right? We still do. Yeah. Yeah. Um, amazing. What water is, and the Hawaiians

752
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:53,680
knew this, the word for wealth was a vai vai. It was water in, in like four, four native Hawaiians.

753
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:01,120
Our watersheds are our most important resource and those watersheds developed. It was, it's almost

754
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,520
like in this permaculture fashion where there's these three layers and they've developed to

755
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,280
capture all of this fog and rain. And they go directly into our aquifers, any ungulate deer

756
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,920
included, ungulate being a cloven hoofed animal. So goats, pigs, deer, et cetera, et cetera.

757
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:23,840
Any ungulate in our forests, it might as well be a salad bar. Like they, like they literally can

758
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,960
eat anything. There are no protections. Those plants have developed no protections for themselves.

759
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:36,880
And once those animals affect the efficiency of our waterfeds, they affect how much water they

760
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:45,200
capture at a significant rate. So their, their most profound effect is in our mountains and

761
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:52,960
affecting how that ecosystem collects water. And so as we come down the hill, that's when they

762
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:01,040
start interacting with our ranchers and farmers. And like we talked about, they directly compete

763
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:09,200
for feed at a rate of about seven to one. Every seven deer equates to about one cow. But there's

764
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:15,280
a lettuce farmer can lose 10 acres of lettuce overnight when a herd of a thousand deer come in.

765
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,800
Like they'll absolutely decimate that. Fencing is optional for deer. Like we've seen deer hop over

766
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:29,040
six foot fences like nothing. So this downstream effect of them impacting how we capture water

767
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:36,720
and then them impacting our food systems all the time, they're also degrading the, like the

768
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:44,080
understory. And what happens when we have large rain events is all of the sediment, all of our

769
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,080
soil, I mean, if there's anything more valuable than water, it's soil. All of the soil that have

770
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:58,160
taken tens of thousands of years to form on this tiny island, especially like coming from lava rock,

771
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,440
all of the soil, all of this incredibly valuable top soil will run off into our oceans.

772
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:14,160
And it doesn't even stop there. There's like deer scat are extremely high in nitrogen. You

773
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:20,080
kind of mentioned this, like the downstream effect of not only the soil depositing on our reefs,

774
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:26,720
but also the impact of like the nitrogen from like thousands of deer's feces starts to bleach

775
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,720
our reefs as well. And I can't say for sure there's a direct link between like that nitrogen

776
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,360
and how it affects it. We know that may be the case with soil, but more than anything,

777
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:47,440
thousands of pounds of sediment come down in these events. And when you fly over our islands,

778
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:55,200
I fly every week, you just see these crazy plumes, like miles and miles wide of this red dirt that

779
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,920
is just going out and covering the reefs. And well, guess what's important about our reef systems,

780
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:09,040
apart from obviously the incredible ecosystems they support food, we've lost significant amounts

781
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:17,520
of reef and the fish that then go along with them. So there's this, they call it maukatu makai,

782
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,280
there's this downstream effect of their impact. That is, I mean, I don't think we completely

783
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:31,520
understand the cumulative impact, like, but it's, we can see it every time these events happen and

784
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:38,160
we can see it when we're in watersheds and part of understand, like, yeah. And then,

785
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,440
so that understanding was obviously what spurred on, you know, the want to better manage them,

786
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,720
but along with it is, like we talked about, they're a food resource. So they're not only a food

787
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:56,320
resource, but they're impacting our food security. And so it's just like when they're imbalanced,

788
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,120
it's a double-edged sword in that they're being, they're significantly detrimental and they're

789
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,240
impacting our food security here as the most isolated landmass on the planet. So it's just all,

790
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:12,000
the vast majority of their impact is not a net positive for our communities when you're at such

791
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,480
imbalance in these populations. And as you were coming into sort of your deeper and deeper

792
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:25,520
understanding of this, you're also continuing to develop with Mike this unbelievable credibility

793
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:32,400
with the community in terms of, like, it just blows my mind what you guys continue to do. So now fast

794
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:39,600
forward to the volcano eruptions. And so, so, so let's talk a little bit about what happened

795
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,440
and what, what type of a threat that was to livestock and what, you know, you guys are doing

796
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,720
with helicopters. I mean, this, this, this is the stuff that's out of movies. Then again, I think,

797
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,720
I'm not asking you to tell the story from the sake of boasting about what you've done, but I think,

798
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,360
I think it kind of continues to round out the story of, you know, these are guys who

799
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:12,880
first and foremost are here to protect Hawaii. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, with Mike as a partner,

800
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:19,920
we just develop a knack to get things done. And like, there was so much problem solving. And as

801
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:28,400
we developed solutions for access to deer and what one of the, a couple of years in, we had a

802
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:34,960
large eruption on Kilauea on the big Island and we had already developed, it was the first of its kind.

803
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,680
It was a live cattle net capture system. You gotta imagine a cow is a really big thing.

804
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:48,160
And basically what it was, if I can explain this properly, it was, it was, it was a large

805
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:56,720
metal frame, a circular frame with a triangle net. And there was, it was attached to the tip of the

806
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:04,800
net. So the top of the cone and it was attached to the frame of the circular structure. And what

807
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:11,600
would happen is via helicopter, we would put the cone over the animal. We would release the top of

808
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:18,960
the net. The net would fall down. The animal would walk out to the end of the net and then we would

809
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,520
pick up the frame and it would be sitting in this like perfect cradle. A little hammock.

810
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:31,520
Yeah. So it had like, it was a little hammock ride. Well, we had a, several years ago, we had a

811
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:40,800
very unexpected and very quick moving lava flow. We're talking, it was about 500 yards wide

812
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:50,000
moving at 50 miles an hour. And it, and it ended up completely destroying an entire community.

813
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,440
Like it's gone. There are no remnants of it. It just completely wiped the whole community out.

814
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,600
And it was this amazing community. It's there still, it was a significant loss for the community,

815
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:07,600
but in the process, two lava flows formed and they cut off a huge portion of a ranching area

816
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:15,840
and including homes and a bunch of things in there. And the state needed a solution for,

817
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,680
they wanted to find a way for these animals not to die. And me and Mike of course said,

818
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:30,240
well, we can do that. Having zero context. Well, we can go and do that. And I remember

819
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,480
driving out the first morning. So we bring in all of the equipment, like got it in the back of the

820
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:41,120
truck and we're driving out early in the morning and it looked like Armageddon, like the entire

821
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:47,200
sky in the middle of the night was red and roiling and like it was creating, there was so much heat.

822
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:52,640
It was creating its own weather system. It was lightning. Like it was, it was such an odd

823
01:27:52,640 --> 01:28:01,200
experience to be driving towards it with the idea that we were going to fly around and pick these

824
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:10,160
animals up flying over these 50 mile an hour lava flows. But me and Mike were like, yeah,

825
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:15,920
we can do it. And at that point, we, hookah was already a part of our team and you've met hookah.

826
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,520
So now we're talking the dream team here.

827
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,400
And hookah's like, boys, we're going to be lava cowboys. And you know, hookah, I'm just like,

828
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,880
oh man. But I think we needed that level of positivity. Like what we were facing

829
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,320
was fairly substantial and it was risky. And I was never going to risk any of my guy's life.

830
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,040
Ultimately, it was my responsibility. I wasn't going to risk any of their life for a cow.

831
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,400
But long story short, we get on site, we use the Fleur really quickly to figure out how many

832
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:55,920
animals are there and where they are. And then we come back and we hook the net up. And there's

833
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:03,520
lots of good stories, but probably the first one is probably the most interesting. We go over to

834
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,960
find the first one and we were working with a helicopter pilot we'd only work with a couple

835
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:13,680
times before, but he was he was amazing. And he goes and he puts the net over. How long do you

836
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:20,320
have? Like what's the distance? How close do you need to be to the cow? Well, we need to be,

837
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:26,960
it's a hundred foot line under the, so it's this, this cone is hanging under the cow. And there's

838
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,200
like your eye level with like lava flows. And there's, there was something called fissure eight.

839
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,160
There's like fissure eight is blowing in front of you, like a couple thousand yards, like, and you're

840
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:40,400
seeing like chunks of magma going everywhere. And like you're seeing the ground heat up on two sides

841
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,680
and how is that? The pilots going and not interfering with what the pilots able to do

842
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:52,480
in terms of stabilizing the helicopter. Because the cows had moved themselves into the internal

843
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:59,360
area between the two flows. So we were coming over the first lava flow and like the helicopter

844
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:06,400
went like this, like there was so much heat coming off the flow. It was like, like it was tossing the

845
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:14,240
helicopter three, 400 feet in the air, like almost instantly. And so we get to the inside and

846
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,800
constantly they're like, are you sure we're good? I'm like, if you're good, I'm good. And there's

847
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:28,880
GoPro video of all of this. So he makes not the mistake, but the cow he happened to catch first

848
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:36,480
was a huge bull. And it was right at the max lifting capacity of the helicopter. But once that

849
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:42,480
bull, he has a 2000 pound animal, once that bull is in the helicopter or in the net system,

850
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:52,640
it's fairly difficult to get out by yourself. And the, well, it wasn't CO2. I can't remember what

851
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,640
the, what chemical we were most worried about or what gas we were most worried about, but we all

852
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:01,760
had like indicators while we're wearing like indicators. And like, I remember like having to

853
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,120
get on the ground and like seeing blue spots, like the gas levels were fairly dangerous as well. So

854
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,720
we didn't want to get on the ground. We wanted to be where airflow was good. And so he says,

855
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,360
like he goes to pick it up and he can get it off the ground and he's moving and he's like,

856
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:22,320
what do you want to do? And I was like, can you get this thing across the lava flow without me

857
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:28,240
getting on the ground? And he's like, I think so. And I'm just like, son of a bitch. Like,

858
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:35,360
he's like, here's what we're going to do. We're going to use the heat from the flow to lift us up.

859
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:42,320
And I'm thinking, well, what if that doesn't work? Like we're going to barbecue this cow.

860
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,920
Like, and he was like, he was confident. And I've learned along the years, like

861
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:54,320
you trust your pilot, like they're the ones that's going to keep you safe. And so this cow is flying

862
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,960
under the helicopter at a hundred feet. So we're only a hundred and fit, you know,

863
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,120
250 feet above the ground. And as we get to the flow, sure enough, the helicopter just goes

864
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,520
and it lifts straight up. And I look down and it's like depth perception is pretty tough at

865
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:20,560
that point. When I look down and the entire cow, I thought lit up with smoke. And I had thought,

866
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:27,200
I thought whole, like I was like, what did we just do? Like we just burnt this cow.

867
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:34,720
I cannot believe like, and like state officials, humane society, everybody is at the corral

868
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:39,360
system on the other side where we're bringing this cow in. And I'm just like, I didn't know

869
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:44,160
what to do. Like, this is going to sound terrible. I honestly contemplated like if it was dead,

870
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:53,200
just dropping it in the lava flow. And so we're flying over this lava flow. And like,

871
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:59,280
all I see is smoke coming from this cow. And what I didn't realize is it was steam.

872
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:07,680
I had forgot that it was raining and the cow had water all over it. And I realized as we got over

873
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,120
the flow, all of the steam came off the cow and the cow was fine. Like it's just sitting there

874
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:21,440
in its hammock. And we brought that cow in. So the way it works is it's hanging in its cradle

875
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:27,440
with the frame above it like this. And you put it down and then you put the frame right back over

876
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:32,400
it. And it just stands up and walks up. And so this cow just stand, and we have all of this on

877
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,360
video, this cow just stands up, walks out like nothing wrong, walks over, starts grabbing some

878
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:43,680
feed like that's on the side. And we had never done it before. And like, Oka and Mike are looking at

879
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,800
me like I was the first one in the helicopter and they're like, is it going to work? I'm like,

880
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:56,320
it works. And then we spent, we had four separate missions to get out all of the cows

881
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,480
over a period of like a week or two. And I think we ended up doing

882
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:09,680
40 or 50 cows. And like the stories are just like, imagine like Oka every morning

883
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:17,280
thriving on this like lava, like he had like lava cowboys on his coolers. Like it was, but

884
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,920
to the rancher, that was potentially going to lose it all. And to communities that were seeing

885
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,360
all of this loss, like there was not like, there was just all of this loss from this flow.

886
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,840
It became this really interesting rallying point for the local community. There's like,

887
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:38,400
A, it was probably like fantastical to see, but B, like, it's like, wait,

888
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,600
we're like, we're not going to lose it all. We're going to get some of this stuff back.

889
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:50,080
And I think it's a, yeah, a long line of projects and innovations that are like,

890
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:55,360
yeah, we can, I think we can do that. And we just, we just had a knack of like figuring it out as we

891
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:59,680
go. Cause there was certainly some bumps in that road. You imagine like me, Mike and Oka standing

892
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:06,160
around with no, like with very limited math experience between the three of us. And we're

893
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:10,720
looking at this huge cargo net and like these pipes. And we're like, I think we argued for like

894
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:16,640
three hours before we built this thing. I just, I just, I just wish I was there for that. Like that

895
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:22,240
is cause I know how much fun it is to just be sitting around the campfire talking about the,

896
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,360
that stove that we like that the, the sure stove, like it's called and getting into the math of that.

897
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:33,520
So this is, I'm going to talk about the stakes being high. So, so how do you go from that to

898
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:41,440
where you are now, which is you've created this company called Maui Nui, which is effectively

899
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:49,120
an unbelievably efficient, humane way to opera to operationalize the harvesting of access deer

900
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,840
for, for food at a USDA certification, which is, uh, it's important for people to understand,

901
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,760
like you and I could go out and hunt access deer, but that doesn't really mean anything because

902
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,720
that's, even if you had a hundred people hunting these things, you, you can't sell that to somebody

903
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:13,200
like a restaurant isn't going to do that. There's food safety issues. So, um, how did you get to

904
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,920
the, the, the formation of what it is you're, you're doing now, which is by that point,

905
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,400
this is about now when you and I are getting to meet each other. Yeah. Um, well, it was a little

906
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:30,800
bit, a little bit before, a little bit before then, because after we finished the project on the big

907
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:37,360
island and we went to, we were getting those inquiries from Maui and like the light bulb went

908
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,920
off like, Hey, there's gotta be a better way. So we understood population dynamics. We understood

909
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:47,440
what we were dealing with. Like from an animal standpoint, the question was like, why can't we

910
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:57,760
eat these things? And we understood the legality of it. So in on the continent, all native game

911
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:06,720
mammals are owned by the public. So, you know, somebody, a resident of Bozeman, Montana owns the

912
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:12,720
elk that's on private property in on a, on a ranch somewhere else. Like the state owns that animal and

913
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:20,480
therefore you own that animal as a non-native invasive species in Hawaii. The ownership of

914
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:27,120
that animal falls to the private landowner where that animal lies essentially. And also the

915
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:34,480
management of it. So you can ask, but the state isn't responsible to manage that animal on private

916
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:40,560
property. State is really only responsible to manage that animal in on, in public spaces. So we,

917
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,480
we are not allowed to operate on public land. So we only operate in privacy. And I think it's really

918
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:53,920
important to understand, um, the difference. So we knew that the landowner owned the animal.

919
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,240
And so I remember one of the first calls to the USDA where I was like, Hey,

920
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,920
we want to be able to manage these animals. What rules would we have to follow? And what would we

921
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,080
have to provide in order to have this animal be USDA inspected? And the guy, I remember the guy,

922
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:17,840
he actually laughed. He just said, here's the meat inspection act from 1930. It's the federal meat

923
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:26,320
inspection act. If you can follow these rules somehow, we'll give you guys a shot. And so

924
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:33,600
it's this thick. And so I remember like reading it nonstop for several days and like finding the

925
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,640
couple of spots in there that require humane handling and all of the things that come into

926
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:43,200
the process of like, um, harvesting an animal or like rendering an animal. And I was like,

927
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,240
I think we can do this. And I, I called them back and explained the process. Like we have this

928
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:54,640
amazing floor equipment where we can see these animals. I believe we can render these animals.

929
01:38:54,640 --> 01:39:01,040
So one of the most important things is we have to follow all of the rules of a brick and mortar

930
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:06,480
facility, but in the field for wild harvesting, which the most important thing is how that animal

931
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:13,760
dies. And it has to be done. It has to be the terminology is rendered immediately unconscious,

932
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:19,120
but it has to be shot in the head. It has to break the skull cap. So it dies immediately.

933
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:26,720
And they doubted whether or not we could do that. And if we couldn't do it efficient efficiently,

934
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,560
they essentially shut you down overnight. It's one of the most important things.

935
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:37,600
And the other part of that was we needed a USDA certified slaughter facility.

936
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:45,600
When I did the math on it all, um, it wasn't possible to use the current facilities on Maui.

937
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,400
So there were two major hiccups to start was like, a, can we do this efficiently enough? And B,

938
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:59,440
well, my wife let me re mortgage my house to buy a slaughter facility, a mobile slaughter facility.

939
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:05,120
And at the beginning, both those answers were no. I didn't, I wasn't willing to re mortgage the house

940
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,120
knowing that we might not be efficient enough to harvest these animals. Cause we didn't know yet.

941
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:17,840
Right. So the way we started that venture and it wasn't perfect. Everything we do,

942
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,960
it isn't perfect. The way we started the understanding and moving forward to be able

943
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,960
to help those ranchers was just through pet food. So we were able to test a lot of these

944
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:35,600
theories create, it wasn't a lot, but like a super tiny margin for me and Mike to operate and

945
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:41,200
get to understand what that looked like. And then it was only after six to eight months of keeping

946
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:46,960
data every single night on, like I was huge on this, like keeping data every single night on

947
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:55,280
proficiency rates and miles and occurrences. Like it wasn't until I could justify the requirements

948
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,680
for the USDA that I called the USDA back and said, I want you guys to come view our process.

949
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:06,160
And if it's approved, I will get the USDA slaughter facility. They came out, they were

950
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:11,280
blown away by our process. So a combination of flurry equipment to view the animal. And again,

951
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,520
this is happening all at night. Yeah. Let's, let's, let's actually explain to people what this is. And,

952
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
you know, at the outset of this podcast in the introduction, I explained that we're going to

953
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,080
get a little bit graphic here. And I think, you know, this would be one of those moments in time

954
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,720
where if you're, you know, if this, if this is a subject matter, that's very sensitive, please

955
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:34,880
hit a little bit of forward on the podcast. But unfortunately, you know, I think if you,

956
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:39,280
if you choose to eat meat, which most of us do, I think you need to be familiar with what that

957
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:46,320
entails. And I always feel that it's, it's, it's wrong to consume meat without having some sense

958
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:50,800
of what's involved. And if you go to a grocery store and you buy a piece of steak, you can't

959
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,760
just assume that piece of steak, you know, just showed up there without a lot of work. And, and

960
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:02,560
and I think when you contrast how that piece of steak showed up there or how that chicken breast

961
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,600
showed up there with the work that you guys are doing in the field, you get a real sense of what

962
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:14,560
the difference is and why a USDA inspector can show up and say, which I know he has said,

963
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:24,240
I've never seen anything like this ever in the history of the USDA. So, so what was your strategy?

964
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:29,200
So, so how is it that you can most humanely hunt an animal?

965
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:41,120
Okay. We have to follow a certain set of rules. So the inspection portion of what we do in the

966
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:47,360
field is called an, is called an anti-mortem inspection. And in that inspection process,

967
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:52,560
the inspector has to be able to view that, that, that, that animal is healthy. It has to be able

968
01:42:52,560 --> 01:43:01,840
to view that is, it's both like at rest and in motion. And typically that is done in a corral.

969
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,680
So if you think about what a typical bro, like brick and mortar looks like, there are a whole

970
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,880
bunch of cows that get trailored in from somewhere else. They're sitting in a corral system and the

971
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,280
inspector is able to go outside, look at these animals very closely, view them, determine that

972
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:20,960
they're, they're safe for human consumption. They're healthy. And then that animal, unfortunate, like

973
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,920
this is kind of the graphic part is that animal goes into a shoot system, goes into a press,

974
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:34,000
or sometimes it's hung up alive. And then that animal is rendered immediately unconscious with

975
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,680
a stun or a bolt gun. And that looks like in most cases, and I know people are trying to get better

976
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,040
at this, but that looks like in most cases, an animal that is stressed and unhealthy to be like,

977
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,600
it's in this press and it's moving around. And that animal and an employee has to then render

978
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:57,680
that animal immediately unconscious. We had to follow those rules. Our process for that same

979
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:04,720
anti-mortem inspection is we don't pen our animals. We don't bait our animals over a period of years.

980
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:10,560
We knew if we cover enough miles, we'll see enough deer and have enough opportunities to

981
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:17,680
harvest them. So translation, the animals you harvest are a hundred percent in their natural

982
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:24,800
environment. They're not in a high fence area, let alone a pen. They're not being baited. You're not

983
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:32,640
leaving food to lure them in. They're literally just out in the evening roaming about. Yes.

984
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:40,480
And I think this is probably one of the favorite parts about what we do is,

985
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:48,880
and it's similar to hunting, we're driving around looking for animals. And if we come over a hill

986
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:55,120
and that animal is, this group of animals is 50 yards away and we scare them, they hear the bike

987
01:44:55,120 --> 01:45:00,800
or they hear whatever else, they'll run away. That animal is not like that. Animal is already in a

988
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:06,560
stressed state and it runs away and we're not able to harvest it. But if we come over that same

989
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,760
hill two night later and an animal is out at 200 yards and they don't hear us or they're not

990
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:20,080
stressed and they stand there, that's the indicator for us that we're able to start the anti-mortem

991
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:25,920
process. And what that looks like is that same Fleur binocular unit that can pick up a deer at

992
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:33,440
six miles. We use that for inspection with extraordinary detail. Like we can see abscesses,

993
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,680
we can see old scarring, we can tell if they're pregnant. Like the level of detail is actually

994
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:44,240
better than an inspector standing looking at an animal in a corral to determine whether or not

995
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:50,160
it's healthy. So the inspector is staring at this screen, all of the lights are off and he says,

996
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:55,040
yep, all of these are healthy. You can guys can go ahead. So there's a pause there. Again,

997
01:45:55,040 --> 01:46:00,240
that animal isn't stressed, so it's not going anywhere. And then what we learned over years

998
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:06,160
and years is we then have to render that animal immediately unconscious, which is shoot it in the

999
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:16,000
head. But that animal is in a zero stress situation and dies immediately. Which is important to

1000
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:23,840
distinguish from archery. In archery, you think about like you've taken me on some amazing hunts

1001
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:28,880
where I've had what for archery would be considered a perfect shot where you go lung, heart, lung.

1002
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:36,160
But that animal doesn't die immediately. It takes 10 seconds to die. And if you're anything but

1003
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:42,320
perfect in archery, if you hit, say one lung, but not the other lung or not the heart and the lung,

1004
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,160
I mean, it could be much longer. But at least I've never had an experience in archery where an

1005
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:54,320
animal died in less than a millisecond. It's always a few seconds even with perfection.

1006
01:46:54,320 --> 01:47:00,640
And that's, I think, in part because of the nature of archery. The type of death that an animal

1007
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:09,920
suffers from an arrow is that of hemorrhagic shock. So they die from blood loss. Now there's

1008
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,400
exceptions to that rule. You can die from a tamponade, but it's still some form of hemorrhagic shock.

1009
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:21,280
But this is different from the wound that you inflict on the animal because when you're putting

1010
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:27,680
a high power ballistic, which is a bullet into the head, that's a central nervous system death.

1011
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:34,000
So that animal is dying immediately because the brain swells. And so that's a brain death versus

1012
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
a cardiopulmonary death. And that's why it's an immediate and instantaneous death. And by

1013
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:46,400
definition, there is simply no more humane way to die because as you point out, that animal has

1014
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:52,960
absolutely no knowledge that that is happening. And the moment it happens, they cease to have

1015
01:47:52,960 --> 01:48:02,320
awareness of anything. Yeah. And so not only are they not aware and great explanation,

1016
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:07,840
but the animals that are with them in a herd, like they die,

1017
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:14,080
like there isn't like they don't even jolt. They just, they literally just drop straight down.

1018
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:20,080
And in almost every case, the animals that are with them won't even move.

1019
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,320
That's the part when you first told me, Jake, I couldn't imagine because I assumed

1020
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:30,160
you came up on a herd of six animals. You would shoot one, it would die. The others would scatter.

1021
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:36,720
That was it for the night with that group. You would have to then drive for another 30

1022
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:42,480
minutes to find another group. But I was amazed to learn that no, you could probably shoot all of

1023
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:49,920
them because A, it's so dark, they don't see anything. And two, there's no movement by the

1024
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:55,360
animal other than just falling to the ground. And that must be a common enough sound to the other

1025
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:01,360
deer that it's not, it doesn't alert them or frighten them. Yeah. So every situation is a

1026
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:05,600
little bit different and it's highly dependent on moon phase and the amount of illumination and

1027
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:13,200
what they can see more importantly, they feel safer, most often not running. I mean, they don't

1028
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,480
have perfect night vision. It's pretty phenomenal, but they'll feel safer most often staying there.

1029
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:24,640
And so in most instances, you've never heard of 10 will, will typically harvest three or four of

1030
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:32,560
those animals. And so that inspector has viewed that the process, the, excuse me, the floor

1031
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:40,560
equipment is so good that the friction from the bullet passing through the air creates a tracer.

1032
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:47,680
So the inspector is actually able to see the bullet path and it like, and it hitting the head.

1033
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:55,600
And one thing to, to be clear on here is we're not, we're not perfect.

1034
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:03,680
We've, but we've trained to be imperfect. So we don't injure any animals. And so what that means

1035
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:12,720
is typically where the perfect target would be central to that brain cap system. We, we train

1036
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:21,360
ourselves to miss 30% of the time. A perfect evening of shooting is at 70% efficiency.

1037
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,200
But the miss is always high.

1038
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:30,880
The miss is always high and there's never any consequence of that. So that was what we,

1039
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:39,760
and that was hard for us to learn and develop the skillset that a perfect miss was still perfect.

1040
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:45,600
Cause it's an odd feeling to be like, Oh, I missed. And then there's so much pressure

1041
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,920
that surrounds shooting each evening. It, we had to train ourselves to understand that

1042
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:55,120
imperfection was actually the best way to go about harvesting this animal.

1043
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,960
The other thing that amazes me in that case, Oh, sorry, go ahead, Jake.

1044
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:07,680
No, no, I was going to say that's what allows us that imperfection is what allows us to meet

1045
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:12,880
the proficiency level of a brick and mortar for the rendering process.

1046
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,800
Well, that's actually what I was going to ask you is isn't, isn't your level of proficiency

1047
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:23,440
better than any brick and mortar? Because from a humane perspective, I think you said in the

1048
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:28,880
entire time you've done this operation, there has only been one bullet that hit the animal,

1049
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:34,400
but didn't hit it in the skull. And it was a shot to the neck, which still resulted in an immediate

1050
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,800
death. So for all intents and purposes, it was the exact same, but it was off the target.

1051
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:49,040
Is that correct? Still? Yeah. Um, yeah. We've only ever been written up again, like once for that

1052
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:55,840
infraction. And part of that is also, so we, we trained for those imperfections, but we also

1053
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,240
trained for the scenario. So I think me and you have talked about this like Mondays when we're

1054
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:08,400
making the conversion from being awake to like working nights, my expectation for the boys is to

1055
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:15,200
shoot at 50%. And what that does is it increases their margin of error for something like bad,

1056
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:22,720
not to happen. Cause we now know through poor sleep, it absolutely affects our nervous system

1057
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:27,680
and our reaction time. And we actually didn't, I didn't completely understand that until you

1058
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:37,200
did that podcast with Matthew Walker, which was so cool. Um, so a brick and mortar facility is asked

1059
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:47,360
to operate at a 95% efficiency. We are operating right now at a 99.99, well, functionally you're

1060
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:54,160
operating at a 100% efficiency. And to think that a 95% efficiency is all that's being asked. That

1061
01:52:54,160 --> 01:53:00,240
means one out of 20 animals is not dying in a humane way. Isn't that what that means? Yeah.

1062
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,320
Or requires like a, they may be unconscious, but they may require an immediate. And I think that's

1063
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,080
really different. I mean, that's going, I won't speak about anybody else's operation. I'm sure

1064
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:17,680
there are, I think I'm sure everybody would aim to be perfect in those scenarios, but anecdotally,

1065
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:23,520
I've actually had the opportunity to work in a brick and mortar. Um, an animal that comes into

1066
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:31,200
a pen stressed out and is moving around even at point blank range is significantly harder than

1067
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:38,720
an animal that is at rest and just like unaware and staring. And part of that's also is we have such a,

1068
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:45,040
the shooter has, has to have such an intimate understanding of access to your behavior. Like

1069
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,480
a right ear starts to dip and you know, like the head is going to go like a nose starts to go up

1070
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,960
and you know, it's going to start nosing. Like there is, there are half millisecond instances

1071
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:01,680
that you have to understand. This isn't something where I could bring in a military sniper and you

1072
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:08,400
can operate at this efficiency. I need a military sniper plus an access to your expert in order to

1073
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,840
take those shots. And that's why for so long that was Mike and me. And now you've met Kalena, like

1074
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:22,400
it's, it requires a very specific skill set. And what's the typical range? You're 100 to

1075
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:30,640
a hundred or 500. Yeah. A hundred to prop. Now it's, it's about 200 max. Oh, so what we're

1076
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:36,240
learning very close with the, you're using a three Oh eight three Oh eight. Yeah. And it's not

1077
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:41,760
because we're not effective past that range. We're only given a three hour window to harvest at night.

1078
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:49,120
What we've learned in collecting data is we carry almost every single one of these deer on our backs

1079
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:56,480
and it's an awesome way for the guys to connect with each animal as we're doing the process.

1080
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:00,480
But there's also, it's also very technical in that we don't want any bruising. We don't want to,

1081
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:04,960
we go to all of this effort. Like we don't want to like affect carcass quality after all of that

1082
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:13,360
work. And so you're carrying, I mean, like that last buck that you shot, you saw me do it that

1083
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:19,440
process. You're carrying a 200 pound animal on your back over extremely varying terrain.

1084
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,920
And the record should show that's why you had to carry my buck because I couldn't carry this 200

1085
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:30,640
pound buck for that first part of the train. There was, it just speaks to how pathetic I am.

1086
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:39,200
Yeah. No, no, no. But I mean, we've developed like the perfect way to pick up a deer. Like it took us

1087
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:47,520
hundreds, if not thousands of animals to figure that out. And so back to my point of range,

1088
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:57,120
at 200 yards for with a 200 pound animal, you're getting back to the bike or truck exhausted.

1089
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,040
And so what we learned was we could actually harvest more deer in a given night,

1090
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:09,040
skipping the animals that we're seeing out past 200 yards, assuming, and we knew this through data

1091
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:15,200
collected, we are going to see more animals at closer yardage. So we have like all of these

1092
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:20,080
parameters in place, these harvesting systems in place that allow us to be in a situation where

1093
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,120
in starting an evening, we really don't know where any animals are. Like we talked about,

1094
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:30,080
we're not baiting them and we have this very stringent process with the USDA. We've had to

1095
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:36,560
collect crazy amounts of data to be able to like do so efficiency on a likely basis. And even then,

1096
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:42,160
it'll vary. I mean, the USDA just continues to be amazed by your process because you're basically

1097
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:49,120
self imposing things that no one else really would think to do. Yeah. And I think that just

1098
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:52,640
continues to amaze me. I guess I want to shift gears for a moment and just now talk a little

1099
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:57,760
bit about bringing it back to sort of my interest in this type of meat, which was,

1100
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:03,760
you know, like I'm still relatively new to hunting, but as you know, I've taken a real

1101
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:09,120
keen interest in the harvesting part of it. I'm very fascinated by the anatomy and just

1102
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,880
the differences in the meat. And there's something that's very different about access deer.

1103
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,440
In some ways, it sort of spoils you with respect to other types of meat.

1104
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:30,800
It seems infinitely cleaner, healthier. The animal itself seems to be, you know,

1105
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:36,000
very clean. There seems to be something about its meat that's unique. Now, as I've gotten to learn

1106
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,400
over time, a big part of that has to do with the intramuscular fat content. You know, most people

1107
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:48,080
who have tried venison say, oh, you know, it's okay, but it's a little bit gamey, you know,

1108
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:51,360
certainly black tail more than white tail and, you know, probably.

1109
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:57,840
But access deer sort of exists in its own camp, which is not particularly gamey at all.

1110
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:06,000
And I suspect this, you know, it's basically 0.4% intramuscular fat. I mean, it's a very

1111
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:12,640
unique animal in that regard. How much have you been able to learn about their eating habits and

1112
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:20,480
how that contributes to what you're seeing in terms of the meat quality beyond what you just

1113
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:25,200
said. So everything you just said speaks to why they don't have these high levels of cortisol

1114
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:32,320
and lactate at harvest, which definitely contribute to the sort of some of the taste that you can

1115
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:37,040
have in wild animal. You've basically eliminated the lactate cortisol response completely.

1116
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:42,720
But now we're talking about something that's much more long term, you know, plays a much

1117
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:50,800
longer term role in the development of the muscle. Yeah. Yeah. And to your point there,

1118
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:58,160
that conversion of glycogen stores as that animal goes through rigamortis and what,

1119
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:02,720
and you can walk me through this, but what I assume is like that muscle trying to continue

1120
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:08,320
to do something. So pulling on ATP and that ATP, a function of that process being lactate

1121
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:16,240
that lactate is so important as that, as that animal, that rigamortis process gradually takes

1122
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:23,200
place over 16 to 24 hours. And the pH level of that meat, the pH level of that meat in,

1123
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:30,720
like it completely changes color and texture in animals that are stressed and don't have that

1124
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:37,280
gradual process to go through. So yeah, it's amazing there, but to, to the point of what they eat,

1125
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:45,040
man. Didn't you guys have a camera on, on a deer one? Yeah. So there's so many,

1126
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:53,120
I'm just trying to figure out where to start. So we, so we've done two, what are called satellite

1127
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:57,200
telemetry video callers. The company called the company was low tax. It was the first,

1128
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:03,680
some of the first like iridium satellite callers. And what that allowed us to do was a understand

1129
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:08,240
home range and, and like how often they're drinking and when, and what are their resting.

1130
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:14,880
But there was a tiny little camera that sat right under the bottom of the collar. And we got in 10

1131
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:22,080
second increments, 48 hours of footage of what they were eating. And what was astonishing,

1132
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:27,760
and we already knew this based on studies in India, they are primarily grass eaters,

1133
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:32,480
which is not the case for most deer species, which are primarily browsers.

1134
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,640
Browsers being they're looking for legumes and shrubs and trees that they're constantly pulling

1135
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:45,600
on different plant species. Access deer are primarily grass eaters. And I think when you talk

1136
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:50,480
about what like little intramuscular fat they do have, it's interesting to see, and we're only

1137
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:55,360
learning this now, like there's high omega threes in there because they're eating so much leafy

1138
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:02,320
greens. And I think that's attributed to them primarily being grass eaters. But what's,

1139
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:09,520
what's crazy, and we've seen this via the collar, and we've seen this like anecdotally is how,

1140
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,400
how intelligent, that's awesome. I never get to have these conversations. It's how intelligent

1141
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:23,360
of an eater they are. And I think that comes down to like these crazy acute senses. So for example,

1142
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:33,840
we've seen me and you together have seen after walking three miles down a hill with do all over

1143
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:39,440
our boots, we walk through an access to your trail, which for all intents and purposes, there should

1144
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:44,080
be no scent on our boot, our boots are soaked, and I'm wearing boots and you're wearing socks.

1145
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:53,280
Like, that's another story. And an animal not even interacting with that specific spot,

1146
02:01:53,280 --> 02:02:02,720
but five yards away, that deer is picking up the scent from that boot mark, which was three hours

1147
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:09,360
earlier. And we see this in like the both the satellites, they are so picky in what they're

1148
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:15,760
eating, not, and not even between different plant species, but within the same species.

1149
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,600
So they're going up to one of their favorite little legumes is called glycine. They're going

1150
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:26,240
up to a patch of glycine. And they have unlimited feed. So they're not eating like voraciously,

1151
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:31,120
like a cow or something. They're going up to a particular like group of glycine. And they're

1152
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:35,440
saying like, they're smelling, smelling, smelling saying, Oh, I'm going to eat this small patch

1153
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:43,120
right here. And I think what we don't understand is an animal that is that intelligent

1154
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:51,040
in what it eats, how that impacts its nutritional value. And we're starting to kind of see that with

1155
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:57,760
some of the results we're seeing. But I think that plays into how extraordinarily healthy they are.

1156
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:03,920
The vast majority of other animals look at like a, you've seen a pig now in a field,

1157
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:10,880
or it seems like some go a pig plowing through a field. It's not stopping to plow in particular

1158
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,120
areas. It's getting started. And it's just going to bulldoze its way through the entire thing.

1159
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:21,520
Yeah, I think this, this is, this was a really transformational thing for me. So I think I've

1160
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:27,680
talked about this on the podcast with, with John Dudley once, but I took up archery because I

1161
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,760
wanted to do archery. That was all I wanted to do. Like, I just wanted to shoot a bow.

1162
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:37,440
And it struck me as the type of thing that, you know, you could spend a lifetime never coming

1163
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:43,760
close to perfection. And it was, you know, just it scratched every itch for my obsession.

1164
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:50,160
It was only two years after I took up archery. And all I was doing was plowing target after

1165
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:55,040
target after target after target that I, you know, got invited on a hunting trip, which I'd been

1166
02:03:55,040 --> 02:04:00,160
invited many times prior to and was like, why would I go waste four days to go and take two shots

1167
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:06,080
when I can take 150 shots a day in my backyard? Didn't seem like a good idea. But I got talked

1168
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:10,480
into it and JR, as you know, close friend of mine was like, no, no, this would be good for you. So

1169
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:14,880
let's do it. So we go and we do this thing. And as you know, it just sort of changed everything

1170
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:21,920
for me in many ways. But among them is it really changed how I thought about food, because I got

1171
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,080
to see on that one first hunting trip, you know, I'm shooting pigs, goats, sheep,

1172
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:35,360
axis deer. I mean, I got to see everything from the lowest to the highest and eat it all

1173
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:42,320
and realize it's hard to be healthier than the animal you're eating. And it's hard for the animal

1174
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:47,040
to be healthier than what it's eating. Like, you know, this is not an accidental process.

1175
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,960
And it's never been the same since. And I was talking to my wife the other day.

1176
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:59,440
My appetite for store bought meat has never been the same since that trip.

1177
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:06,720
And I think that's true for a lot of people that experience really good wild game, be it axis deer

1178
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:11,760
or elk, which would be for me personally, my two favorite, I think axis deer and elk live in a

1179
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:19,600
different category from every other type of wild game. But like even chickens, right? Like we had

1180
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:26,000
chickens back in San Diego. They couldn't have lived a better existence. I mean, you know, the

1181
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,600
the amount of space that they had, the amount of care we took of them, they're eating some organic,

1182
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:37,760
ridiculously expensive, overpriced feed plus our leftover fruits and vegetables like they're living

1183
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:42,400
large. They're making us these beautiful eggs. I had zero desire to eat one of them

1184
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:46,320
because they lived in filth. I mean, all they did was eat their poop all day, right? It just didn't

1185
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:53,040
appeal to me. Even going to the store and having a steak, it's like, yeah, it's not that I don't eat

1186
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:59,920
those things anymore. But like the idea of my appetite for the 32 ounce ribeye has pivoted a

1187
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:05,840
little more towards the eight ounce filet. Whereas if I can eat elk and if I can eat axis deer that

1188
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:12,880
to me is far better. And I think part of it is the taste acquires once you kind of start to

1189
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:18,800
understand what's going into it. But I also think a part of it is just you can't disconnect from

1190
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:24,720
what the process was like to produce that food that winds up on your table. And I just realized,

1191
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:33,840
even if I'm buying the most organic, grass fed, beautiful steak, it didn't have the same stress

1192
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,080
free existence that that axis deer had or that elk had. But again, with elk, it's a different

1193
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:42,560
situation. You have to go out and hunt it yourself. You don't have the luxury of, you know, doing the

1194
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:48,240
USDA certification. So I mean, did you experience that or was that, is that so far in your rear view

1195
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:57,520
mirror that what I'm saying doesn't make sense? No, definitely. And anecdotally, I think it was my

1196
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:06,160
third year of college. And I think I mentioned this before. When I stopped pouring in Hawaii,

1197
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:11,600
axis deer for most folks is just teriyaki. So like, you pour a whole bunch of sugar and you

1198
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:16,960
pour a whole bunch of shoyu. When I stopped doing that and I started eating it like just straight

1199
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:23,520
steaks every night. And it admittedly it was because I had ran out of money. You couldn't

1200
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:32,720
afford the teriyaki sauce. No, I couldn't afford the cafeteria anymore. So I became a dorm advisor

1201
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:39,120
to try and like, anyway, I ran out of money and at 60 bucks a pot for the plane flight and being

1202
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:46,400
able to bring back a hundred pounds of meat. It was like a no brainer. And so by no means was it

1203
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:51,920
on purpose. But when I started eating it the right way, I started noticing it. And I think at the age

1204
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:58,560
of what would have been like 20, I started getting stronger and I was really challenging my body as a

1205
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:03,360
function of like my vertical. And like I realized as a small player, like I needed to start taking

1206
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:08,480
some of that seriously if I was going to like take the next step. By the way, what is the vertical

1207
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:15,600
of a six foot tall national level volleyball player? At its peak, it was 43 inches. I was going to say,

1208
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:24,080
is it possible it was over 40 inches? Holy cow. Yeah. My vertical is 12 inches. Yeah, it's not the

1209
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:29,920
case by any means anymore. But I can, I think fondly look back at pictures when I was playing

1210
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:35,200
in the Netherlands, Netherlands already being the tallest people on the planet. I had two players

1211
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:41,600
beside me that were six, 11 and seven feet and have these really cool pictures of blocking. So

1212
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:46,080
you're jumping up and putting your hands over the net and our hands are at the same height

1213
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:52,560
and our heads kind of match. And then our bodies start changing proportion and my feet are at like

1214
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:58,320
their mid thigh and hip level. And it's just like these comical. Anyway, the,

1215
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,480
I started to notice like I was recovering better. And at that point, it had almost happened

1216
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:10,160
simultaneously. I think I've told you about this. We, we had the opportunity to train with

1217
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:16,720
the Olympic sprinting team. And I don't recommend this for anybody, but they did this workout called

1218
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:22,800
gravity drops. And so they were incorporating gravity into all of their workouts where

1219
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:29,840
we would be squatting and you would fall to 90 degrees and you'd try and stand up as quickly as

1220
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:37,120
possible. And never in my life have I felt like every day I was sore. And at that point, it was

1221
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:42,720
hard to make like these physical gains and every day I was sore. And then I like, I remember making

1222
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:49,040
this transition to like, I just needed more food. Like I could feel it and I started eating the right

1223
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:57,600
way. And then I started noticing like I got so strong and I went from 190 pounds to 220 and it

1224
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:04,000
was all muscle and it was a function of this workout. And I think the use of this ingredient.

1225
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:10,240
Well, that's interesting because very recently, like me in the last four or five months,

1226
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:17,920
you sent me the nutritional information from the company that has been looking at the bone broth

1227
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:23,440
because, you know, one of the things that you've done with this company that I think is so amazing

1228
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:29,280
is you've taken this notion of nose to tail to a whole new level, right? So it's like, okay,

1229
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:34,880
there's a 200 pound axis deer that yields what? How many pounds of meat for the human?

1230
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,040
Yeah. I mean, the bucks are on the big side of typical axis deer is about 60 pounds whole

1231
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:48,560
carcass and will yield about 50 pounds for a typical human, but there's also hides and hooves

1232
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:53,520
and awful and all kinds of things. Yeah. So you've got the pet food, you've got the dog chews.

1233
02:10:54,240 --> 02:11:01,360
And then I remember saying like, where's the bone broth? And then all of a sudden, you know,

1234
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:05,200
you start making this bone broth and what did they say? How did they evaluate that bone broth?

1235
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:13,520
Which by the way, I can't stop drinking it. Yeah. I've never been a bone broth. Yeah. Yeah.

1236
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:22,720
It's amazing. So we have to send all things into the USDA labs for testing and they evaluate that

1237
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:28,400
and then they'll put that on your nutritional panel. And we sent in the first batch of bones

1238
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:36,800
and they called us and they didn't call it outright. They had thought we adulterated the bones.

1239
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:42,880
They had thought we had done something because they tested so high in protein per ounce.

1240
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:49,200
And it was statistically like an anomaly. And so we didn't know what was going on. So we sent them,

1241
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:57,200
I think we sent them a second batch or they retested it. And in the end, it tested 33% higher

1242
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:05,840
in protein per ounce than the best regenerative beef bones on the market. And I say regenerative

1243
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:12,880
because there is something to a regenerative agricultural process with cattle where there's

1244
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:17,040
additional soil health. And I believe that soil health translates into your food,

1245
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:23,440
but that animal is still given the grass it's going to eat. It doesn't have a choice.

1246
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:33,680
So we got the results back and we didn't have an explanation for it. And I mean,

1247
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:38,960
that's a statistical anomaly. I think between what we'd call conventional beef and regenerative beef

1248
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:49,600
is about 3%. Usually they'll see a difference, but 33% is. And so essentially at like 25 grams of

1249
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:55,600
protein per, I think it's a hundred ounces or something. No, I think it's less. No, no, no.

1250
02:12:55,600 --> 02:13:01,760
I think it's less volume. Yeah, yeah, much less volume. Yeah, it would be 16 ounces or something.

1251
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:09,920
16 ounces. Yeah, yeah. You're in like, you're in protein powder care category as a function of

1252
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:17,200
protein per calorie. So we're, I think we're just, and I'm not a nutritionist, like I'm not a

1253
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:24,000
biologist. I only know what I've seen over like thousands and thousands of hours of like interacting

1254
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:29,840
with this animal. Coming back to the previous conversation is I think their level of intelligence

1255
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:35,040
in what they eat is translating to their nutritional value. And we're just starting

1256
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:41,520
to see that like me and you were emailing back the other day, like I don't even know where to start

1257
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:48,160
to better understand their fatty acid levels and how I know there's important ratios of like omega

1258
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:54,720
sixes to omega threes. I don't know enough about it, but I already seeing indicators that we might

1259
02:13:54,800 --> 02:14:01,600
have something special there as well. And why when we're eating it, I don't feel like I need to

1260
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:06,160
go get like a slab of salmon, even though like I'll have one every once in a while. Like I feel

1261
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:12,000
like I'm getting a complete nutritional profile from that animal and we're eating it. And my wife,

1262
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:19,040
my wife laughs. She calls us wegans now. So if it's not wild and it's not vegetables, we're not

1263
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:28,960
eating it. That's actually funny because I'll tell you one of the great joys I have is introducing

1264
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,760
people to this and people fit into different categories, right? So you've got just your

1265
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:37,360
friends who are over for dinner and they'll eat anything and whatever. And then that's great.

1266
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:43,120
And in that category, it's usually, hey, we're having venison and they're like, oh, I don't know.

1267
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:46,880
I don't love that. It's a little gamey. And I'm like, that's cool. Just tell me what you think.

1268
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:50,160
And then they're always like, no, that's totally different than anything I've ever had.

1269
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:57,040
But truthfully, one of the more enjoyable experiences that I had was during our quarantine

1270
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:01,920
when our nanny was staying with us. This is at the early part of the quarantine when for

1271
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:10,800
two months we all just sort of hunkered down and our nanny is a vegan. And so luckily we've got an

1272
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:17,200
infinite supply of vegetables and non-animal matter and stuff like that. But we would sort of,

1273
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:21,760
she'd have her dinner, we'd have ours. And we were at the time, I had 500 pounds of access

1274
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:27,520
here in our freezer. So we were basically eating this every single day. Because we had just come

1275
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:36,800
back from that huge trip in December. But eventually she was like, she wanted to try it

1276
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,560
because we would talk about it over dinner. We would have this type of a discussion.

1277
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:47,280
And I think for totally understandable reasons, her opposition to eating meat was, look,

1278
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:52,400
she had some health concerns, but she also had great concerns over how the animals are treated.

1279
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:56,160
And so night after night, she's sort of asking questions about this and asking questions about

1280
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:03,280
this. And then she's like, look, can I try some of course? And needless to say, she loved it. She had

1281
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:09,120
these two awesome dogs that stayed with us. And it was like, hands down, it was cracked to the dogs.

1282
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:14,240
So I became the dog's best friends because I'm giving them venison treats every night.

1283
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:21,040
But to me, that was like, it was very special experience. It was like, look, everybody's,

1284
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,200
I respect whatever choice a person makes with respect to what they want to eat and don't want

1285
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:30,480
to eat and what the reasons are. But it's also important to understand not all meat is created

1286
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,520
equal. And I think this is just sort of an example of that.

1287
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:44,320
I think we share that experience in, I had seen that in the past, personally, and people,

1288
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:52,000
and it did, it really took them listening and understanding. And I think they recognized

1289
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:58,560
like the crazy lengths we go to, to make the process technically humane. But

1290
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:08,400
we love these animals. The relationship with them started in this place where there was nothing but

1291
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:14,880
respect for them. We didn't understand the negative portions of that relationship to our ecosystems and

1292
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:21,440
ecology. And that's still very much the case for me. It's a continual drive to like, how do we better

1293
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:27,360
manage this animal for us and net positive? But now with Maui Nui, we're seeing these

1294
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:32,400
testimonials coming in. And most of most times it's like them writing to us individually, like

1295
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:38,960
via the website, or I get a phone call. And they're just like, it's been 20 years. And I decided to

1296
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:45,520
have meat after watching your video, or after hearing you like talk here. And I mean, that's not

1297
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:52,240
to my credit, like I've had amazing people help us along the way. But I think, I think, and they'll

1298
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:58,400
mention like, Oh, I watched cow spirits, something along the way told them it was no longer okay to

1299
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:04,960
eat meat. And it's been such an amazing experience for them to see our process. And I think the

1300
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:11,520
intent in what we're trying to do, and be like, wait, this is like, this is an opportunity to eat

1301
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:15,920
meat again. And I completely respect like, everybody's body is different. And you know

1302
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:23,440
this better than anybody. And maybe like, being a vegan works in most instances. But I think for the

1303
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:28,880
vast majority of people, it's important they get this protein, right? And again, you would know

1304
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:35,760
better than me, but it's been, yeah, it's been such a, it's been such an awesome experience that like,

1305
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:41,360
have somebody come to you with that level of trust and be like, I'm going to introduce this

1306
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:48,640
into my life again after 20 years. And you'd be like, wow, like, thank you so much. Like, we're

1307
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:54,720
so glad we can like do that for you and help bring that into your home. And that's the big part of

1308
02:18:54,720 --> 02:19:00,240
this is our mission is to balance populations. Our mission isn't to get rid of these animals. Like,

1309
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:06,480
we find them is an incredible resource for our communities when balanced. And the only way we do

1310
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:12,080
that is people need to eat them. So what does balance look like, Jake? You know, Lani is in

1311
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:18,960
balance at about 20,000 animals. You know, Molokai, he said it's about 60,000. It's out of balance

1312
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:24,880
right now. It seems that's, that seems to be past capacity because my recollection from talking

1313
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:31,600
with you and Mikey and others is there's basically access deer dying on the side of the roads in

1314
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:37,760
Molokai. So it's, it's past that capacity. And then Maui, I think you said was one,

1315
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:41,360
there was 60 on the way to 210. Was that right?

1316
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,200
Yeah. So yeah.

1317
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:44,800
What does sustainability look like?

1318
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:58,400
So it's a super nuanced subject because we don't, we don't have the capacity to manage deer on all

1319
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:04,080
lands. So like we talked about, we're not, we're, it's, it's illegal for us to operate on public

1320
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:11,120
land. And honestly, I support that. We don't ever want to affect resource availability for a

1321
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:19,120
subsistence hunter. And anecdotally, we see on public lands on Maui, it's pretty hard to find a

1322
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:26,000
deer. Like, I think there are, like, I think there's a scenario where subsistence hunters play a huge

1323
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:34,080
role in what balance look like. And, but we also don't dictate balance on a private landowners

1324
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:40,640
property either. They own that animal. What we're able to do is say, here's how many animals you

1325
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:47,280
have. You look, we understand how they, what they're doing as a liability, as a function of dry

1326
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:54,080
feed or watersheds or fencing or like our roadways. Oh, what a mess. We say, this is how many animals

1327
02:20:54,080 --> 02:21:00,720
you have. How many do you want? And then they say to us, well, let's, let's try and bring this from

1328
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:07,120
6,000 to 2,000 and see what it looks like. And because we're able to manage them with such

1329
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:14,240
precision via these aerial surveys, we're able to toggle that balance based on, like we're going

1330
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:18,560
through a pronounced drought right now. We're bringing down numbers in the areas we're working

1331
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:27,120
in. But one of my favorite things we talk about, like, you know, apart from like these, this vegan

1332
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:34,800
conversation, one of my absolute favorite things is we walk into a meeting with a rancher that is

1333
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:39,840
calling an animal spotted rat and it only presents liability to them, right? Like, of course,

1334
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,880
their cowboys enjoy harvesting. Like there's, there's of course value in, in them as a, as

1335
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:53,520
something being able to hunt. By the time we leave that room, that animal has value because our

1336
02:21:53,520 --> 02:22:00,560
harvesting process, we pay, it's not a lot, but we pay them a small amount per pound for that animal

1337
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:04,560
so that they find, so that they find value in that animal. And we didn't have to do that.

1338
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:10,800
In other words, it's more valuable for them to let you harvest it humanely than for them to just,

1339
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:14,560
you know, shoot it and leave it, you know, leave it sitting there.

1340
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:24,400
Exactly. So at balance, so in, in varying this balance each year with rainfall and ingress and

1341
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:29,520
all of the different things that happen at balance, the rancher is happy because more importantly,

1342
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:35,680
he has optimal soil health and no runoff and he's not losing feed, but he's also making like,

1343
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:43,840
he's, he's seeing a small amount of additional value from this animal. And that combination,

1344
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:50,400
when we talk about like what balance looks like on a large scale, we have several ranchers that are

1345
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:56,000
saying like, come help us. We just, we're not there yet. We need to grow. So A, we need to like,

1346
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:01,280
grow our harvesting capacity. And we have the system to do that now, but B, we need more people

1347
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:07,280
to eat these animals with us and bring them into their homes. And in, in that scenario, we'll be

1348
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,680
able to achieve balance by both growing and then working with all these private landowners. And

1349
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:16,320
each one, that's the best part. Each one's going to make their own choice. That's not up to me to

1350
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:23,360
decide what balance looks like for that family or individual or board or whatever it is. That's up

1351
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:29,760
to the private landowner. What we do know is if we're able to grow large enough and we are able to

1352
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:37,920
operate on most of the private lands, between all of them, we can find a population level that is

1353
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:43,920
also best suited for our community. Because I mean, Molokai is a great example. I mean, Maui is well

1354
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:51,200
right now too, but the lights, like sun goes down. Everybody on that place is doing 10 miles an hour.

1355
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:57,120
There are so many deer on the road. Like the, the, the risks to like hitting a deer is like at those

1356
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:04,560
densities we discussed is profound. And you know, on Maui, you can do 55, 65 miles an hour. So as a

1357
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:10,960
function of like our watershed health and sediment, like the net present value of this species that

1358
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:17,280
balance makes sense. It doesn't make sense to eradicate them. We talked about food security.

1359
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,320
I understand this is like a hard conversation too, because we're also the endangered species

1360
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:26,960
capital of the world. So there's, there's a very real conversation. If I was a conservationist,

1361
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:32,880
I would say, get rid of all of these invasive species and let's work to bring back or rehabilitate

1362
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:36,880
the endangered species in these same spaces. Is it even technically feasible, Jake? If,

1363
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:42,560
if the Hawaiian government decided tomorrow, we don't want to single access deer here by 2030,

1364
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:48,160
could that be done technically? No way. They're, they're, they're just,

1365
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:52,160
they're too smart. I mean, we were able to accomplish that because they were in such low numbers.

1366
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:59,520
On the big Island, there's no, I don't believe there's a way to do that. So there's no choice,

1367
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:06,800
but to find balance and balance looks like I support the idea that there shouldn't be deer

1368
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:13,280
in our watersheds. There's nothing more value as an isolated landmass and a community trying to be

1369
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:22,080
self-suspicious, especially through COVID. Like there, we've donated 50,000 pounds of venison,

1370
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:28,880
like over a hundred thousand meals through COVID because food banks were empty. Like,

1371
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:35,040
like Hawaii's economy teeters on absolute disaster because we're so dependent on tourism.

1372
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:42,000
And when COVID hit and we shut the door, like the vast majority of our community was in trouble.

1373
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:47,680
So there, there's, there's this nuance between, yes, like there's ecosystems and ecology we have

1374
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:51,920
to respect and every native species has a right to exist in its own place, but there's also

1375
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:59,680
economics and food security. So it's, it's finding a balance for where these animals should be in the

1376
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:03,840
long run. And that's where we produce food. It's not in our mountain where we depend on water.

1377
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:10,720
That's just my opinion. But yeah, so the conversation of balance isn't just like,

1378
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:14,960
what's the deer density in this particular place? The conversation of balance is like,

1379
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:19,280
how do you interact with all of these things across your communities and ecosystems and all

1380
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:24,000
of these other things? And I think that story about, you know, the, the amount of food that

1381
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:32,400
was donated during COVID is kind of another example of this. I think it's part of why Maui Nui has

1382
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:38,640
been in such high favor with, with local people, because, you know, that's a big step back for a

1383
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:45,760
business that's trying to grow to basically give away, you know, an enormous chunk of its product.

1384
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:51,520
You know, it's one thing if you're Nike and you're, you know, 50 years into your existence and you're

1385
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:56,800
going to give away 5% of your shoes for free or something, this is totally different. But at the

1386
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:03,040
same time, it was sort of a no brainer. Yeah, because it, you know, it basically just meant,

1387
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:07,600
look, we're going to delay the growth of the business by a year and a half, but we're doing

1388
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:12,560
the same thing. And it's, it still serves the same mission, which is you're feeding people

1389
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:18,880
and you're managing a population. Yeah. And you're right. Like there wasn't even like a choice.

1390
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:25,840
And to everybody's credit on the team, because, because people have to, like, we need to grow

1391
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:32,000
at a profitable, healthy margin so we can scale and achieve that mission of balance. But

1392
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:40,160
it was like an overnight, like it was like an instant decision because a hunter can't,

1393
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:46,080
in Hawaii, a hunter can't go harvest an animal and take it into the food bank for a donation.

1394
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:51,520
It's like the, the food safety requirements are far too stringent. And so probably one of the

1395
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:58,400
things we were most proud of is we had created this system and tool that in a time of need

1396
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:03,040
as a function of food security, we could call on it instantly. Yeah. That's the point. Because if

1397
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,960
you didn't have that USDA certification already set up, you wouldn't have been able to have,

1398
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:09,920
you could have all the deer in the world. You couldn't do anything with them.

1399
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:17,520
Yeah. And that's not to say subsistence hunters didn't rally to harvest more animals themselves

1400
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:24,880
and get them into the community, but doing so in a, at a, at a recreational or subsistence level

1401
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:33,360
versus a commercial level is like 50,000 pounds of food in eight months is like, that's a lot of,

1402
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:38,160
that's a lot of meat. And that's not possible in, without like systems for food safety and

1403
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:45,760
slaughtering and all the other things that go into it. So as we look to our communities 20 years

1404
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:51,920
from now and either weather instability or governmental, all of the different things that

1405
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:59,200
are happening in our world economy, especially like the conversation of domestic production,

1406
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:07,840
like having it at home in Hawaii and a resource we can always call on, it's important.

1407
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:13,600
And when we look at the total value of access deer for our communities, that's important.

1408
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:21,040
And that all interacts with this idea of balance. Like, and again, there's no perfect answer one way

1409
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:28,080
or the other, but man, were we happy, like rolling two full pallets of venison into the food bank with

1410
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:34,400
an empty freezer. We were just like the boys, you've met the boys. Like you imagine the smile on like

1411
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:40,320
big Eddie's face, who's been like a community member for, you know, 40 years and him being

1412
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:45,600
able to like have this impact at like a time of need. It's awesome. Like you feel amazing.

1413
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:54,320
Jake, this has been, it's been amazing for me to sort of be a minuscule part of this journey

1414
02:29:54,320 --> 02:30:00,720
alongside for, you know, a couple of years and getting to know you and, you know, having you

1415
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:06,080
share this story has been great because I've never heard it in one piece and there are even

1416
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:11,520
pieces of this that I hadn't heard before. So I know folks are going to, you know, have their

1417
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:17,040
curiosity peaked by this and maybe some belief systems challenged, but that's, if you're not

1418
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:25,600
doing that, then what are you doing? Yeah, absolutely. And I think you underestimate

1419
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:32,000
the impact you've had. You know, it took us seven years to figure out a harvesting system, but

1420
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:38,880
being able to take that next step in understanding how you move this into somebody's home and what

1421
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:43,280
e-commerce looks like and all of these other things, like the resource you've helped us

1422
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:50,560
find. We would not be here without your help and the rest of the group. And we can't thank you

1423
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:57,040
enough for that. And we're, I mean, we're just excited to see what the next couple of years look

1424
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:02,800
like and how we can move that mission forward and what continued good we can do within our

1425
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:06,240
communities. And yeah, we can't thank you enough, but I really appreciate it.

1426
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:12,080
Well, I need more bone broth because like my wife has pretty much consumed all the bone broth you

1427
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:15,520
said. She doesn't even let me have it anymore. It's sort of like her little secret drink.

1428
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:21,760
So yeah, well, we can, we can make that happen for sure. Thanks brother.

1429
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,240
