00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,280
Welcome to this week's episode of The Drive.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,880
My guest this week is one of my dearest friends, Dr. Paul Conti.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,360
Paul is a brilliant psychiatrist.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
In fact, I often refer to him as the single best psychiatrist I've ever come in contact

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,480
with and I've met some many very sharp people over the years.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,840
I've long wanted to have Paul on the podcast.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,640
I've always wanted to interview Paul just in general because there's not that many people

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,400
who I find myself having discussions with and I think to myself, how can this discussion

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,880
be shared with others?

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,200
And throughout this interview, you'll hear us even comment to that effect, which is God,

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,940
it's almost like we're not even talking in front of microphones.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,220
This is exactly the kind of conversation we find ourselves having so often.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,700
Paul's a very special person.

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,140
He doesn't get into great detail, but his life has been shaped by a number of really,

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,820
really tragic events, a couple of which he alludes to here, many of which he does not.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,460
In fact, some of the most tragic events in Paul's life he does not allude to, but I think

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,460
the point that comes across here is that Paul is one of the most empathetic, kind, giving

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,580
individuals and his understanding of the human condition is really unparalleled.

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,060
In keeping with one of the general themes here, which is longevity of which health span

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,140
and happiness are important components, we go really deep on this topic.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,860
We talk about what is meant by trauma.

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,780
Many people just think of trauma as, you know, you got hit by a car or something like that,

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,980
but we get really into emotional trauma.

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,740
We talk a lot about shame, which is the result of trauma and what it ends up doing.

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,260
We talk a lot about depression, suicide, and a number of other topics that are closely

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,500
related to this.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,540
I do think at times this is a little bit heavy, but we really don't get into any of the technical

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,020
stuff that I thought we might get into in large part just because I think there was

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,300
so much to talk about without getting into the neurobiology.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,560
I do think that Paul and I will need to sit down again in the future and get a lot deeper

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,740
on some of those other topics that I also thought would be interesting, and I suspect

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,700
a number of you will find very interesting.

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,860
So again, this is not a deep podcast from a technical standpoint, though we do get into

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,420
some of the heavier stuff.

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,700
Unfortunately, Paul is not someone you're really going to find much about on social

47
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
media.

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,380
Paul is someone whom can be contacted through his office, of course, and will provide that

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,260
contact information for folks who do want to reach out to his office.

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,460
But the good news is Paul is really considering writing a book.

51
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,700
And after we finished recording this podcast, we spent another 20 minutes talking about

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,860
the book he wants to write.

53
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,660
And the gist of it is the book is exactly about the stuff we talked about today.

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,280
So I couldn't be more encouraging of Paul doing this, and I think that the world will

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,000
be a better place for that.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,620
So I hope you enjoy this episode half as much as I enjoyed listening to Paul talk about all

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,900
of these things.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,500
And I think almost anybody will find something of great value in this episode.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,740
Hey Paul, how are you, man?

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
I'm doing well, Peter.

61
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,940
Thank you for having me.

62
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,420
You're a super trooper here.

63
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,620
You have laryngitis.

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,140
I do indeed have laryngitis.

65
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,540
I am persevering, and I appreciate your patience in persevering with me.

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,460
Well, luckily, I guess luckily is the wrong word, but most people here don't know what

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,140
you sound like normally, so they probably won't even know that you're that.

68
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,700
I'm only bringing it up because I know you're straining a lot to speak, but this is such

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
an important topic.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,660
We didn't really want to put it off, but you know, the two of us were so busy, even though

71
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,060
we're in New York often, that we could both have a night when we don't have something

72
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,540
else to do, I think makes this worth it.

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,540
So thank you.

74
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
It's my pleasure.

75
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,300
And even though I sound like the godfather, I'm still going to do my best to come across

76
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,860
as open and honest in a way that's not quite consistent with the godfather.

77
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,380
Although you did pull one old school Italian trick a moment ago, which was as you came in

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,020
my apartment, you beeline for the kitchen.

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,300
What did you do with the aspirin?

80
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,740
I gargled with hot water and aspirin, just like my grandmother told me to do.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
She gets credit.

82
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,700
If people can understand me, credit goes to my grandmother.

83
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
All right.

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,060
So there you have it, your first old Italian old school trick on what to do with laryngitis

85
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,700
to take some boiling water, smash some baby aspirin into it and gargle it.

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,580
They didn't teach us that in medical school, but I'm still doing it.

87
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,580
All right.

88
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,260
So speaking of medical school, you and I have now known each other for 21 years.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Amazing.

90
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,500
Yeah, almost exactly 21 years.

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,540
And I think the relationship that you, me and the other five coconuts had in our med

92
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,700
school class, the seven of us probably in some ways really annoyed most of our med school

93
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,740
classmates because we were, we became close like within the first week of school and never

94
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
separated.

95
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,260
We were an inseparable group of knuckleheads.

96
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,540
I strongly agree that that annoyed people.

97
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Yes.

98
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Yeah.

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Yeah.

100
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,060
But we're fortunate and I feel blessed to have met all of you guys and in particular,

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,020
probably all of the seven of us now, I think you and I by far spend the most time together

102
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,620
because so much of our work clinically overlaps.

103
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,940
I don't want to go deep so soon, but I think I feel like I have to.

104
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,900
So I'll never forget the first day we met all med students on day one are sort of nervously

105
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,780
talking about why they're here and blah, blah, blah.

106
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,660
Truthfully, most med students don't really know what they want to be when they grow up.

107
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,980
They have sort of figured out they want to be doctors and that's about it.

108
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,500
But there were some of us that knew I wasn't really one of them.

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,740
I kind of knew I wanted to do something in oncology.

110
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,660
I thought at the time pediatric oncology.

111
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,020
One of our buddies decided on day one, he was a plastic surgeon and that is exactly

112
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,940
what he is today.

113
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,940
You said the most interesting thing I'd ever heard, which was that you wanted to be a psychiatrist.

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,460
And I just remember thinking, I didn't know people went to med school to become psychiatrists.

115
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,940
I thought that was sort of a lifestyle choice that they made later on or something like

116
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
that.

117
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,860
But you were adamant about it.

118
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Why was that the case?

119
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,300
I think it represented a search for truth.

120
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,380
I think it represented a search for truth and probably a response to some of the difficult

121
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:54,180
things in my life and to a lot of the dissatisfaction that I was feeling with achievement, with

122
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,100
my personal life, my professional life from top to bottom.

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,260
There was a sense of wanting to understand things more.

124
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,840
And I think it's interesting, you talk about how quickly this group of us became really

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,100
fast friends.

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,980
And I think there was a commonality there that we'd all had some life experience and

127
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,320
in different ways as we came to learn, we'd all really been through a lot.

128
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,220
And I think we were coming into medical school, searching for something and trying to find

129
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,220
something for ourselves through doing things that are good for other people.

130
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,260
And I understand that the idea is that's why people go to medical school.

131
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,220
And I'm not saying other people weren't doing that, right?

132
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,640
But we'd all been through a fair amount.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,540
And I think it's the suffering component that drove the ability to maybe be open and honest

134
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,580
earlier with one another and to form bonds that were based upon the searching that we

135
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,260
were all doing that drove all of us to change career, to do something different than what

136
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,560
we might've thought we were doing as a response to an internal need.

137
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,580
And I think ultimately as a response to trauma.

138
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
It's interesting you bring that up.

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,140
I mean, I always knew this, but I guess I sort of forgot until you re-primed it.

140
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,740
None of us were pre-meds and all of us were a little older.

141
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,020
We were all a couple of years older because we'd all, in some cases, like in Bobby's

142
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,500
case, I mean, Christ, he'd been a mountaineering instructor for a decade or something like

143
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
that.

144
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,300
Zolly had been in the army for four years, same with Jason, all these guys.

145
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,980
Sorry to be calling all our boys out here on the show.

146
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,180
But yeah, none of us had just come through.

147
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Right.

148
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Right.

149
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,980
And certainly people can go through a lot by the time they're out of infancy, right?

150
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,820
So it's not as if people need to be out of school, do different things in order to really

151
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
gain life experience.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,820
But I think the choices that each of us made were choices that came from a place of drive

153
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,860
and ambition, but ultimately that were colored by very personal things.

154
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,860
And I think led each of us to really want something more.

155
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,620
And I think we came to medical school in part to find that.

156
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,180
And I don't think that there's a distinction between what are the things that we do for

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,820
other people and the things that we do for ourselves.

158
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,580
I think that that's a false dichotomy that follows through sort of Western logic, that

159
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,740
things have to be one thing or another.

160
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,620
And I think often the best things that we do for others we do in a search for some healing

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,860
or soothing in ourselves.

162
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,300
And I think that that was part and parcel of all of us, was part and parcel of many

163
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,900
people that you and I went to medical school with, trained with.

164
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,460
But I think it's what made the seven of us fast friends.

165
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,100
And I think it's why there's remained a strong bond in part because that searching and that

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,060
desire to do for self through doing for others, I think really hasn't changed.

167
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,500
So what were you doing before medical school?

168
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,460
In other words, you studied, you were an undergrad and you went to Penn, you studied math, and

169
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,860
then you moved to New York.

170
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,300
You were working in finance, right?

171
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,980
Yeah, I minored in math.

172
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,260
I majored in political science and I studied a lot of history and a lot of literature.

173
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,980
And what I didn't realize was that the attraction to me of everything that I was studying was

174
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,460
really the allure of people.

175
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,900
I studied World War II a lot and for a while I thought I wanted to go to grad school and

176
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,380
be a World War II historian.

177
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,340
And at some point I realized what fascinated me was the people, right?

178
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,260
The people who were driving the action, good, bad, or otherwise.

179
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,580
The people who were caught in the crossfires, the millions of people who were part of that

180
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,580
event.

181
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,340
And what I realized over time was that there was a commonality of drive about understanding

182
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,820
what was leading people to do things or how people were responding to things.

183
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,380
And oddly enough, it may seem odd, but I think math is kind of part of that too, right?

184
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,700
That there are things that happen inside of people and there are aspects of our choice,

185
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,620
our choices that we design with a certain linearity.

186
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,260
And ultimately, there are complex functions in all of us that make things that we might

187
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,380
think are predictable, very unpredictable.

188
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,980
And I only kind of realized that in retrospect.

189
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,980
When I graduated from school I had some really wonderful job.

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,660
And I came out in 1991 and there was a little bit of an economic downturn and I was fortunate

191
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,660
to get a job with a good consulting firm.

192
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,020
And I just thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go, that I'm going to have this business

193
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
career.

194
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,420
And if it's with my father having been entrepreneurial and had a business career, and I just thought

195
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,780
like, okay, that's for me and I'm going to make my way doing that.

196
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,180
So then what changed?

197
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,680
What changed is it really, really did not make me happy.

198
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,940
And I say that with no criticism or aspergian whatsoever to people for whom it doesn't make

199
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
happy.

200
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,580
But there was something very much missing from it for me.

201
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,740
And I think that was the intensity of human interaction and so the intensity of human

202
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,820
struggle.

203
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:02,260
And what I found is I did that for four years and I took some time in the middle and I traveled

204
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,540
for several months because I was kind of trying to figure something out, like why am I not

205
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
happy?

206
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,020
And I came back and I took a better job with the same company.

207
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,260
So as time went on, I had more authority, I was making more money, I was doing more

208
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,880
interesting things and I was less happy.

209
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,300
And it really became quite stark to me that unless I was delving into the intensity of

210
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,940
what's going on inside of people, I wasn't going to be happy.

211
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,180
And I think what I didn't really fully realize was that that was going to be a way of kind

212
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,060
of delving into the things going on inside of me.

213
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,860
And as you know and you and I've talked about many, many times, there were some traumatic

214
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,220
things that happened during that time that really just brought to the fore to me, I want

215
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,600
to understand better and I want to be able to help soothe things in other people.

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,960
And what I didn't realize at the time was that wasn't a way of saying, oh, I'll be selfless

217
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,320
and altruistic, right?

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,000
And that's going to save the day for me.

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,800
But really, that also, what I didn't realize at the time was the mirror that it would put

220
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,120
up that would allow me to just get access to help that I didn't have before, be open

221
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,480
and communicative and understand myself in ways that it wasn't necessarily programmed

222
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
to do.

223
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,800
I mean, I was programmed to work hard, achieve, not be weak, right?

224
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,240
And that inability to express, right?

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Even to myself, let alone to other people, was ultimately draining the life from me and

226
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,440
actually did drain the life in terms of actual death from some people around me that I very

227
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,040
much cared about.

228
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,600
And in some ways, I was rebelling against that way of being in the world and that way of

229
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
teaching people to be in the world.

230
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,800
And I had some, I think, inkling of understanding of that, but it more came through anger and

231
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,560
rejection of things and it came through an understanding through the lens of compassion

232
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,080
that we've kind of structured our society in a way that makes it very, very difficult

233
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,360
to live in, I think.

234
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,360
You're alluding to, obviously, something I know is very difficult and we've talked about

235
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
it a lot.

236
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,960
I don't know that we need to necessarily go into great detail here, but in the span of

237
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,760
a year, if I recall, you lost your brother and your best friend.

238
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:23,440
My brother died by suicide and about a year later, one of my closest friends, so this

239
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,120
same, a close group of friends growing up, sort of like we had in medical school, but

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,400
there were a group of us and one of those very, very close friends from childhood also

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,240
died and he didn't die by suicide, but there was sort of that same kind of desperate recklessness

242
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:49,000
that I saw this common root in those two deaths and they confused me and infuriated

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,840
me and made me feel very helpless and vulnerable and wanting to be able to understand better

244
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:04,160
and to kind of fight against this thing that made it so hard for people to get help and

245
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
to be vulnerable.

246
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,200
And that was really the commonality is both of the people who died had real and significant

247
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,920
needs inside of them that came about naturally, right?

248
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Like something you would never criticize a person for having those needs or those struggles,

249
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,120
but there just wasn't a venue of getting real acknowledgement and help for any of that.

250
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,640
So that kind of silent bravado and silent struggle became very real to me that, oh,

251
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,000
that leads to death, right?

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,760
I mean, it doesn't all the time lead to death, but at least to death way more often than

253
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
is even remotely acceptable.

254
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,920
I mean, I think as we've discussed it, sometimes it can lead to death immediately, like in

255
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,680
these cases, and sometimes it can lead to a functional death, which is you're still

256
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,600
technically alive, you know, you still respire, but you're effectively dead.

257
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,520
In many ways, that's probably the more endemic, more sinister, more destructive over the long

258
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,160
term, given its sheer volume problem, right?

259
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, absolutely.

260
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,160
I think the deaths that we see in front of us as like, actually, okay, that person is

261
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,960
not breathing anymore, are there a viscerally moving hallmark of what is so pervasive in

262
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
our society.

263
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,160
And I do think that I didn't understand that then, that in many ways, the way our society

264
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,080
is structured and the way our metrices of achievement are structured really beckons

265
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:41,560
us to death in life, to losing touch with the basics of our own value system and essentially

266
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:49,000
to incessant striving and not incessant striving to achieve, although we may see it that way,

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,400
but incessant striving to not pause and to not feel the vulnerability that I think is

268
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
so pervasive now.

269
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,640
I mean, even in the 20 years, you know, since we went to medical school, I mean, you think

270
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,680
about how pervasive media is, right?

271
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,640
I mean, how there's just marker after marker after marker after marker that says that you're

272
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,840
not good enough, you don't have enough, you're too vulnerable, you know, there could be terrorist

273
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,400
attack anytime your kids could be killed, we could die.

274
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:25,480
I mean, it's one stimulus after another that tells us not to stop and to really value ourselves

275
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,080
by the things that we really value.

276
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,760
We get through med school and true to your word, you get a psychiatry residency spot,

277
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,160
you decide to stay at Stanford in part because your wife was still, your soon to be wife,

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,080
you guys weren't married yet, but your girlfriend was a couple of years behind us in med school

279
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,960
and you end up spending half your time at Stanford and then your wife matches at Harvard

280
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,840
so you go and finish your residency at Harvard.

281
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,520
So whenever I'm telling patients about you and I'm probably bastardizing all of my knowledge,

282
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,400
which is so limited in this field, but I say, you know, one of the things about Paul that's

283
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,880
so unique is he did half of his training at Stanford, which is probably one of the foremost

284
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,280
institutions when it comes to understanding the neurobiology and the pharmaconeurobiology

285
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,960
and the pharmacology of psychiatry and then does the other half at Harvard, which is sort

286
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,560
of a more old school, but you know, a place that specializes so much in the psychotherapy.

287
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,640
Is that an act, am I making that up when I say that?

288
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,200
Because I've just decided to take the liberty and say that about you.

289
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,280
It sounds good, so please keep saying it.

290
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,640
No, no, actually I think that there is truth to that and there's even more, there's more

291
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,040
truth to that the longer I get from it and the more I reflect on it.

292
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,760
I think that, you know, I am not a very positive or hopeful person about the state of the field

293
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:54,680
that I'm in, which I think does not broadly enough train people in brain biology, not

294
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,260
just in the use of medicines, but in what those medicines actually do and on a very

295
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:08,240
real level, what are those medicines doing as interventions in the brain, in the many,

296
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,520
many systems of the brain, in the cascade of effects that occur in the brain?

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,920
And we don't think about structural neurobiology.

298
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,600
We don't think about neurochemistry in general.

299
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,960
So there's that part of the field that often gets ignored.

300
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,280
And then the other side is the psychology.

301
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,800
There has been a debate of should psychiatrists still be trained in psychotherapy?

302
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,180
I mean, I see this come up and I just think that it's, fuck, we're putting it crazy to

303
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,320
consider having people that are, that are schlepping medicines to other people that

304
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,320
aren't thinking about what it's like to really try and understand someone and what are the

305
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,040
paradigms of understanding other humans, right?

306
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,080
The kind of things that are valid and have a scientific basis for them, but that are

307
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
not hardcore brain biology.

308
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,200
And I was very, very fortunate to learn so much neurobiology at Stanford and to have

309
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,760
that integrated into my training.

310
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,560
But when I got to Harvard, I was struck by that several very like prominent, influential

311
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,020
people there who were influential over, like, for example, whether I graduated, right?

312
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,020
We're like really shocked at how much brain biology I knew and really shocked at how much

313
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,920
psychology I didn't know.

314
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,260
And even though I had sought out some of this on my own, being in a place that was kind

315
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,300
of steeped in an older analytic tradition really helped me kind of embrace this belief

316
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,220
that understanding psychology and certainly from the perspective of what's psychodynamic,

317
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
right?

318
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,400
The things that influence and motivate us that are in our unconscious, you know, the

319
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,660
gigantic part of the iceberg that's underneath the water, but that is most deterministic

320
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,560
of our behaviors and our choices and our feelings.

321
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,780
And being able to integrate that with the brain biology upon which it rests, I think

322
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:58,500
is, I think it's the way to at least try and have the most broad set of abilities to try

323
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,580
and help people.

324
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,540
And in some ways it was very fortuitous for me to split my time between those two places

325
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,120
and to find a couple very, very good people who took it upon themselves to try and teach

326
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,860
me in a short period of time what maybe I should have learned over a longer period of

327
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
time.

328
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,740
When those of us who are not trained in this discipline think back to, you know, our psych

329
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,800
101 class or something as undergrads in college, you get introduced to all of the luminaries

330
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,120
in the field.

331
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,600
And one of the things I still remember was sort of the id ego, superego stuff.

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,440
How much of that stuff is still relevant today?

333
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,440
I mean, even sometimes when you and I talk, we still, and again when we talk about personal

334
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,640
things, this idea of ego still comes up.

335
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,960
I mean, you and I both completely separate to all of this discussion because we won't

336
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,600
go down this path, it just takes too long, but we share an enormous interest in psychedelics

337
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,560
and the promise that they hold for people.

338
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,240
And of course one of the hallmarks of this is dissolution of ego.

339
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,800
So when you think about what someone like me or someone who's listening to this who

340
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,420
doesn't have the training thinks at a very crude level of the id ego, superego, how much

341
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,260
does that still apply to how you think about these problems?

342
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,720
I think it applies tremendously on a foundational level.

343
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,400
And the problems we often run into are often about semantics and even among experienced

344
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,320
psychiatrists, the definition of words and terms can obscure any understanding.

345
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,320
So for example, in the Freudian concept of the ego, it's much more the whole self.

346
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,120
It's the part of self that one can bring in a conscious way to bear on the questions and

347
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,600
issues at hand.

348
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,560
It's the part of self that can mediate between the different poles, right?

349
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,760
So it may be about gratification, the superego may be about what you should or shouldn't

350
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,520
do, but ideally it's the ego, the whole self that pulls that together.

351
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,760
And that's a very different use of the term ego than how it often is used these days where

352
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,880
ego is a sense of self that essentially indicates a defense mechanism.

353
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,000
And the idea of dissolution of the ego through the use of psychedelics is not dissolution

354
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,320
of the classic psychodynamic or Freudian ego, which is like the whole self at its most poised

355
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,680
and comprehensively aware and empowered.

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,160
It's more the dissolution of ego as defense that we build up over time.

357
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:31,800
I think a shocking number of defense mechanisms that serve us well at the time, but that ultimately

358
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,120
are an unhealthy part of the foundation that then gets built upon.

359
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,480
So for example, a sense of insecurity in childhood and I'm not good enough and I need to achieve

360
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
more and I need to please people.

361
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,760
We build so much around that, that defines us in a certain way, for example, right?

362
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,000
That tells us that we must be perfect and we beat up on ourselves over less than perfect

363
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,760
because that's how we're going to make ourselves perfect.

364
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Right?

365
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
And then you can think of all the things that build on top of that, which could be maladaptive

366
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,680
friendships, maladaptive romantic relationships, maladaptive career choices, right?

367
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,800
There's so much that we can build on top of that.

368
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,720
And then in a very strong sense, it's almost as if like the true us, right?

369
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:22,120
The Freudian ego is surrounded by, you know, 90 story high walls that are built to protect

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,960
us, but actually protect us from real connection with self and others and real understanding.

371
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,240
And some of what the psychedelics, it seems through the phenomenology, the people's experiences,

372
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
the research, right?

373
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,760
When you put all of that together and you look at it with the brain imaging and the

374
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,680
knowledge we have about brain biology is in an amazing way, they can take down those defenses,

375
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,000
which if not done in, you know, a therapeutic and a controlled setting obviously can be

376
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,240
dangerous, but in the right setting opens one up to an experience of self and an experience

377
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,560
of the truth of self that is no longer walled off by all of these unhealthy defenses.

378
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,400
So I mean, it's a long answer to the question, but yes, what's going on in our unconscious,

379
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,120
what's going on deep in our brain, the things that we're not consciously aware of are so

380
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,500
deeply impactful.

381
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,920
So Freud certainly didn't get everything right, but this concept of the unconscious pulls

382
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,440
on us and the ability to integrate those things in a healthy ego that can actually decide

383
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,120
and choose, I think is as relevant or more so than ever when there's so many pulls away

384
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,480
from authenticity of the self.

385
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,200
And then the hope of psychotherapy, just shared human experience and psychedelics is to be

386
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,040
able to take those defenses down so we can have an experience of self that reflects who

387
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,200
we truly are, which the vast majority of the time involves acknowledgement of the things

388
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,880
that we're ashamed of, the vulnerabilities, the things that we've ensured ourselves against,

389
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,720
which are often the very things that keep us away from happiness.

390
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,760
You know, as you know, I'm writing a book now and it's not a particularly easy thing

391
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
to do.

392
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,160
I think it's probably hard even for someone who's a natural writer, but certainly for

393
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
someone like me, it's very difficult.

394
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,840
And I'm toying with a chapter that I've been really, really flailing with for the past

395
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,160
three weeks.

396
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,960
It may not end up in the book because I just don't know how to write it, but it's a chapter

397
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,800
that centers around the experience I had in Kentucky, which might seem like an obscure

398
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,000
thing to write about in a book about longevity.

399
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,320
But of course, as I've become very clear on lately, I don't think all of this obsession

400
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,000
with longevity and living longer and living better means a lick if you're miserable.

401
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,440
And so much of our misery is self-imposed.

402
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,520
And I think obviously you are the reason I went there.

403
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,320
I would never have done what was required to go through that experience were it not

404
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,720
for you insisting on it.

405
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,600
And frankly, even had you insisted on it, you know, at a different time without the

406
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,840
confluence of events that led to it, I probably could never have done that because the vulnerability

407
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,560
that's required to do and to go there and you even put me in touch with another patient

408
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,360
who you had sent, who had gone.

409
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,360
Again, the thing that amazed me about that was how long I had lived my life, never even

410
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,920
considering the idea that there can be a child that gets wounded, that wounded child develops

411
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,380
in an adoptive child.

412
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,600
And sometimes that adoptive child is the one that shows up in the adult body and not as

413
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,200
opposed to a functional adult.

414
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Yes.

415
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Yes.

416
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,560
I guess I just sort of feel like I'm neo in the matrix.

417
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,200
And after I've gone through this whole experience, I see my life in a totally different way.

418
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,680
And I realize, oh my God, like all of that achievement, all of that perfectionism, all

419
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,640
of those things I was chasing, it's basically a kid trying to protect you.

420
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,400
And I've certainly not held out any hope that it's going to be ever fully resolved.

421
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,160
I mean, I'm not, I don't know, maybe I'm just too pessimistic.

422
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
It's going to get better.

423
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,280
I'm absolutely confident because it has gotten better.

424
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,420
But it just strikes me as so hardwired that it kind of makes me wonder, like, is this

425
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,560
something that's getting worse or is this something that has always existed in our civilizations,

426
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,320
in our societies, and only now because so many of our other needs are being met?

427
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,000
You know, none of us that are list, if you're listening to this podcast, you're probably

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,200
not worried about where your next meal is going to come from.

429
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,120
You're probably not worried about a plague.

430
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,320
You're probably not worried about, hopefully you're not worried about a civil war or something

431
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,400
like that.

432
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,880
So is it just that our basic needs, you know, of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, they've been

433
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,480
met and so now we have the quote unquote luxury of worrying about self actualization and what

434
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,460
does happiness mean and what does it mean to be fulfilled and content that we're now

435
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
realizing this?

436
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,680
Or do you think there are things that are actually making it worse today and there are

437
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,280
more wounded kids out there and more adults that are effectively nothing more than adoptive

438
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
kids?

439
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
It's such a fascinating question.

440
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,400
And I mean, of course, I don't know the answer, but I do suspect that we are making it worse

441
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,160
for ourselves in ways that we haven't intended.

442
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,760
So of course, I'm all for opportunity, meaning like we are numbing ours, we have more net

443
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,840
agents to numb and soothe ourselves.

444
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,500
We've made more opportunity for ourselves in certain ways.

445
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,920
And that opportunity is a wonderful thing in many ways, but every good thing has its

446
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,500
potential for a downside and something that can work against or even negate the good thing.

447
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,280
So for example, as far as I know, for generations, the people in my family lived up in the hills

448
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,440
of central Italy and as far as I can tell, most of them were shepherds, right?

449
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,000
And we could look at that and say, look, there's a limitation to what they could achieve.

450
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,520
And how fortunate am I that people sailed across the Atlantic and now I go to college

451
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,080
and I have a business career and then I go back to school and I take undergraduate classes

452
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,080
and I apply to medical school after all of that and I get in and you could list forever

453
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,480
the additional opportunities that I have that people didn't have before.

454
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,400
And that's wonderful and I certainly would not argue against opportunity, right?

455
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,880
But it also brings greater opportunity to run away from the things that plague us.

456
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,760
So for example, you and I, and probably many, many, if not most of the people listening

457
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,480
to this podcast are driven to be powerful.

458
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,240
So okay, some of the motivation for what I do or what you do is intellectual curiosity,

459
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,400
the desire to help others, the desire to learn about self, right?

460
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,520
But a significant aspect of the strength of the fuel in the tank, right, is running from

461
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
something, right?

462
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,360
It's running from vulnerability.

463
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,240
Because there's more opportunity, there are higher expectations.

464
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,720
And I think there were high expectations for both of us, not that I am arguing against,

465
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,280
you know, the fact that our families instilled in us conscientiousness and ambition, but

466
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,120
I think we internalize that as must be perfect, must achieve more.

467
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,580
Like when is enough enough and it becomes very, very unclear and it becomes very easy

468
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,640
to run from things.

469
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,440
And you know, it's that that I think that the modern world doesn't actually help us

470
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,480
define what we are striving for.

471
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,680
So more striving, more power, whatever that means, right?

472
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,720
It could mean money, it could mean prestige and titles, influence, whatever it means,

473
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,560
like more of that by definition becomes better.

474
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,080
And we live in a world that constantly reminds us of our vulnerability.

475
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
So there's never a time.

476
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,600
I mean, my guess is having spent time, you know, in places where like people are shepherds,

477
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
right?

478
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,480
And people do have these simpler lives.

479
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,520
And sure, they don't have the opportunities we have, but there are ways that I often can

480
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,000
see them at the end of the day, feel a sense that the day is over and that what's the

481
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,280
days exigencies are over the days, ambitions are over, right?

482
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,880
They're like things are okay and it's time to rest and there'll be tomorrow.

483
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,760
And I think most of us don't have that feeling.

484
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,680
You know, most of my life when I fall asleep, I'm exhausted and I have a sense that, well,

485
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,000
now I need to sleep for a little bit so that I can get up and strive more.

486
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,280
And I don't think there's any way if we're honest with ourselves that we can frame that

487
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,320
as, oh, that's a drive to something.

488
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,800
No, that's a drive away from something, right?

489
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,880
And it's running away from ourselves and it's running away from our problems.

490
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,760
And we don't even know what those problems are.

491
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,240
And the fact that, as you know, I have a pretty diverse practice, right?

492
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,520
That like really, I think spans the spectrum of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric things.

493
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,520
And I absolutely believe and I've come to believe more and more and more and more as

494
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,280
time goes on that 80% of what I treat is trauma.

495
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:15,240
80% of what ails me, 80% of what ails you, 80% of what ails the world around us is all

496
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
trauma.

497
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,320
There's another 20% that might be a head injury, schizophrenia, you know, the complications

498
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,080
of physical injuries, biological determinants of addiction.

499
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,920
But none of those things, even those things that seem and are very biologically determined

500
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,320
are free of the impact of trauma.

501
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,000
And the rest of it I think is purely trauma.

502
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,800
It's manifestation is anxiety, depression, panic attacks, choices to abuse substances,

503
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,920
choices to do things that are unhealthy, whether it's overeating or it's cutting or it's gambling

504
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,400
or whatever it is that we're doing.

505
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,480
So much of that is driven by trauma.

506
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,240
And I think that, you know, yes, it's an opinion, right?

507
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,200
It's not something I can prove that you can prove like a, you know, like a math problem,

508
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
right?

509
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,800
If you really look at it and you look at what's going on at the root of what ails people,

510
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,800
I think it becomes self-evident that I think there actually is a way of proving that, which

511
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,080
is just look at what's really going on in people instead of categorizing them.

512
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,320
You know, there's a DSM-5 that's a half a city block long that just looks to like, look,

513
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,600
if we flip through it, I don't know how many diagnoses you and I would have between us,

514
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
right?

515
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,320
Because it's designed to capture everybody multiple times over.

516
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,060
But categorizing what ails somebody and putting a number on it is not understanding them.

517
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,520
That is not synonymous with understanding them.

518
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,280
This is the tragedy of your profession, right?

519
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Yes.

520
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,160
That's the direction it's going in.

521
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,400
It's designed to categorize.

522
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,240
If you categorize something, you can put a number on it, right?

523
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,760
And then you can get 20 bucks for insurance and you haven't actually understood people.

524
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,680
I think that both the practitioners in my field and the people who come to care deserve

525
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,600
better than what the field gives them.

526
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,120
And we've stepped away from really trying to understand people.

527
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,440
And I'll give you an anecdote.

528
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,400
I was very, very fortunate when I was interviewed for Stanford, I was interviewed by Peter Rosenbaum,

529
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,120
who was an emeritus professor of psychiatry.

530
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,880
This was in medical school or for residency?

531
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
No, for medical school.

532
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
For medical school.

533
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Yeah.

534
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,200
And we got along really, really well and he's a wonderful person.

535
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,680
And later on, when I decided to become a psychiatrist, I told him, you know, I got his email out

536
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,840
of the archives and I told him and he sent me some redacted histories of patients.

537
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,160
And he wanted me to understand that, yes, there have been so many biological advances.

538
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,560
There's space age, neuroimaging.

539
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,160
There's an understanding of brain biology that was unimaginable 30, 40 years ago.

540
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,000
But if you look at what they were writing about people, they really evokes a human being.

541
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,560
Whereas very often now, when I look at reports of people, I can't tell anything.

542
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,720
It's just it's an inventory of signs and symptoms that you could conclude anything from.

543
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,680
And then a number gets put on top of it.

544
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,880
And yes, I mean, I'm being critical of the field as I'm saying this.

545
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,720
But in many ways, it's a societal criticism.

546
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,920
It's a criticism of a society that dumps things down and that doesn't respond to the individual,

547
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,080
whether it's the incessant phone trees that prevent us from ever solving any problems,

548
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,600
no matter what it is, whether it's my bank or it's the phone company.

549
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,280
I mean, when do you actually connect?

550
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,880
And I think it's that isolation that is a societal malady and it affects psychiatry,

551
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,600
which is a very bad thing because psychiatry is trying to help us have better mental health.

552
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,280
And we're kind of disarming its ability to do that, I think.

553
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,520
And then it pervades our society in a way that leads to isolation and desperation.

554
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,280
And if I think if you look at suicide rates and just levels of general misery,

555
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,760
I mean, I don't want to glorify the past, including the recent past,

556
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,200
but it's pretty hard to look at that and to think that there's not something here that's getting worse.

557
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,960
Yeah, well, I mean, touching on that, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal recently

558
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,840
after the sort of very close to back to back suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain.

559
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,400
And it showed some stats from the CDC.

560
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,920
So these are obviously US based statistics.

561
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,280
But when you looked at men and women between the ages of 40 and 60 across the board,

562
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
there was about a 30% increase in the rate of suicide.

563
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,720
I don't want to be misquoted on this.

564
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,680
So it was either a decade or two decades, but it was a relatively recent period of time.

565
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,120
And in my approach to longevity, it's very cluj, right?

566
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,200
I mean, I'm kind of a hack if you really stop to think about it.

567
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't have like some single magic pill that I think can make you live longer.

568
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,000
Instead, it's like a whole bunch of reverse engineered problems.

569
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,480
And one of them is, you know, it's you figure out what it is that's going to kill you and start to back out of that.

570
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:56,200
And so I spend a lot of time pouring over actuarial tables and looking over mortality trends and trying to understand how they're shifting.

571
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,560
Where are we, quote unquote, winning and where are we losing?

572
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,720
And it seems to me that, you know, even though most of my energy focuses on three things, atherosclerotic disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease,

573
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,520
the only disease that shows up in every single decade as a top 10 cause of death outside of the first decade.

574
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,160
So birth to nine is suicide accidents do as well.

575
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:32,680
And but but but I think the suicide thing, but the nature of accidents, by the way, changes so much from beginning to end that it's a very different, you know, in other words, the accidents that kill, you know, 30 year olds and 40 year olds are quite different from the accidents that kill 80 year olds and 90 year olds.

576
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:40,440
And sorry to interrupt, but how many of those accidents, especially ones that are killing younger people are what we might call parasuicidal, right?

577
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,760
It's people being reckless and getting killed because their mental state is such that they're not invested in staying alive.

578
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,880
Not only that, so that's a great point.

579
00:38:48,880 --> 00:39:02,160
The other point is when you look at the top three causes of accidental death, it is automotive accident, falling and accidental ingestion, which, of course, begs the question, how many accidental ingestions are not accidental?

580
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,320
When I was in college, a friend that I grew up with his dad shot himself in the head.

581
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,680
I remember the Sunday afternoon that had happened.

582
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:19,760
He literally they all went out to church like a normal day, went out for lunch after and then when they got back home, his dad went out to the shed and shot himself in the head.

583
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:30,120
Probably one of the saddest lessons I ever learned was maybe two months later during finals, my mom said so and so my friend is not doing well.

584
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,240
He's really down in the dumps.

585
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
You ought to come home and see him this weekend.

586
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,520
And I still to this day just cannot I can't believe what I'm admitting and acknowledging now.

587
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,640
It's so embarrassing and painful to say this.

588
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,280
But I said, Mom, look, I'm in the middle of finals here.

589
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,320
You know, I got to graduate first in my class.

590
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,280
I have to be the best engineer that ever lived.

591
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll be done in two weeks.

592
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,240
I'll see him then.

593
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,720
A week later, he was dead.

594
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

595
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,080
Now, we don't know, you know, I don't know that he'll get counted as a quote unquote.

596
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,720
Suicide because it was alcohol, barbiturates, you know, it was like a cocktail of drugs in his system and he just never woke up.

597
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,520
And again, I only tell that story not because it's, you know, it's just such a sad.

598
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,960
It's a sad reminder to me to how to prioritize.

599
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,760
It's that overnight change the way I prioritize things in life.

600
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,360
But it also begs the question, you know, his death might not be one that actually gets counted as a suicide, but I would call it a suicide.

601
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,240
Absolutely.

602
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,160
I mean, the deaths by suicide are in general the ones that are just very clearly suicide.

603
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,680
Right. Yeah. But if you if there's a note written that the gunpowder is on the hand as the gun points at the head.

604
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah. Right. But so many deaths that are not labeled as suicide actually are suicide.

605
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:55,120
And so many that aren't someone saying I'm going to kill myself now are the result of an approach to one's life that doesn't value it and wants it to end.

606
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,560
What gets called Paris suicide.

607
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:07,240
When when you when you add those things together, those numbers just undoubtedly are strikingly higher than the shockingly high numbers that we're reading now.

608
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:17,960
And I've always kept a mental note of if someone I know, you know, which includes again, I don't make much of a distinction for people in my personal life, my patients, people I consult to.

609
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,760
I mean, just humans, right. Of what they died of on the death certificate versus what they really died of.

610
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,800
Right. And it might be auto accident, accidental overdose fall.

611
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Right. And I'm looking at it. You know, that person died of Madoff that they're so ashamed of what happened to them when they were swindled and humiliated.

612
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,040
Right. That person died of rape that was never adequately addressed.

613
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,800
And the sense of shame and the sense of misery that was imparted on them was never addressed.

614
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
That person died of childhood bullying.

615
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,560
Right. That was so intense.

616
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,720
They they they decided that they were this awful, reprehensible person in sixth grade.

617
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,680
And that never changed.

618
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,720
I mean, every now and then the actual cause of death matches what what is is, you know, my brain registers as the real cause of death.

619
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,440
But very, very often there's a difference there.

620
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,000
And and the difference I account for by the role of trauma, right.

621
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,840
The role of trauma that pushes people to either end their life or to move towards the end of their life,

622
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,160
even if they're not overtly acknowledging that they're doing that, which can be a clever way of not having to feel accountable.

623
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,680
Right. If the religion says, don't commit suicide.

624
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,560
Well, it's ultimately it was an accident or well, I don't want to leave my kids.

625
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,480
Ultimately, it's an accident to me.

626
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,760
And I'm not saying that in any negative way, but we don't help people to understand what's going on inside of them.

627
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,640
Right. And you know, you're talking about how you run your practice and how you try and understand the routes to not just

628
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,880
a longevity, but the healthy longevity.

629
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,840
And, you know, and I would argue, I mean, my take on that is that you actually have become the best engineer, because what you're doing is, as you said,

630
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,400
your reverse engineering to ways of living longer and being healthier.

631
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:12,000
And with so many complex variables, I'm not so sure if it's possible to figure that out without reverse engineering.

632
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,280
And I view it as a marker of your I truly mean this, your intense and incredible thoroughness

633
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,920
that you look beyond the factors and the reasons for the factors and the reasons that underlie the factors and the reasons.

634
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,480
And it's I think what leads you to have me here instead of someone who could talk more about oncology or cardiovascular pathology.

635
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:48,720
Right. The realization that what undergirds a tremendous amount of the things that actually take someone's quality of life or take their life ultimately has a root in in mental health.

636
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,480
Right. That people who are depressed are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and more likely to die of accidents and more likely to become addicted.

637
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,440
Right. People who've been through terrible trauma are more likely for all of those things to happen.

638
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,280
The role of stress and its impact on the immune system and the growth of cancer cells.

639
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:12,960
Right. There's a level underneath the things to which we attribute morbidity and mortality that strongly influence morbidity and mortality.

640
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
And I believe that's true.

641
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,680
I mean, I think that 80 percent of what I treat is trauma.

642
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:34,400
But I actually think I don't know what the numbers are, but I think more than 50 percent of what everyone treats any doctor more than 50 percent of what walks through that door is ultimately resting in misery inside of that person that I would attribute to trauma.

643
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,680
And again, it's not my way of saying, oh, we're all suffering.

644
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,680
And in some way that it just kind of denigrates, you know, you know, when really awful things happen to people.

645
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,600
I mean, the problem is we don't take stock of really awful things that happen to people like most of the time.

646
00:44:49,600 --> 00:45:05,200
And even when those things are something so overt as, you know, an assault, a terrible loss, we can ignore even those things, let alone the impact of, you know, loss of a parent as a child, loss of a friend who moves away, loss of a pet.

647
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,040
I mean, like these are things sometimes that that you ask somebody what their inner life is like 20, 25 years later.

648
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,320
And that thing may go through their head a thousand times.

649
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,320
And it may be that the loss of the pet is symbolic of they will have no stability, no peace, no freedom.

650
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:30,960
So then it becomes, you know, becomes the internal symbol of their sense of hopelessness in life or their sense of infinite striving with no hope of getting where they want to go.

651
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:47,280
So so I don't mean to say that in some I don't know trite way, but I mean to say it in a way that I do think if you sit with individual people, you see the depth of that and you see the pervasiveness of it.

652
00:45:47,280 --> 00:46:00,880
When you recommended that I needed to go to Kentucky, needed to go to this place, the bridge to recovery, which we'll be sure to link to in the show notes here, because I really think if anybody takes anything away from this and they even

653
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:08,320
have a suspicion that they're some of their actions, some of their pain could be sort of driven by trauma that had occurred earlier in life.

654
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:14,400
I want to make sure that people at least pick up the phone, give them a call and at least commit the time to doing an intake interview with them.

655
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,000
But I mean, I was so incredibly resistant to this idea, right?

656
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,680
It was this idea that how could there really be anything wrong with me?

657
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,400
Look at how hard I work.

658
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Look at how quote unquote successful I am.

659
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,400
And by that, I just meant like I'm not an alcoholic.

660
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,920
I don't have a drug problem.

661
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,120
I'm not a gambler.

662
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,400
Like I don't have any of these overt signs of pathology.

663
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,360
Yeah, I've got these other things that are kind of pathologic, but I can mostly keep them in check.

664
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:52,000
But I kind of remember when I did my intake call with them how pissed off I got.

665
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,200
And that to me, there was there was two things.

666
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,360
Right.

667
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,800
So the first is I'm talking to this poor woman whose job it is to just do a basic screening call.

668
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,520
But she's asking me a lot of questions.

669
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,640
Nobody's ever asked me and questions.

670
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,160
I don't want to answer.

671
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,240
And at one point she asked me a question.

672
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,360
I won't tell you what the question was, but my answer was fuck you.

673
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,000
Like that was just my answer.

674
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,320
Right.

675
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:22,960
Like and when I later told that story once I finally got there, everybody thought that was so funny because they're like, wow, she asked you a question about X.

676
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,320
And she found out you have X and a bad temper.

677
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,440
It's like this really great anger management and this other thing.

678
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,160
Check.

679
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,200
But that was also kind of the reason that was certainly one of the things that made me think.

680
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,800
Because as you recall, you know, you wanted me to go and I agreed to go and then I backed out.

681
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,920
And, you know, it's just like this had been something that had been on the table for years.

682
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,320
And I just refused to acknowledge this needed to be done.

683
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,960
And I think part of it was the semantics.

684
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,240
Right. It's like, what does trauma mean?

685
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,960
We get so far in our lives.

686
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,400
Our skin gets so thick that I think people get into different patterns.

687
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,320
And for me, I know the pattern was minimization.

688
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,440
You know, I didn't forget any of the stuff that got me there.

689
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,800
I just didn't think it mattered.

690
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,520
You know, when they talk about trauma at the bridge, they really refer to it in five roots.

691
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,560
So the first route is abuse, which can be physical, emotional, sexual, spiritual.

692
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:25,120
You talk about neglect, abandonment, enmeshment, and the witnessing of tragic events.

693
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,200
And so I think it'd be impossible to think that somebody listening to this hasn't experienced

694
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,800
at least some of one of those branches and many of us more than one.

695
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:44,880
For me, the single most powerful way to let my guard down was because we're now, what,

696
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,760
three or four days into the most intense experience of my life, which is 13 hours a

697
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,280
day of group therapy.

698
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,080
And I had still sort of, I mean, I was there, so I'd shown up, but I wasn't happy, but I'd

699
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,920
refused to sort of even have a discussion about any of this stuff.

700
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,720
I was happy to listen to other people, but I wasn't going to get into it.

701
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,680
And one of the counselors, and I had these two amazing counselors, Jeff and Julie, I

702
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,560
can't remember if it was Jeff or Julie, but one of them said something to the effect of,

703
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,160
you know, if such and such, because we were talking about an event in my life, if such

704
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,200
and such occurred to your son, Reese, because Reese is four, about the age that I was, would

705
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,160
you think that was okay?

706
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,200
It's a very different question, right?

707
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,720
It's one thing when it's like, look, that happened.

708
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
I'm over it.

709
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Come on.

710
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Look at, blah, blah, blah.

711
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
I could even rationalize.

712
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,440
Look, these things have made me more resilient.

713
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,120
This has given me a chip on my shoulder.

714
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,520
This has given me an edge.

715
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,440
But when they turn it into, you have a kid and that, and it's so interesting because

716
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,600
just last week I was having dinner with a friend in Malibu and he opened up to me about

717
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,800
something incredibly personal and private that I'd never known, which was that his wife

718
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,760
had had a really difficult year.

719
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,240
She'd relapsed in her smoking.

720
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,920
A whole bunch of other stuff had completely fallen off the rails in their lives, but in

721
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,300
particular in her life.

722
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,060
We get through the whole dinner and he tells me everything about the story and it's just

723
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,620
a heartbreaking story.

724
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:21,540
And then he alludes to a fact that was clearly the trigger, which was his wife had been abused

725
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,340
very badly by her stepfather, had been sexually abused nonstop.

726
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,500
It started when she was seven years old.

727
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:35,300
Earlier this year, their daughter turned seven and it completely triggered this because,

728
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,900
and again, if I'd heard that before, I would have been like, come on, that sounds like

729
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,180
sort of psycho-babble nonsense.

730
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,940
How is it that seeing your daughter at the same age that you were at when something happened

731
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,940
could do that?

732
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,940
I mean, do you see this often?

733
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,940
Oh, sure.

734
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
Yeah, absolutely.

735
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,460
And to kind of lead up to addressing that, I want to comment on a couple of things, right?

736
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,860
One, you said that the woman who was asking you the questions, okay, she learned, okay,

737
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,620
there's this issue and then she learns about anger, right?

738
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,060
I would frame that a little differently.

739
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:09,980
I would say that there's a very skilled clinician that is doing the same thing over the telephone

740
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,140
that we might do physically examining a patient, right?

741
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,500
And he touched, does it hurt here?

742
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Does it hurt there?

743
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,620
I mean, if you get where it hurts and we're not, even if we're very gentle about it, right?

744
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,700
At times the person has a reaction, right?

745
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,420
And then you learn like, oh, you hurt there, right?

746
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,300
And that's why you reacted that way.

747
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,300
And I think that's what she learned.

748
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,300
She said, is it hurt here?

749
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,300
Is it hurt here?

750
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,220
And then she went, oh, shit, it really hurts there.

751
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,460
And it tells us something, right?

752
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:43,780
And what it tells a good mental health clinician is where there's shame and fear, right?

753
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,980
And shame is extremely powerful.

754
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,060
And technically it's an aroused affect.

755
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,700
I mean, the word aroused, it's not purely a sexual word.

756
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,820
I mean, it often gets used in that way because the idea is say something can turn a person

757
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,340
on that you didn't choose to have turn you on, right?

758
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:08,100
But the idea of aroused affect is something that's created in you without your volition.

759
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,880
Someone shoves you, you get angry, right?

760
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,380
Someone shows you really hard, you might get afraid, right?

761
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,420
There are things that make a certain, what gets called affect, but colloquially a feeling

762
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,100
inside of us that we don't have a choice over.

763
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,540
And there's an incredible automaticity to that.

764
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:29,540
And that's like, what you're talking about with, okay, like, what is this trauma thing

765
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,380
and what is it doing, right?

766
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,780
It's not necessarily what happens.

767
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,780
It's what does it make you feel?

768
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,980
And my guess is, and I don't know, I don't know the person you're talking about, but

769
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,380
probably that person is carrying some sense of shame over what happened to her.

770
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,900
Because at the age of seven, there's not the cognitive capacity of deciding, look, what's

771
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,660
going on happening to me is wrong.

772
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,420
The child needs to make sense of it, right?

773
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,300
And often how the child makes sense of it is to decide somehow that it makes sense or

774
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,340
what's happening to them is deserved, or it's their fault, right?

775
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,220
Or it's the way it should be, right?

776
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,380
And that evolves into a sense of shame that the problem here is me.

777
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,540
Someone's hurting me in some way, whatever's happening to me, it doesn't feel good.

778
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,780
And it's my fault.

779
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,820
And then it creates a sense of shame that does not give a damn about the clock or the

780
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,300
calendar or levels of achievement.

781
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,620
You have a trillion dollars and 15 PhDs, right?

782
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,460
It does not make a difference unless that shame is directly addressed.

783
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,980
So that's really the answer, right?

784
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,340
Is what has happened to a person and what is it triggering inside of them?

785
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:40,180
The same way there's pretty good literature that talks about someone is shot, right?

786
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,300
How much does it hurt?

787
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,300
And like, clearly it hurts more if there's no damn reason to have been shot, right?

788
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,980
Like if you try to save somebody and you get shot, then people tend to feel less pain because

789
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:56,580
there's a sense that it makes sense in some way, that this bad thing has happened, but

790
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,140
something good has come of it.

791
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,180
Or I was trying to do something good, right?

792
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,300
It doesn't seem senseless and sadistic.

793
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:11,020
And that sense of absurdity, the sense of evoked shame or aroused affect of shame, the

794
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:18,260
sense of an aroused affect of fear, the sense of absurdity and meaninglessness is what then

795
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,300
creates the trauma that stays with someone and kind of like, it's not even like a ghost

796
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
shadowing, you know?

797
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,260
It's like, you know, just imagine someone who like can't stand you, that just shadows

798
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,120
you all the time and says awful things.

799
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,980
And that's essentially what this kind of thing evolves into.

800
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,420
And it's that that, you know, that raises that triggering that if there's still a sense

801
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,100
of shame and now the daughter is seven years old, you know, what does that make the person

802
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
feel like, right?

803
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,660
And it identifies with the daughter, they still identify as the hurt child, but now

804
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,180
they're supposed to take care of a child who's vulnerable because that child has reached

805
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,700
the age at which they were hurt.

806
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,780
I mean, it's very, very triggering for reasons that make damn good sense.

807
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:04,020
So you've seen this where people's trigger is that the child that reaches an age at which

808
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,540
some traumatic event occurred.

809
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:12,140
Yes, it's very common because that is a trigger that they say, okay, it's my job to make sure

810
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,820
that does not happen to them.

811
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,860
But I am still in the throes of it.

812
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,860
Right?

813
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,580
So then, well, I am the traumatized seven year old child who is supposed to protect

814
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,900
the seven year old child.

815
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,300
That's terrifying.

816
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,740
It's terrifying.

817
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,700
And then the part of the brain that is terrified says, look, this absolutely could happen to

818
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,700
your child.

819
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,860
And you can't protect them.

820
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,580
And then, you know, the brain, again, the brain doesn't care about the clock and the

821
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,580
calendar.

822
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,980
So that trauma is very, very, very real to the person.

823
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,060
And it's very immediate.

824
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:47,300
It doesn't matter if it was two days ago or if it was 30 years ago, it's just as immediate.

825
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,940
And we also lose sight of that.

826
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,860
And many times I hear people say, well, that couldn't still be bothering me.

827
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,060
It was what, two months ago, two years ago, 50 years ago.

828
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,080
And the answer to that is it does not matter one bit how long ago it was.

829
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,820
If it instilled terror, shame, a sense of responsibility for something that wasn't the

830
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,540
person's responsibility, then, you know, my guess is we could probably live to be a thousand

831
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,980
years old and that would still be with us.

832
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,860
And again, very germane to your practice is that's one of the things that often prevents

833
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,660
us from living longer, right?

834
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:26,740
It's that kind of internal stress that leads not only to suicide and para-suicide, but

835
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:32,820
also to the kind of stress that contributes to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, to autoimmune

836
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,920
problems, right, to all the things that ultimately, you know, if you look at the population as

837
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,760
a whole that chips away at our health, at our healthy lifespan and at our lifespan.

838
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,040
I still remember to this day, the very, very first patient we ever collaborated on, which

839
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,240
of course was such an interesting experience for me that it's what basically led to you

840
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,300
and I being so close at the hip in terms of like how many patients we overlap with.

841
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,400
But I obviously won't use her name, but the woman in San Diego that I was taking care

842
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,200
of, very interesting case.

843
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,800
I think most of my patients are incredibly nice people, but she would certainly be on

844
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,280
the short list of like the nicest, just a very, very special woman.

845
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,360
And there were a lot of things that didn't look metabolically right.

846
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,400
Frankly, her chief complaint when she came to me was, you know, she just wanted to have

847
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
more energy.

848
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,320
She wanted to feel better.

849
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,520
Her father had died prematurely of heart disease.

850
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,580
She wanted to make sure that was not going to be her.

851
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,080
And we got to it.

852
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,760
We changed her nutrition and we fixed her hypothyroidism and we tweaked a bunch of

853
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:41,120
things and everything on paper looked right, but we couldn't eradicate certain things.

854
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,240
There was still a degree of inflammation in her body.

855
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,440
There was still a degree of insulin resistance.

856
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,260
I probably hadn't seen a patient who could be so compliant with her nutritional plan

857
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,360
as she was.

858
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,200
And the only one of her meds I couldn't really offer any input on was she was on an SSRI

859
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
I think.

860
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
I don't remember which one.

861
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,000
It was well butrin if I can remember actually.

862
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,560
I think this had been prescribed by her family doctor like 10 years earlier or something

863
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,560
like that.

864
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,080
But I remember one day thinking about what she talked about when her dad died when she

865
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,360
was in medical school.

866
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,000
She was a physician.

867
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,160
And it cleared me on this particular day, which was like a year after the first time

868
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,000
I'd heard this story that like that had that I didn't know to use the word trauma, but

869
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,720
that was clearly a traumatizing event in her life.

870
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,200
My first thought was actually I thought of these zucker rats, which I thought of these

871
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,920
experiments that occurred.

872
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,880
What I couldn't understand was why in the world is this woman who's doing everything

873
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,360
right seemingly have a metabolic rate of a slug?

874
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,520
It was like she's doing everything by the book and the only way that we could infer

875
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,960
what's going on with her is that her metabolic rate has shut down because she's no longer

876
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,960
hypothyroid.

877
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,520
All these other things have been fixed.

878
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,960
And I thought about these zucker rats where they sustain certain lesions into parts of

879
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,760
the hypothalamus and they can alter the metabolic rate.

880
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,400
And so I floated the idea by you and you said, look, anything is plausible.

881
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,800
And to make a long story short, I introduced the patient to you.

882
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,720
She came up, she saw you.

883
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:18,040
And over the course of the next six months without making any change in the thyroid meds,

884
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,320
in the nutrition, in the exercise, she probably lost 30 pounds.

885
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,080
And she looked like a different person.

886
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:31,840
In fact, I remember when I got her Christmas card with her and her family.

887
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,680
At first I thought, I don't know who this is.

888
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,600
Why am I getting a Christmas card from a random person?

889
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,640
And I mean, what do you remember about that case?

890
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,080
Maybe not even the specifics, but just like, were you as surprised by that as I was?

891
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:54,040
You know, I think the fact that I wasn't is just indicative of, it's not indicative of

892
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,760
like some genius that I figured things out that other people haven't.

893
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,800
It's just indicative of things that I have witnessed that utterly shocked me at the time

894
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:10,960
that lead to what I would describe as more than a healthy respect, but an utter reverence

895
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,440
for the impact of what the brain can do to the body.

896
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,560
And a couple of examples are paralysis of a limb.

897
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:24,560
I mean, I've seen people, seen cases in my training and subsequently taken care of people

898
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:32,720
who do something that they find reprehensible or almost do something that could have been

899
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,880
disastrous and then the limb that they did it with is paralyzed.

900
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,680
And now it's like, it's 10 years later and the limb hasn't moved in 10 years.

901
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,760
I mean, the nerves haven't been severed, but they may as well have been those contractures

902
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,760
and everything else.

903
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,600
I mean, when you see that the brain can like shut off vision, right?

904
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,200
The brain can shut off movement to a limb.

905
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,880
You know, these are really shocking things.

906
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:05,160
And I think that we as a society, like we just don't appreciate how much impact over

907
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:11,000
all aspects of our functioning, some of the things that torment us inside can have.

908
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,760
So there was something tormenting this lovely woman that was like shutting her metabolism

909
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,760
off.

910
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,440
And in many ways I get it, it's like, it's a shocking thing.

911
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,320
And it would have knocked me off my feet if I hadn't been like seeing paralyzed limbs before.

912
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:32,300
And you know, things that really kind of told me things that to be honest really made me

913
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,300
angry.

914
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,940
Like, how is it that I consider myself to be a curious person?

915
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,500
I mean, even look before psychiatric training, right?

916
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,700
And I'm a well-read person.

917
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,820
I'm a well-traveled person.

918
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,340
I'm interested in other people.

919
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,100
I took a broad curriculum in college.

920
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:53,300
Like how is it that I didn't understand these things of what our brain and what does that

921
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,300
mean?

922
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,380
It means what our brain in the context of trauma, which is about evoke, shame, fear,

923
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,060
think about things we're talking about in the patients where we've had these kinds of

924
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,980
experiences, right?

925
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:09,540
And even in ourselves, think about the impact of shame and fear and what it does to us.

926
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,400
And people don't tell us that.

927
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,740
So then a person feels ashamed, right?

928
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,060
That they're eating less and they can't lose weight.

929
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:21,460
They feel ashamed that they're sleeping, but they're not well rested.

930
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,860
They feel ashamed that they want to be patient with their kids and they can't be as patient

931
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,860
as they want.

932
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,220
I mean, I could go on and list thousands and thousands of things.

933
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:36,660
And what we often don't, again, don't appreciate is where's all that coming from?

934
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,580
And has anyone ever asked about it?

935
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,580
I'll give you a quick aside that I saw a person in my practice several years, maybe

936
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:49,700
five years ago or so, very, very intelligent person, very capable, academically accomplished

937
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:56,060
who was working many, many, many levels underneath where he could, would have been operating

938
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,140
in a $10 an hour job and somebody, you know, who should be running a company.

939
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,060
Not dramatic.

940
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:06,860
And you know, I was, I don't know how many people had seen and talked to this person

941
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,380
before, right?

942
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:12,100
And I asked him a question and you know, we had been talking, so it's not like it came

943
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:19,220
out of the blue, but, but I asked him, you know, how many times a day do you say something

944
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,540
to yourself inside?

945
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,220
That's some version of like, I suck.

946
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,300
And this response was also, I'm a piece of shit.

947
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:33,540
And his answer was like, he stopped and he says hundreds, hundreds of times all the way

948
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,580
to the job, all the way back in the shower before he goes, when he's back at home with

949
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:42,220
his kids nonstop, you know, that was all trauma based.

950
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,820
And it was based upon belittling, bullying, all things that had happened.

951
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,940
I mean, you could take a trauma history from this person and not like no one's ever shot

952
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,940
him.

953
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,940
No one's ever sexually assaulted him.

954
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,340
Like it was, oh, there's no trauma.

955
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,340
Oh no.

956
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,980
There was gigantic trauma.

957
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:02,100
And if you're saying something to yourself over and over and over again, that is, that

958
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,300
is profoundly negative and that makes you feel vulnerable, ashamed, inadequate.

959
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,900
How are you supposed to be at your best?

960
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,100
How does it affect your brain?

961
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,580
How does it affect your endocrine system?

962
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,500
How does it affect your immune system?

963
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,380
How does it affect your vasculature?

964
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,580
The answer is dramatically.

965
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:21,340
And then you look at this person who now was aware of substandard role performance and

966
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,240
now he feels worse about himself.

967
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,000
And by going after that, we were actually able to change everything.

968
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,600
I mean, that the person's life is dramatically different.

969
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,480
If you look at what he's doing for a living now, you're like, okay, that's, you know,

970
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,760
that's something that seems more commensurate.

971
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,160
And in this person, it doesn't represent the endless striving of you who never, you know,

972
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,160
achieve enough, right?

973
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,960
In this person, it represents something that makes him feel whole, that this wasn't, you

974
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,080
know, his ability to be something he could feel proud of, to support his family in a

975
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,080
way he could feel proud of.

976
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,040
It wasn't taken away from him.

977
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,600
But if you looked at what was the etiology of that problem, it absolutely wasn't single

978
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,880
digit ages.

979
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,680
And it doesn't matter that this was like three or more decades along, right?

980
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,600
It was with him hundreds of times a day.

981
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,920
And that's why these things don't surprise me.

982
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,640
And you know, I've had an increased awareness over time of my own inner voice that, you

983
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,400
know, I may as well have somebody, you know, behind me all the time.

984
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,560
I mean, I've been trying to alter this and some, some of us with your help and a couple

985
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,680
of other people around us, you know, it's kind of gotten better.

986
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,840
And the realization that I carry around with me a voice that tells me how shitty I am for

987
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,520
everything that's not utterly perfect from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to

988
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,760
sleep has created a lot of misery in my life and has created unhealthy situations.

989
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,280
And you know, at times real risk to my life and limb for me.

990
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,800
So you know, I'm a huge believer that the reality and the truth that we're living,

991
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:53,080
I say that the reality and what we view as truth that, that we're living in is often

992
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,880
not apparent to anyone around us and nor is it apparent to ourselves.

993
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,400
And if we make that apparent, then we can make some decisions about it, which is why

994
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,000
that woman was able to lose weight is because we, we started talking about like what was

995
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,280
actually going on inside of her.

996
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:13,160
And you know, in a certain person, if you are intensely ashamed and feel inadequate

997
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,520
from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep, you probably eat 20 calories

998
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,400
a day and you're going to gain weight.

999
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,320
That's the part that just blows my mind in her case.

1000
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,240
The other thing with this stuff that I think it's worth people who are listening to understanding

1001
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,640
and it's so important.

1002
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,760
I certainly didn't understand it until the past year.

1003
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,960
I think I wasn't so naive to know that I wasn't so, so, so maybe naive is the wrong word.

1004
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,240
I wasn't so ignorant to think that, look, bad things happen.

1005
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,400
I got it.

1006
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:49,600
But my sort of blinder based mentality was I can prevent that exact set of things from

1007
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,280
happening to the next generation, to my kids.

1008
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,640
And of course the irony of it is you learn that trauma almost always comes out in some

1009
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,560
orthogonal way.

1010
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:05,800
And so it's not necessarily that the child of the alcoholic becomes the alcoholic.

1011
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,120
In the case of the woman that I was just talking about earlier, who when she saw her daughter

1012
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:15,200
turn seven triggered all these flashbacks of the sexual abuse.

1013
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,280
I think the probability that that mother is going to go ahead and sexually abuse her daughter

1014
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,920
because she was sexually abused by her stepfather, I think the probability of that is close to

1015
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
zero.

1016
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,520
That is not how the shame will be transferred to the next generation.

1017
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,200
It will not be through the same root cause.

1018
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,760
It will come out in something different.

1019
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,520
And to me, that's the part of this thing that is so, it's such an epidemic.

1020
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,240
Terrence Reel, who we've talked about a lot in his book, which I've talked about on other

1021
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,720
podcasts, one of the most important books I've ever read.

1022
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,400
I don't want to talk about it.

1023
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:55,080
He talks about this, the number of generations it takes for shame to sort of work itself

1024
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,240
out.

1025
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,820
And it's like, this happened to the grandfather.

1026
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,740
This happened to the mother.

1027
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,660
This happened to the child.

1028
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:11,460
This idea of shame transference through trauma is, I don't know, I guess like I said, even

1029
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:16,700
though I don't do this for a living, it occupies more and more of my time because I spend more

1030
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,180
and more of my time thinking about it with the patients that I'm lucky enough to get

1031
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,180
this close to.

1032
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,720
And truthfully, there are some of my patients I just don't get close enough to to understand

1033
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,420
this part of their lives.

1034
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:32,260
But I want to because I realize so much of what we do without knowing this becomes quite

1035
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,260
futile.

1036
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,260
Absolutely.

1037
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:38,060
I mean, if the manifest, if the only thing we were guarding against was the manifestation

1038
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,020
of something that we recognize, things would be different.

1039
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:47,460
I mean, I think the number of generations to get rid of shame without intervention,

1040
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:52,340
you know, is either infinite or there's just some, you know, it's practically infinite.

1041
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
Right.

1042
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:56,380
Because why would something like that change unless it's understood?

1043
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,940
Now people at times can intuitively understand.

1044
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:04,460
I mean, there are things that can intervene, but otherwise you're absolutely right.

1045
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,820
I mean, it finds a way out.

1046
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:07,820
Right.

1047
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:14,420
So the person who was sheltered and over controlled as a child and that led to say, you know,

1048
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,900
big problems of rebellion and then something traumatic happens.

1049
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:22,340
Maybe if they don't understand it, they may overcompensate with the sort of freedom and

1050
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,100
what seems like opportunity for their own kids.

1051
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:31,220
But what actually puts them inadvertently in danger, just as the person who was neglected

1052
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:35,500
and was then left in situation of danger may over control their kids and then the kids

1053
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,860
rebel and the same thing happens.

1054
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:41,460
I mean, if we don't understand it, there's a very good chance that it will find a way

1055
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,860
to get us.

1056
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,940
And you know, sometimes that's something dramatic.

1057
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,340
And you know, I see these cases like, oh my gosh, like this person did the opposite thing.

1058
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,180
Their parents didn't look the same thing happens.

1059
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,180
Right.

1060
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:57,740
And a lot of times, you know, I think most human suffering and most bad outcomes, you

1061
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,340
know, happen with a fizzle, not a bang.

1062
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,660
And I think that's part of the really the biggest sadness of it is the things that we

1063
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,700
don't know are the person who just languishes, who doesn't have a strong sense of self and

1064
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,860
is burdened with regret.

1065
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,460
And that's the story.

1066
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:18,460
I mean, there's so much about this that because we don't talk about it, we don't educate ourselves

1067
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,660
about it.

1068
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,060
We just let be perpetuated.

1069
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,980
And in many ways, like I'm not trying to say, oh, this is all easy to address.

1070
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,980
Right.

1071
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:30,660
But some of this I think is low hanging fruit of, look, why are we not talking about these

1072
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,660
things?

1073
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,660
Right.

1074
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:36,860
Why is it that we enter medical school and you have all these like overly powerful guys

1075
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,660
and you know, we don't think of it like, what are we all defending against?

1076
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,500
Like, why do we have to be so powerful all the time?

1077
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,700
What are we guarding against?

1078
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:47,460
Why is it that we feel ashamed if we're not powerful?

1079
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,460
Right.

1080
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,300
And not, you know, if we're not perfect, if we're not the best, right.

1081
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,300
Why is it?

1082
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:58,140
And and and, you know, and I'm not saying, gee, let's let's have some like soft way of

1083
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,460
going about life and then people aren't driven to achieve things.

1084
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,060
But it's it's a lot of it is based on this lie that like, what doesn't kill us makes

1085
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,060
us stronger.

1086
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,980
OK, that is a lie.

1087
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,580
Sometimes something doesn't kill us and makes us stronger.

1088
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,860
You know, we can get an infection.

1089
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,860
It doesn't kill us.

1090
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,860
We develop antibodies.

1091
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,620
It can happen on a biological level.

1092
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,900
It can happen with a life tribulation.

1093
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:27,860
But my experience in my own life and in the people around me that I take care of or my

1094
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,700
friends, family, patients, like the humans in my life is that bad things that don't kill

1095
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,100
us often make us weaker.

1096
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,100
All right.

1097
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,980
They hurt us.

1098
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,540
And if we don't acknowledge that, what has this thing done to me?

1099
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,540
Right.

1100
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:45,700
Then we put it under the surface and we soldier forward.

1101
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,820
And for a lot of people, you know, what does that mean?

1102
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,980
I mean, it does mean languishing.

1103
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,580
And oftentimes for people who maybe are blessed with more drive and perseverance.

1104
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,180
Sure it means we drive ourselves to achievement.

1105
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:03,340
But amidst all that achievement, we remain miserable because the hurt part of us is is

1106
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:09,020
like still what we're living in every moment, every most of the time we're living in that

1107
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,340
hurt person.

1108
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:14,860
But that hurt person is festooned in a way that doesn't look like that.

1109
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:19,500
And if you think about very powerful things in culture, you know, the Wizard of Oz, you

1110
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:25,180
know, like such a cultural touchstone across generations, even the emperor's new clothes.

1111
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:32,140
I mean, we're infatuated with things looking some way, but being another way, you know,

1112
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,300
things looking strong and powerful, but being weak and vulnerable.

1113
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,020
And part of our infatuation with that is it can take the fear out of some of the things

1114
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,380
that scare us.

1115
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:47,340
But I think an even bigger part of that is that we often identify with that.

1116
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,380
We identify with, you know, festooning ourselves, look how great I am.

1117
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,260
And like, you know, really, I'm not festooned in anything, right?

1118
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,900
I mean, there's like, there's a pathetic nakedness to some of it, right?

1119
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,560
But but we sort of posture that way, right?

1120
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,140
And we posture that way in order to show ourselves up.

1121
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,700
And if I see a commonality between like how you and I practice medicine, and how the vast

1122
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:14,740
majority of I think good doctors practice medicine is it's not hiding vulnerability.

1123
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:19,740
I do not feel in any way, shape or form healthier than the vast majority of my patients.

1124
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,980
I mean, some people, yes, I've had a bad head injury, have schizophrenia, okay?

1125
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:28,260
I don't feel any better necessarily healthier to them a lot of the time.

1126
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:33,460
But there's an identified problem that we want to address and treat that can let the

1127
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,540
person feel a greater sense of wholeness.

1128
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,220
Okay, that's valid.

1129
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:42,780
But most of the people that I encounter are just struggling the same way that I am.

1130
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:47,140
And, you know, there really is no difference, except that person may do something, maybe

1131
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:51,860
someday I need an architect, a financial manager, you know, a lawyer, whatever it is that they're

1132
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,180
doing, but we're no different.

1133
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,660
It just happens to be like, okay, this thing I do brings them to come to me for help about

1134
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,080
this certain thing.

1135
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,100
But we're all people are trying to make our way and survive in the world.

1136
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:09,380
And often some of the people who I feel are most put together are not the people that

1137
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,380
you might think, right?

1138
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:15,060
They're the people who if you look at their achievements, you know, you're not going to

1139
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,540
be wowed by it necessarily.

1140
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:20,340
But they're people who have a greater sense of wholeness.

1141
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,300
They're people who have maybe spent more time and effort on themselves.

1142
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:29,140
And again, this is not an anti-ambition agenda that I have here.

1143
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:35,740
What I absolutely am saying is that very, very high levels of achievement are a marker

1144
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:39,860
in my brain for suspicion that this person is defending against something.

1145
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:42,860
And you know, that's the reason why I thought that you should go to the bridge.

1146
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:47,500
It's the reason why trauma therapy is part of my psychotherapy.

1147
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,060
It's the reason why at some point I should go to the bridge too, right?

1148
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,060
I mean, this...

1149
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,620
You know what the nickname for that place is?

1150
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,140
You're the first person who told me I send a bunch of people there and no one tells me

1151
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,140
this and then you do.

1152
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,140
Do you want to...

1153
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,820
It has two nicknames, Camp Misery and The Crying Factory.

1154
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:07,300
Yeah, the key to the Crying Factory.

1155
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:14,940
And you know, it points out that making ourselves healthier often is difficult.

1156
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,540
It does involve misery.

1157
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,140
It involves tears and exposure of things we're ashamed of.

1158
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:25,500
And you know, of all the places that I have sent people in, you know, at this point in

1159
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,300
almost two decade career, you know, I think that they are the most effective or among

1160
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,340
the most effective of places.

1161
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,700
And I think part of it is because they don't shy away from that.

1162
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,300
I remember something you said to me because you suggested, look, there are two or three

1163
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,500
places where I think you could go.

1164
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
Here's why I think the bridge is the best for you.

1165
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,900
And one of the reasons was...

1166
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:51,700
Oh, I'm almost embarrassed to admit live, you know, to people, to so many people what

1167
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,700
I asked you.

1168
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:57,940
You know, Paul, when I looked at these other places, the bridge seems unique in that the

1169
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:03,460
socioeconomics of it look very different from where I've come from, meaning I'm not going

1170
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,740
to be there with other people who have gone to medical school or gone to law school or

1171
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,740
whatever.

1172
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:12,060
Will I have enough in common with the other people there?

1173
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,620
And you said, that's exactly why I think you should go there.

1174
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,660
And I didn't understand that.

1175
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,660
So I go there.

1176
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,700
And of course, the first rule is everybody has a roommate.

1177
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,700
Well, I don't want a goddamn roommate.

1178
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,100
I'm 45 years old.

1179
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,100
I'm past that course.

1180
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:25,620
Right. I did that.

1181
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,740
I did summer camp already.

1182
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,700
I don't want a roommate.

1183
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:32,900
So I have my assistant call over and say, hey, we'll pay extra, but he needs a solo

1184
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,780
room to which they sort of said, thanks for telling us how to do our job.

1185
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,140
That ain't the way it works.

1186
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,220
He gets a roommate.

1187
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:39,820
Right.

1188
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:45,340
Again, everything that they did that I thought was pure torture turned out to be perfect.

1189
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:48,300
There was exactly what you said.

1190
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:54,020
I had to be around people who I could relate to intellectually, who I couldn't relate to

1191
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,620
intellectually, who I had a similar education to, to whom I did not.

1192
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:01,460
But in the end, what I realized was we are all the same.

1193
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:05,580
And that is such a banal, glib, idiotic statement.

1194
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,300
But it's fucking true.

1195
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,580
We are all the same.

1196
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:13,540
My roommate, I swear for the first three days, I thought, I don't have one thing in common

1197
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,540
with this guy.

1198
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,540
I loved him out of the gate.

1199
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,540
I mean, he was just an amazing guy.

1200
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,700
But it's like, we don't have anything in common.

1201
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,540
And that's fine.

1202
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,020
I mean, it didn't make me like him any less.

1203
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:26,140
But two weeks later, I realized, oh, actually, we have more in common than I would have ever

1204
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,940
dreamed we have.

1205
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:34,140
The reason we look like we have nothing in common is perhaps some innate wiring, perhaps

1206
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,340
some stochastic events.

1207
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,140
But in the end, we took very different divergent paths.

1208
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,540
You know, mine led me to college.

1209
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:40,780
His did not.

1210
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,220
My weaknesses led me in a different area than his did.

1211
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:48,500
One of the things that I found most powerful, and I'm bringing this back to a point you

1212
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:55,220
made earlier, was in addition to 13 hours of camp misery every day, seven days a week,

1213
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,260
you get to go to a 12-step meeting every single night.

1214
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,180
And you get to pick what it is.

1215
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,660
So they're not going to tell you which one you're going to, but you're either going to

1216
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:08,300
AA or Al-Anon or CODA or NA or SA or SLA.

1217
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,300
You're going.

1218
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,460
I think you got one night off a week.

1219
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,020
I think Sunday night, you got spared the meeting.

1220
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,220
I remember thinking the first few times, like, I'm so tired.

1221
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:22,700
I'm just so emotionally exhausted that, you know, it's 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.

1222
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,740
All I want to do is go lay on my shitty bunk bed and sleep.

1223
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,260
But they're like, nope, you got to go.

1224
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,900
And you're a guy, by the way, who could work what?

1225
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,420
How many hours constantly as a surgical resident?

1226
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,340
Yeah, this was a different level of fatigue.

1227
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:43,420
So the fact that you're that exhausted speaks to like, what's going on, the magnitude of

1228
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,780
what's going on inside of you.

1229
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:49,060
I find that to be like, fascinating and a great proof of concept.

1230
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,060
Yeah.

1231
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:54,500
This in many ways hurt more than swimming the Catalina Channel every day.

1232
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,500
Wow.

1233
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,420
Okay, that's saying something, right?

1234
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:03,660
But what I realized when it was all said and done, because I ended up being quite surprised

1235
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:07,300
at how much I really got out of being in these 12-step meetings.

1236
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,900
When I wasn't a participant, every meeting I went to was an open meeting.

1237
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,100
I never once spoke, never once.

1238
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,820
But I was so moved by the vulnerability of these people.

1239
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:21,360
Now, again, part of that might be an artifact of the fact that we were two hours outside

1240
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
of the nearest civilization.

1241
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,700
I mean, we're an hour outside of Bowling Green, Kentucky.

1242
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,260
We were in a place that I don't even, I wouldn't know how to find on a map if my life depended

1243
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,260
on it.

1244
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,400
But I couldn't believe the vulnerability in these meetings.

1245
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,300
I think in many ways that is an antidote to shame.

1246
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,680
It is the beginning of it.

1247
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,000
And fast forward five months, I'm back.

1248
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,640
I'm back into my life.

1249
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,980
And obviously much of my life has changed as a result of this.

1250
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,600
But look, we still struggle.

1251
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,800
We're still always thinking about these things.

1252
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,480
And I remember my therapist in San Diego said something that I thought was so profound.

1253
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,520
She goes, Peter, part of the problem with you is you're always the smartest guy in the

1254
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
room.

1255
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,920
Now, she was sort of mocking me.

1256
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,080
She wasn't actually telling me how the smartest guy in the room.

1257
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,160
She's like, you basically are always the one on point.

1258
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,320
You're the one talking.

1259
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,040
You're the one giving the advice.

1260
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,840
You're the one who everyone's looking to for the answer.

1261
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,360
And the problem with that is, like, you never get the chance to listen and not say a word

1262
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,000
and not have anybody even give a shit that you're in the room.

1263
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,100
And I was like, you know, that's the key.

1264
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:27,440
That's the thing I miss about the 12-step meeting was nobody gave a shit that I was

1265
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,440
in the room.

1266
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,680
And even if I was and I said, yeah, my name is Peter, it's like, great.

1267
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,040
Thanks for being here, Peter.

1268
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,600
You were no better or no worse than anybody else in this room.

1269
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,840
And so in many ways, I feel like and again, I don't think it has to be the 12-step stuff.

1270
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,760
I know people are going to listen to this and say, oh, 12 steps, a bunch of nonsense.

1271
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,640
What works for you works for you.

1272
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,560
But the point is there is really something to be said for that type of vulnerability

1273
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,880
in a group where nothing else matters.

1274
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,800
It doesn't matter how much money you have.

1275
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,880
It doesn't matter how many degrees you have.

1276
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,440
It doesn't matter what you've done.

1277
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,880
I mean, none of those has been.

1278
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,760
And of course, the next place where that became the most riveting to me was on this

1279
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,760
prison visit that I went to, which we've talked about as well.

1280
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,400
And again, just another great example of how in that moment, in a moment of redemption,

1281
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,880
all that matters is where it was where you are in that moment.

1282
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,040
And I just find that again, as I'm sitting here and listening to all of the things you're

1283
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,560
saying, of course, my mind is immediately going to, okay, what can we do?

1284
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,560
What can we do?

1285
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,560
What can we do?

1286
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,560
What can someone listening to this do?

1287
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:33,160
Can someone listening to this who's identifying with this saying, you know what, like maybe

1288
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:39,400
that thing that happened to me when I was 10 or maybe this behavior that I have that's

1289
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,880
on the surface reasonable, but underneath the surface is maladaptive.

1290
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,640
Maybe that needs to be revisited.

1291
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,920
And again, if the answer is they need to seek therapy, fine.

1292
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,600
But what else can people do?

1293
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:57,360
I think that it's so important to try and take stock of how are we trying to separate

1294
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,160
ourselves from other people?

1295
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,280
I mean, think about the things you're saying.

1296
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,280
It's very interesting.

1297
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,140
And people listening to this who know you will know that this is true.

1298
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,120
And for the people who don't know you, please, I would ask, take my word for this.

1299
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,880
I mean, you are the least entitled, condescending human being, right?

1300
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,360
I mean, you do not feel superior to other people.

1301
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,680
I don't think I've seen one wit of that in the two decades I've known you.

1302
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,360
So why is it that you want a private room and that you want to be different?

1303
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,360
It's a reflex.

1304
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:31,960
And the reflex is like, I've got to stand out in some way because that's what allows

1305
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,680
me not to feel superior, but to not feel ashamed.

1306
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,080
And that's often what is driving us.

1307
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,880
And it drives good things, right?

1308
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,600
I mean, your expertise and often being the focus in the room because you have things

1309
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,520
to say, to offer is like, these are good things.

1310
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,360
But they're also driven by the need to separate ourselves.

1311
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:57,400
And it's not that both of those sides of the coin have to come together, but if we're

1312
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,680
not aware, they do come together.

1313
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:05,880
And then you're doing something by reflex that is the exact opposite of what you need.

1314
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,120
What you need is to be part of the humanity around you, right?

1315
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,320
What you need is to relate to people.

1316
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:18,520
What you need is to feel that, my God, I mean, I'm a human who suffers from human things

1317
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,300
like these people around me, some of whom are nothing like me.

1318
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,340
Some of whom may be like me, but none of that matters.

1319
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:28,580
We're all people and our suffering is shared.

1320
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,900
That takes away the unique stigma of the things that you are suffering from.

1321
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,740
But your reflex, as mine has been, and as is the case in many people who are sort of

1322
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:42,860
driven to differentiate themselves, is to differentiate yourself so that you guarantee

1323
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:43,860
loneliness.

1324
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:50,260
And, you know, that's what people, I think, really should try and be aware of is when are

1325
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:58,300
we differentiating ourselves from the world around us because we are trying to escape

1326
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:02,140
from something, but in doing so we isolate ourselves.

1327
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,720
And we don't get a chance to just be human.

1328
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,580
We don't get a chance to just be people.

1329
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:13,860
Like, you know, the people who are there at the bridge with you had trauma and suffering,

1330
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:19,140
and they needed to express emotions, and they needed to cry, and they needed to get angry.

1331
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,660
And you did too, right?

1332
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:29,060
And I have too, and so many people need that to heal, but we work so hard to separate ourselves

1333
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,860
from that.

1334
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:35,620
And that's what I think, you know, if there's one thing like a person's going to be attuned

1335
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:41,980
to is how much are you separating yourself from the humanity around you?

1336
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,620
You know, groups of people, when people have agendas or are angry, can feel threatening

1337
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,240
and intimidating.

1338
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:53,000
But there are many places that people gather in order to feel some sense of openness and

1339
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,920
shared humanity.

1340
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,040
And that's really what we're all seeking.

1341
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:02,040
You know, I know you know this, but seven, eight years ago, and I had a clinic that myself

1342
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:07,840
and my practice partner built, you know, to be relatively sizable, and we were doing a

1343
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,640
lot of individualized treatment, and we were running groups.

1344
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,920
And the groups we were running were around addiction.

1345
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:19,680
And we were absolutely adamant that we did not stratify people by what they were addicted

1346
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,680
to.

1347
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,680
So gambling, cutting sex, cocaine, it doesn't matter.

1348
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,880
Nor did we stratify people by age, socioeconomic status.

1349
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,040
And it was a pressure to do that.

1350
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:35,360
Because certain other people who had more resources, right, like wanted that, not realizing

1351
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:40,600
that what they were asking for was, it was the very thing that was going to stand in

1352
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,920
the way of their ability to get help.

1353
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,120
You told me this exact story when I called you up to say, wait a minute, I don't think

1354
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,520
the bridge is the place for me.

1355
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,520
Yeah.

1356
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,480
And I should be going to this place or that place.

1357
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:58,880
And you said, no, what you're missing is you absolutely need to be around people who on

1358
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,440
the surface you think you're different from to realize that you're not.

1359
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,440
Right.

1360
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:09,040
And it's an advantage that people have if they're at a stage of life or for whatever

1361
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,320
reason, they're not in a socioeconomic class that allows them to differentiate because

1362
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,400
they don't strive for something that stands in their way.

1363
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:25,280
And I think back on that venture, which over about five years, my partner and I, and we

1364
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,720
had 30 people or so in some way, shape, or form, we're working for us by the end.

1365
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,520
We all really slaved away to make that place as good as it could be.

1366
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,440
And when I think back on it, I think the proudest moment, people have asked me this

1367
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,720
like, oh, that was so difficult.

1368
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:45,120
And so some people who know me and kind of know what we struggled through and like some

1369
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,800
of the people ask, what do you feel good about?

1370
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,120
And the same image comes to mind is I remember a young woman who I think she was 19 who really

1371
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,680
had struggled and was trying to find her way and had been on the streets and to the outward

1372
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:03,560
look of things, piercings and tattoos and all the kind of things that kind of mark her

1373
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:09,560
attempts to differentiate herself to say, okay, stay away from me in a way that she

1374
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,720
was using to separate herself.

1375
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:17,040
And God, she had made so much progress, so much progress in embracing who she was and

1376
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:22,100
not feeling ashamed of who she was and not feeling responsible for things that happened

1377
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,120
to her that she had no control over.

1378
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:29,200
And I remember her, I walked by kind of late one day after groups had let out and she was

1379
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:32,760
having this like really intense conversation with a neurosurgeon.

1380
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,600
And it was so clear that she was teaching him a lot of things.

1381
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,560
And you know, when he was in sort of wrapped attention, and it's a marker for me of like

1382
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,800
our shared humanness is like, you know, if you look at him and you look at her, you say,

1383
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,520
okay, the things they've achieved, he's clearly he's the authority.

1384
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,760
He's got a CV a half a half a mile long, right?

1385
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,940
And you know, this woman has been struggling to stay off the streets.

1386
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,640
She had done more work on herself.

1387
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,020
So she had a lot to teach him.

1388
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:08,940
And I have found that again, it sounds trite, but the things that I have learned through

1389
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:18,380
the course of my work, so much of them have just come from people who have been through

1390
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:23,700
such difficulties and have learned things about themselves that I hadn't yet learned,

1391
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:27,660
not at all tied to any metric other than that.

1392
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,860
And I think that's part of the secret of it.

1393
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,740
And we don't do these things anymore.

1394
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,940
We don't have places where people can come and even get some mental health education,

1395
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:41,420
some idea of like, what ails them in terms of trauma, like we don't as a society acknowledge

1396
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,420
this.

1397
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:47,020
So then it becomes some like shocking rarity when somebody finds their way to it.

1398
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:51,940
And I just I'm astounded by that, that we should be like setting a roadmap with like

1399
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,860
really gigantic arrows for all of us.

1400
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:59,980
But you know, a person has to stumble upon it or come across it inadvertently.

1401
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:02,060
In many ways, I think I'll forever be grateful.

1402
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:09,180
I mean, forever be grateful to you for making this happen, because I guess some people just

1403
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:13,860
they need a greater degree of immersion to finally break down.

1404
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:19,100
I think I could have spent two hours a week in therapy for the rest of my life and never,

1405
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:25,300
ever come close to what finally takes place when you're doing 13 hours a day plus 12

1406
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,800
step meetings.

1407
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,920
And not only that, it's like every meal, you're sitting there with the same group of people.

1408
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,580
We only got coffee once a day, 7am was coffee time.

1409
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,980
And it was like, I would get up at four and work out.

1410
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,860
And then I'd be, you know, waiting to have my coffee at seven.

1411
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,740
And there were like six of us that showed up for coffee every morning.

1412
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:47,700
And the other thing about this place that was so amazing, which really ties into what

1413
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:52,420
you're saying is everyone who works there, obviously not just the counselors and the

1414
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:58,240
therapists, but the kitchen staff, the custodial staff, the people that worked at the barn

1415
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:02,780
where we did equine therapy, every one of them had themselves been a client there.

1416
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:04,300
Wow, I didn't know that.

1417
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,940
Unbelievable shared experience.

1418
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,820
Like we are all the same at this place.

1419
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:10,900
Wow.

1420
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,740
And isn't there comfort in that, right?

1421
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,740
Absolutely.

1422
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:18,940
And can you be some exception who deserves shame for being something less than perfect

1423
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:22,860
when you fully apprehend that reality?

1424
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,740
It can't be, right?

1425
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:27,660
You know, you said something a moment ago that made me think of one of my favorite talks.

1426
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:31,700
So, you know, you and I, you know that I'm the biggest fan of David Foster Wallace, this

1427
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:38,300
person who I've just, I've just always been kind of so amazed by his insight.

1428
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,500
I just, you know, here's a guy who was not a trained psychiatrist.

1429
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:47,620
He's a writer and yet his insights into humanity go beyond almost anything.

1430
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,340
I think you couldn't learn this stuff in a textbook.

1431
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:55,380
And you know, I've been asked before, like if you could bring anybody back from the dead,

1432
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,140
you know, of recent era, right?

1433
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,140
Who would it be?

1434
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,340
And I think it would be him.

1435
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:03,300
You know, if I could, if I could go back in time and spend a day with anybody, it would

1436
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,020
probably be with David Foster Wallace.

1437
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:10,940
He has a very famous commencement speech from 2005 that he delivered at Kenyon College titled

1438
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,660
This is Water.

1439
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:18,660
And in it, he talks about the fact that we're, I think he, the way he describes it is there's

1440
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,060
no such thing as atheism.

1441
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,060
We are all worshiping some God.

1442
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,460
Do you worship money?

1443
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:28,980
Power your body, you know, your physical allure.

1444
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:35,680
And he almost makes the case that at least if you pick a God to worship, the harm to

1445
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,980
you might be less.

1446
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,660
Because if it is money you worship, you'll never have enough.

1447
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,860
If it's power you worship, you'll never feel strong enough.

1448
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:48,780
If it's intellect that you worship, you'll always feel like a fraud.

1449
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:53,660
And I remember listening to this for the very first time, which was many years ago and thinking,

1450
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,580
yeah, I get that.

1451
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,460
Like I really get that.

1452
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:02,340
Like I, I know I'm not alone, but I think a lot of people who place their self worth

1453
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,460
and their intellect, you think, what if people find out I'm not that smart?

1454
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:09,740
Like I'm just a fraud.

1455
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:14,900
And you know, it's again, it's just, it just speaks to this entire nature of humanity.

1456
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,820
And of course the tragedy in the case of David Foster Wallace is that he ends up taking his

1457
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,340
own life by suicide three years after he gave that talk.

1458
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,340
Now totally unrelated.

1459
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,620
I want to play something for you.

1460
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,740
So I was actually just listening to this today.

1461
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:31,380
I had, I hadn't come across this before, but this is an interview with David Foster Wallace

1462
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,620
and Terry Gross from NPR.

1463
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,620
I believe it was 97.

1464
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:39,020
So it was like a year or two after Infinite Jest came out.

1465
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,100
So I want to play this for you if I can cue it up on my phone here.

1466
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,260
Because I thought of you as soon as I heard this.

1467
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,260
Right.

1468
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,260
Okay, here we go.

1469
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:51,060
You know, I really like the way you talk, you write about a pleasure and how difficult

1470
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,340
it can be to, to really achieve.

1471
01:32:55,340 --> 01:33:00,900
You write about pleasure in the Infinite Jest, your, your, your latest novel.

1472
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:05,100
You know, thinking, you know, one of the things relating to that in Infinite Jest,

1473
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:09,900
one of the characters finds that, that marijuana is, marijuana is no longer a pleasurable experience.

1474
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:14,020
It just makes them terribly self-conscious and therefore anxious.

1475
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,900
And I'm wondering what happens to you when you do something that's supposed to give you

1476
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:21,020
pleasure and that just makes you uncomfortable or anxious.

1477
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:26,140
Boy, I'm not really even sure how to respond to that.

1478
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:30,580
Look, a lot of the impetus for writing Infinite Jest was just the fact that, that I was about

1479
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:35,420
30 and I had a lot of friends who were about 30 and we'd all, you know, been grotesquely

1480
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:41,020
over-educated and privileged our whole lives and had better healthcare and more money than

1481
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,300
our parents did.

1482
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,860
And we were all extraordinarily sad.

1483
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:51,340
I think it has something to do with, with being raised in an era when really the ultimate

1484
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:56,860
value seems to be, I mean, a successful life is, let's see, you make a lot of money and

1485
01:33:56,860 --> 01:34:03,460
you have a really attractive spouse or you get, you get infamous or famous in some way

1486
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:09,020
so that it's a life where you basically experience as much pleasure as possible, which ends up,

1487
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,660
which ends up being sort of empty and low calorie.

1488
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:16,580
The reason I don't like talking about it discursively is it sounds very banal and cliche, you know,

1489
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,340
when you say it out loud that way.

1490
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,340
Believe it or not, this was, this came as something of an epiphany to us at around age

1491
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:26,420
30, sitting around talking about why on earth we were so miserable when we'd been so lucky.

1492
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:32,860
Well, when did you realize that all the, all the benefits you had in an educated middle

1493
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:35,060
class life weren't bringing you happiness?

1494
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:40,660
Well, I, look, I guess it, I guess it sort of depends on what you mean by happiness.

1495
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:44,220
I mean, it's not like we were walking around fingering razor blades or anything like that,

1496
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:49,700
but it just sort of seems as if we sort of knew how happy our parents were and we would

1497
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:53,500
compare our lives with our parents and see that at least on the surface, we're according

1498
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,100
to the criteria that the culture lays down for a successful happy life.

1499
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,660
We were actually doing better than a lot of them were.

1500
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,540
And so why on earth were we so miserable?

1501
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:07,100
I don't think, you know, I don't mean to suggest that, that it was, you know, a state of constant

1502
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,420
clinical depression or that we all felt that we were supposed to be blissfully happy all

1503
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,420
the time.

1504
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:17,020
There was just, I have a very weird and amateur sense that, that an enormous part of like

1505
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:21,420
my generation and the generation right after mine is just an extremely sad sort of lost

1506
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:26,300
generation, which when you think about the material comforts and the political freedoms

1507
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,580
that we enjoy is just strange.

1508
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,940
I could listen to interviews with David, well indefinitely, but it's interesting that I

1509
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:35,100
came across that today for the first time.

1510
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:39,300
Again, I don't know how I missed it today, just literally today.

1511
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,980
And you know, I knew that we were going to be speaking this evening and I thought, you

1512
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:49,380
know, I'm going to put Paul on the spot and play that forum and ask him not just to explain

1513
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:53,300
that, but even more broadly, what the heck is going on, right?

1514
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,300
Why?

1515
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,740
I mean, let's take a step back.

1516
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:04,380
It would seem to me that suicide is the least likely cause of demise for our species, just

1517
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,380
given our evolution.

1518
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:09,460
I mean, it seems to me that we are wired to survive.

1519
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:13,060
So in other words, and again, I'm certainly not being critical of suicide.

1520
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:17,580
I have nothing but empathy for obviously anyone who commits suicide.

1521
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:21,460
It strikes me as the saddest thing ever, but I don't understand it.

1522
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:27,740
Like I don't, I don't understand how it can be so prevalent when we must be so wired to

1523
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:32,340
not want it, when we must be so wired to want to survive.

1524
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:37,580
And it, I remember very recently, I remember having this thought probably in the wake of

1525
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:41,860
the, you know, these high profile suicides, which, you know, I remember when Robin Williams

1526
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:46,140
killed himself, the same sort of thoughts go through my mind, which is, did our ancestors

1527
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,500
do this?

1528
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:51,300
Is suicide a symptom of our civilization?

1529
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:56,700
Is what David Foster Wallace is talking about here, even comparing ourselves to one generation

1530
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:01,380
ago, are we less happy or do we just have greater expectations?

1531
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:04,820
And those expectations being unmet is what makes us feel unhappier.

1532
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:09,180
Again, it's, I mean, it's so complicated.

1533
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:16,780
And I want to start off by saying like, by no means do I attest to any expertise, right?

1534
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:21,340
Or a right to offer an opinion that's more valuable than anyone else's.

1535
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:26,920
But the thoughts that occurred to be is, you know, we're wired to survive as long as we

1536
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,140
see meaning in survival.

1537
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:35,900
And I am not here trying to glorify struggle, but there is something around struggle that

1538
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:36,900
gives meaning.

1539
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:43,260
You know, people who struggle to survive in war zones, you don't have people who see meaning

1540
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,660
in survival, they see meaning in what they're fighting for.

1541
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:50,980
You know, Viktor Frankl writing mens, search for meaning, right?

1542
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:56,980
It's like, if you don't have meaning, then why would you struggle to survive?

1543
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:02,140
And it's not a lengthy extrapolation of that to say, if you don't have meaning, why are

1544
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,900
you interested in surviving?

1545
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,820
Have you read Tribe by Sebastian Younger?

1546
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,820
I have not.

1547
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:08,820
I probably should.

1548
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:09,820
And I've been told several times I should.

1549
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:11,820
I just haven't gotten to it yet.

1550
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,300
But I mean, I understand.

1551
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:16,260
I think I think this is sort of part of what he's getting at.

1552
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:22,180
Yeah, that that we OK, for example, I really I mean, it's interesting, right, given what

1553
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:26,860
I do for a living that like, I don't know how I value myself.

1554
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:30,820
I don't know how to value myself and whether I'm succeeding or not.

1555
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:35,020
I mean, is that what my family of origin thinks of me?

1556
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,740
How much time I spend with them?

1557
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:42,940
I've certainly ranged far afield and left the place I grew up in order to achieve things

1558
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:43,940
and do things.

1559
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:44,940
Should I be proud of that?

1560
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:51,340
If I have I not been a good friend or family member to the people I grew up with, do I

1561
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:55,060
value myself by what other people think of me?

1562
01:38:55,060 --> 01:39:00,580
How many patients I feel I can help the health of my relationship with the people I love

1563
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:01,580
as adults?

1564
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,020
The kind of parent I am, kind of husband I am.

1565
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,420
How much money I have?

1566
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,260
How many people want me to offer some expert opinion on something?

1567
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,540
It's like I have no idea.

1568
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:14,060
I have no idea whatsoever.

1569
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:18,500
And it occurs to me sometimes that I'll bet all those ancestors of mine really knew how

1570
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
to value themselves.

1571
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,740
Like, are the sheep safe?

1572
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,780
Is there a roof over our heads?

1573
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:26,940
And again, I mean, I'm not glorifying the lack of opportunity, you know, the lack of

1574
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,820
like a basic medical care right in generations past.

1575
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:34,500
But there is something very, very concrete about that.

1576
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,700
And when people go through struggle, when we often most worry about them is when the

1577
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,140
struggle is over.

1578
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:44,260
When people feel like I made it through that, you know, whatever that was, maybe that was

1579
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,580
chemotherapy.

1580
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,440
Maybe that was the death of someone close to them.

1581
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,140
Maybe it was a particularly trying time at home or in their career.

1582
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:57,100
You know, people will persevere when they see meaning in their struggle.

1583
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:01,540
But when there's not a struggle, the struggle is over or we're not particularly struggling

1584
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,540
for something.

1585
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,740
How do you value yourself?

1586
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:08,100
And I think often we don't even know enough to answer the question.

1587
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:11,380
I mean, like you and I have never sat down and talked about this.

1588
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,380
We spent a lot of time together.

1589
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,700
We've been closed for two decades.

1590
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,940
Like, why do we not talk about this?

1591
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:18,580
In part because we don't understand how meaningful it is.

1592
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:19,580
Right.

1593
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:22,380
So we value ourselves by persevering.

1594
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,380
But that's endless.

1595
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:24,380
Right.

1596
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:27,220
I mean, as you said, you there's always more of things to have.

1597
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:32,140
So at a certain point, that can seem very, very hollow.

1598
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:35,300
And I think that in many ways that's the disease of the modern civilization.

1599
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:39,620
I mean, even when we grew up the time of the Cold War, I mean, I grew up with this very

1600
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,100
like clear idea.

1601
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,540
And I get that, you know, it was a simplistic idea.

1602
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,540
Right.

1603
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:45,540
The West is good.

1604
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,500
And, you know, we fight for democracy and, you know, the Soviets are bad.

1605
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,300
And I get that this is not the case.

1606
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,900
I mean, I spent time in Russia and in Eastern Europe.

1607
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,940
And I get like the people are people.

1608
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,580
But it wasn't easy.

1609
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,420
It was an easier algorithm to grow up in.

1610
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:05,780
And it instilled faith in in America and faith in what we stood for.

1611
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:10,860
And and as we get older and wiser, we all learn about the hypocrisy of life and the

1612
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:15,220
the truths of life and, you know, learning of, you know, I remember learning about like

1613
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,420
things that America had done in Central America.

1614
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:18,420
Right.

1615
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,020
And, you know, I'm feeling a sense of like, oh, my God, we are not this force of good.

1616
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,300
And it doesn't mean that we were a force of evil.

1617
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,120
It means that the situation was far more complicated, but it provided a heuristic.

1618
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,920
And even that was something that kind of made sense.

1619
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:35,840
I mean, I can remember the Olympics coming around and like feeling this sense of, OK,

1620
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,000
like it's are we going to beat the East Germans and the Russians?

1621
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:45,040
And, you know, there was just a sense of dichotomization, which is why people who want to control other

1622
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,480
people know to make struggle.

1623
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,480
Right.

1624
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,480
You make an enemy.

1625
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,980
So this is all a double edged sword.

1626
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,760
And you can make meaning in ways that is not valid.

1627
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,760
Right.

1628
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,760
You say, OK, those people are bad.

1629
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,760
Let's go kill them.

1630
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,480
And that's a way of making meaning for people.

1631
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,800
It's not an honest or a moral way.

1632
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:07,480
But what I'm trying to point out is that we see value to our struggle if we see meaning.

1633
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:13,960
And I think that for a long time, even as people got wisdom and in greater knowledge

1634
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:18,000
of things like hypocrisy and they're really the truth of the world, I think we still saw

1635
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,600
greater meaning.

1636
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,080
And I'm not so sure that we do as much now.

1637
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:27,800
You know, I think that things are much more nebulous and then it's hard to get around

1638
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,320
the idea of, well, do I really matter?

1639
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,680
You know, what am I doing?

1640
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:31,680
What am I standing for?

1641
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,320
What's what's really the difference?

1642
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,560
And I just think, look, that can happen at any time.

1643
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:41,240
And probably it did happen back when everybody lived in caves.

1644
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:44,960
But I think we're much, much more susceptible to it because we don't have some sense of

1645
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,520
community and we don't have a sense of community.

1646
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,520
I mean, it's interesting, right?

1647
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:54,760
People have written about why do human beings, when we're so focused on survival, right?

1648
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,720
There's a lot of people that will spontaneously risk their life for somebody else.

1649
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,280
Jump into the river, right?

1650
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,280
Try and rescue somebody.

1651
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,280
Why do we do that?

1652
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:07,120
I think the answer is because in that moment we see we see very clearly defined, a very

1653
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,120
lucid meaning to our actions.

1654
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:13,120
And I think that that's like very, very profound.

1655
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,600
And I think it's the opposite.

1656
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:19,280
I see that as the opposite of suicide, which is, which doesn't mean, I mean, it can happen

1657
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,360
for a lot of reasons, right?

1658
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:24,000
People can be very depressed and, and, you know, the delusions of lack of worth.

1659
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,400
I mean, again, it's very complicated and I'm not trying to trivialize it.

1660
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,360
But I think a lot of what promotes suicide is the absence of meaning, which I see as

1661
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:36,240
the opposite of someone who's taking good care of themselves and maybe wants to stay

1662
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:40,800
alive very much so, but will risk their life to help someone else.

1663
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,880
That's a focus of meaning, that there's a compelling meaning right now.

1664
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,880
Right.

1665
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,680
And a lot of those parents who want to be there for their child would jump in a river

1666
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,680
for someone else, like as they see a child.

1667
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:53,760
So, you know, it's that just capturing of the attention, like this is meaningful.

1668
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,760
Look at this.

1669
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,760
I, this is a chance I will make a difference now.

1670
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Right.

1671
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:58,760
And I'm willing to take a chance to do that.

1672
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:02,360
And I think it's very, very different than how a lot of people feel.

1673
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:05,360
I think also socioeconomic demographics.

1674
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:09,200
I mean, if you think that I don't know what the exact numbers are, but I think that's

1675
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,200
the difference between the two.

1676
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:16,040
I mean, if you think that I don't know what the exact numbers are, but you know what percentage

1677
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,240
of people in this country, you know, I was sort of reading the reports around like a

1678
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,120
$500 unexpected bill, right?

1679
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:26,000
And like, just people can't survive that, right?

1680
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,360
Like they're not going to get medical care.

1681
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:31,320
They're not going to, you know, service the car and then they can't get to work or they're

1682
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:36,200
not going to, you know, they can't live a life that we would consider acceptable, you

1683
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:41,600
know, with an unexpected in the grand scheme of things, otherwise surmountable amount of

1684
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,680
money that's needed.

1685
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:47,840
And you know, I think that's a very, very hard way to live that, that, you know, a lot

1686
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,040
of what we're talking about is Foster Wallace was talking about of like, well, we have so

1687
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,520
much opportunity and we don't have to struggle, right?

1688
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:59,920
But if you are struggling to put food on the table and you know, you know that if somebody

1689
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,180
needs to go to the emergency room, how the hell are you going to get enough food?

1690
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,180
That's a struggle.

1691
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,540
It's very hard to see meaning it.

1692
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,540
It's a struggle that seems like denigration.

1693
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,300
I mean, it's, it's, you're going to struggle.

1694
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:11,300
Whereas it's different.

1695
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:16,560
Our ancestors, if they had to struggle through a famine or drought, I mean, it was just, that

1696
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,420
was just the, that was the gods, right?

1697
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,020
That was nature.

1698
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,380
That was the season and they were in it together.

1699
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:21,700
Right.

1700
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:25,780
And it's not like you were struggling because of the drought, but your neighbor was, you

1701
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:30,260
know, rolling around in a, you know, whatever the equivalent of the Ferrari would be.

1702
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:30,620
Right.

1703
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:35,420
And I think it's so, you know, it's so in a way baffling, right?

1704
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:39,380
That, look, I hate the thought that how many people are there that 500 yard medical

1705
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,880
building, they can't put food on the table.

1706
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,020
You know, yet, you know, I'm fortunate to live in relative plenty compared to that,

1707
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,660
but I don't know how to bridge that gap.

1708
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:52,700
There's not a sense of community and sure, like we can donate and we can do things for

1709
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:57,700
free and all of this, but, but like, we don't have a sense of what does that mean?

1710
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,740
And how do we change that?

1711
01:45:58,740 --> 01:45:59,780
And how do we make that better?

1712
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:02,700
And my sense is that I actually feel quite insecure.

1713
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,780
Do I have enough if my kids need something, right?

1714
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:11,100
Do I have enough if you know, things really go south and it becomes unsafe to live here.

1715
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,740
I have a sense of vulnerability.

1716
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:18,020
What does someone feel like who has the same sense of conscientiousness towards the

1717
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:20,900
people that they love through $500 can sink.

1718
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,860
So I'm not trying to make specific points about that, but really to, to point out

1719
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:30,420
what I view as just a tremendous sense of isolation.

1720
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,460
And it's not a disease of plenty.

1721
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,860
I mean, I think it's a disease that affect people who have enough and that affects

1722
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,580
people who don't have enough, even worse.

1723
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:42,020
And then that, that lack of shared sense of community, a lack of being in it

1724
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:45,700
together, you know, it may sound hokey, but, but through most of life, that's how

1725
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:46,340
people live.

1726
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,780
I mean, unfortunately, Paul, everything you just said, doesn't really seem to

1727
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:53,300
offer a foreseeable remedy to this.

1728
01:46:53,300 --> 01:47:00,100
And if today we're seeing 30% more suicide or thereabouts than we were a

1729
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:05,660
couple of decades ago, is there anything on the horizon that's going to curb that

1730
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:13,780
trend or is suicide going to become an increasingly greater part of our humanity

1731
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:19,260
and, and perhaps worse yet for every person who actually kills themselves.

1732
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:23,500
What if there's nine people who are in that category we described earlier is

1733
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,860
basically functionally dead.

1734
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,300
And then you think of the effect of the suicide.

1735
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,700
What's the trickle down effect of that on the next generation?

1736
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:33,540
I do think that there are ways to make this better.

1737
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:36,260
And I feel strongly and passionately about them.

1738
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:41,780
You and I have talked about some of them and I'm fortunate to have dialogues with

1739
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:45,020
people who can really kind of help make a difference in this way.

1740
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,660
Again, do I know that it's the right way?

1741
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:49,140
No, I don't, but it's the best I can think of.

1742
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:53,420
Which is, you know, it's a simplification, right?

1743
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:59,180
Like we don't have places where people could come together and have shared

1744
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:01,380
experience and have a sense of community.

1745
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:07,620
Like what about places where there are people to facilitate human connection and

1746
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:10,900
education, even about the basics of what's going on inside of people.

1747
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,500
And there's a couple of comfortable couches and a pot of coffee.

1748
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,420
These are not expensive things.

1749
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,860
I mean, you think about it in this country, what things cost.

1750
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,340
Go get an X-ray, $700, right?

1751
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:27,740
I mean, we've built up so much cost around things, so much liability, so much

1752
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:31,420
that prevents really basic, simple things from happening.

1753
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:34,620
And we've lost the basics of community support.

1754
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:39,060
I mean, there was an era before you and I were practicing medicine.

1755
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:41,180
So before I was, before I was a psychiatrist, right?

1756
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:45,140
Where, where there were community support centers and they were publicly funded and

1757
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:48,020
they didn't cost very much money in the grand scheme of things.

1758
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:51,500
And there were places where people who are pretty mentally ill could go for

1759
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:55,180
support. Not only do we not have places like that for you and me and the other

1760
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:59,740
people who are managing to function, we don't even have those places for people

1761
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:00,980
who are really mentally ill.

1762
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:06,620
So we don't provide a nidus in the community for the basics of what I would

1763
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:11,500
call psychoeducation and for the ability to do that in a way that really links

1764
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,980
human beings and looks at what their needs are.

1765
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:20,420
You know, how many times have I seen where a person who, if they overdose or

1766
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:24,780
they slit their wrists, right, that the world will pay a million dollars for

1767
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:26,180
their intensive care unit stay.

1768
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:34,420
But what we will not do is buy them the $300 alternator that could fix the car

1769
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:39,380
that allows them to not have to go back to the abusive household situation that

1770
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:43,380
leads to the suicide attempt that society pays a million dollars for.

1771
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:48,380
Like a lot of what we do is utterly absurd as a society.

1772
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,100
It's not even cost efficient.

1773
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:55,020
If you took out care and concern for human beings and said, look, let's factor

1774
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,620
that out, it's absurd.

1775
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:00,540
You know, it's like, you know, you throw away $10,000 to get a dollar.

1776
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:04,220
And that's how we operate as a society.

1777
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:09,580
And I think that if we're going to survive our own progress, you know, as a

1778
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:13,340
species or certainly in this country, we're going to do things that are around

1779
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,020
mutuality and community support.

1780
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:19,860
And we're going to do things where people who have something can help people who

1781
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:23,340
don't, and maybe that's $300 to buy an alternator.

1782
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:29,260
You know, maybe it's not that maybe it's somebody who doesn't have the education

1783
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:33,740
or resources that you or I might have who share some wisdom that they've learned.

1784
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:38,300
I mean, it's not just, oh, the people who have do things for the people who haven't.

1785
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:40,620
I mean, we all have and we all don't have.

1786
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:46,100
And I'm not trying to trivialize the struggles of people who can't put food on

1787
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:49,540
the table, like that's what we need to work so that that's not the case.

1788
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:51,420
And it's actually not that hard to do.

1789
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:56,780
But at the same time, we need to recognize that the people, that some of the things

1790
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:01,020
that we've done through drive to separate us, make us lonely and isolate us.

1791
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:06,620
And I think you and I have as many emotional needs and as many struggles that

1792
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:12,260
can be soothed by other people as somebody does who might identify as

1793
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,940
underprivileged or ill, right?

1794
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,820
Like I said, we're all in it together.

1795
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:22,340
And but we work so damn hard to separate ourselves and you end up with maybe not

1796
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:25,500
everybody, but most people feeling some sense of loneliness and isolation.

1797
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,380
It's a, there's no easy antidote.

1798
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:35,100
You and I have spoken a lot about the idea of creating a tribe.

1799
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:41,060
We think about the seven of us from medical school and it was like, we had this

1800
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:46,220
fantasy, like what if we all could get jobs, not only in the same city, but like

1801
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:52,660
we could all live on the same block and we could all just sort of be one family.

1802
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:57,220
The kids could go between the homes interchangeably, meals were consumed

1803
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:03,220
interchangeably, like it was just, you know, creating a tribe in the way that it

1804
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,300
would have existed 10,000 years ago.

1805
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:08,860
But you know, we still put our shirts and ties on in the morning and go to work, but

1806
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:14,620
you, but there's this closeness that seems so distant right now.

1807
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:18,100
I mean, you and I are so fortunate because of the geography in which we work

1808
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:23,140
that at least a few times a month we get to have a meal together, but that is

1809
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,740
harder and harder to do with friends.

1810
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,500
And I suspect that there are many people who go months, if not years, without

1811
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,540
really getting to do that because it's just too busy.

1812
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,980
There's just too much to do.

1813
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:36,980
That's mission critical.

1814
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:37,420
Right.

1815
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:42,380
And there again is the automaticity of a value system that, you know, I struggle

1816
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:46,460
very much with how many people do I care about who've been really important in my

1817
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:51,060
life. And I think, and I, and theirs that we exchange two emails a year.

1818
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,140
I mean, why, right?

1819
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:59,940
Why is, why do I not take two weeks every three months and go around and see people

1820
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,540
I care about?

1821
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,740
Like, why don't we do that?

1822
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:06,580
And I think, again, I think I do think that all paths, I mean, even not all paths,

1823
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:11,020
but I think the majority of these paths lead back to trauma, that there's a way in

1824
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,660
which I feel too insecure to do that.

1825
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:18,180
I'll step away from my work and maybe it won't be as good at my work or opportunities

1826
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,300
will pass me by and I'll earn less.

1827
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:25,780
And all these things that actually make no sense whatsoever, but it's not as if I

1828
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:27,420
can stop them from driving me.

1829
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:30,740
And, and, and I want to sound futile about that.

1830
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:34,300
I mean, I think like there are things that we can do, right?

1831
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:39,700
And I think like you and I do some things that we might not have done even a couple of

1832
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,340
years ago, right?

1833
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:41,860
But do I think that we do enough of it?

1834
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,700
No, I don't.

1835
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,700
And you think about those other people that, you know, we were in school with and care

1836
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:51,100
very much about and then think about people who weren't like sort of in that group that

1837
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:54,420
we know well and knew well and care very much about.

1838
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:56,220
How much do we really see of them?

1839
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:56,820
Right.

1840
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,740
Almost nothing.

1841
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:58,180
Right.

1842
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:05,020
And, you know, it's a strange thing to, to have so much automaticity to our value

1843
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:08,820
system and we might think, well, I never decided I don't value that.

1844
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:12,180
And I value, you know, another day of work overseeing those people.

1845
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:12,780
Okay.

1846
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:15,220
I never actually put words to it, but I've decided it right.

1847
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,820
Because I act in accordance with that decision.

1848
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,100
And yes, I'd like to be healthier about those things.

1849
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:27,780
But I think the answer is as a, is as a community that we start teaching ourselves

1850
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:31,300
and teaching people how to be healthier about those things, because you can still

1851
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,380
be very good at what you do.

1852
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:34,500
Very successful, move society ahead.

1853
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:38,460
All these things that we want to do if we achieve and have a better sense of balance

1854
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:43,700
and mutuality, which is why a lot of these fantasies and it's what kids say in kindergarten

1855
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:46,500
to their best friend, like we're going to live next door to one another, right?

1856
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,060
Okay.

1857
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:49,060
We're still saying that in medical school after.

1858
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:52,780
We're fricking 45 year old dudes and we still say the same thing.

1859
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:53,620
Right.

1860
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:58,420
Because I think we still have the same needs within us and we still have the same

1861
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:02,340
fears of loneliness and isolation and struggle in isolation.

1862
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,420
So the fantasy is still there.

1863
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:08,820
I think because there's meaning to the fantasy, it's a recurrent fantasy in a

1864
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:13,100
lot of people that tells us something about our desperate sense of isolation.

1865
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:17,460
And I have no basis to back this up and it probably is politically incorrect to say

1866
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,180
this, but I actually don't give a shit.

1867
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,460
You can be married.

1868
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,980
You can have the perfect spouse.

1869
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,660
You can have all that stuff going on.

1870
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:27,260
But, and I say this only being able to speak from my vantage point, which is as a

1871
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:32,780
male, I think that there are certain needs that can't be met by your spouse.

1872
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:36,540
There are certain needs that like, and again, I think my wife doesn't even like

1873
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:43,260
hearing that like she'd like to believe, understandably, that every problem I have

1874
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,940
emotionally can be rectified by discussing it with her.

1875
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:52,180
But I do think there's something different that I think there's a, maybe even a

1876
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:56,620
degree of vulnerability that exists outside of that relationship and, or maybe

1877
01:55:56,620 --> 01:56:00,700
even there's just something gender specific, like a guy needs to be with a

1878
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:05,740
guy sometimes a girl needs to be with a girl sometimes, as far as like truly

1879
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,740
talking about some of these things.

1880
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:12,220
And I think that for many people as they get older, as they have families, as they

1881
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:16,620
have kids, as they have careers, they lose sight with those other people.

1882
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,820
Meaning the woman loses touch with her female friends who I think can offer her

1883
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:25,700
something that her husband cannot, even if they're the most well-adjusted couple.

1884
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:31,540
And similarly, I mean, I can't tell you the premium I place on the time I get to

1885
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:33,100
spend with my male friends.

1886
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,020
And it's hard because as you said, it often comes at the expense of time with

1887
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:37,620
your family.

1888
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:40,460
I mean, every minute I'm here in New York right now, you and I are here.

1889
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,700
We're not with our families.

1890
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:42,340
Right.

1891
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:45,860
I mean, I think that that is a human problem.

1892
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,980
I mean, I think that we, you know, we can, we see it through our own lens.

1893
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:50,260
Right.

1894
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:55,740
But I don't think it's based upon gender, gender, socioeconomic class, sexual

1895
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:56,420
orientation.

1896
01:56:56,420 --> 01:57:02,420
I mean, I think it's a human problem that there's a fallacy that says that we're

1897
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:07,660
supposed to enter, you know, a committed relationship, which already think about

1898
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:12,020
like there are people who, you know, might not be able to do that, right?

1899
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:13,020
Might not want to do this.

1900
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,460
So we're already saying de facto that that's not okay.

1901
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:18,780
So think how many people were invalidating already.

1902
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:22,860
Then we say, okay, even if you do that, we're going to put so much pressure to be

1903
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:30,820
everything to one another, that, that we guarantee almost a sense of a failure or

1904
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,660
of inadequacy.

1905
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:37,340
Why should your lovely, wonderful wife think that she can be everything?

1906
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:38,300
To you, right?

1907
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:41,940
Like that's just not how humans work, but somehow society has told her that.

1908
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:47,300
And then it engenders some negative feeling because both you and she being

1909
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:52,020
healthy people need a broader set of connections, but we're taught to kind of

1910
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:54,140
hunker down and that's what we're supposed to do.

1911
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:58,620
And then when we're getting away and we're doing these things with our friends,

1912
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:02,740
that there's, there's something about that that seems kind of trivialized because

1913
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:07,500
we don't, we don't live in communities where, and look,

1914
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,060
think about it.

1915
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:08,980
I haven't thought about this before.

1916
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:13,660
We think about in medical school when we were kind of living in a community and

1917
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:18,700
we did spend time, like if we were friends, then I spent time with Jill and

1918
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:19,740
you spent time with Brooke.

1919
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,300
We were in a community.

1920
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:27,820
So there was more of a sense of communality and now we don't have that as

1921
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:30,460
much like that's not the way it's supposed to be in a sense.

1922
01:58:30,860 --> 01:58:35,500
And then it engenders these unrealistic expectations of self and others.

1923
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:39,380
And the question I would most ask about that, I don't know the answer to it.

1924
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:43,140
Why don't we continue to live in a communal way?

1925
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:47,980
And I think that that's some of what, you know, communities offer people, right?

1926
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:51,740
Communities that are based around religion or based around shared interests.

1927
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:54,100
Those can be very, very good things for people.

1928
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,220
Of course, like anything else, the other side of that sword is they can, you know,

1929
01:58:57,220 --> 01:59:00,860
that's, they can be used to create cults and how about like affiliate, right?

1930
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:02,700
And people are desperate to affiliate.

1931
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:08,060
So, you know, I think if there isn't health and balance, then, you know, we see

1932
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:09,340
more the negative side of things.

1933
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,460
We don't have enough community affiliation.

1934
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:15,340
So there are a lot of people who get caught up in cult or cult like things,

1935
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:20,300
you know, more than we would know more than we necessarily know on the surface,

1936
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,180
because there are a lot of things like that that don't get defined as such or

1937
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:25,340
don't get acknowledged as such.

1938
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:30,020
They just don't come to attention, but there's a desperation for connection and

1939
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:33,940
for a multiplicity of connection and a variety of connection.

1940
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:37,220
And we live in a way often that really makes no sense.

1941
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:41,540
There's no reason why should one person be everything to one other person?

1942
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:45,620
You know, life is more complicated and more interesting and richer than that.

1943
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:49,380
Are there any books that you would recommend people read?

1944
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:54,100
I mean, I have my sort of list of go to books that I've suggested to people over

1945
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:58,660
time. I certainly hope that anybody who's listening to this that thinks that some

1946
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:04,420
trauma in their life has continued to sort of yield its grip around their neck.

1947
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:07,620
We'll look into some of these trauma based treatment facilities and ultimately

1948
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:13,100
seek out therapists who themselves are well versed in trauma based therapy.

1949
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:17,500
Again, you don't have to go to an inpatient place to start, but I've since

1950
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:21,420
learned the importance of trying to vet therapists to find out who truly

1951
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:25,540
understands this, but what other resources, whether it be books or

1952
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,740
facilities or anything like, I mean, what,

1953
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:32,060
what kind of things can we, can we leave people with to think about as they begin

1954
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:33,380
to navigate their own path?

1955
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:36,340
I mean, like I said, I suspect there's going to be some people for whom this

1956
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:41,180
episode scratches a scab a little bit, creates a little bit of bleeding.

1957
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:42,500
What do they do now?

1958
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:47,420
I think it's so important to take stock of one's inner dialogue.

1959
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:51,540
We can say things to ourselves hundreds and hundreds and thousands of times over

1960
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:54,180
and never stop and reflect that we're saying it to ourselves.

1961
02:00:54,500 --> 02:01:00,220
So I think thinking about what's going on inside of us and talking to people that

1962
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,020
are close to us.

1963
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:06,460
I mean, most people have people that they can talk to more openly than they're

1964
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:09,700
talking to, and that can be complemented with professionals.

1965
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:13,940
I mean, I think anyone who has no problems or issues whatsoever should never have

1966
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,420
psychotherapy, right?

1967
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:19,460
Which is, you know, my way of trying to be clever and saying every damn human on

1968
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,460
the planet should have psychotherapy, right?

1969
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:24,900
Because it's a way of understanding ourselves better.

1970
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:30,740
It's a way of being able to commune with someone without feeling the pressure that

1971
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:33,580
we're burdening them, like, you know, personal and professional relationships

1972
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:35,060
help us understand each other better.

1973
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:40,100
Go to a 12 step meeting, helps a person understand oneself better, even for no

1974
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,380
other reason by the feeling of shared humanity.

1975
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:47,500
Some of those things, which may sound kind of basic, I think are just of inordinate

1976
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:52,140
importance, an ordinate importance of take stock of what's inside of you, connect

1977
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,180
with people around you.

1978
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:57,540
That may sound trite, but most of us are not doing it or not doing nearly enough of

1979
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:57,780
it.

1980
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:04,140
And in terms of literature or books, I mean, I, I tend to have very, very few book

1981
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:05,100
recommendations.

1982
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:09,300
I'll say a couple of the standards that I say when people ask me, I would consider

1983
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:11,540
reading the K-Muse, the plague.

1984
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,620
You know, the plague is about a city that is afflicted by the plague, but it is also

1985
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:21,460
about the afflictions of all of us that are we all living amidst the plague and are we

1986
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:25,060
all living amidst threat to our life and health and safety?

1987
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:26,100
Yes, we are.

1988
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:34,500
And, and I think it is, it's a way of potentially thinking about and framing things

1989
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:39,580
inside of us, this feeling often of being beset upon and needing a sense of community

1990
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:42,260
and a sense of mutuality that we often don't acknowledge.

1991
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:45,540
And I think for that reason, the book is of tremendous value.

1992
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:50,620
Somewhat of a very different recommendation is read some short stories by Katherine

1993
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:51,300
Mansfield.

1994
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:58,020
I think that, yes, Chekhov was a wonderful, brilliant short story writer, but my

1995
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:04,900
favorite in terms of evoking the realness of being human, the subtle nuances of human

1996
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:07,980
interaction, I think is actually best evoked by Mansfield.

1997
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:15,220
And I think if we're searching for a way of identifying with our own humanity, I think

1998
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,660
those two authors can help us get there.

1999
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:24,420
So it's not the most typical literature to recommend, but I think exploring things that

2000
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:30,300
great writers have written that help elucidate our humanity is a good thing if one is trying

2001
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:35,380
to gain a greater grasp on what's going on inside of us and what may be really driving

2002
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,740
us to misery.

2003
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:41,500
And I think those things engender compassion and compassion for self is what can

2004
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:45,100
ultimately lead somebody to take that step of getting help.

2005
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:45,620
Right.

2006
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:49,740
Is we have to feel like, hey, there's something going on inside of me that I've been

2007
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:53,380
hiding and that I feel really ashamed of that I don't want to feel ashamed of anymore.

2008
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:54,540
And I don't want to hide anymore.

2009
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:58,540
And in general, people won't take that step unless they've engendered some

2010
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,140
compassion for themselves.

2011
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:04,060
Paul, there are so many other things I want to talk about.

2012
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:08,300
I'm looking at my little notepad here where I had just scribbled down other things to

2013
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,260
talk about that.

2014
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:14,940
Amazingly, we literally did not get through half of what I wanted to talk about.

2015
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:20,060
We didn't get into, you know, the real understanding of distress tolerance, the

2016
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:25,020
completely nuanced geeky discussions that we have over dinner about all of the

2017
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:29,900
different pharmacokinetics of every class of drug and every neurotransmitter.

2018
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:33,780
I think the only real remedy for this is we have to do this again.

2019
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:39,340
So I think there needs to be a part two of this discussion where we can get into all

2020
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:40,380
of these other things.

2021
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:44,740
And perhaps between now and then I could try and become less annoyingly long winded.

2022
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:46,020
No, no, no, no, no.

2023
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:48,100
No, I'll work on that before our next one.

2024
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:52,180
Despite the short tenure of this podcast, I've already been given feedback by a few

2025
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:56,300
friends who have said, Peter, we are really loving your podcast, but can you

2026
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:59,860
shorten it? I would really like to just have a 30 minute podcast.

2027
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:04,220
And I've said, honestly, I appreciate your feedback, but that's not what I'm trying

2028
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:04,860
to do here.

2029
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:09,500
One is I want these conversations to be the conversations that we have.

2030
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:14,580
And what we just discussed tonight, the only thing that separates it from a normal

2031
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:18,460
discussion is we have these microphones in front of us and we're not eating a meal.

2032
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:23,220
Right. It is very similar to conversation you and I had three weeks ago while we were

2033
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:25,940
sitting around the same table eating really good Indian food.

2034
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:29,380
Right. Now, the fact that I'm in the middle of a one week fast makes that image

2035
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:31,260
particularly distressing to me right now.

2036
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:35,460
I don't appreciate that, but I just see part of how I keep myself in business is by

2037
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,220
causing trauma.

2038
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:40,340
Yeah, you just you just cost a shit ton of trauma in me by reminding me of that

2039
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:45,780
incredible lamb vindaloo that I was eating sitting right where you're sitting now.

2040
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:49,780
And I'm not going to have any of it tonight because I'm going to I want you to go home

2041
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:50,540
and have something.

2042
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:51,820
I'm going to.

2043
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:57,300
Well, Paul, I can't thank you enough for all of the insights you've brought to all of

2044
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:03,980
these topics from depression, suicide, trauma, shame, all of these things that are, I

2045
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:07,620
think, near and dear to our hearts, but more importantly, kind of near and dear to the

2046
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:09,740
hearts of pretty much everyone who's listening.

2047
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:12,580
I know I said there's a lot more I'd like to get into.

2048
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:17,500
I think we should certainly plan to sit down again and talk more about this stuff.

2049
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:22,860
I I believe that there's a lot here that that people can take with them and hopefully at

2050
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:26,460
least take some steps that that kind of improve the quality of their lives.

2051
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:29,060
I've said it before, I will continue to say it.

2052
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:36,580
I don't think it makes much sense to fixate on living longer if you can't on some level

2053
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:38,780
rectify being happier.

2054
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:43,540
And that seems to be, you know, if we talk about diabetes and all these other things

2055
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:48,060
being diseases of civilization, there may be no greater disease of civilization than

2056
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,060
our unhappiness.

2057
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:54,220
Yeah, it's probably a good time for me to say, you know, what I truly believe, which is

2058
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:57,060
I'm honored that you have had me on here.

2059
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:01,620
And I really do mean that I do think that the things that I have to say from the mental

2060
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:06,580
health perspective, not because I'm saying them, but because mental health undergirds

2061
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:10,020
our ability to live good lives are so important.

2062
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:17,060
And I think it's a testament to, you know, your sort of relentless drive to understand

2063
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:20,580
things better that make a difference to the lives of the people that you take care of

2064
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:25,700
that has you looking at elements of the substructure that people often ignore.

2065
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:32,180
So I consider it an honor and a privilege to be on your podcast and to be able to talk

2066
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:37,220
about things that I think are really are so important and that are just so often overlooked.

2067
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:43,220
So I thank you for the opportunity to get the word out in a way that I hope ultimately

2068
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:43,900
help some people.

2069
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:44,540
Thank you.

2070
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:46,700
Paul, I have no doubt that it will.

2071
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:49,140
