00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,720
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,080
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr.

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,000
Raj Atariwalla. Raj is an amazing guy. I've known him for several years. He's incredibly well

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,280
trained. He first actually went down the engineering pathway doing his PhD in biomedical

48
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,640
engineering at Northwestern, then decided he wanted to go into medicine and apply his engineering

49
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,920
approach to that. So he went back to medical school, did his residency in radiology, and then

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,640
went on to specialize in nuclear medicine and spent a great deal of time at some of the top

51
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,720
institutions in North America, Memorial Sloan Kettering, UCLA, USC, et cetera. He's now back in

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,920
Vancouver, and what he's been up to for about the past decade has been effectively creating a new

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:58,120
way of doing MRI. So he's sort of what I think can only be described as an MRI ninja. And that is to

54
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,520
say he's been able to tinker with the hardware and the software to create a completely revolutionary

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,160
product and process by which to look at the body using this technology of magnetic resonance. Now,

56
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,200
I think this is a bit of a technical episode, but I also think it's one that anybody who's

57
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,640
ever had an X-ray, a CT scan, an ultrasound, an MR in their life needs to listen to. Why? Because

58
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,760
truthfully, most doctors don't actually understand this stuff in great detail. You have to really go

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,600
out of your way in medical school and residency to understand radiology. I was obsessed with it.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
I went out of my way to learn about it. I learned a little bit about it, but obviously nothing to

61
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,840
the level of what someone like Raj knows. And so what we did in this episode, which you can sort of

62
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,880
divide into two halves is as follows. The first half is sort of a history of radiology. So we start

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,920
with talking about what an X-ray is, how it works, what the radiation does and doesn't mean, CT scans,

64
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,280
ultrasounds, PET scans, nuclear medicine scans, all of these things. And I promise we've done this

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,520
in a way that is really geared towards the patient. I think we do a pretty good job of always bringing

66
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,720
it back to language that makes sense and we don't get terribly lost in the physics. And of all areas

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,600
in medicine where you can get lost in the physics, this is head and shoulders above the rest. Second

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:20,520
half of this episode, we really do this deep dive into cancer screening and this particular type of

69
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,400
MRI technology that Raj has almost single-handedly developed, although he would probably bristle at

70
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,600
the sound of me saying that because he's just such a modest fellow. What I enjoy about this episode

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,800
is it gives me a little bit of a chance to talk about cancer screening. This is something I'm

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,200
incredibly passionate about and it's something I love talking about with my patients. The show notes

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,880
for this are going to be important because one, radiology is obviously a very visual field. You

74
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,200
see things and much more than you sort of hear things. So we're going to do a great job to pair

75
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,400
a lot of what we discuss with images, especially once we get into the confusing MRI stuff and we

76
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,040
try to explain the difference between a T1-weighted image and a T2-weighted image and a diffusion-weighted

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,960
image and things like that. The second thing is we're going to link to some of the material that

78
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,400
we use with our patients on cancer screening because I know this is a very controversial topic

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,200
and I suspect that this episode is going to generate just a lot of controversy. But I want to

80
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,160
be clear that cancer screening is a very personal decision and it comes with risks. And the biggest

81
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,720
risk of course is a false positive, which then leads to subsequent screening, emotional distress,

82
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,160
potential harm. We talk about all of this stuff and as I said, we'll link to some of the materials

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,200
that we've prepared specifically for our patients that I think just create a nice primer for how to

84
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,040
go through that. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Raj Atariwala.

85
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,320
Hey, Raj, thanks for carving some time out today in the middle of your busy day. I've

86
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,080
probably done what no one else has done before, which is shut down this clinic, huh?

87
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,000
No, it's fantastic to see you again and to be here. It's a pleasure as always.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,040
What's the deal with Vancouver and Uber? I got off the plane this morning and tried to

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,000
get an Uber to come here and apparently there's no Uber in Vancouver.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,800
It's stunning. Everybody complains. We all complain, but I don't know, somebody somewhere

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,360
not allowing it. It was amazing. I was in India and you can get Uber in India.

92
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah. And it's not a Canadian thing because I Uber'd in Toronto.

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,280
Toronto, Calgary, almost all the country, just Vancouver.

94
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Very well. I'll reserve my editorial comments for myself. Well, I've been looking forward to this

95
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,360
for a long time, Raj. We've known each other for about four years. I think we were introduced

96
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,240
through a mutual acquaintance who's a good friend of mine and has become very interested in your

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,600
technology. And I'm not sure even sure if you remember the context, but the context was

98
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,960
basically this person reaching out to me to say, hey, there's this really fancy MRI scanner up in

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:03,880
Vancouver. Can you go check it out for me? And at the time I was focusing a lot on different

100
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,720
technologies that might be able to aid in the detection of atherosclerosis. And he may have

101
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,120
misunderstood what I was interested in, but it was sort of pitched to me through that lens.

102
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,240
You and I hopped on a call. I still remember where I was sitting actually in my office at the time.

103
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,200
It was probably, yeah, it was in January. By the end of that call, I was really interested. And

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,960
you said, look, I mean, I think you should just come up to Vancouver, get scanned and let's spend

105
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,840
a day discussing it. And the rest is history. So, you know, what I wanted to do today was obviously

106
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,360
talk a lot about AIM, which is the, well, I guess it's the name, is that the name of the company?

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Yeah. So actually what I did is I actually set up AIM as a private MRI company and we basically put

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,240
in the MRI machine so I could play with it. That's one of the problems of being an engineer.

109
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,560
And so AIM is the name of the scanning company, the clinic, but we've actually now kind of moved

110
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,360
it into Prinuvo. And what Prinuvo is about is actually to basically sort of put the power of

111
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,000
preventative medicine into patients' hands. Yeah. Well, we'll talk a heck of a lot about this,

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,520
but let's talk a little bit about your background. Because that was one of the things that right off

113
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,960
the bat made me realize that this was going to be an interesting discussion. I, even in medical

114
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,880
school, just took a huge interest in radiology. I never thought for a moment I would become a

115
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,160
radiologist, but I knew that whatever type of medicine you practice, you have a choice,

116
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,360
which is basically you can just be confused and intimidated by all of these scans that your

117
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,680
patients get, or you can at least try to understand them and have some hope of appreciating the risks

118
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,680
of them, the benefits of them, the subtleties, et cetera. So when I did my radiology rotation,

119
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,560
I was probably the most eager student who wasn't going into radiology. And I remember,

120
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,280
and I still have my notes, but I took, I mean, maybe 50 pages of notes, drawing coils and all

121
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,120
sorts of things. So let's start at the beginning. You have a background in engineering, which a lot

122
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,000
of radiologists seem to have, right? It's actually common in radiology. It's like, basically, there's

123
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,720
a lot of technology in radiology. And so as a result, it attracts those of us who actually are

124
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,280
technophiles. And so my background, actually, I started out in chemical engineering. And then

125
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,320
during that period of time, kind of realized that I actually kind of liked the body and physiology

126
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,040
and how that works. And as a result, I then went into biomedical engineering, where I did my master's

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,560
in PhD in biomedical engineering in Northwestern. During that period of time, I was actually working

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,560
on fluid mechanics. We're actually looking at blood flow and hemodynamics and all sorts of

129
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,840
complicated things. And we also actually did what engineers do. We actually had all these

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,880
manual systems that we're using to measure blood flow and blood pressure. And we decided, okay,

131
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,760
let's build a robot to do it instead. So we did. And this robot that we actually built allowed us

132
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,760
to do keyhole surgery in the eye that wound up attracting a lot of attention from physicians,

133
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,760
from top tier universities all over the United States, from Mass General everywhere. And as

134
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,560
engineers, the attitude was we can build anything you want, what do you want? A lot of times,

135
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,720
physicians can never answer that. I was working with a lot of these top tier guys, like editor in

136
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,160
chief of the different medical journals and ophthalmology. And it was like they were speaking

137
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,040
a different language, and I just didn't understand what they were talking about. And so I actually

138
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,520
kind of decided, okay, well, let me apply to medical school and see what happens. So I can

139
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,920
actually kind of learn this language and kind of learn more about medicine. And so I applied and

140
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,240
then I actually kind of got accepted. And I was like, Hmm, do I want to do this? It's like, I'm

141
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,920
really an engineer and was born an engineer. So my PhD advisors famous last words were that the

142
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,680
engineering world will always take you back. So I went off to medical school and actually hated

143
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,000
every minute of it. It was kind of like, I need to know more. I'm one of those kids who's kind of

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,280
like why, why, why, why, why? How does this work? Explain this to me, I don't get it. And realize

145
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,480
that there's a lot of things in the body and physiology and pathophysiology that we just

146
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,520
don't understand. Despite the massive amount of literature that's out there in the medical world,

147
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,440
you really couldn't find a lot of the answers of why things go wrong and how they go wrong.

148
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,640
So then I'd wind up sort of exploring, okay, how do we advance understanding of what's going on

149
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,400
in the body? Like the simple aging process, what happens? Why does everything change? Why?

150
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,040
People can answer it. Instead, it was like, okay, memorizes list of changes. I'm like, okay,

151
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,360
great. Let me try and remember all that. And what I would actually start to boil down to is that

152
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,080
I would actually go back to my engineering pathophysiology texts and I actually read them

153
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,720
and talk to the PhD guys. And they would actually sort of give me the theories on what they thought

154
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,120
was happening. And when you actually got that theory, it was almost like planting a seed,

155
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,920
then you actually kind of understood how the entire tree would look. And that's when I said,

156
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,560
okay, maybe this is good, but I still need my technology. Where is technology going? We worked

157
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,440
on some of the very first surgical robotic machines ever built. My colleagues presented the

158
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,920
first teller robotics telepresence conference ever held in United States. At the same time,

159
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,200
the group that made the DaVinci was there. I kind of looked and said, there's not a lot of space for

160
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,240
robotics because people don't want machines operating on them as a former surgeon. I'm sure

161
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,440
you probably feel the same way. You don't want a machine operating on you unless it's going to be

162
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,160
better. So that's when I decided, okay, the technology that people understand, doctors

163
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
understand is a picture and that picture is radiology. And that's really where all the

164
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,960
technology is. And so I actually started in an area called nuclear medicine, which is a sort of

165
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,000
a small specialty within radiology, which is where you're actually looking at functional imaging,

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,160
how things work, how do things change, what happens over time, and really enjoy that area

167
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,400
because it was sort of showing you what's happening when things are normal. And then when things

168
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,880
become abnormal. And it was actually one of these other amazing fields that in medicine, there's a

169
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,040
lot of shades of gray. Whereas in nuclear medicine, it's almost black and white, it's there or it's

170
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,520
not. It's one of these very few areas where you actually get a binary choice of what's happening.

171
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,920
Is there a problem? Yes or no, as opposed to, well, there might be. So that's actually what I like to

172
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,080
about it. But then I also kind of realized that radiology is basically very much like anatomy,

173
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,160
you actually see what's going on, you actually see the changes and you see the shapes of things.

174
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,840
And you use that very much as a blueprint for a building to actually kind of see what it does.

175
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,400
Whereas nuclear medicine is kind of, instead of the blueprint, you actually kind of know there's

176
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,680
all these people carrying letters moving in and out of this building, we don't really know the

177
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,720
detail of where the building walls are. But we know that there must be something happening there. And

178
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,960
hey, when you put the radiology with the architecture together of the blueprint of the

179
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,280
building, then you combine that with the people going in and out of it, you realize it's the post

180
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,080
office. And you realize that these are postal workers carrying things. And here's the geometry

181
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,280
of the building. So that power really is actually quite useful. And the fact that it's really that

182
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,840
there's this famous equation when people actually realized to put functional imaging or nuclear

183
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,520
medicine imaging together, the first device that did that was positron emission tomography and CT

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,880
or PET CT. And the famous equation is that one plus one equals three. These two separate modalities

185
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,440
of functional imaging and anatomic imaging come together to actually make something better than

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,320
each part individually. And so that's what really attracted me to the whole field, just because you

187
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,400
could see what's going on. And you can actually see the power of what's happening. That was certainly

188
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,320
one of the more powerful lessons I remember as a medical student when I went sort of headlong into

189
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,320
radiology, which was what I really liked about this rotation. I remember, I wish I could remember

190
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,920
the names of the residents, but they took me under their wing, even though they knew I wasn't going

191
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,520
to be a radiologist. And as you know, from being in medical school, that's a little unusual. Typically

192
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,240
the residents tend to gravitate to the students that are going to follow in their footsteps. But

193
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,400
I think they saw in me a genuine curiosity and they thought, well, look, the smarter we can make

194
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,240
this surgeon, the better down the line for us radiologists. And so I remember them taking me

195
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,560
aside and saying, look, Peter, anytime you order a test in the back of your mind, you have to be

196
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,920
asking yourself, do you want anatomical information or functional information or both? And the example

197
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,160
you gave is a great one. And in the show notes for this podcast, we'll link to tons of pictures so

198
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,120
that people understand what is meant by anatomic imaging. And the way I would explain this to a

199
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,760
person is an anatomic image has nice sharp edges. It looks like what it is you're trying to take a

200
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,440
picture of. So the anatomic image of the brain shows all of the substructures. And when the

201
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:28,120
radiologist looks at it, he or she can make out every little blip and bend and crevice inside of

202
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,040
the brain. And they can comment on different structures while there's a tumor here or there's

203
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,680
a blood vessel that's slightly dilated there. If you contrast that with the PET scan, as you pointed

204
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,240
out, that's looking at a function of the brain, which is how much glucose does it uptake? And

205
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,280
instead it lights up darker, the more glucose that's being taken there. And that's so your

206
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,360
neural analogy, the CT scan is showing the architecture of the post office. But the PET

207
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,120
scan is showing you the distribution of people moving into different areas of it. And by putting

208
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,360
it together, that gives you a really powerful picture. Exactly. And that's actually exactly

209
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,640
how it works. And you know, one of the things that might be useful as well is if we kind of look at

210
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,040
the different sort of techniques that are used between nuclear medicine and radiology. We all

211
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,400
know that imaging started with the simple x-ray, but that was actually groundbreaking for the field

212
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,400
of medicine. Well, let's start with that. So everybody has seen an x-ray and I think most people,

213
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,400
if they can close their eyes and picture it now or look at an image, kind of know directionally

214
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:34,600
that an x-ray is nothing more than a series of contrasts going from black to white and everything

215
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,680
in between. So at the highest level, how do we take an x-ray? What are we doing with those little

216
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,760
electrons going through someone? How does it produce that image? For sure. And it's quite

217
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,440
amazing actually how it was discovered by runt. And effectively what it is is we're taking these

218
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,040
high energy wavelength and it actually penetrates right through the body. And anywhere where there's

219
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,080
something dense, very hard like bone, the x-ray beam can't make it through. We've all sort of

220
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,920
taken like a flashlight and sort of shown it through our finger and we can actually see the

221
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,480
red light coming through. Well, effectively that's what an x-ray is. We're just taking higher energy

222
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,360
wavelength that we can't see with our eyes. And it's actually allowing the areas where there's

223
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,440
things like air or soft tissues, the x-ray penetrates right through it and goes right through,

224
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,520
shines through. Whereas in place of where there's bones, the x-rays can't make it through. So they

225
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,680
actually get left behind. And that's what gives us like the white pictures of the bone because

226
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,040
the film that's exposed on the other side, soft tissues, the x-rays have gone through,

227
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,440
they turn it from white to black. Whereas in bones, the x-ray doesn't make it through because

228
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,680
it gets left behind in the person. And therefore on the film on the other side, it stays white.

229
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,960
And back in the days of Rankin, did they appreciate the damage of ionizing radiation or

230
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,240
were there a number of casualties along the way from people being far too exposed to this type

231
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,160
of energy? Unfortunately, there were lots of casualties and actually our understanding of

232
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,400
radiation has actually been moved by really traumatic events such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki

233
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,760
and things like that where there's been real radiation damage. And we've actually been able

234
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,440
to watch people over time. And recently in the past 10 to 15 years in imaging, we've actually

235
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,440
realized the danger of this high powered ionizing radiation and how it can damage cells. And when

236
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,720
the DNA of the cells get damaged, there's a risk of inducing cancers with that. And so we're actually

237
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,240
starting to understand that more and more. And we're actually starting to see that a lot of

238
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,280
patients, individuals are like, look, I know about the potential damaging effects of x-ray radiation.

239
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,720
Therefore, I don't want a lot of x-rays CT type of scans. Now, the way I generally talk about this

240
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,120
with my patients, I have a graph that I show them that on the x-axis lists a number of different

241
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,240
technologies. So a chest x-ray, an abdominal x-ray, a mammogram, and they're generally in

242
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,480
increasing amounts of radiation. So at the top end of that spectrum, you'd have a whole body

243
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,640
PET CT just for if you want it to go as ionizing as possible. And then the y-axis, I use these units

244
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,360
called millisieverts. Can you explain what a millisievert is? Exactly. So a millisievert is

245
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,080
actually the unit of measurement of radiation. And it's actually set by the standards group

246
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,160
System International in France, that actually sets what a standard dose of radiation is. And now it's

247
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,400
actually important that a lot of people really don't understand radiation. There's good radiation,

248
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,920
there's bad radiation, but radiation is anytime you actually have any ion that's actually releasing

249
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,120
a component of its energy, that energy has to get deposited somewhere. It actually comes off as a

250
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:34,520
photon of energy that has to by, I guess, energy effects go from it's never created, it's never

251
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,080
destroyed, but is actually transferred. And so that energy, if it doesn't go through you, it's

252
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,600
actually going to deposit in you. And if it actually deposits in you, that's where it can

253
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,560
actually cause the damage. And now when we look at all the different types of imaging, as you talked

254
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,360
about on one end, you have the mammogram, which actually has a very low amount of radiation in

255
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,520
millisieverts, it's usually about 0.05, which is quite negligible. Whereas on the other end of the

256
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,520
scale, you'll have the PET CT. And now the PET CT basically couples the radiation from the CT.

257
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,840
And the CT scanner is basically a powerful x-ray that's spinning around the body and creating a

258
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,880
three dimensional view of you, combined with the PET, which is the positron emission tomography,

259
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,640
where you're taking radioactive glucose, and you're actually labeling with fluorine. And that fluorine

260
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,920
is a radioactive fluorine 18, which actually now gives off a positron. And that positron has

261
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,160
tremendous amount of energy, it's the highest energy that you can actually have in imaging

262
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,680
for radiation, and that's 511 kilo electron volts, so very, very high. And so when you combine those

263
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,040
two together, you wind up getting typically, when we actually give somebody radioactive glucose for

264
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:47,000
a whole body scan for let's say they have cancer, it's roughly one millisievert per megabecro, but I

265
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,320
am trying to convert the Canadian. Oh, that's okay. We've got an international

266
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,560
audience here. You don't have to make it Americanized. So we do it in megabeckerels up here

267
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,240
in Canada. And so it's typically about 35 megabeckerels per millisievert. So typically,

268
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,800
somebody will actually get the US dose would be about 12 millimoles. And so that's about the 12

269
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,160
millisieverts of radiation, in addition to what they get on the CT scan. So they could easily get

270
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,920
30, 40 millisieverts in total in that scan if they were doing chest, abdomen, pelvis, for example.

271
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,840
It's possible. Yeah. And a lot of that radiation would come from the CT, whereas with nuclear

272
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,800
medicine, what we typically do, since we're actually going to inject somebody with the

273
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,440
radioactive material, as a result, we've exposed them to that radiation to all parts of the body.

274
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,680
So as a result, as it circulates through their entire body, we want to take pictures of everything

275
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,640
from head to foot. Because if we're going to give somebody radiation, we want to maximize the amount

276
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,920
of data we're going to extract from that exposure. Now, I don't know in Canada what the number is,

277
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,080
but in the United States, the NRC recommends that no one receive more than 50 millisieverts in a year.

278
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,200
But of course, not all of that can be assigned to radiography because living at sea level exposes

279
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,480
you to what, two millisieverts a year, maybe three. I mean, I think even if you live at elevation,

280
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,560
people in Denver are getting probably six or seven millisieverts a year at background. I'm

281
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,920
probably a bit off on that. It might be a bit less. That's right. Yep. So the higher you go,

282
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,520
actually get more cosmic radiation. And then as well, certain geographies will actually have radon,

283
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,720
which is another exposure to the millisieverts. And as well, when you actually travel, when you

284
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,640
actually go up in altitude in planes, we actually get a lot more radiation exposure. So that's why

285
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,840
pilots, for example, they actually, when they wear glasses, they actually have to block the UV

286
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,680
radiation, the UVA, UVB, and also the X-ray radiation, which is much more prevalent at higher altitude.

287
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,000
The route matters. I know I've calculated this for myself, doing a lot of east-west coast travel,

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,160
fortunately, not very much exposure. I believe it's less than 0.1 millisievert per round trip.

289
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,000
But if you do LA over the pole, right, all of a sudden it goes up by, again, I don't want to

290
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,120
misquote it because we have the data, so I could just post it. But it goes up by a non-linear

291
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,880
amount. It's much more radiation when you cross the north pole than just the extra distance you

292
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,000
travel. Exactly. And that's because of the ozone. The less ozone you have at the poles, the more

293
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,160
exposure you're going to get because the ozone actually absorbs the radiation. So there's

294
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
actually a calculator available online for people to actually determine how much radiation they're

295
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,480
getting from exposure. And it's actually required that pilots and flight attendants calculate their

296
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,840
dose. We'll make sure we find that and link to that. I just, because the NRC says 50 is the limit,

297
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,360
I've never really thought of that as we should go up to 50. I've thought of that as they probably

298
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,320
have some reason to believe that successive years with exposure to 50 millisieverts is not a good

299
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,200
idea. Do we have a sense of what the implication of that is in terms of normal physiology?

300
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,360
We do and we don't. And actually, a lot of the time our understanding of that really comes from,

301
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,760
like I said, the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other people like in the

302
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,960
Fuji reactor who actually got exposed. And that's where understanding of the damage comes from.

303
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,560
Now, there's actually a landmark paper out of Columbia that actually looked at the amount of

304
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,880
radiation that people actually received from CT scanners. And it actually forced radiologies

305
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,680
of field to actually look at the potential damaging effect of X-ray radiation. And what

306
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,320
they actually kind of found is that the younger you are, the greater the risk of cancer induction

307
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,200
from CT scanners, which is why in the pediatric world, we actually try and really minimize the

308
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,080
amount of dose that children in particular are getting. And the sex as well matters. So females

309
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,120
are actually more sensitive to radiation than men. Meaning if you took a 20 year old male and

310
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,080
a 20 year old female, so both in their reproductive prime, are you saying that the ovaries of the

311
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:46,680
woman are more sensitive to DNA damage in the egg than the sperm are in the testes of the male?

312
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,840
Exactly. I didn't know that. Why is that? And that actually has to do with the fact that the egg

313
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,520
was actually produced during embryonic stage. And as a result, that DNA is effectively frozen in

314
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,200
time. And so as women are getting older and older, they're releasing these DNA in the eggs.

315
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,360
So therefore the younger you are, the fresher the DNA, whereas when they're prime sort of around 12,

316
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,080
which is when this DNA comes out of the, I guess, frozen state during the beginning of menstruation,

317
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,840
that's when these eggs start to be released. So actually 12 is sort of the worst time for females.

318
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,600
Which is really sad because of course, anybody who spent time in a hospital knows that there

319
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,320
are invariably kids that need to undergo radiographic studies. They only need to spend

320
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,640
a few days in a cancer ward to realize all these poor children that are right at that age and they're

321
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,080
being exposed to it. And unfortunately there's not much of a choice. And trauma is another area where

322
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,240
the child comes in having sustained a bad injury in a car accident. You go out of your way to use

323
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,680
ultrasound whenever possible, but invariably sometimes patients do require X-ray, NCT,

324
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,760
radiographic studies. So let's go back to the X-ray because I like where you started there

325
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,480
historically. And then you alluded to the fact that basically if you understand how an X-ray works,

326
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,080
if you truly understand what's happening, then you understand what a CT scan is doing because

327
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,000
it's just doing it in three dimensions spirally. So the other thing about X-ray that I think is

328
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,360
very interesting for anyone who spends time looking at it just to appreciate it, even though

329
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,600
it seems so simple, is nothing in the body is two-dimensional. So you talked about how this

330
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,160
photon is going through the body and if it hits a rib, well that's going to show up as white,

331
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,800
whereas if it's passing through the lung between the ribs, it's going to show up as black. But of

332
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,960
course you could hit a rib on the front but not on the back. You can hit a rib on the back and not

333
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,280
on the front. You can hit the sternum. So when you look at an X-ray, even to this day, I'm still

334
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:45,880
constantly amazed at what the collage looks like of overlapping layers of tissue. And I mean, I just

335
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,360
don't think I ever got good at reading X-rays. It was actually easier for me to, I think because we

336
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,840
just spent more time reading CT scans and there's so much more anatomic detail. But when I look at

337
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,400
these old-time radiologists look at X-rays and the stuff that they could pull out of it, I was

338
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,120
blown away. Exactly. It's true. It's an amazing skill to actually be able to pull that 3D

339
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,240
information out of a 2D picture. And if we actually kind of think about it, our brain is designed to

340
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,240
always imagine in 3D, always think in 3D. Even if actually somebody lost an eye, they can still see

341
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,720
in 3D. And that actually has to do with the fact that that's how our brain was wired or I was wired.

342
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,320
And so the amount of information in X-ray is phenomenal. But the biggest problem is that

343
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,480
sometimes you're actually overlapping different things and you just can't see. So quite often,

344
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,080
the reason we do two X-rays, when you do a chest X-ray, you do a frontal PA as well as a lateral,

345
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,880
is so you can actually try and mimic those two together to become a three-dimensional object.

346
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,920
And so when CT came around, that's when it actually really allowed us to look at things in 3D. And

347
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,040
that's where surgeons and everybody else who actually operates and deals with people in 3D,

348
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,800
they can actually start to look at these and actually start to imagine what they're going to

349
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,680
be operating on. They actually kind of get the power of where the 3D image comes in. And so a

350
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,000
simple way to think about an X-ray, as I try to tell people, it's almost like an X-ray is based

351
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,800
like a flash. Take a single flash and you get a picture. Whereas a CT scan is really like a

352
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,960
searchlight in a boat kind of going around an island, you actually get all the images the whole

353
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,680
way around. And then the equipment, what it does, it actually sort of sees how the intensity passes

354
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,480
through, let's say two panes of glass and comes out the other side. And then you can actually start

355
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,760
to evaluate what's going on inside that entire building. The police officers use this all the

356
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,440
time when they actually need to stake out a building or a site, they actually use it to

357
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,160
determine where the occupants are. And that's exactly what an X-ray does. It's triangulation

358
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,040
effectively by spinning around in multiple different cycles by going around 360 degrees.

359
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,160
So we should clarify our semantics for people. We use the term CT very loosely, but it stands for

360
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,960
Commuted Tomography. And sometimes people back in the illness used to refer to it as CAT scan or

361
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,160
CAT and the A was for axial, of course, because it's going up and down the axial dimension of

362
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,920
the person. When was the first CT scan put into clinical practice? I mean, would it have been in

363
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,320
the early eighties or something like that or earlier? Earlier than that, it was actually EMI,

364
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,600
the phonographic company that actually built the very first CT or CAT scanner. And I believe it was

365
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,080
in the seventies or even earlier. It's actually been around for quite a while. Realistically,

366
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,120
that three-dimensional image really revolutionized medicine, as did all imaging. And the other thing

367
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,520
that people will often hear about, and I guess maybe patients don't hear about it as often,

368
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,800
but it certainly gets touted to them as a feature, is they talk about the speed of these things. They

369
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,160
say this is this many bits or that many bits. And presumably the first one was a four bit.

370
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,280
I think it was actually even less than that. It might have been two bit and actually just took a

371
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,000
long time to go around. And it was actually first used in the brain. So let's explain what that

372
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,680
means. So two bit means you really only have two flashlights. Exactly. Or one flashlight, one detector.

373
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,920
Exactly. Yeah. It'll be easier, I think, when people look at pictures and we'll make this clear. But

374
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,640
you have this cylinder that goes around the patient who's laying down. And there's one place

375
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,680
where you shine the ionizing radiation and on the backside of the cylinder is where you read it.

376
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,760
And then that thing has to rotate. So it's moving in its rotational plane, but also moving up and

377
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,480
down the Z plane in time. Correct? Right. This makes so much more sense when I can use my hands,

378
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,600
by the way. And so it's exactly like that. Basically, 180 degrees apart, you have the x-ray

379
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,920
and the detector. And then it actually starts to spin around in rapid revolution. So when you

380
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,440
actually look at a machine, there's the donut hole in the middle, but around it, there's actually the

381
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,360
casing and these two parts, the detector and the machine that are actually spinning around the body

382
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,760
very, very quickly. It's actually quite fascinating. Maybe we can find a picture of one of these

383
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,120
actually with the cover off. Yeah, we'll find one. And I feel like even when I got to residency,

384
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,080
which is, so let's just say directionally 20 years ago. I mean, I still think people were using 16

385
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,080
and 32 bit scanners, right? Yeah, they were. So 16 bit means you've got eight, you're spaced out

386
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,880
equally eight units, and then you've got your eight detecting surfaces. Right. And so what it

387
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,400
winds up doing is so if you started at, let's say the top of your head and go to the bottom,

388
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,360
we'll call that the axial dimension. What the eight bit would mean is that, or eight slice,

389
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,600
I guess is probably the more correct term is that you basically have like one slice and then you're

390
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,200
actually measuring immediately below it and immediately below that. And so as a result,

391
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,000
as you're circulating around the person or the patient, you're actually doing eight slices at a

392
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,160
time or 16 slices a time or 32 slices a time. So what that means is as you're rotating around,

393
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,960
the amount of coverage you get is more the higher the number of slices, or you can actually also

394
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,680
have thinner and thinner slices. And the more thin you get, the more detail you can get from

395
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,960
an imaging perspective, but the more radiation you're required to overcome the signal and the

396
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,920
noise background. Yeah. So what you're trading off is an optimization problem, which is speed,

397
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,960
resolution, radiation. Now, where are we today? I assume 256 is pretty common.

398
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,040
256 is one of the common ones and it's actually used for things that are rapidly moving,

399
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,440
typically the heart. The heart. Do we have a 512 yet? In research. Really? Yeah. You can actually

400
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,640
make them as high as you want. The problem is you eventually sort of get to these diminishing

401
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,560
returns of how thin the slices are and how many images you need. So if someone needed to scan a

402
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,760
part of the body with a CT scan that wasn't moving functionally, so something that's anatomically

403
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,160
complicated like the pancreas, but it's not moving like the heart, are you good enough at 128 or 64?

404
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,800
Like does 256 offer an advantage? It doesn't really offer any advantage. No, you can actually,

405
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,560
eight slices work quite well. As long as the person can hold their breath and there's not

406
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,240
a lot of movement, eight slices work well. One of the things I remember at Hopkins, there was a

407
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,400
radiologist there. I don't know if he's still there. I think his name was Elliot Fishman and

408
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,560
he was sort of the god of pancreatic reconstruction. And of course, this was important at Hopkins

409
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,160
because at the time Hopkins was the epicenter of pancreatic cancer surgery. And as important as it

410
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,760
was to have a great surgeon, John Cameron, Charlie Yeo, et cetera, that could do this operation,

411
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,920
it was as important to have an exceptional radiologist because as you know, and maybe some

412
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,320
of the listeners know, many patients with pancreatic cancer technically shouldn't be operated on.

413
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,360
And you'd really like to know that before you enter the patient's abdomen, which is not always

414
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,040
possible. But I remember that Elliot Fishman's images, he would have these 3D reconstructions

415
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,200
of the pancreas at a time. I mean, today that's pretty common, but at the time, like nobody was

416
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,640
contemplating this kind of resolution. And we would sit there on rounds and look at these images

417
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,200
when they were still printed out on that sort of vellum, whatever the hell that plastic paper is.

418
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,560
And you just couldn't believe it. So to think that he was doing that with relatively few slices,

419
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,320
right? Exactly. And like the whole power of that is again, as I mentioned at the very beginning,

420
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,960
is that our brain thinks in 3D, right? And so the power of that, as opposed to a good looking slice

421
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,920
by slice at a 2D image became very useful because now it became real. It became what our

422
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,240
eyes could see, what our brains could see. And it actually really helped everybody plan their

423
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,720
surgery. And so it really was revolutionary to actually start to look at things in three dimensions.

424
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,480
Now there's another element that we're going to introduce to this, which is contrast.

425
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,240
So what is contrast? Why do we use it? What contrast is? And for the CT world,

426
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,160
it's actually an iodinated material. And so what iodine does is actually absorbs the photons. And

427
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,000
so therefore makes things look white on a CT scan. So it's like having liquid bone in your bloodstream.

428
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,600
Pretty much a liquid photon absorber. And so what it does is we actually inject it into the vein,

429
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,160
and then we actually, the heart pumps it around. And so that means we're actually able to time

430
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,560
when we actually take the CT image in order to be able to see what type of organ we're looking for.

431
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,360
So you can think of it, if you actually get the arterial phase, you'll actually see what arteries

432
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,680
are connecting to an organ, or else you can wait for the venous phase or when the veins

433
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,080
are returning blood flow from that organ. And you actually see the entire detail of the organ.

434
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,920
And what contrast really is, is basically a way to light up the blood vessels and let up the capillary

435
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,200
net and everything in between, between the artery and the vein, to allow us to see the anatomic

436
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,480
detail from the perspective of adding blood to it. And the name of course explains exactly why

437
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,920
it's to create contrast. Exactly. In the absence of contrast, blood looks functionally like water.

438
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,240
I feel like I just want to go into this in so much detail, but I'm also trying to be mindful of not

439
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,320
going deeper than we need to. But I guess we can talk about a Hounsfield unit, because that will

440
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,280
allow us to explain this contrast thing and tissue differences, right? Exactly. So what actually

441
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,200
happened in CT is that Hounsfield came along and kind of said, okay, how do we calibrate this?

442
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,200
And so there's a range of Hounsfield units from minus 1000, zero to 2000. And what that actually

443
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:46,120
has to do with is density. And so zero is defined as water. 1000 is basically air. And so as a result,

444
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,720
we can actually see the difference between the density of bone and air with water effectively

445
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:59,560
in the middle. So you have at plus 1000, it is black, right? At minus 1000, it is pure white.

446
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
Pretty much. Yeah. And the biggest problem is that the eye actually can't see that range.

447
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,560
So on our computers, we actually will narrow down and look at, we'll actually look at the

448
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,640
higher Hounsfield units and we'll actually see lung. Then we go down, we look at the denser

449
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,320
material and that becomes bone, but we can't see the whole thing. Right. So you could technically

450
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,760
specify multiple parameters. You could specify the width of your window and where it is centered,

451
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:30,040
for example. So if you wanted to look at lung, you would center it much closer to positive numbers

452
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,080
and you don't need a very wide range, do you? No, not at all. So what's a typical lung window,

453
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,760
like 800 plus or minus a hundred or something to that? I mean, I have no idea. I don't even

454
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,920
remember anymore, but that's the gist of it, right? Exactly. Yeah. And actually I don't even

455
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,880
remember because you push a preset. Once you said it, you never really change it much.

456
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,400
So I had committed all of these to memory in medical school. I was so obsessed with knowing

457
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,040
the window for optimizing the viewing of every tissue. As did I. And then when you actually start

458
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,280
to practically use it, you kind of, you wing it because what happens is that every person is

459
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,440
actually slightly different appreciation for contrast. Yeah. And also it's like the amount

460
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,280
of photons lost based on patients' body size, the amount of absorption changes things. So the

461
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,280
numbers actually kind of move around and you wind up building a database in your mind of actually

462
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,280
what you're looking at. And so when you first start, you actually push the buttons and it's like 60,

463
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,440
40 for the abdomen and you actually know all these numbers. And then as you kind of go through,

464
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,920
you're like, no, I just need to see what I need to see. What you said a moment ago, it really brought

465
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,320
back those memories of how horrible it looked if you tried to set the window to be the entire plus

466
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,360
minus 1000. You could appreciate nothing. And that sort of struck me as a metaphor for life

467
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,760
at times, which is like at a thousand feet, sometimes you can tell I'm looking at a human,

468
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,520
but that was about the limits of detection. But you could appreciate so many different things by

469
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,560
zeroing in on the capillaries of the lung, but you had to be in the right resolution versus if

470
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,600
you wanted to look and see if they actually had a fracture. People forget CTs are great for bones,

471
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,760
right? And we're going to talk about how MRI, for example, is less great for bones.

472
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,280
So now we've got the CT thing. So what we've established is that

473
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,080
X-ray is a purely anatomic study. There's nothing functional about it. As you go into CT by itself,

474
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,120
it's also a very anatomic study. You can add contrast to get even better information about

475
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:25,160
the vasculature. And you now have so much information that you can basically titrate or

476
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:32,360
calibrate the window in which you look into that collection of radiation and specify your tissues.

477
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,000
CT scans are generally pretty quick, right? People who are claustrophobic don't tend to

478
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
struggle that much in a CT scanner, correct? Exactly. And that's actually the real power of

479
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,800
CT is the speed. So for example, in trauma settings, that's what you want. Basically,

480
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,640
if a patient's not doing well in a trauma, you want to put them through the CT scanner as fast

481
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,920
as possible to get the information out as fast as possible. And they're very fast.

482
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,480
So something that's even faster than CT and comes without at least one of its most significant

483
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,600
drawbacks, which is radiation is ultrasound. So how does ultrasound work? Where does it fit into

484
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,360
this and what are its limitations? The way ultrasound works is basically it's a high frequency,

485
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,560
so higher than what our ears can hear. And effectively it's penetrating solid tissue.

486
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,960
So it's a high frequency sound wave versus an ionizing wave of energy. Exactly. Okay.

487
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,520
And so then it's actually going at every tissue interface that actually reflects back. So it's

488
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,680
very much like an echo. So if you're standing at a mountain range and you yell out, you actually

489
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,760
hear the echo coming back and you can actually from that time, you can determine how deep that

490
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,800
tissue is. And so with ultrasound, we're just doing that very, very fast. And so at every tissue

491
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,280
interface or every mountain range, if we could, you actually hear that reflection coming back.

492
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,800
You actually are able to then composite that as a representative of how deep things are away from

493
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,120
you. Now, there are animals that do this, right? Including some of our closest relatives, right?

494
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,480
They do. And as bats also do them, that's actually how they see.

495
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,320
And the bats resolution on this is what compared to say a dolphin. I've read, and I feel like I

496
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,400
read this in the journal science many years ago, so I'm almost assuredly not remembering this

497
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:19,560
correctly, that the resolution with which a whale or a dolphin could undergo sonography rivaled that

498
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,400
of our finest medical equipment. I mean, their ability to discern was remarkable. I found that

499
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,880
amazing. And of course, in part, that's because they're the medium through which they travel is

500
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,960
water, as opposed to what the bat has to do, which is go through this poorly, poorly dense air, right?

501
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,520
Exactly. So traveling through the different material actually makes a very good way to explain

502
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,000
it because in the air, actually, ultrasound doesn't penetrate very far because it's as high

503
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,960
frequency and it just you lose it because there's no reflection coming back. Whereas in more solid

504
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,160
material like water or even dense material like organs in the body, it actually reflects back

505
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,000
easier. And so it's actually that reflection that actually allows you to discern the different

506
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,200
tissue types based on how quickly it reflects back. Now, ultrasound can't harm you, right? You

507
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,880
don't have ionized. You could ultrasound yourself all day, every day for the rest of your life and

508
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,760
you're not increasing your risk of cancer. Whereas if you did a CT scan of yourself every month,

509
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,120
you're going to be in trouble after several months. Exactly. The drawback of ultrasound is

510
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,920
the resolution doesn't seem to be as high. Right. With ultrasound, you're only looking at one slice,

511
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,440
right? So you're only looking at one slice in time and you're basically kind of sweeping

512
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,760
through an organ, trying to composite those slices together in your brain to try and build

513
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,760
that 3D model. Because like I said, our brain always wants to build a 3D model. So with

514
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,360
ultrasound, as you sweep through, you get one layer, then you get another layer, then you get

515
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,960
another layer, and then eventually that's composited together to see what's going on.

516
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,680
And ultrasound also seems to really struggle when it encounters air inside the body. So if you're

517
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,720
trying to do an ultrasound of someone's aorta, but their bowel is in front of it, it becomes

518
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,080
difficult to see for the same reason the bat can't really use high frequency ultrasound to fly.

519
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,320
Exactly. And so that's why when, for example, you look at a female pelvis, you want their bladder

520
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,960
to be full because then their bladder being full of fluid, it actually acts as a nice window to

521
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,640
allow the ultrasound beam to pass right through to be able to see the uterus behind it.

522
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,040
I think any woman listening to this who's been pregnant, that's got to be one of their

523
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,080
most vexing parts of prenatal ultrasound is they always had to sit there in a waiting room with a

524
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,680
full bladder waiting to have that ultrasound. And of course, that's why we like to do ultrasound on

525
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,640
a fetus, right? Is you're not causing any harm. I mean, certainly one thing I came to appreciate

526
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,880
in the hospital was the skill that was required on the part of the person doing it. So if you gave

527
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,720
me the best ultrasound device money could buy today, like you literally went and bought whatever

528
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,760
ultrasound was at the absolute limit of technology. And then you walked down to the local hospital

529
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,840
here, Vancouver General, and you grabbed just a middle of the road radiology ultrasound tech,

530
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:01,080
someone who's maybe been out of school for a year. And you gave him or her the worst ultrasound

531
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,840
machine on the market. There's no comparison who would be able to see more. This is where skill

532
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,200
and experience is invaluable. Basically also dealing with the difficult patient body type is

533
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,320
really critical and you can't replace that experience. Now there's a special subset of

534
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,200
ultrasound that we do on the heart. Where did that idea come about? Who figured that idea out?

535
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,640
Again, the value was like once you can actually find like a nice window that would actually allow

536
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,400
you to miss the air in the lungs and actually kind of look at the heart, you realize that boy,

537
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,480
you can actually start to see this two dimensional plane of the heart quite well. And as a result,

538
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,480
you can actually see where things were moving, such as the valves in the heart or the walls of

539
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,280
the heart. And then as well, you actually add something called Doppler, which is basically the

540
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,920
frequency bouncing off of blood vessel. If it's going or coming, the frequency is going to be

541
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,440
different. And so as a result, you can actually now start to see how blood is moving. And so that's

542
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,760
what echo does. And so it actually allows you to look at the heart in detail with a very, very thin

543
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,040
window, usually underneath the chest and around the lung. Yeah. So anybody listening to this,

544
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,720
who's had an echocardiogram, they know that the person doing it is really pressing quite hard.

545
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,080
It's somewhat uncomfortable for you, the person getting the echo done. And the reason is they've

546
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,200
got that jelly on you, which again is doing everything to eliminate even a drop of air

547
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,120
between the interface. And secondly, they're pushing and they're grinding it in between

548
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,560
the ribs and they want to get that view versus, so that's a trans thoracic echo where you're doing

549
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,960
it over the chest. In surgery, often if we needed to look at the heart, you would add,

550
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,680
the anesthesiologist would actually put the echocardiogram in the esophagus and you get an

551
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,200
even better view of the heart. The esophagus sits right underneath it and there's nothing in between.

552
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,680
It's a beautiful view and the patient obviously, because they're asleep, they don't have to worry

553
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,000
about having this huge probe stuck in their esophagus. Right. And because you're closer to

554
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,240
the organ you want to see being the heart, the details can be fantastic because one of the other

555
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,440
things with ultrasound is that the deeper you go, the beam effectively fans out and gets thinner

556
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,440
and thinner. So you actually get less sort of detail on the edges. Whereas right in the center,

557
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,600
right underneath the probe is where your maximum amount of detail is going to be. So by having it

558
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,360
right in the esophagus, which is right beside the heart, you're going to get fantastic detail.

559
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,680
As important as the CT scanner was in trauma, the ultrasound was actually the most important

560
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,760
radiographic tool we had in trauma. And that was the one thing that even the surgical residents

561
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,720
needed to know how to do. And it was called a fast ultrasound. There was an algorithm for this

562
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:38,040
because in a busy trauma center like Hopkins, you're going to see trauma so often, penetrating

563
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,640
trauma in particular, where you have to know, does this person need to go up to surgery? Is there

564
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,800
fluid in the abdominal cavity? That's generally one of the things you care about. You certainly

565
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,800
also care if there's fluid around the pericardium, this non-stretchy sack that surrounds the heart.

566
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,080
These are surgical emergencies, especially fluid around the pericardium. So I think sometime in

567
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,520
our second year of residency, we would go off and do this course where on pigs, we would have to

568
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,560
practice this over and over again until you learn the four places that you were looking for fluid

569
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:15,640
inside the abdomen. I guess we got pretty good at it. I think I got okay at it, but I still always

570
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,480
felt like a little nervous when push came to shove because I always felt like I wish I could

571
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:27,640
go and spend a year just being an ultrasound tech to really, really dial this in because the stakes

572
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,040
are so high, especially if you miss the slight amount of fluid in the pericardium. That's a

573
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,400
lethal injury. And one of the real tricks as well is that depending on the composition of the fluid,

574
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,320
there's like frank blood or coagulating blood. It can be really tricky to actually pick it out.

575
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,440
And so a lot of times you'd actually see that fast ultrasound would be done. And if people weren't

576
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,000
100% confident that there's a problem or not a problem, they go straight to CT scan because you

577
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,400
just couldn't make that error. And that happens time and time again. Yeah. And it's funny, one of

578
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,680
the last traumas I was ever involved in as a resident was just one of those cases where

579
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:08,600
the patient came in and he was responsive. He had the tiniest, tiniest stab wound. So less than a

580
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,760
centimeter wide under the xiphoid. That's it. So this is a guy who walks in who has a sub centimeter,

581
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,360
sub xiphoid incision. I mean, it could have been a shaving cut, but he's been stabbed. And

582
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:27,640
he's more or less seems pretty normal. Vital signs are more or less what you would expect.

583
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,680
When I lay him down and do this ultrasound of his heart, it really looks like there's something

584
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,920
there, but I can't quite figure it out. And now the question is, well, he's obviously too responsive

585
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,480
to warrant cutting his chest open, which was what you would do in the emergency situation.

586
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,440
So you have to do the CT scan. But of course, the risk in the CT scanner is as fast as the CT scanner

587
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,440
is, he is still laying down on a scanner, potentially ready to have a cardiac arrest

588
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,120
for at least a minute and a half. And usually what would happen is, I don't recall in this case,

589
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,920
but a lot of times if you're going to go through the trouble of doing that, you're going to do a

590
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,280
contrast CT scan as well. You're not just going to do what we would call a dry scan with no contrast.

591
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,000
So now you've got the fumbling around of getting the iodine machine hooked up to him, et cetera,

592
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,880
et cetera. And Eddie Cornwell, who was the chairman of surgery at Hopkins, he's now the chairman of

593
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,680
surgery at Howard and just an incredible human being. I remember one of the things that he told

594
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:31,560
us when we were junior residents is, beware of the patient who gets wildly anxious when you lay them

595
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:37,960
down. And sure enough, when we go and lay this guy down in the scanner, he just starts freaking out.

596
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,880
And when you sat him up, he sort of calmed down a little bit. It was do not pass go,

597
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,960
do not collect $200 and took him to the OR, opened him up immediately. And sure enough,

598
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,280
that knife had actually hit his pulmonary vein. And so that pulmonary vein was bleeding into his

599
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,520
pericardium. And so he would have had a cardiac tamponade if we'd left him on that table.

600
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,600
And amazingly, that patient went home three days later.

601
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,040
Yeah, no, exactly. And you can see the power of the clinical scale as well as just the basic

602
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,760
imaging, right? The power of imaging plus clinical is pretty much where medicine is right now and how

603
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,160
we actually are able to diagnose things quickly and efficiently.

604
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,880
So we've talked about two technologies that most women are very familiar with when it comes to

605
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,440
breast cancer, which is of the cancers where screening is done vis-a-vis imaging technology,

606
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,440
breast cancer is head and shoulders above the others in terms of the frequency and ubiquity

607
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,680
of the scan. So let's talk a little bit about, because you've already explained what an ultrasound

608
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:41,080
and an x-ray is. So now explain what mammography is and why we would sometimes say mammography is

609
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,560
sufficient versus insufficient. And why do some women get told, well, you also need an ultrasound.

610
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:51,320
Right. So basically mammography is a lower attenuation x-ray. We're actually taking x-ray,

611
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,480
but a weaker strength of it because we never have to penetrate bone. And actually now it

612
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,040
shines through the breast tissue, which is all soft tissue. And so one of the things that actually is

613
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,320
maybe stepping back is to actually kind of look at breast tissue in particular.

614
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,440
So breast tissue is composed of normal subcutaneous tissue, which is mainly fat,

615
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,600
and as well as glandular tissue. And so when women are in their childbearing age,

616
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,640
it's almost all glandular tissue to produce milk for eventually feeding a baby. And as women then

617
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,760
go through menopause, that glandular tissue can invariably involute. So it's one of these things,

618
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,680
you don't use it, it gets replaced with fat. But in some women, it actually doesn't get replaced

619
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,520
with fat. And that is what we call the dense breast tissue. So mammograms are very, very good

620
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,240
at shining through fat. And it actually allows you to see very, very simple things like calcification

621
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,280
in fat because they are just so dense and it actually just stands out. Whereas in glandular

622
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,800
tissue, sometimes that photon of low energy x-ray doesn't make it through. And as a result,

623
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,800
the tissue is very, very hard to see through. And that's what we call the dense breast tissue. And

624
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,120
the reason it's hard to see through is because of all that glandular tissue that in some women

625
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,000
over menopause or even older, they just retain. And nobody really knows why they retain that

626
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,800
extra glandular tissue. Why in some women it gets replaced with fat. In other women, it doesn't.

627
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,680
We don't know why. And so many states, and I think they're actually over 38 and possibly soon to

628
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,080
become a federal law in the United States is going to require that the very first line on a

629
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,840
mammogram report is going to be that the women's breast tissue is dense, limiting mammographic

630
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:26,040
sensitivity, or the breast tissue is almost entirely fat, in which case mammograms are helpful,

631
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,880
because that actually will really allow women to determine was this test good enough. And so for

632
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,280
women who actually have dense breast tissue, so they for some reason, if they're postmenopausal

633
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,600
or if they're premenopausal in their childbearing age, they still have a lot of glandular tissue.

634
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,840
That means a mammogram might not be enough. And therefore they need another second imaging

635
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,400
modality to look through the tissue. And that's where ultrasound comes in. And as well as MRI

636
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,800
would come in as well to be able to see through that dense glandular tissue that the mammogram

637
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,200
can't see through. Now, the last time I looked in these data could be, they could just be simply

638
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:06,040
dated, but I think directionally this is right. A mammogram had a sensitivity of about 80, call

639
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:13,160
it 84, 85% and a specificity of about 90, 91%. Does that still sound about right to you?

640
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,040
It depends actually.

641
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah, that was like all comers was the point I was going to make, which is it becomes almost

642
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
impossible to interpret what that means. Because what you need to know is what if I had a thousand

643
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,840
women that looked exactly like the women I'm scanning right now.

644
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,600
Exactly. And so that's where it actually becomes really critical in the fact that depending on the

645
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,080
breast density, and that's why it's important for women to know what that is, you're going to know

646
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,960
how helpful the mammogram is or may not be. But one of the other things that becomes actually very,

647
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,680
very powerful in the mammogram is to actually use comparison over time. So that's why they

648
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,720
recommend screening intervals of either one or two years. And it's a matter of academic debate.

649
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,920
Because if you actually have like a mammogram taken, and then let's say two years later,

650
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,560
you do another one, it's actually far more sensitive to see that subtle change over time

651
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,040
than it is to actually look at an individual mammogram on its own. So a single mammogram on

652
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,240
a dense woman, its sensitivity is about 55%. It's actually quite poor. Whereas on a woman

653
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,120
who actually has fatty tissue, it's very high.

654
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,680
How high?

655
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,440
It can actually be over 95%.

656
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,920
So let me explain what sensitivity and specificity means so that a person understands what this is

657
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
about. Let's just use the numbers 80 and 90, because those are generally accepted as an aggregate.

658
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,280
So when we say a mammogram has an 80% sensitivity, here's what we mean. If there are a 100 women

659
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,680
who have breast cancer, so there's 100 women and we absolutely know that they have breast cancer,

660
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,160
and we subject them to a mammogram, 80 of them will test positive. 80 of them will have a true

661
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:52,600
positive, and 20 of them will test falsely negative. So the sensitivity is the true

662
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,040
positive rate over the true positives plus the false negatives, correct?

663
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,760
Exactly.

664
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:07,800
So the higher the sensitivity, the less likely you are to take someone who has the cancer

665
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,800
and miss them. That's the juice on sensitivity. Let's now talk about specificity. So mammography,

666
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,120
a moment ago you gave a staggeringly sad example, so we'll come back to that. But let's use the

667
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:25,160
better one, right? Let's say 90%. So now what does it mean to have 90% specificity? So that means

668
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:33,560
you take 100 women who we absolutely know do not have breast cancer and you scan them. 90 of them

669
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:40,680
will correctly identify as not having breast cancer. 10 of them will incorrectly identify

670
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,960
as having breast cancer. So 10 will be false positives, 90 will be true negatives. So the

671
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:54,760
sensitivity is the number of true negatives over the true negatives plus the false positives.

672
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,440
And so the example you gave a moment ago is if you have a woman whose breasts are very fatty,

673
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,040
not glandular, therefore she's the poster child for mammography, you're driving that specificity

674
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,840
up, which means you are reducing the number of false positives. But in the example you gave

675
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,120
earlier, which is a woman who might have very, very dense breast tissue, imagine what it means

676
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:26,840
to take 100 women who have very, very dense breast tissue and drive your specificity down to 50%.

677
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:34,360
That means on a given day, half the women that walk into your clinic are going to be told they

678
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,000
have cancer if they don't. Exactly. So it's like flipping a coin. And by the way, one of the

679
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,040
greatest examples of this, and I mean, I attribute it to Bob Kaplan, but maybe he heard it somewhere

680
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,680
else, but I love it, is you can make a test that is 100% sensitive if you're willing to have 0%

681
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:56,600
specificity and vice versa. For example, you could send a letter, you could have a little card that

682
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:02,680
says you have cancer and you show it to every single person you meet, you have 100% sensitivity.

683
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,160
Right? Right. You will never have a false negative. The problem is that's so clinically

684
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,040
useless because you have no specificity. And similarly, you could have a little magic card

685
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,720
that you show everyone you ever meet for the rest of your life that says you do not have cancer.

686
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:24,440
Guess what? You have a 100% specific test. It just has zero sensitivity. So it's as useful as a warm

687
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,240
bucket of hamster vomit. And so it's this trade off between sensitivity and specificity, which I'm

688
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,760
teeing this up because I know we're going to come and talk about this when we get into the more

689
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:39,480
advanced MRI stuff. But the example of mammography is amazing to me because it makes you realize

690
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,160
you can't just rely on one test, especially when that test has such low sensitivity and specificity,

691
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,080
depending on the individual. Exactly. And I think that that's the real important lesson is that

692
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,520
it's actually very individually tailored. Right? And so if you have one test and you don't know

693
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,480
what your fingerprint or what the tissue that your breast is made of, you really have no idea

694
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,480
what you're looking for. So you always need the one to kind of find out is this good enough.

695
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,360
People always talk about machine learning and AI and how it invariably it has to infiltrate medicine.

696
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,000
And it seems to me that one of the best places for it to do so is in at least comparative radiology.

697
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,320
So given the ubiquity of mammograms, hopefully every woman above a certain age in the United

698
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:27,080
States, Canada is getting regular mammography. There's no shortage of data. Are there companies

699
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,840
out there that are working on basically doing that once you have a baseline, which would be almost

700
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,040
impossible for a machine to read. But once you have that baseline, longitudinally comparing it.

701
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,520
There are actually a lot of companies that are actually doing that. And even in some states that

702
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,240
are actually using machine learning techniques to actually help the radiologist and they actually

703
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,080
can be used as even a second reader. There are a fair number of companies working on that,

704
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,240
but it's not perfect. What do you think that could improve the sensitivities and

705
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,200
specificities of mammography too? I mean, can we get to the point where I don't know, I mean,

706
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:07,240
most people would say you've got to be north of 97, 98% on both to really feel confident.

707
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:11,160
I think that's a pretty high target to achieve. And the reason that would be is just because of

708
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,160
the way the tests are done and the individual variability of people, it's going to be tough.

709
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,920
Can machine learning get that good? It'll take a while. It's going to need volumes and volumes

710
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,680
of data that's actually reproduced the exact same way. And I think that's the biggest problem is

711
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,080
because we're unique. The way the breast is compressed, the way everything is done when

712
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,800
a mammogram is taken is somewhat different each time. So the amount of coverage is a little bit

713
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,160
different each time. It's possible. Are we there yet? No, we're nowhere near close, but we're

714
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,200
getting better. And that's also one of the challenges that we have when we look at the

715
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:48,200
data on mammography is it's so backwards looking. And so if you want to look at the

716
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,880
most comprehensive study of mammography and breast cancer screening, by definition,

717
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,080
you are looking at a trial that was enrolling patients 15 to 20 years ago. And therefore,

718
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:06,040
you have to be able to say, well, how relevant is the technology that was being used then relative

719
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,600
to today? And in the case of mammography, it shouldn't be changing that much, but I mean,

720
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:16,280
things do get better. I mean, we're reading pure digital now. We have much better capacity to read

721
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,280
even an X-ray than we did 20 years ago, don't we? We do. And basically now what's actually happening

722
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,280
is we're actually doing a fluoroscopic version of a mammogram where we're basically sort of trying

723
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,240
to slice through this three-dimensional object and actually get the detail of it at a three-dimensional

724
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:35,400
layer. Whereas before the mammogram were typically just like the chest X-ray was done, two different

725
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,280
views compositing that three-dimensional picture together. So that three-dimensional view of the

726
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,920
mammogram is actually better than it was. Now, there's something else that I've never actually

727
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,920
seen done clinically, but I've read about it called MBI, molecular breast imaging. Is that used

728
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,680
any longer? And what is it? The reason it came across my radar was many years ago when I was

729
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,360
just trying to get the landscape on ionizing radiation, this came up as a test that was done

730
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,240
as a follow-up to a mammogram. But I thought there must be a typo based on how much it had like

731
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,240
something like 20 millisieverts of radiation. I mean, it was 40% of your annual radiation limit.

732
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:18,680
What that is now, that's a functional test in the realm of nuclear medicine. And so what that is

733
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,440
doing is we're actually taking radioactive material and then we're actually injecting it into the

734
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,880
body. And so tissues that actually have increased mitochondria actually concentrate this

735
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,640
radio tracer. And so that typically happens in breast cancer. So it's actually used with a

736
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,120
radio tracer called sestamib. You've heard of this MBI scan, which is where we actually inject

737
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,040
this into the heart. And we actually look at whether or not the heart is being properly

738
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,960
perfused. And so areas that aren't being perfused, so therefore the muscle is not alive, basically

739
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,160
don't take up the radio tracer. Whereas muscle that is alive does take up the radio tracer. And

740
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,400
that muscle that's alive, that's moving has a very high mitochondrial rate. So therefore it actually

741
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,840
concentrates this material. So breast cancer was actually doing very similar thing. They'd actually

742
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,480
have a high metabolism. And so this tissue would actually concentrate or this radio tracer

743
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,040
would concentrate in that tissue. So that was the MPI exam for breast. Is that test still done?

744
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,560
Rarely, but it can be done in women who actually have very, very dense breast tissue and you

745
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,720
actually need to see what's going on. It can be done, but a lot of it's actually been replaced

746
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:25,080
with positron emission tomography scans. So right now, how many women, young women,

747
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,520
if we just say because the young women are going to be more likely to have dense breast tissue,

748
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,400
do we have a sense of what percentage of them really are being uncovered? Meaning they're not

749
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,560
getting adequate sort of surveillance with just mammography and would require at least ultrasound.

750
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,360
Is that a third of women? I mean, do we have a sense of what that number is?

751
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,120
Depending on the jurisdiction. So the guideline for when you actually start screening for

752
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,920
mammography can either be the age of 40 and higher or 50 and higher. Each jurisdiction is

753
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,000
a little bit different. So what that means is that basically anybody under the age of 40,

754
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,600
unless you have a family history of somebody having breast cancer at an early age,

755
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:01,880
they're not getting screened at all. So everything we've talked about from a technology standpoint,

756
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,880
in some ways pales in comparison to what we're about to talk about, which is about as complicated

757
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,640
a set of physics as you're going to find within the walls of a hospital, right? I mean, it doesn't

758
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,840
get a lot more complicated than an MRI, does it? No, it doesn't. It's really an engineered delight.

759
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:22,760
Yeah. And I certainly, again, thinking back to my brief six weeks of doing radiology, I feel like

760
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:29,240
more of my notes were scribbling down an explanation of how this thing worked than anything else. So

761
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,360
let's go back to the beginning. Who the heck thought of this? There were actually three people

762
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,480
actually thought about it, but the Mansfield is actually one of the main creators of it in UK.

763
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,840
And so the MRI machine really, it's actually quite the amazing tool. And it actually wasn't

764
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,600
initially developed for imaging. It was actually just sort of developed on a benchtop where they're

765
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,200
actually just kind of looking to see what the effect of electromagnetic waves does to anything.

766
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,200
And somebody wind up sticking tissue in it saying, Hey, look, it's like we can actually,

767
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,920
what goes in one side comes out a little bit differently on the other side.

768
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,480
And as a result, we can actually determine what that composition of material was.

769
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,760
So does that mean like the NMR that we were looking at when we did organic chemistry was

770
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,880
really the precursor to the MRI that we're sitting outside of right now listening to at home?

771
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,120
It's the exact same device that the NMR basically is just a two dimensional version

772
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,200
of an MRI, which is three dimensions because our brain likes three dimensions.

773
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:31,560
So let's go back to organic chemistry. So again, we'll link to a picture of an NMR spec so that

774
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,720
people can see what we're talking about. But I, I guess there's also no easy way around this,

775
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,800
right? I think you have to sort of roll your sleeves up a little bit on physics to understand

776
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:44,920
how an MRI works. There is no, I'm sure there's a kids book out there waiting to be written on

777
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:53,080
the topic, which would be amazing, but it's pretty tough. So you take a molecule like alcohol,

778
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,680
okay? So it's got these two carbons that are joined. The first carbon has three hydrogens

779
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,680
around it. The next carbon has a hydrogen and a hydrogen, but then instead of the third hydrogen,

780
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,800
it gets an oxygen, which is bound to a hydrogen. That is the stuff that people drink and get drunk

781
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:16,280
on. Now, put that into a nuclear magnetic resonance machine and you're going to see

782
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,640
different peaks, right? It's going to show you that there is a methyl group somewhere. It's going to

783
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:27,720
say, it can't tell you what it sees, but it tells you that there's a carbon bound to three hydrogens,

784
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:33,000
right? Right. How does it do that? Perhaps I might actually take up the challenge of a children's

785
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,120
book. But problem is I dislike writing, but maybe for children I'll be okay. The way it actually

786
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:44,040
does it is actually quite fascinating and it's actually relatively simple. So what it actually

787
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:49,400
does is the hydrogen in particular. So we're going to sort of fixate on hydrogen because that's the

788
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,920
atom that we're really interested in. I'm just going to say one thing because you're going to

789
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,640
do this anyway and I just want to preface it. You're going to use hydrogen and proton interchangeably,

790
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,040
aren't you? I will. Can you just tell someone why you're going to use hydrogen and proton

791
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,880
interchangeably? Sure. So the atom basically of the hydrogen is you have one proton and one

792
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,200
electron and in the hydrogen proton, we don't really care about the electron. It just sort of

793
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:19,720
disappears. So the hydrogen, I guess nucleus is a proton. It has no neutron. Its mass is one. Its

794
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,320
mass is determined by the one and only proton it carries, correct? Exactly. Okay. So now hydrogen

795
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,320
and proton, they're the same thing for the purpose of this discussion. Exactly. So when we look at the

796
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,680
NMR, so we actually have hydrogen bound to an oxygen or hydrogen bound to a carbon. And so the

797
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,760
behavior of that nucleus is going to be a little different. So there's basically a magnet that's

798
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:48,680
creating a field and somehow through that we can see how the hydrogen is bonded to either the oxygen

799
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:54,120
or the carbon in the ethanol molecule. Right. So we were talking about the NMR and so what the NMR

800
01:07:54,120 --> 01:08:00,520
does is that it really is a hydrogen or proton imager or actually just detector. And so the way

801
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:07,400
the magnetic field of hydrogen behaves, if it's attached to either the oxygen and OH of alcohol

802
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,560
or the CH3 of carbon is completely different. It actually gives off a different wavelength. And so

803
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,920
as a result, that's how we're actually able to get this, what we call NMR spectra. And so what

804
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:25,800
happened is that from there, there's a person named Domadian who many consider to be the father of MRI.

805
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,880
He actually said, well, you know, look, if we can actually take what Mansfield and Lauterbur did

806
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,040
on a benchtop, can we actually put a human in it and actually start to see the soft tissue? Because

807
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,320
we know that our bodies composed of roughly 70% water. There's a lot of hydrogen on fat. So can

808
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,560
we see that frequency difference? We can see it on a benchtop, but what about in people? So we have

809
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,880
more hydrogen in us. If we were just going to count up the atoms in us, hydrogen wins all day long.

810
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,640
Because as you said, if we're 70% water, that's two to one hydrogen over oxygen there. And then

811
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:59,160
all the fat that's in us is all the hydrogen to the carbon there. And there's basically hydrogen

812
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:06,120
in protein as well. I mean, so if you have a hydrogen detector, that's basically the way you

813
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,840
would describe an MRI. An MRI is exactly that. It's a hydrogen imager. So basically we're looking at

814
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:17,080
hydrogen nuclei, which is a proton. And so a lot of times as well, people actually talk about proton

815
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:24,120
spectroscopy, which is NMR. An MRI is just basically a simple hydrogen imager. So I think

816
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,640
anyone who's had an MRI knows that there's a magnet involved and it's generally a non-trivial

817
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,480
magnet. Some people have probably heard of some of these real horror stories where accidentally

818
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,280
in the hospital, a patient's wheeled in and there's a loose oxygen tank under the gurney

819
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,920
that's wheeling them in and it goes flying across the room and hits somebody and can kill someone.

820
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,560
So how strong is the magnet and why does it need to be so strong? Right. So the magnets,

821
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,080
they come in different flavors. So typically it's regarded as a Tesla. And so Tesla is

822
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,920
roughly 10,000 gauss. And so a gauss is effectively what the North Pole can produce.

823
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,360
And it's actually the typical measurement for most magnets. But when we actually get into the MRI

824
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,200
field, it becomes so much stronger. And the reason we actually kind of need that high

825
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,800
Tesla field strength is because we're actually taking hydrogen, which is typically not that

826
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,360
magnetic compared to like a magnet that we think about like a bar magnet. And what we're trying to

827
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:24,760
do is we're actually trying to orient that little dipole of the water molecule or fat molecule

828
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,160
a certain direction. And that's what the static field does. And that's why it has to be so strong.

829
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:36,840
So they come in flavors 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, which is double the strength, 7 Tesla. And so the higher

830
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,720
the Tesla they go, the more it's actually able to pull all of the hydrogens and orient them in one

831
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,360
direction. Because as we're sitting here or anywhere, normally our hydrogen molecules are

832
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:50,680
on water, we're just kind of bouncing around randomly kind of pointed at any which direction

833
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:56,760
and that there is no kind of magnetic component to us. The hydrogens are spinning around just based

834
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,560
on Brownian motion. And so when you actually go into a magnet, that strong magnetic field,

835
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:07,000
these hydrogens basically kind of turn and orient themselves in that direction. And so that's what

836
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,800
actually provides the initial basis for an MRI. And that's why contrary to what we see on TV,

837
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,080
that magnet is always on you can never turn it off. Because that magnetic field always has to be

838
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,760
there in order to provide that orientation. And as well, the way it works is you actually have

839
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,960
a superconducting wire that's actually running just above absolute zero degrees Kelvin. So it's

840
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:34,600
roughly two Kelvin. And so you can't turn that off. This is superconducting wire, it has like pumps

841
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,160
that are pumping all the time to keep it that cold. So that when you actually put an electric field in

842
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:44,040
like a loop of wire, that electric field is what actually generates the magnetic field in a

843
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:49,320
perpendicular direction. So you have a generator that backs up if you lose power, which invariably

844
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,400
you're going to lose at some point. Exactly. You have to have that backup power to always keep this

845
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,200
pump moving this liquid helium that's surrounding the wires to always keep that liquid helium

846
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,760
floating around circulating around that wire to keep that wire near absolute zero Kelvin. Now,

847
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,680
if we were to walk in the scanner today and everyone can sort of picture this, there's a bed

848
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:12,680
running through a donut. What is the direction right now that that magnet is being oriented?

849
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:17,240
The donut. So that's where that loop of superconducting wire is sitting in. And so depending

850
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,120
on how it's put in, most of the time the north will actually face away from the control center.

851
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,600
And that's the direction of north. Got it. And if I recall, there's like a right hand rule on this,

852
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,400
isn't there? There is very nice. So it can tell you which way the power in the coil is going.

853
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,160
And it's actually going, I guess, if you're looking from the foot of the bed, it's actually

854
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,480
going in a clockwise circle. And that's the right hand rule. The right hand rule. It's pointing in

855
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:45,240
the axis. Okay. Now, aside from the fact, let's pretend we weren't wearing anything metal. If you

856
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:52,200
walked into a room where there was a 10 or a 20 Tesla magnet, would you feel anything and would

857
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:58,200
it do anything to you that is harmful? The actual magnetic field won't do that much. Now, when you

858
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,400
get very, very strong to a moving magnetic field, you can actually start to feel it because it can

859
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,360
actually trigger your nerve impulses to start moving. So sometimes people actually, if the

860
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,920
magnetic field is too strong, will actually get twitching. And sometimes people who are actually

861
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,240
around magnets all the time, they actually become more and more attuned to this type of a thing.

862
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:21,000
And so if you have MRI technologists or people who are working with a high field all the time,

863
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
they can say, you know, when I go to the head of the magnet or like the north side,

864
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:30,760
I actually kind of feel something pulling. And sometimes people describe getting temporary

865
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,840
headaches and as soon as they step away from the field, it all goes away. Usually when patients

866
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,280
ask me if there are any side effects or harm of an MRI, I mean, our lib answer is to say, no, no,

867
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,520
no, no, no, especially with a non-contrast. Like if there's, I mean, not that the risk of gadolinium

868
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,240
is high, but if you're just having a dry MRI, you say nothing, nothing, nothing. But I actually had

869
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,840
a patient who had very, very, very severe migraine headaches and she actually had a migraine triggered

870
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,000
by an MRI. And I truly believe that wasn't just a coincidence. I mean, I think her headaches were so

871
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
severe. So, so I now sort of always couch my response as there's virtually no short term or

872
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,320
long term consequence that can come from an MRI, but at least in the case of that person, you could

873
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:13,880
trigger a headache. You can, because what it does is it can actually stimulate the nervous response

874
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,840
and depending on how strong the field is. So for example, if you were to do a seven Tesla magnet,

875
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,440
you're definitely going to notice it. And as a result, they'll tell people, look, you can't be

876
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:27,000
in this too long because of the fact that you're actually going to stimulate. So I remember going

877
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,240
back to learning about this. One of the other things that sort of strikes anybody who's had an

878
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,240
MRI is they take a long time. So why is it that if you wanted to get an MRI, let's never mind whole

879
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,040
body, which we'll come to, but you just wanted to get an MRI of the abdomen that could easily take

880
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:48,040
40 minutes. Whereas a CT scan of the abdomen can take two minutes. Yeah. And it's basically the way

881
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,520
the images are acquired to completely different mechanism. So if we go back and talk about the

882
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,720
x-ray, it's basically like a single flash where you're actually looking through everything.

883
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:01,960
The CT is basically this x-ray that's constantly on spinning around and basically sort of circulating

884
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,360
around you. Whereas MRI behaves completely differently. And during the period of time

885
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,480
of that acquisition, what it's doing is everything that's inside the center of that donut is being

886
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,520
pulled in a certain direction, all the hydrogens on your water and fat. And then the loud part of

887
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:22,440
the MRI is actually a temporary magnetic field, which is countering that static field. And so

888
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,240
it's actually now pulling all the hydrogens in the opposite direction. And then in that opposite

889
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,240
direction, it actually turns off. And then the hydrogens reorient to where they were in that

890
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,800
static field. And as they reorient, they actually give off a different frequency. And that different

891
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:42,440
frequency takes a while to gather. And that's what we call the TR or repetition time or the TE of the

892
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:47,640
echo time. And that you can't speed up. So let's talk about TR and TE because it's the TR and the

893
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:53,080
TE that determine what sequence you're looking at. So again, I think the average person probably

894
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:58,280
won't recognize these terms, but certainly anyone in the medical profession will know the difference

895
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:04,920
between a T1 weighted versus a T2 weighted image versus a spin versus an echo versus all of these

896
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,840
things. So let's just talk about the difference between TR, that repetition pulse time, and then

897
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:18,920
TE. Is TE the time it takes to relax back to its original position? So just discussing TR and TE,

898
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,560
how do they differ in acquiring a T1 weighted image, which is the one that's really anatomically

899
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:31,080
beautiful. It's the closest thing you see to, wow, I know what I'm looking at if I'm not a radiologist,

900
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:37,720
versus the T2 weighted image, which seems to highlight water more. So things that are water

901
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,440
look more white, but it doesn't have the anatomic resolution. How would you differentiate those?

902
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,720
Right. So the simplest thing to do, and it's actually quite fascinating, is I went through

903
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:51,560
residency. People are always sort of stunned with, is this a T1 image or a T2 image? And went through

904
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,440
all that and was kind of like, sort of a bit obscure. And then when they started to do MRI

905
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:01,800
much more, it's like it became actually pretty simple. On the T1 image, we actually see nothing

906
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:07,080
but fat. So fat gives a lot of signal, which is what makes it nice and bright. So we see a single

907
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,080
element, or I guess a single element that the hydrogen would be bonded to that we're looking at.

908
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Whereas a T2, we're actually now seeing two elements. We're seeing fat and water. And so

909
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,120
those two elements are actually coming off at different frequencies from the MRI machine.

910
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:27,720
And you have to wait a longer echo time to be able to pick up the water because it returns back to

911
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,640
normal much more slowly than the fat does. So that's our T2.

912
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:38,680
The T2 weighted images take longer to acquire because the T E is long because you have to wait

913
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,720
to get both fat and water. What's the difference in the T R between the T1 and T2?

914
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,240
It's all going to be entirely dependent on the machine. So you actually have to customize those

915
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,480
parameters for every single machine. And so that actually kind of takes a while to actually kind

916
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,960
of go and calibrate and kind of get used to what your eyes used to seeing. And it's also going to

917
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:01,160
be dependent on the signal, the overall magnetic field as well as the overall signal to noise for

918
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,480
that coil set that you're using. So each one has to be effectively tuned.

919
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,480
And then what does it mean when you have these other things that come out and God,

920
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,640
it's been so long since I've done it that I don't even remember when we would look at spin,

921
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:19,240
spin, echo, flare, all of these. I vaguely remember all of these other sequences we would order.

922
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,520
I don't actually recall what they were. Give us a brief rundown of that.

923
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,880
One of the things that MRI absolutely loves is just the different acronyms for everything.

924
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,240
You got to have it.

925
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,680
It's almost like whoever can come up with the coolest acronym wins like lava and all these

926
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:39,320
other things. But effectively, there's three main categories of MRI sequencing. One is what we'll

927
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,960
call conventional. So conventional spin echo. And so that's basically just waiting as long as you can

928
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,040
for the hydrogen to completely relax and give off both its water and fat signal. And then we have

929
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,880
what's called gradient imaging. And so that's actually you're not waiting for it to completely

930
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,440
return back to normal, but somewhere in the middle, you're actually kind of repulsing again.

931
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,560
So you're basically hearing that noise of the machine turning back on and saying,

932
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,320
we're not going to wait until they completely relax. We're going to fire up again.

933
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,600
And just give us a sense of the actual time. How many milliseconds, if you're trying to get a T2

934
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,880
signal and you're waiting for that full relaxation, how many milliseconds is that? Directionally.

935
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,600
It's actually going to be, it can be up as high as like 60 milliseconds or even longer for some of

936
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:26,440
them. Okay. And when you do these gradient based tests where you're going to repulse, how quickly

937
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:31,880
are you repulsing? You can actually repulse in like two milliseconds or even faster. And then

938
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,360
there's actually the third category, which is actually called EPI or echo planar imaging.

939
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:41,080
And this is actually amazing. So this part actually allows you not just to be looking at

940
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:47,000
a single slice of a person, but you're actually going and you're actually now running multiple

941
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,400
slices simultaneously where you're actually putting two different fields on the person at

942
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:58,920
the same time. And so as a result, and it kind of gets complicated because we use the word gradient

943
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,720
all the time. And so what a gradient basically means it's effectively like a ramp from a low

944
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,800
number to a high number. And so if I was kind of looking at you and I sort of said, we're going to

945
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,280
start the image from your top down. First, we're going to put a gradient on from top to bottom.

946
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,640
So it's going to be a little bit of a higher frequency at the top, a little bit of a lower

947
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,120
frequency, lower down. And then we're actually also going to look at phase from right to left.

948
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,560
And depending on how your body is oriented and where the blood flow is going to be,

949
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,840
we're going to look at phase and frequency, which now bring us into the realm of a Fourier transform.

950
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:34,040
So these are now with the pulses, we're effectively looking at all these repetitive sign waves.

951
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,200
And we're actually plotting that in frequency and phase domain.

952
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:44,680
Right. And for the listener, we always talk that Laplace was only half the man Fourier was.

953
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:50,040
That's like the nerdiest math joke I'm going to tell today. All kidding aside, how does one

954
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:55,080
get into MRI radiology without a background in mathematics and physics? It seems it would be

955
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,640
impossible. It's a struggle. I can actually remember with the group of residents that I

956
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:05,000
was with training and great people that we actually had a physicist come in and was talking about MRI

957
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,240
physics for a couple of days and trying to teach us all. And I thought, boy, this guy's really

958
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,960
watering it down. I can barely hang on to what this guy's saying. Then I kind of looked and talked to

959
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,440
my colleagues and they were just bewildered. They had no idea what he was talking about,

960
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,440
because as far as an engineer is concerned, it's like Fourier domain, it's kind of like,

961
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,120
that's sort of like the alphabet. Yeah, that's our bread and butter back in the day. Yeah.

962
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,360
The difference with the MRIs that you start in this Fourier domain and because we're a three

963
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,680
dimensional object, when you're looking at a two dimensional plane, that's the Fourier transform.

964
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,600
When you now have that third dimension, it becomes what we call k space. So it's effectively a two

965
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,720
dimensional Fourier transform, which is what the MRI world operates on. It's called k space.

966
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:49,480
So what we're going to do in the show notes here is we're going to link to some very common types

967
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:54,440
of MRIs that people have, right? The most common ones that people have is you've tweaked your knee,

968
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:58,920
you're going to get the knee MRI, you've hurt your back, you're going to get the MRI of your back,

969
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,440
you're having headaches, they're going to do the MRI of the head, those sorts of things. So when

970
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,720
you think about the bread and butter clinical practice of medicine, what types of MRIs describe

971
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,280
what those three would be, what sequences would be run to. If you wanted to evaluate someone's ACL,

972
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,800
the ligament in the knee, what are you going to look at? The first thing you're going to do,

973
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,800
and this sort of relates back to the plane x-ray, you're always going to look at things in two

974
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,360
dimensions. You're going to look at two planes and in this case, and she'll be slicing from right to

975
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,880
left, top to bottom, side to side. And the beauty of the MRI is that based on how you orient your

976
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,000
gradients, you can easily slice those three directions or actually in any direction you want,

977
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,360
which is why we call it multi-planar. And so if we were to look at a simple thing, like a simple

978
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:45,640
image like a knee, so we always like our anatomy image. So that's our plane T1 because fat is

979
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,480
beautiful and it actually allows us to see everything really well. And it looks like what

980
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,400
we're actually accustomed to seeing. And so we do a T1 sequence and we'd also look at a T2 sequence

981
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:01,480
or a T2 fat sat sequence. And what that actually allows us to do is on a T2 fat sat, we actually

982
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,600
go with- That's fat saturation. Yeah. So T2 fat saturation, what we're doing is we're taking T2.

983
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,800
So now the T2 looks at two things, so fat and water, and then we actually suppress the fat. So

984
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,920
really all we're seeing is water. And why that's most interesting is because edema. So when there's

985
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,240
something going wrong in the body, almost anywhere, edema happens. It's like if you bang your hand

986
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,480
and it swells up, that swelling is edema. You injure your knee, it swells up, that's edema.

987
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,280
And so if you actually bang the bones on your knees, so you've actually injured the cartilage,

988
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,440
you're going to get edema happening in the ends of the bone as well as in the cartilage.

989
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:40,120
So that's where the T2 with fat saturation or removing the fat signal becomes so powerful

990
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,920
because it effectively now turns into a edema imager. And when we know when there's edema,

991
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,560
there's a problem. And that's kind of a simple concept in MRI that is quite often lost,

992
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,320
but it's very, very important. And then when you look at somebody's brain, for example,

993
01:23:53,880 --> 01:24:00,520
we just reviewed my MRI recently. So one thing that stands out, I think is the exquisite anatomic

994
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:06,680
detail you're getting that seems to look far better than it does in CT scan. And secondly,

995
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:15,320
it's the fact that without any contrast, you're able to see as though you did an angiogram on all

996
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:21,240
the vessels in my brain. Now, is that something that any MRI can do or is that just something

997
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:27,080
that the MRI here can do? Most MRIs should be able to do that. And so when we can sort of think back

998
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:32,840
to what an MRI is, so again, hydrone imager, but it's also a big powerful magnet. And so what makes

999
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:38,360
our blood red is actually the iron that's contained within it. So what you can actually do is you can

1000
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,600
take all the blood that's let's say flowing to a particular organ like the head. So anything that's

1001
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:48,120
flowing up and you say, okay, I'm going to actually excite anything going up north to the brain. And

1002
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:52,280
so therefore that's arteries. And so then you'll actually get to see all the exquisite arteries in

1003
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:58,760
your brain just by exciting that blood. I had never realized something so obvious as you just

1004
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:04,760
said it, but that's one part of the body where it's really easy. I mean, the limbs would be the same

1005
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:11,640
where directionally it's so clear, you know which way your magnet is oriented. You know which way

1006
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:18,040
is blood flow away from the heart. And you've got this beautiful iron floating around in water.

1007
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,560
Right. That's one of the beauties of MRI. It's that there's all these different things that you

1008
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,800
can actually add to it. And so not only that, you can actually excite anything flowing in one

1009
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,760
direction, but you can actually also pick off the frequency that's different between oxygenated

1010
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:36,680
arterial blood and deoxygenated venous blood. And so that comes into a different sequence called SWI

1011
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:41,720
or Susceptibility Weighted Imaging, where you can actually look at the deoxygenation status of

1012
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,440
venous blood and you can get spectacular contrast to the small blood vessels in the brain

1013
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:52,520
using that sequence. I remember the first time you did an MRI of my head. I don't know why I was

1014
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,040
more nervous about seeing that than anything else because we sort of remember the most extreme

1015
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:02,920
horrible stories, but I mean, I know people who have died of aneurysms. You and I were even

1016
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:09,000
speaking about a patient a few hours ago about this. I used to ride a bike with a guy who was

1017
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,160
maybe six years, seven years older than me and was at Disneyland one day with his kids and had a

1018
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:18,680
horrible headache and dropped dead. And he had an aneurysm, which is congenital. And so yeah,

1019
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:24,520
I was sort of like really nervous, even though I realized straight probability basis, the odds were

1020
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:30,360
quite low. They weren't zero. And I figured, well, it's better to find this now because you can treat

1021
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,640
these things electively quite easily. But once they rupture, the mortality is incredibly high.

1022
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:41,400
The mortality of a ruptured aneurysm is over 93 to 95%. So most people don't make it. Whereas

1023
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,920
when you do find them earlier, there's all sorts of options such as coiling where you can actually

1024
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,800
treat it or clipping. And so that's actually one of the real powers of being able to kind of see

1025
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,280
what's going on without any injection or anything like that. You can see the exquisite detail of

1026
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:58,200
the arteries. And if there is a problem, and we found a fair number of people with them,

1027
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,240
you can actually save their lives. What is the frequency? Admittedly, you have a,

1028
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:08,040
you could argue a somewhat biased population because they're more health conscious. Obviously,

1029
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:13,080
anyone who can afford to just pay for an MRI out of pocket is going to have a socioeconomic

1030
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,400
advantage. But if you argued that that's still a reasonable cross section of the population from a

1031
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,920
genetic standpoint, which is what we're basically asking, what is the prevalence you find of aneurysm

1032
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,240
in the brain? So when we actually scanned a thousand people, we actually found eight

1033
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:31,800
intracranial brain aneurysms, so 0.8%. That's higher than I would have guessed.

1034
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:36,440
Does the literature support that? The literature is actually a little bit less. And the question is,

1035
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,760
is that because you don't find them? Because basically people have passed away. And we don't

1036
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:45,320
know what happens to the elderly because if they pass away, it's natural causes.

1037
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:50,120
Yeah, we're not doing the autopsies. Now, there are other aneurysms that are not quite as lethal,

1038
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,720
but are really bad. And the two that I remember from residency were splenic artery aneurysms and

1039
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,360
popliteal artery aneurysms. Do you see those? And if so, at what frequency?

1040
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:05,000
We found only, I think, two splenic artery aneurysms, but they are particularly deadly.

1041
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:10,040
And now the popliteal arteries haven't seen many of those. I haven't seen those. And then those

1042
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:14,200
should be actually easier. You can palpate those on a thin enough individual. I was going to say

1043
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,280
those are actually easier to feel and to see and to look at, but we actually haven't found any of

1044
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,080
those. I'm kind of still shocked. That's a frightening statistic, Raj, to think that almost

1045
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,880
1% of the population has an aneurysm in their brain. And one of the things that we actually find

1046
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,360
though, and this may be showing the genetic component to it, is that when you find it in

1047
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,880
one person in the family, next thing you know, all their extended family's coming in,

1048
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,840
they want to know what's going on. We looked into this three years ago. I have a patient,

1049
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:46,760
a young woman, probably in her late 30s. Her mother died very young when she was very young.

1050
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,920
The patient was very young and the mother herself was quite young from an aneurysm.

1051
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:55,400
It was not in the brain, but I'll for the sake of trying to protect her confidentiality. I'll

1052
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,320
refrain from saying what part of the body it was. And then when we dug into her family history

1053
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:04,200
further, we found another person who had died of an aneurysm in yet a different part of the body.

1054
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,840
So not aortic where you normally see that linked to atherosclerosis, but a different major vessel.

1055
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,680
And our team did a bit of work on this and actually found evidence that there really was

1056
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:22,040
potentially a genetic component here. And so we petitioned her insurance company to pay for an MRA,

1057
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,720
a magnetic resonance angiography, which is basically what we're talking about here.

1058
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:30,280
And they declined it, which really irked me. And we fought with her insurance company for

1059
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:35,000
six months to get this paid and they denied it and they denied it and they denied it. And finally,

1060
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,200
the woman just paid out of pocket for it. And I was blown away at how much it cost. Do you want

1061
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:45,560
to take a guess at how much it costs to get an MRA in the United States? I've seen some interesting

1062
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:53,640
pricing. It was $9,000. Wow. Wow. That's unbelievable. Yeah. And it was negative. So we

1063
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,880
were happy and she was obviously fortunate enough to be able to afford that. But it upset me that

1064
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:03,240
we couldn't make a case to the insurance company that two people, one first degree, one second

1065
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:09,640
degree related to this woman who died from an aneurysm young. And they were like, yeah, that's cool.

1066
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:14,840
Wow. That's a tragedy. So let's come back to now what you do here,

1067
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,080
Raj, because I've been around a lot of MRI. And if we bring this story back full circle

1068
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,960
four years ago or whenever we were introduced, the question that was asked of me was, hey,

1069
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:28,920
is this thing kind of cool or what? And I came up here and I spent the full day with you and

1070
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,040
I thought, yeah, boy, this is really cool. But so many things that you were doing just seemed

1071
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:40,200
counter to what we were seeing in the big shot hospitals. And for starters, you were using a

1072
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:46,680
puny magnet, right? So one of the things hospitals love to brag about is the size of their magnet,

1073
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:51,560
right? I'm going to just try not to name any hospitals and offend everyone, but pick your

1074
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:58,280
favorite institution. We've got the newest four Tesla magnet. That probably was in the top five

1075
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:02,920
questions I asked you. Oh, so what size magnet are you using? And you said, we're using a 1.5

1076
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:10,360
Tesla magnet. And I said, oh, that's interesting. That seems a little bit JV. So explain why you

1077
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:16,200
use a magnet that is not at the peak of what you're capable of just from a technology standpoint.

1078
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,040
Well, it really sort of depends on like, basically how you tune a magnet. So actually

1079
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,880
kind of view of magnet is very much like a smartphone. If you actually build the right

1080
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:29,400
hardware, you can actually really get it to sing and do an amazing job. And so with a 3T magnet,

1081
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:33,320
one of the things is you can get some pretty exquisite imaging as you see quite commonly.

1082
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:37,560
And really, there's a lot of bragging rights associated with it. We're not much of braggers up

1083
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:42,680
here. We just actually want to do the best imaging we can and actually tune the machine as optimally

1084
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:47,480
as possible. So with a 3T magnet, one of the things that actually commonly happens is that

1085
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,880
when you look at the wavelength of a 3T, because remember, it's electromagnetic fields actually go

1086
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:58,920
hand in hand. And those are actually wavelengths. And so the 3T wavelength is roughly 15 centimeters.

1087
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:04,520
So it's the width of your head. 1.5 is roughly 30 centimeters. So it's the width of most people's

1088
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:09,160
shoulders. So as a result, you actually start to get a lot more penetration with a lower field

1089
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:14,440
magnet. And so that way, you're actually able to see things quite well when you're particularly

1090
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:19,480
having everything tuned to that particular wavelength. And quite commonly, when people

1091
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:24,840
are purchasing machines, they just don't know the physics of how the static magnetic field,

1092
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:31,320
the gradient magnetic fields, the coils, and there's roughly about 150 parameters per T1,

1093
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:36,520
T2, fat saturation sequence that you can actually adjust to make it work the way you need it.

1094
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:41,480
And most of the time, what commonly happens almost everywhere is that you'll have the

1095
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:46,440
vendor will actually come in and set the standard parameters. And from there on, it's kind of like,

1096
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:51,640
let's make it as simple as possible, push a button. And that's kind of not what I do. We don't want

1097
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,680
to just push buttons, we actually want to understand how it all works, how it can be optimized to the

1098
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,920
person that's coming in, and how the entire system from front to back is optimized. So we're

1099
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:05,560
maximizing our signal to noise. And when you maximize your signal to noise, that's when you

1100
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:11,240
actually really get a lot of speed and detail. And that's where one of the real values of being

1101
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:16,360
able to talk engineering or physics with an MRI physicist, and also then put on your clinical hat

1102
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:20,040
and kind of saying, well, this is what I want to see, this is the level of detail I need,

1103
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,600
and the level of resolution that you can really tune the machine to where you want it to be.

1104
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,120
To me, of course, that was the analogy you came up with. The first one that jumps to my mind is

1105
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:35,240
looking at sort of the heyday of F1 in the late 80s and early 90s when the cars had become

1106
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:42,600
monsters. So if you look at the McLaren MP4-4, which is regarded as either the greatest or

1107
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,680
second greatest Formula One car in history, the only other car that could probably rival it would

1108
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:53,240
be the 1993 Williams. It had a 1.5 liter engine, so for any gearhead listening, that's a really

1109
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:58,600
tiny engine. Like your Prius probably has a bigger engine than a 1.5 liter engine, and yet it produced

1110
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:07,400
1200 horsepower redlining at something like 15,000 RPM. And I just remember being a boy,

1111
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:13,320
being so obsessed with that, like how could that possibly happen? And I remember looking at my

1112
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:19,800
dad's station wagon, which had like a five liter Chevy block in it and thinking, how is this thing

1113
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,880
so inferior? But in the end, like you can engineer, I mean, I think the technical term is you can

1114
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:30,360
engineer the shit out of anything, right? That would be... Exactly, and that's exactly what it is,

1115
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:35,080
and it's very analogous to the Formula One. And a lot of people kind of, they're more into the

1116
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,000
bragging rights of like the bigger, the bigger, the bigger. It's not always bigger. It's kind of

1117
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,720
like if you really understand what you're doing and want to get underneath the hood, you can take

1118
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:49,160
that 1.5 liter engine, you can put the turbochargers on it, you can put, you know, like the multiple

1119
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:55,000
valves and everything to actually get the torque and horsepower you want out of it. But most people

1120
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,600
don't think that way. They think bigger is better. How did you do all this tinkering? Because you

1121
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:06,920
basically have here in Vancouver a piece of hardware that doesn't exist anywhere else in the

1122
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:13,160
world, and you've layered on top of that software that is now also in a league of its own, and that's

1123
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,760
even more complicated. I just am interested in this hardware. I mean, one of the things that

1124
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,400
I send a number of patients here, and usually the first question they ask is, why are you sending me

1125
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:27,080
to Vancouver? Like, I live in, fill in the blank, some city in the United States, we do everything

1126
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:33,160
the best. There's no way, Peter, you're telling me there's an MRI in Vancouver. In fact, I told

1127
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:38,040
my parents the other day I was coming to Vancouver to get the MRI, and they live, you could almost

1128
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:44,360
hear them looking at me through the phone like, why are you coming to Canada? So, I mean, not to

1129
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:48,840
toot your horn too much, but you're doing something very different, Raj. So how did you

1130
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:55,800
go through this process of tinkering with the 150 variables at your disposal to come up with this

1131
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:02,840
super custom pimped out hardware that doesn't resemble anything else on the planet?

1132
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,240
So part of it is, it's like the biggest problem with me is that I'm an engineer in medicine.

1133
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,440
And so when I kind of go through, it's like I say, well, what do I want to know? What do I want to

1134
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,840
see? And how do I make it work? And so I kind of start at sort of the back end and say, okay,

1135
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,920
what I want to know is exactly what's going on everywhere in the body and what are the different

1136
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,480
sequences that are going to get me there. And then I kind of work backwards. And then this is where

1137
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:30,920
you put your engineering or physics hat on. And you actually wind up starting to talk to like the

1138
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:36,440
MRI physicists who are, there's a plethora of them, they're almost everywhere. And they love to talk

1139
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,480
to doctors, but just most of the time, doctors can't talk to them or vice versa. And that's when

1140
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,480
you start to really kind of get under the hood and really kind of understand how to make this work.

1141
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:50,280
And then you travel around to different academic centers or different places. And you wind up

1142
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:55,320
spending time with the people who actually really understand the hardware. And those are mainly the

1143
01:36:55,320 --> 01:37:00,360
physicists, very similar to a mechanic. It's like if you want to figure out how to make your five

1144
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,560
liter behave like 1000 horsepower, you talk to the mechanics, you know how to do it. Don't try it

1145
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:09,560
yourself, right? They've already been there. They've seen it. They've worked on things forever. And

1146
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,640
that's actually how a lot of it happens. And so we would actually be having some of the

1147
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:19,320
top MRI physicists sort of saying, Hey, Raj, can you test as we wrote the sequence? And a sequence

1148
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:24,520
is basically like a filter, like a T1 or a T2 or a fat saturation. Can you try it out and kind of

1149
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,680
see how it works? So we'd go and try it out. Usually on me as a subject, because I also know

1150
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:33,720
what I'm looking for. And then we'd have a feedback loop, one or two of my MRI technologists here who

1151
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,200
would actually sort of push the buttons and run the machine. And we'd see what it would give me.

1152
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:42,280
And I knew from all the other imaging training that I would have what I would be looking for

1153
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,120
so I put my nuclear medicine hat on and say, okay, from a functional point of view, this is what I

1154
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:50,120
want to see. Then I put my radiology hat and say, this is what I want to see from an imaging

1155
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:55,000
perspective. And let's define that a little bit. I mean, objective is important. So when you went

1156
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,720
about this process, what were you optimizing for? Were you interested primarily in detection of

1157
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:04,120
cancer or what was the problem you wanted to solve clinically? The first thing I wanted to do is so

1158
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:08,200
when we talk about the nuclear medicine, so when we're injecting somebody with radioactivity, we

1159
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:12,040
want to basically optimize that dose that we're giving to somebody. So that means we want to cover

1160
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:16,120
everything from head to foot. We don't want to just look at an individual body part. And we want

1161
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:19,960
to see how it all works. Then we go to radiology. Typically, we're just doing a snapshot of an

1162
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:25,240
individual part like a head or a neck or a torso. And so I kind of thought, well, all these MRI

1163
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:29,960
machines that are out there, all they're doing is looking at individual body parts. And I thought,

1164
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:35,560
if I customize this hardware with a few things that might allow me to move people around,

1165
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:40,360
while they're on the table, while they're laying there, will I maybe be able to connect the head

1166
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:45,400
with the neck with the chest with the abdomen. And so actually, when I bought the hardware myself,

1167
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:51,560
I kind of put together probably about 50 options that the vendors kind of said, you're crazy. We've

1168
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:56,200
never seen any of this stuff, just with the thought that, you know, I think this might work. This is

1169
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,400
where I was kind of looking at all the different options and kind of knew what they could possibly

1170
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:04,520
do. And I thought, if I build this hardware, I'm going to do it. And I thought, well, I'm going to

1171
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:11,400
build this hardware this this way. Will it work? And it was a complete guess, but an educated guess.

1172
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:18,200
And then once I put that hardware together, then we started to test and test and did more and more.

1173
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:22,600
Then we would start talking to more physicists, the vendors themselves actually have a lot of

1174
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:28,280
good resources with very technologically capable people. And when I started to put this together,

1175
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,400
then I kind of thought, okay, what would I want? If I'm a patient, what would I want to know?

1176
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:37,320
Well, number one, I'd want to know that my brain's okay. I'd want to know that the arteries in my

1177
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:42,040
brain are okay, they're not going to rupture. And then I basically want to say, whenever I go into

1178
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:47,160
any test or anybody goes into the doctor and gets any kind of imaging test of any kind. The first

1179
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,200
question of their mind is, do I have cancer? Yes or no. And in nuclear medicine, most of the tests

1180
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,320
are binary, we can actually answer that with a yes or no. In radiology, it's not so clear. It's

1181
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,640
kind of like, maybe, and you're actually kind of playing more statistics, like probably not.

1182
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:06,600
And I thought, how do I marry these two together? And this is where MRI becomes a beautiful machine

1183
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,080
and the fact that it actually allows you to take that yes or no binary answer of functional

1184
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,120
nuclear medicine and combine it with the anatomic localization and understanding of

1185
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:21,640
tissue types that radiology has. And so I merged those two together on the one machine.

1186
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:25,080
And what is the functional arm that you've brought into it?

1187
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:29,080
Yeah, so the functional arm is actually an area that's actually growing a lot in academia. It's

1188
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:33,720
actually called DWI or DWIBs, which stands for diffusion-weighted imaging with background

1189
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:39,560
subtraction. And so what we're doing with DWIBs is that we're actually looking at water at two

1190
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:44,280
points in time. And so we're actually looking at it within about 60 microseconds of water motion.

1191
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,320
And so by doing that, what happens is that you first look at water at one point in time,

1192
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:53,080
and then you look at it at the second point in time. And if it hasn't moved,

1193
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,840
it's because it's not allowed to move. It's effectively trapped between walls.

1194
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,560
And so that could be because of the fact there's a tight cell membrane, or it could be because

1195
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,840
components of a cell are preventing that water from moving.

1196
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,320
What's the time gap between those two samples?

1197
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:08,600
Six microseconds.

1198
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,680
Wow. And so when you see that something isn't moving, when you see that water is being forced

1199
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:20,920
to be stationary as opposed to moving according to the stochastic prediction you have, what do you

1200
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,080
infer clinically about that tissue?

1201
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,600
So as soon as you start to see that water is being prevented from moving, that means that

1202
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,920
there's basically going to be a high density of cells there, so a big cluster of cells.

1203
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:36,200
And so it's very much like I actually call it the lump detector. So it's basically like they tell

1204
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,960
women for breast cancer, feel for a lump. And basically when you're feeling for a lump,

1205
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:44,600
that's a hard spot. And so the reason it's hard is because you have this increased cellular density.

1206
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:49,320
And so with that increased cellular density, that's where water is restricted from moving.

1207
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:54,760
And that's what DWI or diffusion weighted imaging does. And why it's called DWI is because the

1208
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:59,480
fixed log diffusion basically means that the normal diffusion of water allowing it to move a

1209
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,240
lot is being completely restricted and it just doesn't have the ability to move.

1210
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,040
You know, I usually tell patients about this part of the MRI,

1211
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:11,000
telling them something that I think many people outside of medicine would find surprising.

1212
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,240
When you do what's called a laparotomy, when you open up a person's abdomen and let's say they

1213
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:19,880
have colon cancer. So the colonoscopy has confirmed that, of course, you have a biopsy.

1214
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,040
So now you're going in to do an operation to remove their colon, but you still have another

1215
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,640
step along the way, which is you have to complete what's called staging. You have to

1216
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:32,440
ask the question, has this cancer spread? So usually the first thing you're doing is you're

1217
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:37,480
running your hand along parts of the abdomen. You can't even visualize the entire surface of the

1218
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:42,120
liver, even behind the liver, something you won't see. It's actually unmistakable what cancer feels

1219
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:50,040
like because it is so in contrast to what normal tissue feels like. And even the colon, before you

1220
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:56,040
cut it out, if you just reach in and pick up a piece of the ascending colon, it's not remotely

1221
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:02,440
subtle where the cancer is. It's entirely obvious just based on the firmness of the tissue. And even

1222
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:06,680
when I talk to surgeons who operate on parts of the body that I didn't operate on, such as the

1223
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,320
prostate or things like that, it's the same thing. And the example you give with breast is perfect.

1224
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:19,880
And so it really is this amazing ability to pair exquisite anatomic detail at resolutions that will

1225
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:25,640
discuss, but basically now approaching one by one by one millimeter resolution anatomically

1226
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:31,480
with now this functional property of firmness. Is that an accurate statement? It definitely is. So

1227
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:36,360
we're actually combining the anatomic and functional and that's where just like the on the PET-CT,

1228
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:41,240
where that famous one plus one equals three is exactly what we're doing. And the beauty of it

1229
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:47,080
is there's absolutely no radiation, so there's no risk. So the risk it seems, because one of the

1230
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:52,520
things I do explain to patients is who should consider doing this. And my view with cancer

1231
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:57,640
screening is just a very personalized decision. I don't think it is for everybody to do the kind

1232
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:02,440
of stuff that I do or that a number of my patients who you've now scanned have done over the past

1233
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:09,000
three or four years. And when people say, is there a harm of doing this outside of the probably rare,

1234
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,080
rare event of getting a migraine headache triggered by the magnet, I say there is a harm,

1235
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:18,600
the harm of a false positive. The harm is that we see something that turns out in the long run to

1236
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:25,800
not be cancer, but in the process of going down the advanced diagnostic pathway to get there,

1237
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:32,440
you are either physically harmed by something we do subsequently, for example, another biopsy or a

1238
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:40,680
biopsy or a subsequent biopsy. And of course, the emotional toll it takes on you to see a shadow in

1239
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:45,000
this part of your body and have to sit there and have a discussion about what it could be, what

1240
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,720
it's probably a cyst, but it might be a tumor. We probably need to do follow. I mean, to me,

1241
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:55,240
this gets back to where we were a while ago on the discussion of sensitivity and specificity.

1242
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:59,000
Right. So if somebody came along and said, I have a test that is 100%

1243
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:07,400
sensitive, but only 50% specific, I'd throw it in the wastebasket. I mean, it would serve virtually

1244
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:12,440
no purpose for reasons I could walk the listener through in terms of positive and negative

1245
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:19,240
predictive value. So when you think about the sensitivity and specificity of the technology

1246
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:23,000
that you've developed here, which again, we haven't even really done justice to getting into, we've

1247
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,600
talked a little bit about the hardware. We haven't even got to the software. I'd love to talk about

1248
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,600
that a little bit. Do you think about sensitivity and specificity by tissue type, by cancer type?

1249
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:37,400
How do you in your mind wrap your head around that? So typically, the way I kind of look at it

1250
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:41,640
is really almost organ by organ when we're actually kind of going through, for example, in the liver,

1251
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,680
basically the simple thing we want to kind of know, is there a problem? Yes or no? Like really,

1252
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:52,040
that's the simplicity that the average person and I put myself in that category wants to know,

1253
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:56,040
do I have a problem to worry about? And that's where I kind of say by combining this functional

1254
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:01,720
as well as an anatomic imaging together, we're actually really able to nail that down. So in our

1255
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,800
thousand people that we did, the fascinating thing about this is all these people who actually

1256
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,560
followed them up and actually talked to them and kind of found out what happened. And so we actually

1257
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:13,560
had two false positives. So these were two people where we kind of thought, okay, there's a problem

1258
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:19,240
here that you need to get addressed further by their further imaging and see what's going on.

1259
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:24,680
And of those two false positives, one was a male with asymmetric breast tissue. So we actually just

1260
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:29,880
had one sided breast tissue. We didn't know what it was. It's like, so meaning you, he came out of

1261
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:34,120
the MRI and you believed he had breast cancer, which most listeners might think is odd, but it

1262
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:38,840
turns out men can get breast cancer. It's just virtually and exceedingly rare. Exactly. But

1263
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:43,800
that's basically the DWI showed a difference in density between one breast and the other. Yeah.

1264
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:48,840
And so we're like, why is that? Most of the time when men actually have gynecomastia or they have

1265
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:54,680
breast tissue, it's usually bilateral because it's hormonal, but to have unilateral is somewhat odd.

1266
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:59,320
And so as a result, we sent this person to an ultrasound, which is a commonly done,

1267
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:03,560
and they too had no idea. And so they actually also made the call to biopsy that came back as

1268
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,440
normal breast glandular tissue in a male. So let's talk just about the harm there. So

1269
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:13,960
emotionally that man probably spent a series of, oh, if it was in Canada a year, if it was in the

1270
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:18,600
United States a week, being stressed out about this, or I just can't help but take digs at your

1271
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,400
healthcare system as you take digs at ours. No, I'm totally teasing. So there's a legitimate

1272
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,640
emotional strain here, which I don't think anybody who's known someone who's gone through that, or

1273
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:31,080
who's gone through that themselves, you just can't deny this. And I've not lived it personally,

1274
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:36,040
but I've seen it and it's very difficult. And then secondly, he had to get a procedure. He had

1275
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:40,520
to get a needle stuck into his breast tissue. And look, that's on the scale of procedures.

1276
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:45,560
That's still pretty minor, but it's not trivial. So what was the second case?

1277
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:50,200
And so the second case was actually a woman who basically had a seat belt injury to her breast

1278
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:54,760
and actually wound up having an unusual scar that had actually trapped fluid in it. And so this

1279
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:58,840
person actually should have, but never did actually have any mammograms because that would

1280
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,400
have led to the same conclusion that we don't know what this is. So that was the second case where

1281
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:06,840
it's kind of like, there's something unusual going on in this breast. We don't know what it is,

1282
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:10,920
but we didn't actually have any proper history from her. And so we said-

1283
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,720
How old was she?

1284
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,720
She would have been late fifties.

1285
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,040
A woman in her late fifties had never had a mammogram?

1286
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,560
Surprise. It's out there.

1287
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,440
Even in Canada?

1288
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,960
Even in Canada, yeah.

1289
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,920
That in and of itself is very hard to believe in a country where-

1290
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,960
It's free, yeah.

1291
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,200
And then what would bring that patient in to get a whole body MRI?

1292
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:32,200
The person actually kind of felt that, I just want to know where I'm at. And it's like,

1293
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:36,520
I don't believe in the radiation from mammography and I keep trying to tell them, look, it's so

1294
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:41,400
minimal that the benefit outweighs the risks. But they're like, I want the MRI instead because,

1295
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,600
number one, patients kind of know that it's the most detailed exam you can get.

1296
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:49,560
And as well, there's no radiation. So we actually had the patient and it's kind of like, yes,

1297
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:54,840
there's this, I don't really know what this is going on here. So we sent them off to a facility

1298
01:48:54,840 --> 01:49:00,280
that does nothing but women's imaging and they too didn't know what it was. And so they stuck a

1299
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,280
needle in it and it actually came back as a-

1300
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:03,560
It was something fibrous.

1301
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:07,480
Exactly. It was actually trapped scar tissue. And at that point when we'd spoken to a woman

1302
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,880
afterwards, we're like, did you ever have trauma? Like, why would you have scar to that area?

1303
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,640
And it's like, oh yeah, I was in a bad car accident. And that was it. It was a seatbelt scar.

1304
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:21,160
Those are two pretty interesting false negatives, right? Both breast, men, women. I would have

1305
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:27,720
always maybe guessed or been most concerned about the false positives that occur deeper in the body.

1306
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:32,680
I always tell patients, the call I'm always most afraid of getting is the little shadow in the

1307
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:38,200
pancreas where you just don't know, is this adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which of course is

1308
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:43,320
something that if you're lucky, you can resect it. And if you're even luckier, you can survive it.

1309
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:47,160
And I guess that's the only shot you're going to have at surviving pancreatic cancer is an

1310
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,920
incidental finding. Really don't think anybody that presents with pancreatic cancer is going

1311
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:56,280
to survive it, at least not as an adenocarcinoma. But then you worry about, well, what if it's

1312
01:49:56,280 --> 01:50:00,120
something that turns out not to be cancer and you hear these horror stories. There's a very famous

1313
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:05,240
one, I believe at Stanford several years ago where a woman went to a sort of drive-by CT clinic,

1314
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:11,240
got a CT scan, showed something in the pancreas. She ended up going to get a biopsy and I believe

1315
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:17,480
it was an ERCP, added biopsy. One complication led to another, led to another, she died of sepsis.

1316
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:21,400
And by the way, it turned out she didn't have pancreatic cancer. I don't know that firsthand.

1317
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:26,120
So that might be a bit of a wives tale stretch, but certainly that's a very popular story in the

1318
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:30,440
Bay area, but it's the cautionary tale, right? Definitely it is. And that's kind of where the

1319
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:35,000
real value of actually having MRI as opposed to CT comes in. And the fact that when we're looking

1320
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,720
at organs, particularly like the pancreas or any of the visceral solid organs, we're looking at

1321
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:44,040
about seven different filters, looking at it different ways, top to bottom, front to back,

1322
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:48,120
to really be able to see what's going on. And that's where what we call contrast density

1323
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:53,240
becomes really important in the fact that when we're actually looking at the pancreas in particular,

1324
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:57,800
we can actually pick out the pancreatic duct as well as a bowel duct and be able to see that just

1325
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:02,200
standing out against the rest of the organ. And one of the first most common things that pancreatic

1326
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,320
cancer likes to do is to actually start to block that duct. And so that's why when ERCPs are done,

1327
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:12,200
they're actually looking for cells of pancreatic cancer. And an ERCP is basically when they go

1328
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:17,640
down into the mouth and the esophagus and they actually go and take a trace of fluid from the

1329
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:23,560
pancreatic bowel duct. So one of the other things that kind of amazes me when we go through these

1330
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:27,640
images here is when we've talked a little bit about the hardware though, actually I kind of

1331
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:31,000
want to come back and ask more hardware questions, but it's almost like you've created your own

1332
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:37,400
software now as well. I had never seen this. Is it commercially available to have that rotating

1333
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:43,880
diffusion weighted image map? Is that a commercially available piece of software or did you guys make

1334
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:49,720
that? We actually built that as a display tool and that's actually effectively taking a page of the

1335
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:54,920
nuclear medicine positron emission tomography or PET CT handbook. And the reason why we actually

1336
01:51:54,920 --> 01:52:00,280
put it together is because it actually allows you an effectively a pretty efficient viewing to be

1337
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,960
able to see what's going on through the entire body. It's almost like making a transparent person

1338
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:09,560
and where basically any of the black spots that stand out would be the hard spots or the firm

1339
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:16,600
areas. And the one that we just looked at earlier, I remember you saying that if I understood you

1340
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:22,200
correctly, one of the advantages of using a quote unquote low power magnet like you're using is you

1341
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,240
don't have any of the gaps in the spine. You've got this everything that you showed on that rotating

1342
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:33,720
diffusion weighted image. You had the dark brain, obviously full of firm fluid and then you have this

1343
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:39,240
dark beautiful tail coming out of it which is the spinal fluid but it was perfectly smooth.

1344
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:43,240
Right and that's actually one of the important things because magnets actually have a lot of

1345
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:48,600
homogeneity problems we call them in the fact that you want it to be perfect so that the field

1346
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:53,000
in between the top and the bottom and the left and the right are identical. And as soon as you

1347
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:57,240
put a person in there that comes in various sizes and shapes, they actually distort that magnetic

1348
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:02,680
field. And the sweet spot for the magnetic field is perfectly in the center. And so when we put all

1349
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:06,920
these protocols and built all these things, we actually built it for different body shapes and

1350
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:11,640
we can actually go and tune it for all these body shapes so that the goal is that no matter what

1351
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:16,120
when we're doing these rotating images that it looks like a normal person, not a segmented piece

1352
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:20,280
of a person. Yeah, it's funny you say that you took a playbook out of the PET CT. That's exactly

1353
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:25,960
what it looks like. It looks just like you're looking at the FDG PET juxtaposed with the CT.

1354
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:30,600
Right and that's the entire purpose and so that's where I talk about the MRI being this tool that

1355
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:35,640
can actually combine functional imaging of in this case DWBS or DWI diffusion weighted imaging.

1356
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,640
And the MRI being the equivalent to the CT which is far more tissue weightings in detail.

1357
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:47,480
It's where the one plus one equals three. Now if the radiation didn't bother you of a whole body

1358
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:55,000
PET CT and of course it should bother you because a whole body PET CT would be more than 50% of your,

1359
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,720
it'd be probably close to 80% of your annual allotment of radiation, right? If not more.

1360
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:03,960
It'd be quite high, yeah. Depending on if you live at altitude or where you live,

1361
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,960
right? So if you're at sea level, you'd probably be allowed one a year maximum if not one every

1362
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:17,320
two years. Yeah, so putting aside that issue which is not trivial, what advantage do you think that

1363
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:25,080
the MRI with DWI has over the PET CT? And where does the PET CT have an advantage? So if you go

1364
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:31,400
either by histology, by tissue, by tumor type. With the PET CT with radioactive glucose, one of

1365
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:36,120
the areas that actually doesn't work very well at all is the brain and the MRI is always known as

1366
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:40,920
like the best image of the brain. The PET CT you can actually miss things in the brain because

1367
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:45,560
what you're looking for with the radioactive glucose is areas of increased glucose utilization

1368
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:51,240
and the brain in particular is a glucose, that's all I can use unless you're in ketosis.

1369
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:58,040
And then the other problem is that the glucose is then excreted by the kidneys and so the kidneys

1370
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:02,760
now become difficult to see because they're actually full of glucose and as is the bladder,

1371
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:07,320
you can't see a thing in the bladder because it's full of the accumulated glucose. As well in the

1372
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:12,520
prostate, prostate is very, very poorly perfused and as a result, it doesn't get a lot of glucose

1373
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:18,200
coming to it and so PET is actually almost entirely useless with FDG at looking at the

1374
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:25,320
prostate. Diffusion-weighted image of the prostate coupled with the more advanced molecular tests,

1375
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:31,560
the 4k as an example of a blood test, in my mind have totally revolutionized the way we think about

1376
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:38,920
prostate cancer. So we now have a blood test that produces much better resolution than just a PSA

1377
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,640
but more importantly we have this MRI and even in a practice as small as mine, I have had two

1378
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:57,320
patients for whom PSA is high, 4k comes back high. So these are patients who now have a 20% chance,

1379
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:03,960
maybe 16, 18, 20% chance of having cancer in their prostate or having metastatic cancer over the next

1380
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:08,680
two decades. That's basically what the high 4k tells you. In the olden days, we would have just

1381
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:15,320
biopsied them and now we run them through this MRI and the answer is nope, that's totally fine.

1382
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:19,960
Right and then that's actually where MRI becomes very, very powerful particularly with the DWI and

1383
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:25,400
and I think in many countries it's now coming to US and becoming more popular but in Australia,

1384
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:30,840
in Europe, particularly UK, Scandinavia, it's actually the de facto standard. Basically almost

1385
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,240
all men are actually getting screened with MRI. Wait, wait, wait, did you say in Europe and

1386
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:41,080
Australia? Yeah, they're actually doing it with a DWI and so how is that even possible that countries

1387
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:46,840
with single payer socialized medicine could use an MRI for a screening tool? I mean that would be

1388
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,680
unheard of in Canada, wouldn't it? Well, you know, we just don't have the access to the number of

1389
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:54,360
machines here but I think one of the things that people are actually finding with screening for the

1390
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,920
prostate is that all men are either going to die with or from prostate cancer and so you really

1391
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,760
want to be able to separate those out and up until MRI with DWI came into effect, there was no real

1392
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:10,520
way to do that so you'd be doing PSA or 4k and all that would do is say, yeah, there's an increased

1393
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:16,040
risk of something going on but is it going on? So PSA in particular, it can actually be elevated for

1394
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:21,320
three reasons, one prostate cancer, the other one inflammation or prostatitis and then the third

1395
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:25,400
being enlarged prostate and so if it was up for any of those causes then you would actually go and

1396
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:30,760
take a biopsy which actually comes with risks but the whole idea is that all the staging was

1397
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:35,720
based on that tissue sample whereas what's happening very similar to the breast is kind

1398
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:40,600
of like a lot of people are saying, well, treating this is like a big deal, I don't want the biopsy

1399
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:45,000
and people get a choice of what they want to do and a lot of men are saying, look, I want to see

1400
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,560
what's going on, I want to see if there's going to be a change and if it actually starts to grow or

1401
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:53,720
something's growing in the prostate at an accelerated rate, that's when I want to deal with it whereas

1402
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:57,960
if it's actually just there and holding still and not changing much, I'm not going to worry about it

1403
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:03,160
because something else may take me first. Is DWI going to have the same effect on breast cancer? In

1404
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:09,320
other words, if you could put resources aside for a moment, if a woman could have a mammogram and a

1405
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:16,200
DWI MRI and it's important to point out that you can't eliminate mammography because we're going to

1406
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:21,480
come to this but MRI has its own blind spots and small calcifications would be a blind spot but

1407
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:29,240
with those two tests, mammogram and DWI MRI done the way you guys are doing it, not just off the

1408
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:33,960
shelf, are you going to miss breast cancer in those situations? Pretty unlikely and actually there's

1409
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:38,600
been a couple of really nice big studies that have finally started to come out from groups at UCSF

1410
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:42,920
and as well at Sloan Kettering, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, they've actually shown that.

1411
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:47,080
You did your fellowship at Memorial, didn't you? I was actually there for quite a while actually

1412
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:53,240
doing PET CT. Amazing institution, absolutely amazing but what's actually come out of the MRI

1413
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:59,880
group is that basically if you actually use DWI with MRI, you actually are as sensitive as giving

1414
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:05,000
a contrast injection breast MRI but that's diffusion done right and the problem is out of

1415
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,080
the box, it's not always done right. Yeah, that's the challenge I think for the patient, right?

1416
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:15,480
Is the patients, look, you kind of need a PhD in physics, let's be honest, to really understand

1417
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:21,880
the nuances of MRI. I consider myself pretty technically smart when it comes to the physics

1418
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:29,240
of this stuff and I would not feel competent to try to differentiate or even parse out the differences

1419
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:34,680
between scanners. In fact, anytime I'm sending my patients to a scanner, I sort of have to rely on

1420
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:39,320
other people to help me. I have to reach out to experts and say, hey, my patient has to get this

1421
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:43,880
scan done in New York or in San Francisco or LA, is this the best we got? If they're not going to

1422
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:48,280
get on a plane and go to someplace where I know exactly what they're going to get. That's a

1423
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:52,520
significant challenge, right? Because people are going to listen to this and think, okay, well,

1424
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:56,680
as long as it's diffusion weighted imaging MRI, it's perfect. Yeah, and that's actually the biggest

1425
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:01,160
problem with MRI. Earlier on, we talked about CT having units of Hounsfield, like Hounsfield

1426
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:06,360
units to actually sort of calibrate and standardize them. Unfortunately, MRI has no standardization

1427
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:12,120
whatsoever and there's actually a movement called KIBA or quantitative imaging biomarkers alliance.

1428
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:17,160
It's a component of the radiology society of North America that's actually really trying to push

1429
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:21,960
to standardize the amount of signal to noise coming off of MRI machines with the goal that

1430
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:27,080
if you actually get a scan at one site or another site, the image quality is the same. Right now,

1431
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:34,760
it's really not that at all and really is sort of caveat emptor. Look out. So right now, if somebody

1432
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:43,400
goes to Shreveport and gets a 256 slice CT scanner on a Siemens PICUR favorite model

1433
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:49,640
and they do the same thing in Seattle, you can share those data across radiologists and it can

1434
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:55,320
be made to look identical. Your acquisition is the same. Relatively. So what I mean by that is that

1435
02:00:55,320 --> 02:01:01,080
the actual amount of signal on your film or on your screen, water is going to be zero. And so

1436
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,920
the Hounfield unit is always going to be exactly calibrated. So what's the opposition? I mean,

1437
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:09,160
that seems like a no brainer. What is the opposition to doing this with MR? It actually

1438
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:13,160
relies on the vendors coming together. And a few years ago, we actually spoke with a bunch of the

1439
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:16,040
vendors and saying, you know, look, why don't you guys do this, particularly for diffusion,

1440
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:21,960
where it's actually so important because this is such a new and powerful sequence. And they all

1441
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,880
kind of came back and said, well, you guys write a white paper and then we'll implement what you

1442
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:31,080
said. And this is fortunately starting to move forward with this organization, Kibab of RSNA,

1443
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:37,320
and they're doing it organ by organ. So there is a bit of a standardization for prostate, for liver,

1444
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:41,880
and as well breast is now coming out. And that was actually the breast was led by

1445
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:46,520
group out of University of Washington. And the overall leader for this is a person named Michael

1446
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:51,960
Boss out of now he's American College of Radiology. And this needs to move forward because otherwise

1447
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,320
people have no idea what they're getting. And it's really sad because even if you

1448
02:01:55,320 --> 02:02:01,080
walk down the streets, for example, in a place like New York, I used to live literally 20 feet

1449
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:07,560
from a MRI shop. And they had all these sort of images and what I consider just sort of bogus

1450
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:12,440
propaganda all over their window, like, why go down a memorial and get your MRI there when you

1451
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:16,760
can come here and do a standing MRI? It's comfortable, it's fast, and blah, blah, blah.

1452
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:21,880
I'm thinking to myself, and it sucks. So, and again, I don't know that that exists in Canada,

1453
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:26,440
but it's certainly the United States. There's a bit of a cottage industry around one-stop shop

1454
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:30,440
scanners that I think patients just don't know what they're getting into, right?

1455
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:34,200
Right. And I don't know how well it works in the United States, but it really is. It's like,

1456
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:38,760
because of this lack of standardization in the field of MRI, and it's really unfortunate because

1457
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:44,120
this is, of all the imaging tools, it's the most powerful, but it really does need this stability

1458
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:48,680
for standardization. And it may also sort of be the fact that in order to make it standardized,

1459
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:53,560
you need to get the physicists together with the radiologists who are basically the eye of the

1460
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:58,440
final image. And quite often that doesn't happen because of the language barrier.

1461
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:02,920
Right. And of course, it's not, it's the language of physics is the language. Going back to the

1462
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:08,200
hardware for a second, where do you see things evolving? In other words, if you had to project

1463
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:13,160
where you think you, with the right technology, would like to see this in five or 10 years,

1464
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:16,520
what could make this better? What I'd actually like to do, and when you see sort of what we're

1465
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,160
doing, the speed with which we do and that the detail and resolution that we're able to acquire

1466
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:25,400
in about 55 minutes is really unprecedented anywhere. But I know from a physics point of

1467
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:29,320
view that I could speed this up further. Right now, everything we're doing is perfectly within

1468
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,840
FDA specifications. There's nothing outside of the box, but I really would like to push this and go

1469
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:39,960
outside of the box. And what that really requires is a lot more computational horsepower. It's

1470
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:45,400
really difficult to do all that computation within a single CPU machine on site, whereas I

1471
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:50,120
expect that in the future as Moore's law and computers get faster and faster, you can actually

1472
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:54,840
do a lot of this stuff computationally and make it much faster. And the goal would really be to

1473
02:03:54,840 --> 02:04:00,200
actually have these scans that we're doing under half an hour, even faster. And it can be done from

1474
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:04,600
a physics point of view. It's not a technological barrier. Even with the magnet that you have,

1475
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:10,200
even at 1.5. Now, I had my scan today, a friend had a scan today. And one of the things that

1476
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:13,960
people always talk about when they're doing these scans is, my God, it gets hot in there.

1477
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,120
What is it about a whole body MRI, even one that's done in a shorter period of time,

1478
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:23,080
is 55 minutes, that makes it so uncomfortable by the end in terms of body temperature?

1479
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:26,600
Really has to do with the amount of energy that's being absorbed. So what we're doing with the

1480
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:31,880
electromagnetic field is you're actually putting in radio frequency, right? And that radio frequency

1481
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:36,840
is always also coming out. And that radio frequency is the same thing as a cell phone would get.

1482
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:44,520
That's called SAR or specific absorption ratio. And the hydrogen ions are basically moving around

1483
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:48,920
and that's basically effectively heating you up. So it's not quite like a microwave, but you can

1484
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:54,200
actually think about it as a microwave. The wavelength is exactly very similar to an AM

1485
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:59,960
radio. And so your cell phone is typically far more powerful. So as an example, I went and did

1486
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:05,320
the calculation a while ago on how much SAR we're actually putting into a whole body prenupial scan.

1487
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:09,400
And it's equivalent to talking on a cell phone for about four hours.

1488
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,520
Interesting, but it concentrates it across your whole body.

1489
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:13,080
Right.

1490
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:18,520
Yeah, it's funny, every time I get an MRI or a whole body, the first 30 minutes, I'm like,

1491
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:23,000
yeah, it's not so bad. And then the last 10 minutes, I'm like, get me out of here.

1492
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,920
Right. And we've actually done it that way on purpose, because we kind of know that the way we

1493
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:31,560
kind of run our sequences or filters together is that we actually kind of want to get as much

1494
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:32,760
information in such a way as possible.

1495
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:37,720
Yeah, you do the head first and that's not nearly as much as doing the abdomen and thighs or

1496
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:41,480
probably where a ton of that heat gets generated, right? And it's sort of knees to abdomen.

1497
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:46,040
Right. And so when you look at basically the overall blood flow, which is what cools your body,

1498
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:49,720
well, the brain takes 20% of your cardiac output. So it's basically like this big cool,

1499
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:54,520
it's this big heat sink, right? It just cools everything away. Whereas when you get down and

1500
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:59,160
lower to the legs, which you're all muscle, it's going to heat that up. And so that's why we

1501
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:04,920
figure out how to orient these and what organization to make, what plan of sequences to make it not as

1502
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,800
uncomfortable.

1503
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:09,800
Commercially, what's the best off the shelf scanner that could come close to producing the

1504
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:14,360
resolution you're producing, which is it fully isotropic?

1505
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:17,720
It's isotropic in the brain, but in the rest of the body, we're actually doing

1506
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:19,560
more conventional clinical images.

1507
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:22,040
Tell us what isotropic is. I'm sorry, I should have clarified that.

1508
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:26,360
Sure. So what isotropic basically means is that it's more basically slicing you in cubes. So a

1509
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:31,000
one by one by one millimeter cube, for example, and then the power of actually doing that one by

1510
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,400
one by one is that you can now look at things again in three dimensions in any direction you want.

1511
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:42,520
The detail and resolution is perfect. And so that's what isotropic means. Whereas MRI typically

1512
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:47,640
can't be done isotropically just because of time. You want to cover as much as possible,

1513
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:52,440
but you want what we call in-plane resolution, which is how you orient the first gradient

1514
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:56,680
to have the highest amount of detail. And then you typically will take a perpendicular view.

1515
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:02,440
And that's why when you do these rotations off your sagittal plane, the resolution deteriorates

1516
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,000
wildly in conventional scans, right?

1517
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,760
Right, exactly. And so the diffusions that we're doing are done isotropic,

1518
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,600
but unconventional not often.

1519
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:15,240
So that's why when you rotate, and hopefully in the show notes, we'll be able to get some videos,

1520
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:20,360
we'll literally just show what it looks like. Because I know this is a difficult discussion

1521
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:24,280
to have without being able to picture for us. It's easy, but I think we want to make sure that

1522
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:28,680
the listener can see this. That's why you don't see any distortion when you rotate the DWI.

1523
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:31,320
So is there a commercially available scanner that can do that?

1524
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,400
Not yet, someday, not yet.

1525
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:37,000
And so basically your goal was just to be, I don't know how to put a timestamp on it.

1526
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,880
How far are you ahead of what's happening conventionally? I mean, four years ago,

1527
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:45,880
you were doing things that I still don't see any scanner doing in the country.

1528
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:48,280
And I see the best scanners.

1529
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:49,320
Thank you. But-

1530
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:55,000
Well, for example, like when I have a patient that went to one of the most famous hospitals in the

1531
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:01,720
country and had a dedicated prostate CT scan, it took 40 minutes just to do the prostate.

1532
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,160
Dedicated prostate MRI.

1533
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:09,320
MRI, not CT. So he had dedicated prostate MRI, took 40 minutes. It was on a three or four Tesla

1534
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:16,520
magnet. And so he spent two thirds of the time to get a slightly inferior image by resolution,

1535
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:21,640
especially on the DWI was far inferior to what you were doing on the whole body.

1536
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:27,160
It all comes down to basic engineering of signal to noise. If you can make all the hardware that

1537
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:32,760
you have really sing, your signal to noise is so much better. And then you can basically dial it

1538
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:36,760
to effectively where you want. So if you need more and more signal, depending on your machine's,

1539
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:42,040
I guess horsepower and coil configuration just takes time. It's always a balance between time

1540
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,320
and signal to noise.

1541
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:48,920
So where is machine learning going to come into the fold here? You actually mentioned something

1542
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:56,280
to me recently that I had never thought of, which is it's really hard to throw a whole body image

1543
02:08:56,280 --> 02:09:01,960
at a machine and have it solve even the simplest problem that we take for granted as a human,

1544
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:07,400
which is which one's the liver, which one's the kidney. And whereas if you weren't doing a whole

1545
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:12,280
body, if you were just doing a liver image, that's an easier problem to hand the machine because it

1546
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:17,560
already knows it's looking at liver. So I mean, how far are we away from a machine being able to

1547
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:18,600
help you do this?

1548
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:23,000
I think that there's actually a lot of tools that actually still need to be written. So for example,

1549
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,880
part of that is to really kind of look at organs and isolate organs. Conventionally,

1550
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:34,200
most imaging is done by body part. So head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and not connected

1551
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:39,240
together. And so when you actually give a machine, okay, here's your brain, it's actually able to

1552
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:44,120
kind of go through that relatively efficiently. But part of it really comes down to building

1553
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:48,440
the tools to actually analyze whole body, like even the software to view the whole body is

1554
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:53,320
exquisitely complex. But the difference is that when you actually start to build these tools,

1555
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,720
it can actually start to help us narrow down what's going on. And the goal is to really sort

1556
02:09:57,960 --> 02:10:03,000
of have machines make radiologists more efficient. And also more importantly, we never want to miss

1557
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,800
anything. And so we can't have a second reader all the time, but if you have a machine being a second

1558
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:12,280
reader, you wind up actually training that machine as you go along. And I think most people would be

1559
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:15,400
comfortable with that. And that's what's actually done in monography right now.

1560
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:19,560
And so for, I mean, monography obviously is like the tip of the iceberg, but you got to start

1561
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:23,800
somewhere, right? It's very, I don't want to minimize because I couldn't read a mammogram to

1562
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:28,680
save my life, but it's relative to what we're talking about. It's much simpler. It seems that

1563
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:33,480
where the machine might first be able to make a dent in what you're doing is not the patient who

1564
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:38,520
gets their first skin, but the one who gets the repeat skin. That seems to be paired T-test,

1565
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:42,680
seems to be an easier problem to solve. And an important problem to solve, because a lot of

1566
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:48,600
times for us as radiologists, like those studies, we still do things the same way when we review

1567
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:52,120
them. Whereas when you actually go and you take like a paired T-test, like you said, and you

1568
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,120
actually do a subtraction where you're looking for the difference or that Delta, it can actually

1569
02:10:56,120 --> 02:11:01,080
stand out and become very, very simple and very obvious. And once that subtraction is done,

1570
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:05,240
and I think that's where machine learning will actually really help make us more efficient. And

1571
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:09,640
at the end of the day, we just don't want to miss anything. Well, Raj, I've monopolized more of your

1572
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:14,120
time today. And that means that there've been probably three or four fewer patients that have

1573
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:18,280
been scanned today. So I really appreciate you taking the time. And I appreciate just all the

1574
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:22,200
time you've spent over the last three or four years educating me. You're incredibly generous

1575
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:27,640
with your insights. And I constantly lob questions at you and you've always got all the time in the

1576
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:32,520
world for me and by extension my patients and all the people that I hope to sort of try to educate

1577
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:37,080
with this. So thank you for the amazing work you're doing here and then also just for your generosity.

1578
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:40,120
Oh, thanks. It's a pleasure. Love it. You need to visit more often.

1579
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:43,240
Yeah. Next time you come down to California. Sure.
