Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,440
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Irene Davis. Irene is a professor of physical medicine

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,000
and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. She's also the founding director of the Spalding

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
National Running Center, one of the premier centers in the United States devoted exclusively

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,800
to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of running injuries in runners of all ages and

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,720
abilities. Irene holds two bachelor's degrees, one in exercise science from the University of

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,880
Massachusetts and one in physical therapy from the University of Florida. She then went on to earn

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,720
her master's degree in biomechanics from the University of Virginia before finally going on

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,840
to get her PhD in biomechanics from Penn State. In this episode, we talk about a lot of things. And

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Irene is someone I've been wanting to talk with for about six months and I was hoping to do it in

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,160
person so I could actually go to her lab. But alas, COVID turned this into yet another video

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,320
interview. Nevertheless, the wait was worth it. In this episode, we talk about a number of things.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,280
We start with the evolution of running. So when did we stand up as Homo erectus? And then when did

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,800
we begin to run? How did we run? What was the mechanic of that run? And then what changed about

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,320
50 years ago? Because what's really interesting when you think about this is we went from 2 million

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,440
years ago till about 50 years ago, sort of doing the same thing. And then 50 years ago, something

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,440
changed. We talk a lot about what that change was and how that change led to where we are today.

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,320
We had a little nerdy in this episode, but I think the show notes are going to make this really easy

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,920
to follow. And I go out of my way to stop and have Irene re-explain things and try to re-explain

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,720
things myself so that people who aren't as familiar with the terminology can understand it.

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,720
And I think we do a pretty good job of explaining the direction of the forces and just making sure

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,360
people understand some of the lingo that we use. But that said, the show notes will be very valuable

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,120
as we especially discuss some of the movement patterns, the gait patterns, the muscles within

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,080
the foot and the legs, and even things as simple as the different types of strike patterns and what

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,240
we mean by minimalist shoes. We have a very lengthy discussion about minimalist shoes versus

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,520
conventional shoes, motion control shoes, cushion control shoes. We do talk a lot about running and

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,720
walking, but I think a lot of what we talk about goes even beyond that. And we have also a pretty

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
detailed discussion about orthotics, plantar fasciitis, and all of the common injuries that

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,640
many of you have probably either heard about, know people who have suffered from, or have

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,480
suffered from yourself. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Irene Davis.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:28,280
Irene, thanks so much for making time today. I know you're incredibly busy as evidenced by

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,560
the fact that you had to change our last meeting in exchange for something that was obviously much

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,880
more important that we certainly could understand, which was making time to speak with folks at the

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,800
DOD. And I can imagine how they're very interested in what you do. Tell me a little bit about how you

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,120
came to be doing what you are doing. For example, what did you study during your PhD?

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm actually gonna go back a little bit further. So when I started out in college, I really didn't

44
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,680
know what I wanted to do. I honestly wanted to be an FBI agent and wrote a letter to J Edgar Hoover,

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,160
who wrote me a letter back that I still have and framed that said that women aren't allowed in the

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,440
FBI. So at that point, I really didn't know what I wanted to do. So I went to school and started

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,440
taking classes in exercise science, which led me to wanting to understand how the body works and

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,880
combine it with medicine. And most people who go into physical therapy often think about either

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,320
medicine or PT and I decided to go the PT route, got a degree in physical therapy and worked for a

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,160
while. But I think I've always had an inquisitive mind and I kind of knew that I would go back to

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,480
school for just for additional education and thought that I would probably end up going on for

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,400
my PhD. So I went on, I did my master's in biomechanics and then went on to Penn State and did my PhD in

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,200
biomechanics. The person at Penn State that I went to work with was Dr. Peter Cavanaugh, who is one of

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,080
the pioneers in running mechanics. And what I thought was really cool was I was able to bring in

55
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,160
my medical sort of physical therapy, clinical perspective to biomechanics and marry them.

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,080
That's really what I did. It's when I started that sort of journey of understanding the relationship

57
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,800
between mechanics and injuries. And then I took a position at the University of Delaware to start

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,080
my career. And on a personal level, was there an injury that you had growing up? Did you know

59
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,960
somebody? Were you close to somebody who'd been through the churn of physical therapy either with

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,440
successful results that kind of created this passion within you?

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,280
So the physical therapy part early on, I had a cousin who in a diving accident became a

62
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,200
quadriplegic. When I watched the physical therapist work with him, I was really inspired. And I

63
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:52,160
actually started my career in spinal cord rehab, but then moved on to after I started my graduate

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,600
degrees, I moved into outpatient physical therapy because it was easier to do part-time PT and that

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,760
kind of environment. And then because of my interest in biomechanics and injuries, really

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,760
orthopedics was really kind of the better match for me, but really started with that. That's how I

67
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,880
kind of got interested. But my interest in biomechanics actually came from the fact that my

68
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,600
cousin and other people with quadriplegia have to move 100% of their body with 25% of their muscle

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,720
power, and it's a biomechanical feat. So you have to learn how to use your body in ways that we

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,200
don't normally use it, and you have to understand mechanics. And that's really what got me interested

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,040
in biomechanics.

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,840
You know, I've been thinking about how I wanted to approach this subject with you. And a lot of

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,520
times I come into an interview and I have a pretty clear sense of how I want to do that. And I got

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,600
to be honest with you, I'm still sitting here, as we're talking, thinking, God, we could, well,

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,640
maybe we approach it this way, maybe you approach it that way. So I'm just going to take a stab at

76
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,440
one of the ways I wanted to talk about this with you. And if it goes in a place that's interesting,

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,920
wonderful, and if not, we'll pivot. But does it make sense to talk about this through an

78
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,560
evolutionary lens? Does it make sense to start from the standpoint of what did our ancestors do

79
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:07,080
biomechanically, I don't know, several million years ago, that today we do radically different?

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,440
So in terms of our evolution having been the driving factor even more than sort of the

81
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,760
environmental change, which I know we're going to talk about the environmental changes later,

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,720
but just help me understand sort of what the step function changes have been, if any, in the

83
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,280
biomechanics of our species. So if you don't mind, I wouldn't mind stepping back one more step and

84
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,240
talk about the evolution of my thought that leads to the evolution that you're referring to. So when

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,560
I started out at the University of Delaware, I had done some work as a physical therapist doing

86
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,800
orthotics. And I became the person who taught the orthotics, the foot orthotic component of our

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,840
program, I was making orthotics, I was doing research in foot orthotics, and really kind of

88
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,280
gotten to the mindset that some people have feet that can't support themselves. And it was

89
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,600
interesting, it was kind of like a perfect storm for me, because I was doing research in the area

90
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,560
of impacts and injuries. And I realized that when people land on the ball of the foot, and I'm sure

91
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,320
we'll talk about this later, the impacts are lower, and people who are barefoot runners tend to run in

92
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,720
the ball of their foot. So maybe that's really the way we were meant to run. And footwear can

93
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,600
interfere with these things. And so all of these things kind of came together at the same time that

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,560
the Born to Run book came out and again made me start to think it wasn't really the Born to Run

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,440
book. But again, it kind of made me reexamine my thinking. And it kind of brought me back to when

96
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,560
I was a physical therapist in rehab, where we would try to take away as much support and bracing to

97
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,600
our patients, even in wheelchairs, a lower back, less lower extremity bracing so that they would

98
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,040
use what they had. And yet, my thinking in terms of feet was completely opposite. And then the other

99
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,800
part of it I was thinking about is a physical therapist, we don't brace anything else permanently

100
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,160
if you have an orthopedic problem. And yet with the feet, somehow we think someone needs and I did

101
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,840
thought we needed to have bracing in the foot, I needed to give them orthotics for every pair of

102
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,760
shoes they had, and they were going to need those forever. Instead of thinking that these feet

103
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,400
actually have these amazing muscles, and that they have just as much of an ability to strengthen

104
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:23,360
as my quads and my hamstrings and my biceps. And so they really started to change my thinking then.

105
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,160
And then there were papers that came out that showed that when people are placed into shoes that

106
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,160
match their foot type, which is really how we got to these motion control and cushion shoes, and I

107
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,720
can give you a little history there too, when we have a chance. But when you look at the studies

108
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,480
that have been done, what they found is that when you match the foot to the shoe, so a motion

109
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,120
control shoe for a very low flat foot that's flexible, a cushion shoe for a high arch rigid

110
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,360
foot and stability shoe for normal arch, and then you compare that to a group of people who all got

111
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,600
the same shoe regardless of their foot type, there was no difference in the injury patterns. This was

112
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,040
done by Joe Knappek in the military, I think something like 7,000 military individuals in

113
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,520
different branches of the service. So that made it start making me think, wait a minute, because I

114
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,480
used to prescribe footwear in that way as well. So all of this, along with really kind of meeting

115
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,600
Dan Lieberman, who's an evolutionary biologist, who invited me on to the Nature paper from 2010.

116
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,240
And it was at a time when I was moving from the University of Delaware up to Harvard, which is

117
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,040
where he was as well, I really started thinking about the evolution. So when we think about the

118
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,480
evolution of our foot, when we went from walking man to running man, so that would be Strelopithecus

119
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,160
to Homo erectus, we actually started to develop not just changes in our feet, but changes in our

120
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,040
body. And there's a great paper by Dan Lieberman and Dennis Bramble, it's Bramble and Lieberman,

121
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:06,480
looking at the changes, the anatomical changes that occurred as we went from walking to running.

122
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,920
And what they found is that things like the longitudinal arch, the medial longitudinal arch

123
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,280
developed at that point, our joint surfaces got larger because we had higher forces going from

124
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,360
walking to running. And so those those services had to be larger in order to distribute the forces.

125
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,680
Our Achilles tendon got longer in order to store the energy, you can walk with a very short Achilles,

126
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,840
you don't need to store energy, but for running, you do. And so we saw these changes that occurred.

127
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,640
And that's really kind of what I have focused on is the changes from walking to running because my

128
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,640
interest has been in running. But those changes occurred, probably not just simply for running,

129
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,920
but they certainly optimized us for running and they had, I think 23 markers of endurance running.

130
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,280
It's a very fascinating paper. It's the title of it's called Born to Run, which is interesting. I

131
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:07,640
think that we really evolved to have feet that are very well on their own, well equipped to be able

132
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,880
to walk and run without any kind of support. We think about the structure of our feet, we've got

133
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,600
26 bones, we have 33 articulations, those articulations that have six degrees of freedom of

134
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,640
motion. The foot is a very complex structure, just like the hand, it's very much like the hand, the

135
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,440
anatomy. It also has four layers of arch muscles, four layers of 10 muscles just in the arch. So

136
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:41,200
allows this foot to have diverse function from being a stable base of support, to being an adapter

137
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,880
on uneven terrain, to being a shock attenuator, to being a spring, to be a rigid lever for push off.

138
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,120
All of those functions come from the fact that it has that kind of complexity and that kind of beauty.

139
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,440
That was really interesting and there was a lot I'd like to unpack there. You mentioned Dan Lieberman.

140
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,680
I saw Dan lecture for the first time in the summer of 2011. I actually remember it quite well. And I

141
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,800
remember being blown away by a lot of things he said. One of the things he said, if I heard him

142
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,360
correctly and if I remember correctly, was that over 24 hours no animal could cover a greater

143
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,000
distance than humans. And obviously there are lots of animals that can run faster than humans for

144
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,840
short distance, but over 24 hours we're going to win the day. And again, this was part of this sort

145
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,640
of born to run thesis. I want to just go back and make sure I have a couple things correct. So when did

146
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,200
we approximately stand up? How many years ago was that? Oh, now you're testing me. I can tell you when

147
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,480
we started to run. We've been running for two million years. Wow. Okay. That's longer than I

148
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,680
would have thought. So two million years of, it was essentially a transition from walk to run.

149
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
Do you have a sense of how much, I mean, again, how much speed did we give up?

150
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,560
Acute speed when we went from, when we stood up. In other words, I'm guessing that when we were on

151
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,680
all fours, we could move very quickly over a short period of time, a hundred yards or so,

152
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,800
but probably not that quickly over miles. And so standing up gave us that transition, right? We

153
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,440
were able to then go slower, potentially over the first few meters, but we could,

154
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
as Lieberman pointed out, go much greater distances. Is that accurate?

155
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,640
Yeah, it probably is accurate, but I think I would really yield to someone like Dan

156
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,760
for that kind of information because I wouldn't be confident that I'm giving you accurate information.

157
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Well, Dan is definitely someone I'd like to have on this show. I'll save those questions for Dan.

158
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah, I think that would be good. I do know that when we transitioned from walking to running,

159
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,520
it was at a time when our brains were getting bigger and we needed meat. And we didn't have

160
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:57,120
spears at that time. So we had to really outrun our prey. So we're not very fast runners, but we

161
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,440
are good endurance runners. And the reason for that is because we can pant off our heat,

162
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,360
whereas these big animals like kudos have their guts sort of slosh up against their diaphragm,

163
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,920
and they can only do one breath for every step. And so they aren't able to pant off their heat

164
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,800
very well. So basically what we would do is we would carve them out of the herd,

165
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,320
because we'd be able to follow one and we would just run them to an exhaustion and then club them.

166
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,840
So that's why that endurance running was so important for us. So we are probably among the

167
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,520
slowest of the animal kingdom when it comes to speed. But as you said, we're very good endurance

168
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,320
runners. The other thing you said, Irene, that impressed me was effectively the malleable nature

169
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,600
of your thinking. I've met many people who come up in one school of thought, and I'll just use the

170
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,840
example you gave, but it's true of doctors. It's true of anybody, which was, hey, we're going to

171
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,080
put everybody into orthotics if they have the foot issue, and we're going to try to fit you to

172
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,680
the fanciest motion control shoe or cushion control shoe or whatever. And it seems that somehow in the

173
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,000
presence of new information, you seemed to very easily be able to let go of that and actually

174
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,520
challenge yourself and say, wait a minute. I was very impressed by the way you described it, because

175
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm sitting here saying, how the hell did I not see something so obvious? Which is,

176
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,640
and I'm not an orthopedic surgeon, but I certainly am familiar enough with the field to say there's

177
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,360
really no long-term use for a brace. I mean, we always want people to strengthen themselves

178
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,600
intrinsically rather than rely on extrinsic support. And yet I think up until probably two

179
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
years ago, I took it on face value that, yeah, orthotics were a great thing if you need them.

180
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Never questioning it as you did. I felt the same way about myself at that time. I said to myself,

181
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,360
how have I thought this even for this length of time? And I think it really was because of what

182
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
I had said to you. There was a number of things coming together with my research,

183
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,360
with other people's research that started to make sense to me that maybe we aren't supposed to be

184
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,480
in this kind of footwear and maybe this kind of footwear changes the way that we run. And maybe

185
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,560
we should be trying to strengthen our feet. There were just a lot of things that came together at

186
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,480
that time that kind of pushed me into thinking differently. But I really believe that you have

187
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,480
to evolve. We have to evolve in our relationships, right? And we have to evolve in our spirituality.

188
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,080
We have to evolve in our scientific thinking as well. And I've always believed that.

189
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,320
Does it make sense first, in your opinion, to talk about what perfect intrinsic support of the foot

190
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,520
looks like and then start to talk about how we got where we got? In other words, do you want to

191
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,680
follow this through a time sequence of, okay, so two million years ago, we're out there running.

192
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Basically, we did that up until when? I mean, when were shoes even brought into the equation?

193
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Let me talk about it in that way. So if we look at the fact that we've been running for

194
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,000
two million years and we don't know exactly when the first emerged, some of the first footwear

195
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,760
that we found were found in the caves in Fort Rock, Oregon, and they were dated to be 10,000 years old.

196
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm not saying they're the first, but when we looked at them, they basically were made out of

197
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,200
sagebrush bark and had a flat surface with straps that kept it on the top of the foot. When you

198
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,480
think about that, they're kind of like horachi sandals. The purpose of it is to protect the

199
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,560
bottom surface of the foot from the elements. And when you think of other clothing that has developed,

200
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,120
sort of being fashionistas, has been to protect us from the cold, the rain, the heat, the snow,

201
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,920
and that was really the prime purpose of footwear up until I'm not exactly sure the dates of when

202
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,080
we started to get into some of the high-heeled shoes and some of those things. But in terms

203
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,200
of athletic footwear, I'd like to talk about that. Before we do, I just want to go back to this thing,

204
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,080
which why is it that we even needed anything to protect our feet? There's no other animal out

205
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,160
there that needs to protect his feet. So a polar bear has enough padding and insulation on the

206
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,680
bottom of its feet that it can easily walk through its environment. This is true of every

207
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,560
single animal. Why did man not evolve enough protection of the foot to be resistant to

208
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,360
scratching, cutting, and extremes of temperature? I think that's probably another really good

209
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,280
question for Dan. I hate to pass that on, but we do develop calluses on our feet that help us to

210
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,360
protect us from the elements. I don't know what happened that made us, maybe it's a comfort issue

211
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
where it was just more comfortable. You can walk out on rocks and you've seen people walk across

212
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,040
really sharp rocks and be able to do it very lightly, but it's just maybe easier, maybe faster,

213
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,920
maybe more comfortable. I mean, that's what I'm thinking is likely to be the reason why we ended

214
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,520
up developing footwear. So we basically short circuited natural selection on that particular

215
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,560
element. Perhaps, yeah. And maybe that speaks to all of clothing, actually, aside from maybe some

216
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
of the social modesty or whatever that came from it, but it might've been that, hey,

217
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,360
we could wait another million years and we'll develop really tough feet, but what the hell?

218
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,440
We've now got a brain that tells us how to put something on these things that will

219
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,440
short circuit that evolutionary period. Okay. But you know that if you end up going barefoot a

220
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,120
lot, that you develop calluses on the bottom of the foot that are protective to the feet.

221
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,200
So we do have the ability to develop that protective feature.

222
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,600
It's funny that you mentioned Oregon where they discovered the first shoe because of course,

223
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,640
Oregon is the epicenter of another big revolution in shoes vis-a-vis running shoes. So

224
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,080
where did running shoes per se this idea that we're going to put something that's more cushiony

225
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,240
on our feet? It's funny, I haven't paid much attention to what running looked like

226
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,240
200 years ago or a hundred years. If you look back at the Olympics at the turn of the last century,

227
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,560
what were athletes wearing in the marathon? Were they wearing basically just a flat piece of leather

228
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:17,200
that protected the bottom of their feet? Exactly. And up until probably the 60s,

229
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,280
the kind of footwear that we were wearing were really what we would call minimal footwear today.

230
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,440
And it basically was something that protected the bottom surface of the foot. There were some

231
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,840
developments in terms of spikes for track. And so there has been a development of footwear

232
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,160
along that line. But when we're talking about distance running, endurance running,

233
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,480
people were running in very flat shoes. And then what happened is we had the running boom and

234
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,960
people got very excited about running and a lot of people who were not very fit,

235
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,120
better than us today, but in their time, not as fit as today runners who were part of a

236
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,680
high school team or collegiate track or cross country team, took the sign. Very quickly,

237
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,400
they developed some injuries. And some of the first injuries were Achilles problems because

238
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,760
people were used to walking around with a little bit of a heel in their shoe,

239
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,960
two inch heel, men's shoes got a little bit of a heel. And these shoes were flat to begin with.

240
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,160
And Achilles, it doesn't take much. You take out a lift. If you just go down and walk in a flat

241
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,920
shoe for a period of time, you can develop an Achilles 10 nice. You don't do it slowly.

242
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,560
And so people started to develop some problems with their Achilles. So they started to add

243
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,680
a lift in the shoe. Just to explain that for folks who might not be familiar enough with the anatomy,

244
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,720
the Achilles is the tendon that's basically joining the bottom of the big muscle of the calf,

245
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,240
the gastrocnemius right around the heel, right? Exactly. It's an extension of the calf muscle

246
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,160
and that's the attachment structure to the heel. So the more pointy your toe is relative to your

247
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:01,040
heel or the more your heel is raised, the more compressed that Achilles tendon is. In other

248
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,560
words, the less stretched out it is. That's right. That's exactly right. So if you're used to walking

249
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,200
around with two to three inches of heel elevation, and then you start running with something that has

250
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,200
no elevation, you've got a double whammy, which is one, you're applying a huge stretch to something

251
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,960
that hasn't been stretched. And then going back to something you said a few minutes ago, the force

252
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:33,040
of that, the force transfer in that transition from a walking to a running stride multiplies that

253
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,040
stretch by some factor that's probably not linear and therefore quite destructive. Exactly. You hit

254
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,880
the nail on the head. That was one aspect. So that created this change of adding a little bit of a

255
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,720
heel lift to athletic shoes. And this is where the heel to toe drop comes from. The next thing that

256
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,360
happened is there were some other injuries that occurred. And I learned about this because I was

257
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,520
writing a paper on the reemergence of the minimal shoe. And I wanted to know how we ever got to

258
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,160
having a motion control and a cushioning shoe. How do we get these divergent types of footwear?

259
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,080
Can you explain what those are? I mean, cushioning to me sounds obvious,

260
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,840
but explain it in some detail. So a motion control running shoe is a shoe that actually

261
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,640
has a very stiff heel counter. And it has material that's stiffer on the inside of the midsole of the

262
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,120
shoe that helps to prevent the foot from rolling in and also may have some plastic support

263
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,120
reinforcements on the inside of the shoe and more arch support to prevent the foot from rolling in.

264
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,320
So that would be a motion control shoe. And that's typically designed for people who roll

265
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,360
into much. This was what the original idea was. The other shoe is called the cushioning shoe.

266
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,280
And it's for someone typically who has a high arch, doesn't move a lot and needs more cushioning.

267
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,400
But what happened is we started to see many more injuries in runners after the running boom. And

268
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,560
interestingly, if you look at PubMed and you try to determine when the first, I think the first

269
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:15,520
running injury article was in 1970s. It was in the early 1970s. So before then, we had lots of

270
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,880
people running. And if there was a lot of running injuries, you would have seen literature on it.

271
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
I'm not saying there weren't any running injuries. Of course, there probably were,

272
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,560
but it wasn't such a huge issue as it has become. So I really think that it's part of the fact that

273
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,200
these people were not trained to cushion the landings because when you land, you've got to

274
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,240
cushion it and you've got to control it. So if you don't have the muscles and you don't have the

275
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,360
motor control to be able to control as your foot comes down so that you can actually attenuate the

276
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,200
shock that you get when you land. So you're not using the muscles correctly, you're not landing

277
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,840
softly, then you're going to have injuries related to impact and related to too much motion. Does

278
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,720
that make sense? It certainly does. I want to make sure I understand what we're calling a running

279
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,960
injury because as I've become more and more obsessed with this topic, what I've come to

280
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,600
realize is that if the feet aren't working correctly, the injury can go all the way to the neck.

281
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,880
In other words, what I used to assume is if your feet aren't working right, your feet can hurt.

282
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
But then you realize, well, actually that translates up to the knee and oh, that translates into the

283
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,600
hip. Well, actually that translates into the pelvis and the back and the L spine and the T spine and

284
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,680
the C spine. And before you know it, you realize if a person isn't connected to the ground correctly,

285
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,600
a lot of things go wrong. So when you talk about this wave of running injuries that showed up on

286
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,080
PubMed in the early 70s, do you mean specifically foot injuries or what type of injuries are you

287
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,760
referring to? I think the very first reference might have been tibial stress fractures. But if

288
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,880
you look at the distribution of running injuries, you're right, they can go all the way up to the

289
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,640
neck. The majority of them are from the knee down. If you look at the distribution, the knee is the

290
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,120
most common site for injuries, the lower leg, the ankle, the foot from the knee down and the knee is

291
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,600
the primary attenuator of shock. So it takes a brunt of the load. You do most of your shock

292
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,800
attenuation through the knee. What is that load, by the way? I mean, I remember knowing this at one

293
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,360
point, you know, my undergrad is in engineering and mechanical engineering. So we did a few courses in

294
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,960
biomechanical, but I've forgotten so much of it. But I do remember being blown away at what the

295
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,320
load was that it was experienced by the knee. So if you took like a 175 pound man and he was running,

296
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,080
the shock forces felt in the knee were astronomical, were much higher than what you would expect

297
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,200
if you were just thinking about this. The ground reaction force when you land is typically the

298
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,920
peak ground reaction force in running is typically about two and a half to three times your body

299
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:07,280
weight. That's the force that your body feels. At the knee itself, it's even higher. So it can be

300
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,680
seven times your body weight. So if you're 200 pounds, it could be 1400 pounds. So Nike actually

301
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,800
called in three sports podiatrists when they saw all of these injuries that were occurring.

302
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,440
I got this information from an individual called Jeff Johnson. And Jeff was with Nike in the early,

303
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,960
early days of Nike. And he worked with them. And he's the person that told me that when the injury

304
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
started to occur, they brought these sports podiatrists in. But he said that when he was running,

305
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,720
back in the 50s and 60s in high school and college, he said that nobody was getting injured,

306
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,400
and that people were running in rubber soles with canvas tops on them. And he said they

307
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,840
developed legs of steel. Those were his words, legs of steel, and they weren't having the

308
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,360
knee pain and the stress fractures. And of course, that's very anecdotal. But I think it's interesting

309
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,040
that speaks to that. But then when the running wound started, we started to see this very quick

310
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,000
rise in injuries. So they brought these sports podiatrists in. And what they told them is based

311
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,680
on what they were seeing, they felt that the injuries were related to too much impact and

312
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,880
too much motion. And it was that they had no science behind it. And I truly believe that's

313
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,480
what they thought clinically. But it was that information that created this divergent

314
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,920
motion control and cushioned shoe that we described. What they did is they, rather than

315
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,880
have the runners adapt to the running, they took the shoe and adapted it to the runner.

316
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,400
So instead of making their feet stronger and making them land softer, the runners who are

317
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,840
running in shoes that have no cushioning at all, basically like minimal shoes, they adapted it.

318
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,840
And the problem with that is that then you start into the cycle where if you give people cushioning,

319
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,040
they actually land harder. And that's been shown by a number of different research studies.

320
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,840
And when you put a support, the muscles get weaker. And there are lots of studies that show

321
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,000
that when you take the support away, take an arch support away, the muscles of the foot get stronger.

322
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,720
When you add cushioning, you land harder. There have been a number of studies that have shown

323
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,800
that that new Hoka shoe causes people to hit harder. Let's unpack that for a second, because

324
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,400
the first thing makes a ton of sense. I can really see why removing an arch support will

325
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,760
actually allow the foot to become stronger. Take away the extrinsic support, the intrinsic muscles

326
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,920
are forced to adapt. Help me understand why the cushioning of the shoe will have the relationship

327
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,200
you've described, which is a bit counterintuitive that it would actually increase the force.

328
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,240
Assume you mean the force all the way from the ground to foot and then foot to knee.

329
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,800
That's exactly right. I'm going to give you an example. So if you are going to hit somebody with

330
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,880
your fist, you think you're going to hit them harder if your fist is bare or if you have a

331
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,720
padding, like a glove. In boxing, you're right. We typically do hit harder with a glove. And I think

332
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,680
a lot of it has to do with the weight of the glove. You wear a 12-ounce glove, you have more mass

333
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,400
that is being thrown. So are you saying it's the mass effect as well of the shoe potentially?

334
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,440
I don't think it's just the mass effect. I think it's the fact that you have this protection so you

335
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,120
can hit harder. And it does attenuate some of the load, but it doesn't attenuate all of the load.

336
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,960
What I believe and what's difficult is we don't have a lot of good data, pre-cushioned shoes,

337
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,000
that is high-speed data that looks at foot strike pattern. I think that we evolved to

338
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,360
primarily land on the ball of her feet because when you land on your foot barefoot,

339
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,400
it's going to hurt. And there was a study done by one of my colleagues looking at the pressure

340
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,000
pain threshold of the heel. And what they did is they applied pressure and then they determined

341
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,320
when somebody felt pain. And what they found is that when the pressure exceeds the pressure that

342
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,200
you have in walking, that's when people start to have pain, which tells us that we naturally,

343
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,880
this hilt pad was designed, was adapted for attenuating loads of walking. Because you figure

344
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,720
we were born to be barefoot. We should be able to do these things barefoot. But running on your heel

345
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,800
is very painful, can be very painful because you don't have the cushioning. And there have been

346
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,560
other studies that have shown that really is footwear that has changed our mechanics from

347
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,920
a forefoot strike to a rear foot strike. Now it seems to me that maybe somebody's

348
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,040
already done this, but you could go back and look at lots of old film of runners going back

349
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,200
into the 1800s in the early part of the 1900s. And if this argument is correct, you would see

350
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,880
that everybody would be a forefoot striker until the advent of cushioned shoes. In other words,

351
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,280
this would suggest that heel striking is something that's really only been brought

352
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,360
about in the last 50 years. Is that true? It's mostly true. I think that as a barefoot runner,

353
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
it's been shown that they do vary. So barefoot runners may land on their heel. If you're running

354
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,560
in grass, you may have more of a tendency to land on your heel. When you land on your heel,

355
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,280
you can stride out more. And so for a given cadence, you can go faster. So it may be advantageous if

356
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,240
you're on a soft surface to land on your heel. But when you're on relatively firm surfaces,

357
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,760
there's more of a tendency to land on the ball of your foot. And if you look at some of the vases,

358
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,840
the prehistoric vases that depict man running, they're always running on the ball of their foot.

359
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:51,040
And if you look at the Boston robot that runs, guess what? He runs on the ball of his foot.

360
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,880
I honestly believe that optimally we were adapted to do that. And that's why we have a long Achilles

361
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,200
tendon. We have a much bigger calf than we do an anterior. We have much bigger muscle in the back

362
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,960
than we do muscle in the front. And when you think about that, one of the most common injuries

363
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,680
that runners have when they first start running is this shin splints that they call.

364
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,960
Explain to people what a shin splint actually is.

365
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,600
It's pain on the front part of the leg, and particularly in the anterior, the muscle in

366
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,600
the front part of the leg. And if you're not used to running landing on your heel and having to use

367
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,560
the muscle on the front part of your leg to lower your foot down, you could have an overuse

368
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,560
injury for a while until it gets used to it. And so they get sore in the front part of their leg.

369
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,800
Let's explain that to people because I think a lot of people won't appreciate that. I think many

370
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,160
people might not understand that you have these muscles in the front of your leg, the tibialis

371
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,120
anterior, et cetera. They're in these packed, these tight little fascial compartments. And

372
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,200
the point you're making that, of course, I can see because I'm looking at you is an important one,

373
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,160
which is... And so the listener, I just hope they can sort of picture this, as the heel is coming

374
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,760
to the ground, they have to eccentrically allow the rest of the foot to come down. And in doing

375
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,840
so, you're not using the big muscle in the back of the calf muscle. You have to use that front

376
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:25,120
muscle to control the toes as they come down. And you're saying, look, those muscles are not

377
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,560
nearly as big as the muscle in the back. They're going to fatigue long before the muscle in the

378
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,160
back. Your point here is, if you just look at the shape of the human lower leg, it's designed to

379
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,760
carry more load in the back than in the front. That's correct. Here's another really interesting

380
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:53,680
biomechanical fact. When you land on the ball of your foot, you shift the load from the quadriceps,

381
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,560
the muscle in the front of your thigh and your knee to the ankle and the calf. And when you land

382
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:09,280
on your heel as a heel striker, you shift the load from the calf to the knee. When you think about the

383
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,960
knee being the most common site for injury, then it makes sense. And the knee was not really

384
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,560
designed to take those kinds of loads in running repeatedly. But the calf is this big muscle. And

385
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,480
what happens is when you land on the ball of your foot, because you have this time in which you're

386
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,720
bringing your heel down to the ground, you have that time to attenuate that force. Whereas when

387
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,800
you land on your heel, you come in and it's almost like you get a very distinct impact. In fact,

388
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,800
when you look at the force that the ground pushes back up at you, the ground reaction force

389
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,880
of a rear foot striker versus a forefoot striker, a rear foot striker has an impact peak followed

390
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,200
by a propulsive peak. This impact peak is a very quick rise to peak. A forefoot striker has a very

391
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:13,680
nice smooth curve that's very gentle. And so this impact peak is associated with a very quick

392
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,680
application of force to the body called the load rate. Right. And let's explain why that matters.

393
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:29,840
So if you can picture an x-axis that shows time and a y-axis that shows force, the narrower the

394
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,520
force is applied over time, the more problematic it is. And that's what you're describing, which is

395
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,280
when you strike with the toe, that force peak is spread out. You can picture a curve over a longer

396
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,440
part of the time axis as opposed to a spike function, which is when you're heel striking,

397
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,600
that first transfer of force is an up and down spike before you reach the propulsive phase,

398
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:05,520
which is over a broader application of time. Correct? Absolutely. And the steeper the slope

399
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:13,600
of that first impact peak, the greater the rate of loading. And studies have shown that rates of

400
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:22,720
loading are related to running related injuries. So the softer you land, the less your chance of

401
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,760
getting injured. You've obviously explained a couple of benefits to heel striking. You can take

402
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,720
a longer stride. I think it's worth anybody sort of playing with that in their mind and you can

403
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,440
see why you could take a longer stride if you could strike with your heel as opposed to your toe.

404
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,480
And you've said that, look, there might be times when you were running on a sandy beach or you're

405
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,680
running in the grass where the contact surface is malleable enough that you can get away with it.

406
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,560
But so far what we've learned is for the most part, we've probably had two million years of running

407
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,400
on a toe strike or forefoot strike pattern. And basically what happened is once people who

408
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,360
weren't frankly fit enough to be running due to the other sedentary changes that came with our

409
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:13,440
most recent evolution, coupled with some well-intentioned but probably ill-informed

410
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,360
podiatrist suggested, hey, we've got to lessen the load. We've got to put some cushion here and we've

411
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,800
got to make it easier for the Achilles tendon, which has become deconditioned. Basically about

412
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,840
50 years ago, we started building shoes to fit a modern day problem as opposed to taking a modern

413
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,880
day problem and deconstructing it to its evolutionary origin. Is that kind of a summary

414
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,680
of what you've said? It's exactly right. And that's exactly our approach that we take in our clinic.

415
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,520
So when people come to us with injuries and they come to us and many of them come with

416
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,920
foot orthotics habituated to foot orthotics and habituated to standard shoes, our goal,

417
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,560
we believe that the closer we are to the way we evolve to move, the less the risk for injury.

418
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,400
What you and I are doing right now, we're sitting, it's very unnatural. What we evolved to do was to

419
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,840
squat. We really try to get people back into shoes that allow their feet to do what they were

420
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,360
adapted to do and to run in a pattern that is closer to our evolutionary legacy.

421
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,040
Do you believe that there are some people who shouldn't be running? And I say that not from

422
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,360
the standpoint of somebody who is so injured and they have no cartilage left. But I mean, if you

423
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,880
took the average teenager who for all intents and purposes still has their body intact, but

424
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,880
either they're too overweight or they've spent too much time in a high shoe, meaning a heel to toe

425
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,960
ratio that's too great, or there's something about the length of their tibia to their femur

426
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,640
that just doesn't seem optimal. In other words, we say that we're born to run, but that's obviously

427
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,560
a great general statement. But do you think that there's some nuance to this and that there's just

428
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,280
some people for which running is never going to be a good idea? Or do you think that no, Peter,

429
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,160
truly anybody who still has cartilage left in those joints can be trained to do this thing?

430
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,040
Well, I don't believe in 100% of anything. There's always going to be exceptions, you know,

431
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,640
that from a medical standpoint as well. But I believe that running is an activity of daily

432
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,000
living. People talk about running being a skill. I don't think it is. We learn to run on our own.

433
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
We're not taught. If you have children, you'll see, you'll watch them go from crawling to walking to

434
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,600
running. You don't get out there and you're not training them. Now, there are some runners that

435
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,840
can be trained to have better technique, but you know what? You could train walkers to have

436
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,800
better technique as well. We evolved to run and it's something that we need for fight or flight.

437
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,960
You know, you get to run away from the boogeyman. You get to run after your kids. Running is

438
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,160
something that is ingrained in us. Having said that, someone is born with a huge leg length

439
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,560
discrepancy that is really going to abnormally load them when they run. That's probably not a

440
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,080
good idea. If somebody has some really extreme foot deformities, maybe running isn't the best

441
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:17,200
idea. But I think if we looked at the distribution, the normal distribution of structure, most people

442
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:26,080
can run. And I think that the problem, it starts really, Peter, from when we are children. I would

443
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:34,160
love for you to take a look at a video. There's a trailer on the motivation factor. The motivation

444
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,840
factor is a 90 minute documentary about a program at La Sierra High School that was in Carmichael,

445
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:52,080
California. Stan LaPrade, a Marine in 1955, brought a program to La Sierra where he had every single

446
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,320
child. He recognized that only 40% of kids are involved in sports. I mean, some kids don't want

447
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:05,680
to, some don't feel they can. So he wanted every single child to be fit. And he took those kids

448
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,640
and every single one of them had a PE five days a week, 55 minutes. And they went through a Marine

449
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,000
type boot camp program, but he did it in a way that was highly motivational. So the kids started

450
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,440
out in white shorts and then you moved, you had criteria and you were on teams, the white

451
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,520
shorts were a team. And when you got to move, everybody cheered you on. You got to the red team.

452
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,920
So these kids progressed all the way up. They finally had to add on what they called the Navy

453
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,320
Blue Team. And only 21 of probably at least 20,000 people that went through their school, because it

454
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:47,200
was a 30 year program and they had 800,000 kids per class, only 21 made that. This program,

455
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,640
yielded children and teenagers that were so fit, Peter, when you look at this trailer of the

456
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,200
documentary, you're going to be incredibly impressed. They look like they're all military.

457
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,680
I think about that. And I think that that's not hard to do. He did it without any real fancy

458
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,240
equipment. The kids were doing monkey bars. They were doing pushups. They were doing calisthenics.

459
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,160
They were doing the pegboards. They were doing man carries. They did all kinds of things that

460
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,640
were building not only strength, but physical literacy. They taught them how to move. Those kids

461
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:30,000
are all going to be able to run. The reason I talk about this and those kids today are now 55 to

462
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,520
probably 79 years old. And we're actually proposing a study to follow them, to look at them now,

463
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,560
where they are now and compare them to a comparable group that was growing up at that same time.

464
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,800
So to see if that sort of critical window of exposure was going to, like an exposure to

465
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,320
language or something during a period of time that's critical would stay with them.

466
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,720
In the documentary, they all talk about how much this program changed their life. They attribute

467
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,520
their success to it. Some of them were in really troubled homes. But aside from that,

468
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,720
the physical part of it is that when you see this documentary, you see this video of these kids,

469
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,880
every one of them are fit. So I believe aside from being born with some kind of neurological

470
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,720
disability, or certainly those are the ones that I would say probably don't have that same potential.

471
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,680
But if you're born with a normally intact neuromuscular system, I think everybody has

472
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,720
the ability to look like that. Because I saw it. I saw it in this class. It's amazing.

473
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,400
Every single kid, now their body types are a little bit different, but they were all fit.

474
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,680
They were all strong. Every one of them ran. They had to run a mile. Each short level was

475
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,200
a different time for their mile. They all ran. So I think running, this is coming back to your

476
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,280
question. I think it is innate in us. And I think everyone who has a pretty normally intact neuromuscular

477
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,520
system can run. But to answer your question, should that teenager who's overweight and has been doing

478
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,600
video games go out and run? Probably not. You need to get fit to run. These kids are growing up

479
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,800
being fit. But if you're not fit, going out and running right away is not the best thing to do.

480
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,400
Because I think you need to develop that strength and that mode of control. I've had a lot of people

481
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,560
who are obese that run and run without pain. If you run on the ball of your foot, you soften the

482
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,080
landing. Going from a rear foot to a forefoot strike, so landing on your heel versus your

483
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:31,440
body foot, does not change the peak force. The peak force is the same. It changes that first

484
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,080
impact. You remove that impact. And when you think about the landings, you have a thousand foot

485
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:44,400
strikes per mile. You run 20 miles a week. That's 20,000 foot strikes per week. You do that for a

486
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,960
year. That's a million foot strikes per foot per year. So that impact, you get that every single

487
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,720
time. I think that one of the things that we feel is that by getting off your heels, we actually

488
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,840
reduce you, bring you farther away from your injury threshold, which we all have an injury

489
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,880
threshold. Our goal is trying to make sure that we keep people as far below it as possible.

490
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,600
Do you have a force plate treadmill in your lab?

491
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,960
We do. Can you explain to folks what you see when you put, like if I were to come to your lab and

492
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,800
we were to experiment and you'd put me in making this up. One day I'm going to run in a minimalist

493
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,440
shoe. One day I'm going to run in a Hoka, which would be the exact opposite of a minimalist shoe.

494
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,440
One day I'm going to heel strike. One day I'm going to forefoot strike. What are the different

495
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,480
things you see in that two by two? So minimalist versus maximalist shoe, heel versus toe strike.

496
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,120
What does the force plate treadmill show you in terms of like a magnitude effect, especially as

497
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,080
we start to now map that out for what you said, which is a million of those a year is not an

498
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,480
unheard of amount for someone even running modestly. Well, the first thing I want to ask you is can I

499
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,880
invite you to come and do that? I would happily do that. Okay. I would love it. You're in Boston

500
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,120
when I always have a reason to be there. So yeah, I've never run on a force plate treadmill, by the

501
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,000
way. So I'd love to know what that's like. So if you're running in a cushioned, a highly cushioned

502
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,240
shoe, most likely you're going to be landing on your heel. Which by the way, I used to run in a

503
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,560
Hoka. So I can relate. I know what that feels like. I know what it's like to heel strike in a Hoka.

504
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:25,280
So when you heel strike in a Hoka, compared to heel striking in a conventional regular shoe,

505
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:32,560
normal shoe, a Nike Air Pegasus, let's say, you're likely to have based on research, higher slopes.

506
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,960
It's called the load rate. So a quicker application of force during that first impact peak.

507
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:48,080
If you compare a forefoot strike in regular shoes to a forefoot strike in minimal shoes,

508
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,720
you're going to see differences there. The forefoot strike in minimal shoes, your slope will be

509
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,160
slightly less than forefoot striking in regular shoes. But that's the vertical direction. And

510
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,200
that's all we've been talking about so far. I want to introduce the concept because a force plate

511
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,200
will give you the amount of force in the vertical direction, the amount of force you're applying in

512
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,800
an anterior, posterior, front to back direction, and the amount of force that you can apply in a

513
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,600
mediilateral direction. So what happens is when you forefoot strike in a pair of conventional

514
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,920
shoes, you have a tendency to land in more plain reflection than in minimal shoes, which puts a

515
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,160
greater load on the Achilles that we talked about in your calf. And you have a tendency to

516
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,800
have a greater force in the anterior, posterior direction. Explain what you're doing with your

517
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,160
hand there for people who might not be familiar with that terminology. I'm pointing my toes and

518
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,320
I'm coming into the ground, approaching the ground with a very pointed foot, and that tends to push

519
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,200
forward on the ground and the ground pushes back at you. So you get this high breaking force.

520
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:05,040
In the mediilateral direction, when you forefoot strike in a pair of regular shoes, you have a

521
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:12,560
tendency to be more on the outside of your foot when you land. This is called inversion. This is

522
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,760
your landing on the lateral border of your foot with your medial border up. Right. And I think of

523
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,800
that as inversion because the bottoms of your feet now start to point inward to the midline of your

524
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,880
body. That's correct. When you land that way, because you're coming down on the outside of

525
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,040
your foot, you're kind of pushing outward, you have a greater lateral force that you're applying

526
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,440
to the ground. So you have a greater medial by the ground reaction force. So basically what's

527
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,840
happening is you increase the force in the medial lateral direction when you are forefoot striking

528
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:54,240
in a pair of regular shoes. When you forefoot strike in a pair of minimal shoes, your toes are

529
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,680
less pointed. You tend to be less inverted. So your foot is more level when you land. And so you

530
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,600
reduce the forces in the vertical direction, the rates of loading, the slope, you reduce the slope

531
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,920
in the anterior posterior direction, and you reduce the slope in the medial lateral direction. So it's

532
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:20,800
the softest landing. When people try to transition to a forefoot strike pattern in a pair of regular

533
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,680
shoes, they often come to me with problems with their Achilles, tendon in the back, and also

534
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,440
problems with the tendon of the muscle on the outside of the leg called the perineal tendon.

535
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,640
It's a tendon on the outside of the leg. They're so tipped laterally. And they're stretching that

536
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,520
out. Exactly. Our recommendation is if you're gonna forefoot strike, there's an interaction

537
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,720
between footwear and foot strike, and it's important. If you're gonna decide you want to

538
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,680
transition to a forefoot strike pattern, it should be done in minimal shoes. But if you're gonna stay

539
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,720
a rear foot striker, make sure you put cushioning under your heel because you're gonna need it,

540
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:08,160
because you're hitting hard. Now let's get one more idea across, which is there are shoes that

541
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,920
have cushioning that have no heel raise. I'm blanking on a brand. I have a friend who wears them,

542
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,880
and I think it starts with an A, but I could be wrong. But it's got about a three-quarter inch

543
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,320
sole, but it's the same at the front and the back. So it has zero elevation of the heel,

544
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,120
but it has some cushioning. And of course, we wouldn't consider that a minimalist shoe, would we?

545
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,560
You might be thinking of the topus.

546
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,000
It's not. I could look it up. But I guess the point is when you say minimalist, we're talking

547
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,840
really about two features, no elevation of heel and no cushion or support, correct?

548
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,440
Yes. When I talk about minimal, I'm talking about a shoe you can roll up and put in your pocket.

549
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,600
Okay. How many brands are there of those shoes? I wear a brand called Zero. There are another

550
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,280
couple of brands out there.

551
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,440
There are. There's many, I think, but some of the big brands that you think about

552
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,680
are Vivo Barefoot.

553
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,880
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of. They seem to make a pretty nice looking product.

554
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,200
Yeah. And then there's Innovate.

555
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,600
Okay. So is Innovate a true minimalist? I mean, I love Innovate and I have them,

556
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,320
but I've sort of migrated over to the Zero because it has a wider toe box. And I'm also,

557
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,360
one of the things I've been working very hard on, which I'd also like to come back to,

558
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,480
so I'll just mention it now and we'll park it, is spreading my toes. So at the outset,

559
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:33,280
when you were describing the anatomy of the foot, I was using my hand to pretend it was a foot.

560
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,720
You saw me doing that and you made the comment just like the hand. And I, through a colleague,

561
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,960
had an epiphany a year ago, which is, can you imagine how unhelpful your hands would be if

562
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,200
they were shoved into tight gloves most of the time, as opposed to being able to spread apart?

563
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,320
And since that time, I've been working greatly to sort of enhance the spread of my toes so that I

564
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,120
could actually use these feet the way I can use my hands. And so for that reason, that's when I

565
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:07,120
went from the Innovate to the Zero, was to be able to actually get those toes across. But you're

566
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,560
saying the Innovate is still a minimalist shoe because it meets the criteria that it can be

567
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,240
rolled up into a ball. Some of these minimal companies actually have shoes that have some

568
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:23,760
midsole. So as long as the shoe has no midsole, so some of them have real true minimal models,

569
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,960
and then some that add a little bit of cushioning into them. So what I'm saying is if it's a model

570
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:35,920
that has no cushioning, has no arch support, has a flexible heel counter, a flexible upper,

571
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,680
and you can roll it up, it's a minimal shoe. Now what happened after the Vibram lawsuit,

572
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,320
which by the way, was not about injury, but about false reporting of increased muscle size with the

573
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:56,880
use of the shoe. I'm not aware of the lawsuit. There was a lawsuit that came out against Vibram,

574
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,280
and it was basically about false advertising. Although a lot of people, because when Vibram

575
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,360
shoes first came out, a lot of people thought you could just put these shoes on and run.

576
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,560
And we need to talk at some point about transitioning. But there were some reports of

577
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,320
injuries with them. And I say it's just like if you were to go to the gym and lift 100 pounds

578
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,240
when you never lift and gotten injured, you wouldn't say don't ever do that again. You'd say,

579
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,680
don't do it that way. Well, what happened with this is it really turned people against the

580
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,840
minimal shoe. And a lot of people think that the lawsuit against Vibram was about injury,

581
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,200
because people have to wear some reported injuries in the literature. It was about the fact that the

582
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,520
Nike Free shoe, which was the very first barefoot type shoe, wasn't really quite truly barefoot or

583
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,400
minimal, had shown that you increase muscle size when you take away the support in the arch. And

584
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,640
since the Vibram shoe took away the support of the arch, they were advertising this could

585
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,720
strengthen your feet. That's what happened. So what it did is a lot of the shoe companies sort of

586
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,600
pulled back and started adding a little bit more to their minimal shoes. I think New Balance had a

587
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:13,520
New Balance Minimus that had no midsole. Minimus Trail, I think, had no midsole. And then they

588
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,800
started to put a little bit of a midsole in there. Because I think that they thought that that was

589
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,640
what we needed to do to try to prevent injury. But I call those shoes partial minimal shoes,

590
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,880
because some of them have a little bit of a heel to toe drop. Some of them have a little bit of

591
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,640
arch support. Some of them have some cushioning, and they have various degrees. The Nike Free,

592
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,400
for example, was the very first shoe. There was somebody at Nike, his name was Jeff Pichotta,

593
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,480
and he was tasked with studying barefoot running and coming up with a shoe that mimicked it.

594
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,360
That's why it has all those flex screws on the bottom of the sole, so it can be very flexible.

595
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
He took away the arch support. He took away the stiff heel counter.

596
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
I mean, that's a pretty thick shoe, isn't it, though? An inch of cushioning, right?

597
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,680
Yes. His plan was to have a Nike, maybe zero to 10.

598
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,600
Like no cushion all the way up to full cushion?

599
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,320
Barefoot all the way up to having cushioning. And they started out, I think, with the 5.0,

600
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,080
and they did do a 3.0 and a 7.0. I don't know if you remember these,

601
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,400
and they were either more or less cushioned. But the problem with the minimal shoes

602
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,400
are that the studies that have been done have demonstrated that when people run in a partial

603
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,600
minimal shoe, they run closer to running in a regular shoe than barefoot.

604
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,800
In which case it defeats the purpose, because they're still heel striking,

605
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,000
but now they have less cushion.

606
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:46,560
Exactly. And a study that was done looking at a regular shoe, partial minimal shoe,

607
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,640
and a minimal shoe over the course of a training cycle of 12 weeks,

608
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,800
the partial minimal shoe had twice the injuries as the minimal shoe.

609
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,720
And the authors suggest that it may be, and they didn't look at biomechanics,

610
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,360
but it may be because the partial minimal shoe, they still were heel striking, but now you have

611
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,080
less cushioning, which is why I say if you're going to land on your heel, put cushioning under it.

612
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,200
I'm not going to try to convince people to run a certain way. When people come to me with injuries,

613
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,320
then we have a conversation about why we might want to change foot strike. But if people are

614
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,680
out there and they're happy, I'm happy for them. I just say you need to put cushioning under there,

615
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,320
and you need to change those shoes every three to 500 miles. I don't know if you know the shoes

616
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,480
that you have, the zero shoes, are guaranteed for 5,000 miles.

617
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,560
I did not know that. And I don't know if my wife will let me keep any one pair for that long.

618
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,920
I know, I know.

619
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,720
They're growing on her. She initially called them my clown shoes. She was so unimpressed with them,

620
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,360
but then I got her three pair. They've just evolved in terms of their fanciness now,

621
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,120
so she likes them a little bit more. Yeah.

622
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,720
They have. They're a little nicer.

623
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,880
You brought up something that I want to go a little deeper into. So I made this mistake

624
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:06,000
before with a friend, which was they were wearing orthotics. This was after I sort of

625
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,120
bought into the thesis that, hey, you don't want to be using orthotics indefinitely. You want to

626
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:17,840
regain the strength that is intrinsic to your own foot. And I sort of tried to help him wean

627
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,400
off the orthotics, but I think I did it too quickly, and it ended up kind of causing him

628
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,400
pain. So walk us through how you handle a patient. So patient comes to you. I'll just make up an

629
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,280
example, but feel free to come up with a different one if this isn't instructive. But this is someone

630
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,640
who's athletic, a former athlete, even the former runner, for that matter, who goes on to perhaps

631
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,120
they stop running and they come back to running. They develop very bad plantar fasciitis.

632
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:53,120
They see a podiatrist who says the diagnosis is low arches or high arches or some arches,

633
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,600
and they need to be in a stiff orthotic. And now they're in an orthotic. And now they come to you

634
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,640
and they say, God, I'd really love to run again, but this plantar fasciitis just won't quit. What

635
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:09,040
can you do for me, Dr. Davis? I always try to educate my patients because they need to buy

636
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,480
into this. Our approach is 180 degrees from the approach that they've been given. And I don't

637
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,680
want to dis someone else. I just want to say we've got a different approach. And our approach is,

638
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:25,600
rather than adapt to you, we want you to adapt to running. And so that requires you using your

639
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,040
muscles and your body in a different way. And I give them the example of a neck brace. This is

640
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,720
always really very illustrative for them. So if you put someone in a neck brace for life, what's

641
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,400
going to happen to your neck muscles? And they say, well, they're going to get weak and I'm not

642
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,640
going to be able to hold my head up. So if I give you a foot orthotic for life, what's going to

643
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,920
happen to those muscles? I think we all think that the arch is going to fall and the arch doesn't

644
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,040
fall. The arch actually gets stronger. So when you use that kind of analogy, a light bulb goes on.

645
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,680
I'm like, wow, yeah, they don't realize they have 10 muscles in their arch. So I go through that

646
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,640
anatomy with them. I'll show them a picture of it. And I go, you've got 10 muscles and four layers in

647
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,160
your arch of your foot. They can get stronger unless you're paralyzed. I don't think you're

648
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,160
paralyzed, right? No. So what we're going to do is we're going to slowly wean you from those

649
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,040
orthotics. And at the same time, we're going to be giving you exercises to strengthen your feet so

650
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,480
that it can start to take on the load that it's supposed to take off. So what we do is we slowly

651
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,480
wean them. And we usually wean them out in the same way I used to wean people in, which is I'll say,

652
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,240
take them out for an hour in the morning, but keep them with you. You don't want to take them

653
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,840
out and go cold turkey. And it depends again on how much they're doing. If they're walking to work,

654
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,840
and they're going three miles, you don't want that to be the hour that they take them out,

655
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,360
maybe walk a half a mile without them or a mile without them, and then just slowly take them out

656
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:55,200
and use your body to judge if your feet are feeling sore, put them back in. And we never take

657
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,600
them away from them. They may always can have them. So if they decide at some point they want to go

658
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:05,760
back to most people come to us wanting to get out of them, because they're paying, they're expensive,

659
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,000
and they've got to replace them at times and they stink. And they just don't like the idea of it. A

660
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,080
lot of people don't. So that's how we wean them out. And at the same time, we are strengthening

661
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:23,600
their feet. And we also once somebody has weaned out of them, and they're able to walk comfortably

662
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:29,440
without their orthotics in their regular shoes, then we put them in a pair of minimal shoes like

663
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,800
the ones you have. There are lots of different brands. We have three brands in our office where

664
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,560
they can try them on, decide what they like. Some people's feet are narrower.

665
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,360
So what are the three brands you like people to try?

666
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,160
I want to kind of be shoe agnostic because I love them all.

667
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

668
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,360
That we have just because people have given them to us really are the innovates, the Vivo Barefoots,

669
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,680
and the Xero. So those are the ones that people have donated the shoes to us, I think,

670
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:58,000
to their advantage because those are the ones people are going to try. But there are others as well.

671
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,920
And so we get them walking in the minimal shoes because we published a study that showed

672
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:12,400
that simply walking in minimal shoes is as efficacious, as effective as a foot strengthening

673
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,960
program. So we had three groups of people in this study. Sarah Ridge from BYU was the first author.

674
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,240
One group walked around in their regular shoes. Another group slowly progressed their walking

675
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,360
steps in minimal shoes. And the third group went through our foot core program over eight weeks.

676
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,520
And the foot core group and the minimal shoe group had almost the same amount of strengthening.

677
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,360
Foot core group had a little bit more strengthening. But it's very powerful when you

678
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:46,000
think just putting a pair of shoes on is going to strengthen your feet. And so we have them do that

679
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,560
right from the get go. If someone comes to us with plantar fasciitis, it's not right from the get go

680
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,200
and in orthotics. We take that slowly because it's important that they develop. They've got

681
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,800
to give the foot time to adapt to not having the orthotic. So what does that look like? Let's go

682
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,240
through that in some detail. Yeah, so it depends on the person and how long they've been in the shoes

683
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,520
and how weak their feet are. So what we do is we just try to slowly wean them out over the course

684
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,240
of maybe two to three weeks of weaning them out. And that's sort of the protocol you described

685
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,040
earlier, which was maybe just take it off for an hour in the morning as you walk around. And then

686
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,000
an hour in the midday and an hour at night, maybe something like that. Yeah, got it. Okay. So the

687
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,120
first goal of therapy for that patient is if I could get you for a day to just through your

688
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:38,800
activities of daily living, not require full arch support. That's a win. That's step one.

689
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,280
That's step one. That's right. And then we build their foot strength and we get them to wear the

690
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,600
minimal shoes just walking. And our program, when we transition someone from regular shoes,

691
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:54,960
even if they're not in orthotics, to a minimal shoe and forefoot strike requires what we call

692
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:01,280
our pre-gate program. So that program can be anywhere from one to three months, depending on

693
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,600
the person and their age, the older you are, the more time it takes. Typically, we're a little less

694
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:12,000
plastic as we age. But it's a program in which we do foot strengthening. We're also addressing other

695
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,520
issues. It's not just foot problems, but foot, hip, knee. We're working on functional activities,

696
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,680
teaching them how to use those foot intrinsic muscles when they're moving. So it's not enough

697
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,640
just to strengthen. You've actually got to teach people how to engage them during the activity.

698
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,600
And then we do a lot of off the treadmill kinds of activities like hopping and lunging and

699
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:41,440
plyometrics and jump roping and all kinds of things that help to get them to move dynamically,

700
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,240
but not run. These are components of running. And once they've met certain criteria, which

701
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,520
can take anywhere from one to three months, depending on the person and what kind of pain

702
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:55,200
they're in, then we put them on the treadmill and we start to do the retraining. When somebody is

703
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:02,080
wanting to transition to minimal shoes, even if they're completely healthy, I can't emphasize

704
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,520
enough that it's not just putting a new pair of shoes on, it's changing the way that you even walk.

705
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,840
And it's putting greater demands on your foot and your ankle. And so you need to give yourself time.

706
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,160
And so you need to walk and make sure you can walk for maybe 30 minutes briskly,

707
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,800
and then start to interject some running slowly. Because if you don't, you're going to load the

708
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:31,040
foot faster than it's ready. And you can create problems like plantar fasciitis or worse of a

709
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:37,600
metatarsal stress fracture. The bones of the foot, every bone, your tibia, those are really

710
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,200
protected by muscle. So when you have one of the long bones of your foot, the muscles on the

711
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:48,320
bottom of your foot and the muscles on the top of your foot are balanced so that the strain in the

712
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:54,080
metatarsal is minimized. But if you have an imbalance in that muscle strength, then you're

713
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,640
going to get additional strain on these metatarsals, which can lead repetitively to a stress fracture.

714
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,200
So it's really important that they strengthen. You know, Irene, I've looked at more CT scans and MRI

715
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:13,440
scans of people than I can ever possibly count. And let's just say you're looking through the

716
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:20,720
trunk or the legs. The difference between a muscular person who's super fit and someone

717
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,280
who's never exercised in their life is so apparent at the level of every muscle.

718
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,080
There's the obvious muscles. You look at the quadriceps. You look at the quadriceps of a

719
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:36,400
muscular person. I mean, you can see those four muscles. They are huge. But even at the level of

720
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:43,200
the rectus abdominis muscles, you take a look at a person who's never done a core exercise or a

721
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,800
crunch in their life and they barely have like half a centimeter thick of a rectus abdominis muscle.

722
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,440
And then you look at somebody who's incredibly fit all around. You see a rectus abdominis muscle

723
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:03,120
that's easily an inch thick. I've never bothered to look at the MRI of a foot for the same thing.

724
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:10,000
But hearing you talk about this makes me wonder if you look at a person who runs in a minimalist

725
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,680
shoe, who's been doing it forever, who's got these amazingly intrinsically powerful feet,

726
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:22,000
and then you look at somebody who's using a highly supported shoe. If I show you those two

727
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,640
CT scans or MRI scans just on the basis of the musculature, can you see a clear difference?

728
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:36,080
I don't look at those very often just because I'm more on the rehab side of things. I know that

729
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:43,600
research shows it's been done with ultrasound that when people run in minimalist shoes, the volume,

730
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,080
we've done a study looking at volume of the foot intrinsic muscles as well as the cross-sectional

731
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:54,560
area of each muscle gets bigger, significantly bigger. So I would say likely yes, you would be

732
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,720
able to notice it. I know that those numbers definitely increase. What I also know is there

733
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:06,400
was a study recently done that was presented in a meeting. It hasn't quite, it's in review right now

734
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,800
that took healthy feet and put them in a pair of orthotics for 12 weeks. And then they had a

735
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:18,240
control group that just were in a pair of shoes. Over 12 weeks, they mentioned that baseline and

736
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:25,360
at the end of that time period, the intrinsic muscles size reduced between 10 and 17 percent,

737
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:30,720
10 and 17 percent reduction. And the other group, there was no change at all. We wouldn't expect it.

738
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,720
What does that tell you? We know that when you take away the support, the muscles get bigger,

739
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,200
but it makes sense, but no one has actually shown this, that when you actually add support,

740
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,960
those muscles get smaller. It makes perfect sense. And yet we don't think about that. We don't even

741
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,720
think about the importance of those foot muscles. There was a recent clinical guidelines in the

742
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,520
physical therapy journal looking at clinical guidelines for treating plantar fasciitis.

743
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:03,680
And they have all kinds of recommendations, ultrasound, orthotics, ice, stretching,

744
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,920
everything but strengthening. And if you look at the clinical guidelines for something like

745
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,960
ankle sprain or knee injury or shoulder injury, they all include strengthening.

746
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,800
And that's my own profession that highlights the lack of appreciation for the muscles in the foot.

747
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:27,040
And they're very, very important. So how many podiatrists would agree with your approach

748
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,640
versus disagree with your approach? And is there a position statement taken by the field as a whole

749
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,600
on this? Because I've been to podiatrists myself three times in my entire life. And every time I

750
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,360
did, I walked out with a set of orthotics. Now it could be that that's just a bad sample size,

751
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:51,360
but that would lead me to believe that the entire field of orthotics is built around that. And I

752
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,600
could be very skeptical and say that it has to do with reimbursement and they're making money on the

753
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,560
orthotics and all sorts of things. I'll refrain from that speculation. But where does the field

754
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,680
as a whole sit in relation to what we're discussing now? So when I first started talking

755
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:12,800
about this, I used to present at the foot orthotic meetings with a group of podiatrists.

756
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:19,040
So when I started to change, I think they were very surprised. And I have debated on stage,

757
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:27,920
a very good friend of mine, colleague, who is very dug in about his dogma and orthotics. And I think

758
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,640
it's because they think it's working. I have to believe that he thinks that this is the right

759
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:39,440
thing to do. But we went back and forth. Now this was probably, I don't know, eight years ago now.

760
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,760
I don't know what he's thinking now, but I can tell you that more and more podiatrists are telling

761
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:49,360
me that now they think about orthotics as more of a temporary thing. So I think we're moving in that

762
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,280
direction. There are some podiatrists. There's one that I have been in touch with recently,

763
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,480
who is very much on the barefoot running and all of that. And he doesn't prescribe orthotics at all,

764
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,080
which is really unusual. I went down to Australia. I was invited down. And again,

765
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,080
this was probably about six, seven, eight years ago, again, same time period, probably.

766
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,600
They asked me to give a talk on barefoot running. I thought, gosh, do they really want to hear this?

767
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,000
Because it was a big podiatric group. I found that a lot of them were very open to the idea of

768
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,720
treating people with exercise and not orthotics. So it could be somewhat regional. And these were

769
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,480
also younger podiatrists. So the ones that are coming up are thinking differently.

770
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,800
My husband tells me, because I am a very impatient person. And he said, Mary, the way that you change

771
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,600
things, the way that you bend bamboo is a little at a time, you add some water and you bend it,

772
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,800
things are going to be slow to change. And you just have to keep at it. So my goal is to get people

773
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:58,720
back into minimal shoes from day one, because I think they're important for kids. I don't think

774
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,800
we should be putting kids into really structured shoes, let their feet develop. I think they're

775
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:09,440
important for adults. I also think they're very important in the aging. When you have a shoe that

776
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:15,840
allows your foot to be closer to the ground, you're more stable, that allows the muscles to act.

777
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,480
Because one of the things that happens with aging, as you start to lose muscle power, you lose it.

778
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,400
In your feet and lower extremities first, it goes from the feet up. So if you can do something to

779
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,960
help to preserve that strength, that's a good thing. I think it's really important. We're in

780
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,320
the process right now, a group of us are writing a paper about the minimal shoe across the lifespan,

781
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,200
because I think it's not just about athletics. It's about getting people into shoes that let their

782
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,080
feet do what they're supposed to do. I've really come to believe that as well, Irene. I got my

783
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:52,480
little guys some zeros last year, because I realized we were putting them into an ideal

784
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,920
world. I'd love for them to run around barefoot for the reasons you suggest. But look, you want

785
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,800
to protect the bottom of their feet, the concrete gets too hot. Okay, fine. But putting the zeros

786
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,680
on them, and hopefully they'll skip some of the stuff that the rest of us did. To your point,

787
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:10,560
I think as people age, the analogy I like to think about when I talk about feet is the tires

788
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,080
on a race car. You watch something like Formula One, right, which is the pinnacle of motorsport.

789
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,840
And what you have to remember is all of that power, that thousand horsepower engine, that

790
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,840
million dollar car has only four points of contact with the road, and they're called tires.

791
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:35,760
Every bit of force generation in the AP direction and in the media lateral direction is transmitted

792
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,640
through the drivetrain, through the tires, to the road, full stop. That's it. So now imagine

793
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:50,320
how much you could de-engineer tires to distance them from the road. How much you could create

794
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:56,400
lateral instability, how much you could remove grip from them. And I think about that through

795
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:02,800
the lens of our foot. If you cram your foot into a narrow little box and remove it from the surface

796
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:11,440
of the road, it's sort of like making your tire have less grip, more slip angle, and less lateral

797
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,160
stability. None of those things are desirable in a tire. I think if you just sort of think about

798
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:22,400
the importance of connecting to the ground, it does start to become pretty obvious. And I actually

799
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,400
like the way you're thinking about it, which is let's not shoehorn everyone into this box. If

800
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,840
somebody comes along and says, look, I'll never be able to give up heel striking. Well, that's not

801
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,160
a person that should be going to a minimalist shoe. That's fine. Let's hope that everything else

802
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,400
is going okay. I do want to ask you, what is a good reference for somebody? Let's say there's

803
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:46,000
somebody listening to this now who's wearing a maximalist shoe, who's heel striking, and either

804
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,120
does or doesn't have injury, but says, I want to start thinking about this transition. What are

805
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,840
the references to learn how to forefoot strike? Is this just something you just go out and do and

806
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:01,360
start concentrating on? To be honest with you, I know that there are people have written books

807
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:08,480
about it. There are courses on pose and chi running. I guess I believe that it is our,

808
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,240
if you take your shoes off, it's a natural way you want to run. Now you might still land on your

809
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:19,760
heel for a little while because you're used to it. But it's interesting. When I was in college,

810
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:25,200
I was running maybe about 20 miles a week just to stay fit. And I ended up with, I can't remember

811
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,560
what the injury was, but every time I stopped, it would go away. And then when I'd start running,

812
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,200
he came back. So I gave up running. I did a lot of inline skating, ton of inline skating,

813
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:37,920
did some marathon races and stuff in it. When Born to Run came out and I met Chris McDougall,

814
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,520
because Chris came down to, he lived in Lancaster, lives in Lancaster now. And he came down to the

815
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,440
University of Delaware because he was doing a story for, I think it was the times. And he wanted

816
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,080
me to run him on the treadmill and run him barefoot and that kind of thing. So we got talking and I

817
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:58,800
said to me, you know, I haven't run in so long and I think I'd really like to run again. Should I get

818
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,440
those vibro shoes? And he said, you know what, start barefoot. Just start barefoot and your

819
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,200
feet will teach you. And I did. That's what I did. I started running again barefoot. My feet did teach

820
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:15,280
me. It's like you don't need to be taught to walk. Now, if somebody has really bad posture,

821
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:20,000
you have all kinds of postures in walking as well. We can improve walking. I'm not saying that you

822
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,440
can't improve the technique of someone in running, but I feel like sometimes people overthink it,

823
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,320
get people in that do these really strange things like they're kicking their butt and they're not

824
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,800
running fast. They're running slow, but they're kicking their butt. Like why are you kicking your

825
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:40,000
feet up? Well, that, you know, I was told to do that. So it seems like maybe just going to grass,

826
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,200
going to a forgiving environment and running barefoot and doing it for very short periods of time,

827
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:50,880
instead of doing like a long run, say, look, I'm going to go and run a few hundred yards,

828
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,080
stop, regroup. I'll give you an example. I learned to swim as an adult. I guess we could sit here and

829
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,520
debate whether swimming is innate to our species. It seems there's probably a very early window in

830
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,360
which if you're exposed to swimming, when you're, you know, a few months old, it tends to come

831
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,320
naturally. But certainly anyone who's watched a five year old who's never swim, you realize it

832
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,720
doesn't look too innate, but nevertheless, I'm 31 when I'm learning to swim. And the only way I

833
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:23,920
could really do it was to understand the technique and do it in very short bursts with lots of rest

834
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,040
so that my technique wouldn't deteriorate, which basically amounted to doing a lot of drills and

835
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,880
never really swimming more than 50 yards or 50 meters at a time until I slowly learned how to

836
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,040
piece those together. And I haven't read she running. My wife actually has it because Terry

837
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:47,280
Laughlin, who's the guy that taught me how to swim, he's no longer alive, but Terry created a program

838
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,880
called Total Immersion for Swimming. He was very good friends with, I forget, is it Danny? What's

839
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,400
the guy who wrote she running? Oh yeah, I've met him. Danny. Yeah, I can't remember Dan's last name.

840
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,760
I can't recall, but Terry and Danny were friends. And when Terry knew that my wife was a runner,

841
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,640
he got her connected. And I guess I should go back and read the book. I'm very curious now

842
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,720
about what the methods are, but it really is whether you decide you never want to run for

843
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:19,280
the sake of running or whether you decide, I actually do want to run. I want to use running

844
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,160
as a form of my exercise. I just don't think you can make a strong enough case for why it's

845
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:29,680
imperative that we learn to use our feet better. That's sort of my thinking on this subject matter

846
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,040
is the minimalist shoe becomes a vehicle through which we learn to acquire the contact of our feet

847
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,400
to the ground. And if you want to run, that's essential. Yeah, I agree. I want to go back to

848
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,120
something that you said about when you start running. This is another thing I asked Chris.

849
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,880
First of all, I asked him, should I wear the vibrancy goes? Now you really need to go barefoot

850
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,600
so you get all the sensory input. And I said, you know, I like to paint my toes. I go, Chris,

851
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,800
I don't want to get calluses. He goes, honey, the world is your pumice stone. But he told me,

852
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,240
don't start in grass. And the reason for that is that when you start in grass, well, first of all,

853
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:09,920
grass is more dangerous. I've never cut my foot. I have burned my foot on hot pavement at times,

854
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,120
because I wasn't smart enough not to run when it was really hot. But the problem with running grass

855
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,640
is first of all, you can't see what's there. I'd be a little nervous running barefoot and grass,

856
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,920
honestly, I've cut my foot in the sand, sharp shells and things like that. So if you can't see

857
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:30,000
what's underneath it. But the other thing is that when you run on a soft surface, you stiffen your

858
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
leg. This is amazing thing about our leg spring, you have this ability, this innate ability to

859
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,280
modulate the stiffness of your leg. So when you land on hard surfaces, you make your leg compliant.

860
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,720
So if you're going to step off of a three foot step and land on concrete, you're going to land as

861
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:54,080
soft as you can, you're going to flex your ankles, your knees, your hips. But if you land in sand,

862
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,960
you're going to stiffen, you don't want to collapse into it. So you stiffen on soft surfaces. And

863
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,560
there's lots and lots of studies that have shown this. This is definitely true. This is why when

864
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:11,840
you have a cushioned shoe, we'll go back to that, you tend to land hard. If you train on grass,

865
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,240
there's nothing wrong with starting on grass, it's fine. But when you train on hard surfaces,

866
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,720
it teaches you to be really compliant. And that's what Chris told me to do. He said,

867
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,760
start on the hard surfaces. If you're going to run, do most of your running on hard surfaces,

868
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,000
like people who compete, mostly always on hard surfaces, unless you're doing track,

869
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:36,240
then you need to train your leg to be compliant. I tell people, you can mix it up, it's fine,

870
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,560
but make sure you do a good part of your training on the surface you're going to do most of your

871
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,560
running on. So don't do all of it on soft surfaces, really. And again, the hardest part

872
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:52,000
is making your leg nice and compliant. And when you make it compliant, you're actually using muscles

873
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,720
to attenuate. So it's work, it's work to make it compliant. So yeah, I would start that way.

874
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,440
Thanks for clarifying that. That's interesting. Now I want to go up the chain a little bit. You

875
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:10,000
alluded to the knee and I want to talk about other issues of the knee. So is knee valgus an issue?

876
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,240
Are you concerned with that? Do you see when a person's running and they have a significant

877
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:19,200
valgus and I'll let you explain to people what that is, how much of an issue is that? And is

878
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:24,960
that basically always a pathologic finding, sometimes a pathologic finding, and does it

879
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,400
always result from the foot? There's a lot of questions there.

880
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,920
I'm known for that, Irene. That's what I do. I'm going to give you a lot of questions.

881
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,120
I'm known for saying there's never 100% of anything. I'll never say always and never say

882
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,480
never. There are people who have terrible alignment that aren't injured and there are

883
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,720
people who have good alignment that are injured. And part of it is because these injuries are

884
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:52,000
multifactorial and if we just take the mechanical part of it, part of it's related to your structure,

885
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,080
that's just how you're built, and then how you move, your motor control, and then your dosage,

886
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,880
how quickly you ramp up and how much dosage you have. So you could have someone who has

887
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,440
a problem with their alignment but they're keeping their dosage down so they don't get injured.

888
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,040
So you can look at them and it looks like that they should be injured but they're not.

889
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,640
That might just be because they're keeping their dosage down. You can have someone that looks

890
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:19,600
really well aligned and really good mechanics but because they did too much too quick.

891
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,160
So it really is not a one-to-one. And here's the other thing that's really interesting.

892
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:30,880
You can have someone who's got knee valgus and have five people. One could have a knee problem.

893
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:36,080
It manifests as a knee problem. One it could manifest as a hip problem. Another person could

894
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,760
be their medial foot. Another person could be their plantar fascia. So it's not a mapping of

895
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,880
one-to-one. And you can have somebody with knee problems. One of them might have excessive

896
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:53,280
valgus. Another might have a really stiff landing. You see what I'm saying? So it's what makes it

897
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,360
so much fun to figure out but it's not straightforward. It's not a one-to-one mapping.

898
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:07,520
Having said that, there are these patterns that we tend to see with injuries. So I had to kind

899
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:14,480
of preface it with that but the two features that we see most often with injuries and we've had over

900
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:20,480
700 through the Running Injury Clinic so far at our center are high impacts, landing hard,

901
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:27,840
and malalignment in general. But the most common malalignment is a medialization of their leg.

902
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:35,120
So when I say that, I mean there's valgus. So the knees come in towards each other. So instead of

903
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:40,160
the legs being straight, the knees bow in. They can bow out. That's why there's other

904
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:45,440
alignments. This is most common though. The kneecap rotates inward. So the kneecaps start to look at

905
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:53,840
each other. A rotation inward of the leg often. And the pelvis drops to each side every time you land.

906
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,760
Other side drops down. Then you land on the other leg. The other side drops down. It can be just on

907
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:04,960
one side. All those seem to go together and they're the most common. And I think that a lot of that

908
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,520
relates if we talk about evolution. It goes back to the fact that when we sit, as much as we're

909
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,600
sitting now in our lives, we don't have the core stability. Short of if we're really going at it

910
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,000
and really making sure that we're addressing our core, which not a lot of people do, and that core

911
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,280
instability, just like the instability of the foot, you don't have the core muscle. We call it the foot

912
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:32,640
core for a reason. It's just like the lumbar pelvic core. If those muscles aren't doing their job,

913
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,640
then the prime movers can't do their job and you have malfunction. So I believe that we see a lot

914
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,840
of this instability because we are so weak in our core so we don't have that kind of stability. And

915
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,400
those kids I mentioned from La Sierra High School, I betcha if I looked at them, they wouldn't have

916
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:54,480
those kind of mechanics. So it is a very common kind of problem that we see in terms of mechanics

917
01:25:54,480 --> 01:26:00,480
is that valgus. Irene, when you talk about the elevation and depression of the hemipelvus,

918
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,400
I think everybody knows what you're talking about, which is basically the hip hiking that occurs one

919
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,760
side to the other. It's actually not a hiking, it's the other hip dropping. I see. So the one side

920
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,320
is actually staying level, the other side is actually depressing. Okay. Right. And it's the

921
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:20,480
side, so if you're on your right leg, it's the right hip that keeps the left hip from falling down.

922
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:28,640
So it's the opposite side that drops. So if on my right leg, it's my right hip muscles that hold

923
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:34,400
my hip, my pelvis level. I got it. Because the left foot's not on the ground. It's not under load.

924
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,680
It's swinging through. So this drops unless these muscles are doing their job. And then when you go

925
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:46,320
to the other leg, so now I'm on my left leg, then my pelvis is going to drop to my right because the

926
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:51,120
left hip muscles are not doing their job. You mentioned the core, which is obviously a very

927
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:59,520
broad term. So are you referring to the intrinsic muscles of the pelvis along with the transversalis

928
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:07,840
fascia and all these muscles, or is it also in part the result of the adductors and abductors

929
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:13,920
being too weak? This is such a complicated part of the anatomy that it's hard to get a handle on

930
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:19,520
what muscles. Let's use the example you gave. So the right foot is on the ground striking.

931
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:28,000
The left foot is now sweeping. The left hip has now gone down, right? So what's not firing that

932
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,800
should be? I think it's all of the above. I think you need that stability of the small muscles that

933
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,440
actually stabilize the hip in its socket. I think you need the abdominals that prevent the pelvis

934
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:46,800
from anteriorly tilting. So you get a tilting of the top part of the pelvis forward and the back

935
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:53,920
part of the pelvis backwards. That tilting is also associated with rotation inward of the thigh.

936
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,520
They kind of go together. And then if the abductors are not doing their job, you get the drop.

937
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,920
It really is all of it, but you need that stability also of the core. And the core really is the sort

938
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,640
of the transverse of deep muscles that stabilize. And it's not always weakness. We think about it.

939
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:18,560
We talk to our patients and say, you've got your hardware and your software. Your hardware is the

940
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:24,240
strength of your musculoskeletal system. That's your hardware. But the software is your motor

941
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:31,120
pattern. So we see people who are not that weak, but they are a mess mechanically because they just

942
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:36,080
start using the muscles in the way that they should. Another injury I'd like to ask you about

943
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:42,480
is, which I've struggled with not in a long time. I got it under control by strengthening my

944
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:49,440
abductors, but is IT band. And a lot of people get this really miserable pain on the side of their

945
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:55,040
knee. I think most people are familiar with what that is, but the IT band is this sort of tendinous

946
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,240
thing that connects to a muscle called the tensor fascia lata, which is basically at your hip.

947
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,680
What are some of the things that you see exacerbating that IT band syndrome and do

948
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:09,760
any of them actually tie all the way down to the foot and what we've talked about?

949
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:16,960
I can. That's a very good point. So we did a study looking at people with IT band syndrome

950
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:22,000
compared to healthy controls. And we looked at their mechanics and we have two studies. One of

951
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,920
them was retrospective. That means that these people were now healed, but they had a history

952
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:34,240
of IT band syndrome and we compared them to their controls. Then we had another study where we had

953
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:39,120
people who were healthy to start out with and we looked to see who got injured and who did not.

954
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,280
That is a stronger design because there you can say they didn't have the injury, here are the

955
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,560
mechanics, and it led to this injury. Whereas when you look retrospectively, which is easier to do

956
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,760
from a scientific standpoint, you've got to wait for the injuries in a prospective design,

957
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,160
but in a retrospective you can just go and get people out of history. But you don't know whether

958
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:07,040
the injury caused it or it was there before. We've done both kinds of studies and we found the

959
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:13,040
exact same results, which to me is very compelling. What we found in the mechanics was that people

960
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:19,040
with IT band syndrome had greater inward angulation of their thigh, which can kind of

961
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:26,400
contribute to valgus. The reason that that's important is because the IT band attaches

962
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,840
to the distal thigh. There's a very robust attachment, not just to the tibia,

963
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:38,560
Gertie's tubercle, which is a little bump on the lateral lower leg bone, but it also attaches to

964
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:45,360
the end of the thigh bone. When the thigh comes in too much, it stretches it. The other thing that

965
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:50,560
stretches it is when the pelvis drops because the IT band comes all the way up and it does

966
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:58,400
insert into the tensor fasciae and glutes. So the drop of the pelvis and the inward angulation of

967
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:05,440
the thigh just puts a big strain on the IT band. If it's already tight, as you flex and extend your

968
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:11,200
knee, it goes back and forth over the bump on the lateral end of the thigh bone. So it just rubs and

969
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:16,240
gets this pressure. You can have that excessive pressure to start with. And then if you increase

970
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:22,720
the amount that your hip comes in and your pelvis drops, it just further exacerbates it.

971
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:29,120
So that's one cause of it. The other mechanic that we saw, both retrospectively and prospectively,

972
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:35,680
again, very strong results, was internal rotation of the tibia. So the tibia is the lower leg bone.

973
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:45,040
Now the IT band also attaches to the tibia. So as the tibia rotates inward, it stretches the IT band.

974
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,360
So when you ask me about the foot, the tibia is connected to the leg bones connected to the foot

975
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,040
bone. So if you're excessively pronating, it can excessively internally rotate your tibia.

976
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,560
It can be from the foot and it can be from the hip. And when you think about the knee

977
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,760
and all kinds of knee injuries, it's the joint in the middle of the foot and the hip. So it often

978
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:14,480
is the victim of issues with the foot or the hip. Pronating in this context is the opposite of

979
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:20,640
inversion. Yes, pronating and supinating, it's just another term for it. But yeah, so you're

980
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:25,920
rolling your foot inward too much. The analogy would be the E version, inversion and E version,

981
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,280
sometimes also referred to as supination and pronation.

982
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:34,000
That's very interesting. It speaks to this idea that you've got to be able to

983
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,280
at least try to identify the cause of this with some gait analysis. I think in my case when my

984
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:47,680
IT band hurt, I just assumed it was the first explanation you gave. And it was because once I

985
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:54,560
took on a robust program of strengthening the glute med, basically, especially from an eccentric

986
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:00,000
standpoint, so really did a lot of eccentric strengthening of the glute med, all of a sudden

987
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,480
you now have the ability to keep the femur out. You take that valgus and lengthening away of the

988
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,480
IT band and the pain gets better. I was experiencing it on a bicycle actually not running.

989
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:16,640
Nevertheless, but the point here is I never even thought about it through the lens of if you have

990
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:21,840
enough E version or pronation, you're going to pull on the other head of that tendon, which is

991
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,040
attaching to the tuberosity of the tibia. I mean, it's really an amazing field you're in because it

992
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:32,240
is truly an engineering field. I mean, it's a structural... One of the things I'm doing with

993
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:38,080
my daughter right now this summer is we're working on physics. She's in sixth grade. It's more about

994
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:45,040
the fun of physics, but last week we worked on free body diagrams, drawing forces and the direction

995
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:49,920
of this force, the direction of that force and the magnitude of this versus that. And we're basically

996
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,320
just doing Newtonian physics and going through the three laws. This would be a great thing for me

997
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:59,360
to now show her as she's sort of thinking about this muscle is pulling this way, but if this one's

998
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:04,000
pulling that way, look what could happen. And the ground reaction force is another great example

999
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,080
because they are equal and opposite. It's Newton's third law. You push down, the ground pushes you up.

1000
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,120
So when you push down on the ground, you're a free body diagram of the world. You are pushing down

1001
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,440
on the world, but the world's so massive it doesn't move. And you get all the Chinese people on the

1002
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:24,000
other side, they're pushing up, remember, on the other side of the world. But the force that's

1003
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,360
coming back at you because your mass is so much smaller creates your movement. So it is all physics.

1004
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,000
And this is why I have loved being in this field is because I get to marry physics with medicine.

1005
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:40,800
Let's go back and close the loop then on that sort of force discussion around how it is that

1006
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:48,160
joints can experience an amplification of that force. So the reason that it amplifies the force

1007
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:54,560
is because the ground reaction force, the muscles have to respond to the ground reaction force.

1008
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,840
And so if you have a force that is directed, say, let's take the knee and it's directed behind the

1009
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:08,800
knee, it's going to create a flexion moment on the knee. And so the knee has to extend in order for

1010
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:16,480
you to be able to prevent yourself from collapsing. So it creates these muscle forces around the joint.

1011
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,360
And when the muscle forces act around the joint, they compress the joint inward.

1012
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,680
And so they create an increase. That's how they get amplified.

1013
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:30,000
It's really amazing because and this will be probably more than you would want to explain

1014
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,520
to a 12 year old. But this is where the free body diagrams become really complicated,

1015
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:43,840
because it's not just I hit this thing with 200 Newtons, it hit me back at 200 Newtons. No,

1016
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,240
that 200 Newtons gets into the joint and then the joint has its own internal moment arm that's

1017
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:56,400
going to add, as you said earlier, potentially seven X that force. And then, of course,

1018
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:02,320
depending on the length of that moment arm, I mean, we're talking about really serious forces here.

1019
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,400
Do you ever just sit back and look at this and think how the hell did we even evolve? Like it's

1020
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:13,280
so remarkable at what our bodies are capable of, isn't it? Yeah, it is. And the fact that we're so

1021
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:19,360
adaptable is the thing that's amazing. I mean, this is why I love mechanics because we can adapt.

1022
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,240
We can't change our structure, sort of doing osteotomies, which I'm not qualified to do,

1023
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,440
meaning making changes in alignment in the bones. Mechanics, though, is something that's very

1024
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:36,320
modifiable. And for a long time, people did not believe that. When I first started in this business,

1025
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:41,680
I was a young scientist and I went to a meeting and I talked about gate retraining runners.

1026
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:48,160
Wow, I got virtual tomatoes thrown at me. I remember it. And people saying you can't

1027
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:55,680
change the way somebody moves, that we have these automatic generators of gate. But if you actually

1028
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:04,400
study it, we do have the ability, super cortical ability to modulate our gate pattern. And so it's

1029
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:09,680
been really fun to be able to say, okay, I see that in your gate, I'm going to change it.

1030
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:15,680
It's not easy. I have to say it's not easy because in order to change somebody's gate,

1031
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:21,360
you have to give them a lot of practice. They've got a certain pattern that they have. And they've

1032
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:28,400
had it for 20 years, 40 years, 60 years, depending on how old they are. And we've done gate retraining

1033
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,840
across that age span. You need to be able to give them feedback to begin with so that they start to

1034
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:39,680
learn, okay, this is right. This is what I see that's right. If it's visual feedback, this is

1035
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:45,680
what it feels like. Now I know what's right. Then you have to start to fade the feedback. So now

1036
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,280
they have to feel what's right without having it because they're not going to have it. And then you

1037
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:55,600
have to give them a lot of practice. That process of changing your gate, though I think it's worth

1038
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,080
it if you've been injured and we think that the mechanics are causing the injury, you have to be

1039
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:05,680
patient with it. And even when you finish, so in our program, I started to tell you we have a,

1040
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:12,400
say on average, a two month pre-gate. Then they have a three time a week, four week

1041
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:18,400
gate retraining on the treadmill. And then they go out for 10 weeks under our supervision. They're

1042
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:23,200
out running on their own, but we check in with them. They come and see us at two weeks and at

1043
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:29,680
four weeks and they have to start really slow. They can't go really fast because even though

1044
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,240
they've maybe got the pattern now, if they want to start ramping up, they got to give the tissues

1045
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:40,560
the time to adapt. It is a process that takes patience. And if someone's going to come to us

1046
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,840
and say, Hey, I'm doing this New York marathon two months, we say we can't do this right now.

1047
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,400
We'll give you some exercises and try to help you out, but you're going to need a lot more time than

1048
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:56,320
that. What percentage of those patients Irene are people that have no injury but have bought

1049
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:01,680
into this thesis, which is my gate's probably not adequate and I'm going to get injured one day.

1050
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:07,120
So I want to do this in a totally preventative manner versus people who are actually under the

1051
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:12,720
spell of some injury at the time that they show up. So in order to be able to have the treatments

1052
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,480
paid for, you have to have an injury. They wouldn't get it covered in terms of retraining. So I would

1053
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:24,160
say we have had people come in for just an eval for us to kind of take a look at their gate.

1054
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,120
Sometimes a spouse will give it to their spouse as a Christmas gift or something like that.

1055
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,600
But in terms of people come through the program, it's 100% people who've been injured,

1056
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,960
which seems to be a bit of a failure of the system. That's sort of the same problem we have

1057
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,760
in medicine, which is, look, we'll wait till you have type two diabetes, at which point it's going

1058
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,800
to cost the healthcare system somewhere between seven and $12,000 a year, including insulin.

1059
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:54,400
But God forbid we spend, I don't know, $500 a year on prevention to make sure you never get type two

1060
01:39:54,400 --> 01:40:00,960
diabetes. It seems to me that a great investment, at least for the people who are motivated,

1061
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,280
would be taking people who are not injured and teaching them what you were talking about.

1062
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,840
So let me tell you about a study of one of my colleagues. He was one of my postdocs that he

1063
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:16,640
went on and did a study where he took 320 novice, meaning they'd been running a year or less.

1064
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:21,680
I think they'd all been running at least a year, but not much more than that. And then what he did

1065
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:27,120
is he took half of them and had them train on a treadmill, because the same kind of retraining

1066
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:32,080
program we have, where they had a monitor and they could see those impacts that I was telling you

1067
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,960
about. And I can give you some graphs of these. And so what they did is they were told to get rid

1068
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:42,800
of the impact, to land softer. And he didn't monitor what they did, but in order to do that,

1069
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,520
they probably got off their heels. And then the other group went through the same eight sessions.

1070
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,400
They did eight sessions. They slowly ramp up from 10 minutes to 30 minutes over those eight sessions.

1071
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:59,520
And then he followed them for a year. And these are healthy people, 62% reduction in injuries in

1072
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:06,240
the group that was trained to land softer, 62% reduction over the course of a year. That's huge.

1073
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,960
What's most amazing to me in that study, if I understand you correctly, Irene, is that

1074
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:16,640
they weren't given an explicit instruction of how to change their form. It was basically they

1075
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:25,440
adapted to the visual stimulus of just make that spike smaller and they figured out what to do.

1076
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,200
And then in what sounds like a relatively short period of time, made the adjustment,

1077
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:33,040
the adjustment stuck. Am I replaying that correctly to you?

1078
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,880
Yes, I think you are. The thing that we're not sure of, because he didn't, and this is one of

1079
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,760
the criticisms of the studies, that he never brought them back later to see if it did stick.

1080
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:49,360
So not sure. And it may be that some people did get reduced the spike where others may have eliminated

1081
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,960
it by being on the ball of their foot. I would like to know if the people on the ball of their

1082
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:58,880
foot had less injuries. Dan's group did a study, Dan Lieberman's group did a study looking,

1083
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:05,600
it's retrospective of the Harvard track team and found that the kids who were forefoot strikers

1084
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:13,040
on the track team had half of the running, he classified them into overuse injuries and they

1085
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:18,320
had half of the injuries of the refford strikers. Because it's retrospective, it's not as strong as

1086
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:24,800
being prospective. But another really interesting piece of information in terms of how this might

1087
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:30,960
apply to running teams is that there's a group, it's a close Christian community, and I won't name

1088
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,760
them because they don't want to be named. But it's a close Christian community. The doc of the

1089
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:40,560
close Christian community basically went through medical school, he's a physician, and he had all

1090
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,600
kinds of foot related problems. And all of his residents and fellows and colleagues who were

1091
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,080
giving him advice, he got like three pairs of orthotics and nothing helped him. It was when

1092
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:54,240
Born to Run had come out and he kind of looked at it and put the book down and they decided to read

1093
01:42:54,240 --> 01:43:00,160
it and they decided that he's going to try to go barefoot and minimal. And it cured his problem,

1094
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:05,760
resolved his problem, I can say it's cured it, but it resolved his problem. So now he, as a member

1095
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,080
of this community, they pay for your medical school and then you come back into the community.

1096
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:17,840
And he's the physician in the community. The track team of this community had had some members that

1097
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:24,480
had season ending injuries, running injuries. But before that, he started to prescribe minimal shoes

1098
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:31,200
for some of his patients that weren't responding to standard of care. So he used to really send

1099
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:37,120
all of his foot related patients to a podiatrist. And then he started deciding, I'm going to try

1100
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:42,000
this because it worked for me. So this first woman who just wasn't getting better with the

1101
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
orthotics and the standard of care. So he said, look, I know you may think I'm crazy, but would

1102
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,640
you be willing to try this? And it worked. And they tried it again. And he tried it again. And

1103
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:56,640
he tried again to the point where he was so convinced that this was working, they actually

1104
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:01,520
decide the footwear, they have a clothing store because nobody pays for anything. It's all common

1105
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:07,280
money. And they had a clothing store. He ordered minimal shoes. So 80% of their community now are

1106
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:15,440
in minimal shoes. And he showed a graph of the number of referrals to podiatrists went down

1107
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:20,560
as his prescription of minimal footwear went up. And with that success in the normal community

1108
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,760
with walking, he decided to try it with the cross country team. He was the physician for

1109
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,960
the cross country team. And the coaches went along with it. So they basically started in January and

1110
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,680
had the kids start transitioning in January before the September season. So they had what,

1111
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:43,280
nine months of slowly working into the minimal shoes. And they ended up that year having no

1112
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:49,680
injuries and winning their division. And then they had a second year of, I think winning, they

1113
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:53,840
got bumped up, even though we're small school, because they were so successful, they got bumped

1114
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:58,800
up to the next division. And I think they came in second. And they had basically no injuries,

1115
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,880
like one sprained ankle, but no tubular stress fractures, no plantar fasciitis, no injury,

1116
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:08,800
knee pain, no IT, all the things that you see. And he's had a third year, I think this is a third

1117
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,120
year. And then we had, yeah, he had a third year because COVID, I haven't really talked to him

1118
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:17,920
since. I can't publish this because they want to stay private. And I understand that. But it's just

1119
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:23,360
unfortunate, I can't publish it. But basically, it's just an example when you have this kind of

1120
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:30,240
ability to control it, and you look and see that it can have that kind of result. This is why I say,

1121
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:35,120
I would love to see people all start their kids this way, and have people run this way. I think

1122
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:39,360
our running mechanics would improve. I think we wouldn't have the same kind of problems with feet,

1123
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,280
I don't think we'd have the same kind of problems with these. This is my hypothesis, and I admit it's

1124
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:49,040
a hypothesis. And some people think I'm a little bit crazy. But I don't. We're really coming back

1125
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,960
to your points about evolution. It's the way that we evolved to be. And so I feel like we have

1126
01:45:54,960 --> 01:46:00,800
everything we need. And that when we start to add shoes, we haven't talked about this much, you add

1127
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:07,600
torques to the ankle, knee and the hip. So when you look at the torques at the ankle, knee and hip,

1128
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:13,040
they are the lowest with barefoot. That's like your gold standard. And the minute you start to add

1129
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:20,240
footwear, low heel and higher heel and more athletic shoes with more flares to the outer sole,

1130
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:26,800
the torques go up. Now, does the increase in torques cause a problem? I don't know. But they

1131
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:33,040
certainly are increased above what we're adapted for. It's like, how do we facilitate natural

1132
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:38,960
movement in a modern world? And it's a challenge. I share your view. I share your bias. I'll say

1133
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:44,560
that. That if you took every kid when they were born and you kept them in minimalist footwear,

1134
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:50,720
and they never sat down in chairs. So you squatted, you sat on logs, you stood,

1135
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:57,280
but this idea of a desk and a chair was taken away. I would put those as two of the five most

1136
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:02,480
important things you could do. Like if I could be czar of the world and I could have five things

1137
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:08,000
that I would do to change human health. And I was given the liberty of going and starting at the

1138
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,560
beginning. So saying you could implement these changes from the moment a person is born.

1139
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,280
Those are two of the five I'd take right there. I couldn't agree with you more because we see so

1140
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,840
many problems with feet and hips and it's all related to that. I just couldn't agree with you

1141
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:27,360
more. I think that we got to start it there. And I think that we would be solving a lot of the

1142
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:33,440
problems. We're going to get phys ed and this is going a little off topic, but I'm really wanting

1143
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:40,160
to see phys ed back in schools every single day and not just dodgeball, but activities that are

1144
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,000
actually calisthenics, pushups, sit ups, using your upper extremities, monkey bars, kids hanging

1145
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,200
over. I mean, we don't do that anymore. I think we need to really encourage that kind of activity.

1146
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:57,920
The statistics are overwhelming. It's just so unbelievable. I think by the time adolescents,

1147
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:04,000
you're 12 to 17 years old, on average kids have at least one chronic disease.

1148
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:09,200
Not all kids, maybe it was 40% of kids. I can't remember the exact numbers, but it was really

1149
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:15,920
alarming. And a fairly large percent of them had two chronic diseases as adolescents. That to me

1150
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:20,960
is really alarming. We shouldn't be having chronic diseases as kids. Diabetes is really high

1151
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,040
in kids now. It's grown, it's really increased. Yeah. And I think the chronic injury issue is

1152
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:33,120
another problem, which is if you're a kid that if you're having knee pain and hip pain and all these

1153
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:38,080
sorts of issues when you're 18 or when you're in college, it's not like it's going to get better

1154
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:42,400
when you're out of college without a very deliberate effort. We definitely need to get

1155
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:48,160
our kids so that they're not doing a single sport. It's been shown that those kids actually burn out

1156
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:53,200
quicker. They get injured at a higher rate, that it's important for kids to be using their bodies

1157
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:58,800
in a number of different ways. That multi-sport athlete is much healthier than the single sport

1158
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:06,160
that's doing soccer all year long. Yeah. Irene, I got to say, I'm pretty glad that

1159
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:11,760
Hoover sent you that rejection letter. Yeah, me too. 50 years ago, right? Because I think

1160
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,320
the human condition is a better place for you not having become an FBI agent, though I'm sure you

1161
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:20,560
would have been an excellent one at that. And despite what you said about your patients,

1162
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:26,960
I don't detect in you someone who has an unhealthy amount of impatience. I detect in you just the

1163
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,760
right amount of impatience, which is you've kicked the hornet's nest enough, you've stirred up the

1164
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:37,280
pot enough. But what impresses me the most in this discussion, and I knew from reading what

1165
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,640
you'd written and your credentials that this would be an interesting discussion, but what

1166
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:46,240
doesn't come across in all of those is how malleable you've been in your thinking and how many ways and

1167
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:51,760
times you've changed your view based on new evidence that's put forth. And that leads me to believe

1168
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,840
that five years from now, if we speak again, you're going to have something different to say,

1169
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:00,160
which I always view as a sign of good thoughtfulness. With that said, I want to thank you

1170
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:04,160
very much for your time. I know people are going to enjoy this, hopefully half as much as I did.

1171
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:09,680
Peter, it's been really fun talking to you because I think we are like-minded and like-spirited.

1172
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:14,960
Thank you very much for the opportunity. I really have enjoyed it. They're not always as much fun

1173
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:20,480
as this one was. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested
