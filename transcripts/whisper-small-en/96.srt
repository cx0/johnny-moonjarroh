00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,000
today's episode. I guess this week is David Epstein. David is the author of the bestselling

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,160
book, The Sports Gene, and more recently, range why generalists triumph in a specialized world,

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,520
which ironically makes him a specialist of generalists. He was previously a science and

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,720
investigative reporter at ProPublica, and prior to that, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,600
I have followed David's work for some time, have enjoyed his articles, his books, and reached out

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,480
to him several months ago, asking to interview him, even though I had already heard him on a couple

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,200
of other podcasts that frankly, I thought did a great job, but I just knew there was more I wanted

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
to explore with him. So of course, if you've heard David on other podcasts, I wouldn't let

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,280
that discourage you from listening to him here. We go into, in my opinion, sort of a broader,

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,640
deeper discussion that's sort of enabled by our long format. We talk about a lot of things, but

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,440
I think at the root of it, it's basically trying to get a better understanding of how we can improve

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,040
our own performance. And perhaps you can see we get into a lot of stuff around kids, but as parents,

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,080
how do we manage the exposure of our kids to various things? I think anyone listening to this,

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,080
who is a parent, obviously feels pretty strongly about giving their kids the best chance at finding

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,000
something they love and doing well at it. There are so many things we go into in this podcast that

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,360
are just fascinating beyond belief, including a really good explanation of why the 10,000 hour

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,720
rule that most people take for granted is essentially an axiom or dogma, i.e. that 10,000

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,920
hours of deliberate practice is what is required for mastery and greatness. And I think David goes

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,800
into a great explanation of why that's probably completely nonsense, which is not to say that

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,400
deliberate practice is not incredibly important, but to break it down to something as simple as

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,400
10,000 hours is almost assuredly incorrect. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:41,320
with David Epstein. Thank you so much for coming. It's a pleasure. Thanks for having me. Your work

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,720
has been something I followed for quite a long time now. And even before your most recent book

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,920
came out, just on the basis of the book you wrote, was it in 2013? That's right. Yeah, just on the

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,600
basis of that book, people had always said, you got an interview, and I was always like, yeah, yeah,

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,680
I know, I know, I know, I know. And then the new book comes out and it's like, well, now there's no

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
excuse not to. So, and I guess it's tough for you because you have this new book and everybody was

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,880
talking about it, but I kind of want to talk about the old one too, if that's okay. Whatever you want.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,720
We can talk about something other than my books if you want. We have a lot to talk about actually,

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,600
because I learned a number of things about you in getting ready to sit down today, but somehow it

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,040
escaped me that you were a fan of Ira Tencena. Yeah. I mean, first of all, one of the all time

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,840
great sports documentaries if people have seen Senna, but I used to follow racing and just,

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,280
I loved racing in general. Like if you put two paper boats on a pond, I was interested basically.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,160
And then as I learned about him and his start in karting and the different types of racing he did,

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,240
the fact that he was a good gymnast as a young guy, that he basically tried to retire from racing

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,120
at one point, and that he was also very quietly charitable. And I think kind of a sensitive soul

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
in a lot of ways and obviously a very dramatic story. And I think the greatest deaf one driver

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
ever. And so just a lot of, I don't really as much as you, so I'm kind of cautious about saying

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,040
anything, but yeah. I think all of those things are really interesting and resonant. And so last

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
week I went to the beach and was with my kids and the two older kids were in the water. So just me

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,240
and the toddler who's two, who's actually named after Senna, his name is Ira Tencena. And then

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,280
these other two boys came up and started playing. And so then I'm sort of overseeing a play group,

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,120
basically one of mine and two others. And for like 20 minutes, this is going on. And then the

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,080
mother of these two other boys comes up and she's thanking me or whatever playing with them. And I

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,000
can sense a Brazilian accent. I said, Oh, are you Brazilian? She says, yeah. And I said, Oh, great,

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,280
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And we get chatting and I can't talk to somebody who's Brazilian for

55
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,280
more than five minutes without of course asking them, do you remember when Senna died and blah,

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,680
blah, blah. And I'm still waiting for the exception to this to happen. It's never happened yet where

57
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,040
that person doesn't immediately transform into, Oh my God, Senna is the greatest manifestation

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,320
representation of Brazil. It was the saddest day of my life when he died. And this woman would have

59
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,160
been seven when he died. And our nanny also Brazilian, same thing was like four when Senna

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,560
died, but it's seared in her mind. So I'm talking Uber driver person at rest. It doesn't matter. Any

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,440
time I meet someone from Brazil, we talk about Senna and it is without exception. They speak of

62
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,480
him with a reverence that I don't think Americans can relate to. There is no athlete we talk about.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,880
There's no politician. There's no scientist we can speak about in the way of Brazilian talks about

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,600
Senna. It's amazing. So it sounds like what people hear of certain generation might think of where

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,040
they were when Kennedy or Martin Luther King were assassinated or something like that.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,800
It's absolutely that way because of course, everybody in Brazil was watching F1. So the world

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,120
stopped every Sunday to watch the race. So now you take everybody is there stopping to watch your

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,560
guy doing this thing. And then you see this person die. But unlike maybe with say JFK, where yes,

69
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,120
anybody who was old enough at that moment would remember it. I don't even think that they can

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,480
speak about JFK the way with as much love or reverence as they do Senna. So it's kind of amazing

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,160
to me and humbling. That's interesting. Because obviously we have Ali is the first person who

72
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,800
would come to mind. But in his day, a lot of people hated him. It's a lot of athletes like him,

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,280
I think they become beloved once they're sort of older and non threatening feeling. And so a lot of

74
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
people who love them don't actually really know what it was like for them at the time. But that's

75
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,920
fascinating. And I think his reputation, I think a lot of the it turned out after Senna died that

76
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,120
he had been doing like a lot of charity that people didn't even know about with no, no fanfare

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,880
whatsoever. And so I think his legacy was, that's amazing. That's not very, very common.

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,280
That's right. Very few people know about how much he did for for the people in Brazil and how

79
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,600
seriously he took his position of he came from privilege came from a wealthy family, achieved

80
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,840
this unbelievable success. And people love this humility that he had that because remember,

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,000
it's not like he was the first Brazilian F1 champion in Fittipaldi was a two time champion,

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Nelson Pique, a three time champion, who by the way, Senna won his first championship the year

83
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,560
after Pique won his last. So it's like a complete overlap with another, but they don't even belong

84
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,520
in the same sentence for most Brazilians. In fact, I asked this question of almost everybody as well,

85
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,120
which is how does he compare to Pile? And they're like, Oh, Pile was great, but oh, really? Oh,

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,720
that's interesting. Yeah, yeah. It's really kind of amazing. Yeah. I guess that's the most telling

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,960
question you could ask in Brazil probably. Yeah. I'll be going for my first time actually to Sao

88
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,160
Paulo soon to watch an F1 race and to go and I want to be able to visit the memorial where he

89
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,480
was buried and go to the foundation and stuff like that. How did you get so interested in him?

90
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,680
I don't do anything in moderation. I think is what it kind of comes down to. And I've always

91
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,760
loved and been attracted to people that are incredibly passionate and great at what they do.

92
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,640
And I do think that his perfectionism, well, I'll take a step back and say, I was probably

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,640
attracted to things about him that I didn't appreciate the pathology in at the time. So

94
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,200
I do think that his desire to win probably also killed him. And I think that the sharpness of

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:18,080
that edge I probably found incredibly appealing in a way that almost maybe speaks to my own

96
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,200
demons. And I think that's probably true of a lot of people. I don't think I'm unique in that. So I

97
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,640
just remember one of the things I remember loving about him during his career was how much he cared

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,320
about the engine and what was going on with the car and the setup and the time he would spend

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,200
with the mechanics. I mean, it was always telling to me that the Honda mechanics loved him. I mean,

100
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,160
just loved him. You'd have some guys that would show up, they would drive and they would leave,

101
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,920
but not send out. Like he could spend the entire night in the garage, machinating over every minute

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,520
detail of the car. So it was just this sort of incredible degree of perfectionism. Also,

103
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I do think that there was just a certain, there were just things that he did that to this day

104
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,440
can't be explained. I think his qualifying session in 1988 at Monaco, there is no explanation for what

105
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,760
he did that day. I'm sure you're familiar with it just for the listener. Monaco is a very short

106
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,400
circuit. So in a short circuit, the difference between qualifying times should be tenths of

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,280
seconds, hundredths of seconds. His teammate that year, meaning someone driving the exact same car,

108
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,960
which they had the best car in the field was Alan Prost, who was himself a three-time world

109
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,000
champion at the time. Unbelievable driver. Some would argue one of the more underrated drivers

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:38,080
ever. Senna outqualified him by a second and a half. A second and a half on Monaco in a quality

111
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,840
might as well be a day. It's like winning the hundred meters of the Olympics by a second and

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,520
a half. That's exactly right. It's like even Usain Bolt at his most dominant couldn't win a race by

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,840
a second. Even though there's no actual onboard footage of Senna during that quality lap because

114
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,920
he was already on pole. So I don't think the networks were even paying attention to his very

115
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,280
last quality lap, which why would he try to go any faster? He'd already secured pole. But when

116
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,600
you watch Senna at Monaco over and over again, which is one of the most demanding circuits

117
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,320
because of how tight it is, I have my kids watch these videos because I'm like, I don't think you

118
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,080
guys understand. You think daddy drives a race car and that's fun because he can go fast. But I want

119
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,240
you to see what the best in the world is seeing in real time because we can't do this. Humans can't

120
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,560
do what he's doing. The other sort of extension to that story that speaks to this sort of love I

121
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
have is the tormented nature of this, which is what most people don't realize is he qualifies

122
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
first in Monaco or what most people I think have forgotten is he qualifies first from Monaco in

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,440
1988 by literally a second and a half. As the race is going on and on and on, he has built up such a

124
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,120
lead. He almost has a lap lead over the field with a very short duration to go in the race. I don't

125
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,480
remember how many laps I think like maybe six to 10 laps to go. He could basically stop, get out of

126
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,400
his car, get back in it and still win the race. But he's pushing very hard. He's pushing so hard

127
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,920
that he actually crashed. He is disgusted with himself. He gets out of the car, literally leaves,

128
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,240
go straight to his home in Monaco, doesn't speak with anybody for days. And to me, this is a guy

129
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
for whom it's not about winning. Yeah, yeah, this actually gets to something. You said I could be

130
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,640
digressive. So I'm gonna make a multi multi jump. Let's do it. Something I've been thinking about

131
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,280
that I used to think about a lot and then came up recently was at a certain point when I was at

132
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Sports Illustrated, and I was doing reporting on doping. And I would get a lot of reader feedback

133
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
of why are you reporting on this sort of a killjoy, that kind of stuff. I took it seriously and started

134
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,160
thinking about, should I be doing this? What's the value that comes out of sport? And somehow I landed

135
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,920
on this book called the Grasshopper by a Canadian philosopher named Bernard Suits. And it's called

136
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,800
the Grasshopper because it's sort of an inversion of this Aesop fable where there's a Grasshopper

137
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,920
who's playing games all summer. And while the ant is storing up food in the summer, and then come

138
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,280
winter, the Grasshopper doesn't have any food and the ant does and the Grasshopper goes to the ant

139
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,320
and asks for some food and the ant says, no, you were playing while you should have been collecting

140
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,000
food. And so morals kind of obvious. But in Suits, there had been this philosophical debate that was

141
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,720
supposed to be settled by Wittgenstein about is there any necessary and sufficient core of sports

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,760
and games? And he said no, he said, no, absolutely, there's not. And Suits, in writing this book,

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,240
the Grasshopper, the Grasshopper is a character who's playing these games. And his disciples are

144
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,960
saying, you should be storing food, you're gonna die. And he says, no, this is who I am, I understand

145
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,440
what's coming. But this is the best thing I can be doing this endeavor for the love of what he was

146
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,880
doing. And Suits says there is a core to all sports and games. And it's the voluntary acceptance of

147
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,000
unnecessary obstacles, which I thought was kind of amazing. And he talks about what he calls the

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,920
Lucerie attitude, which is the attitude you adopt when you get involved in these things, which I

149
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,160
think is kind of a love of difficulty, essentially. And I think he sort of united something Aristotle

150
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,200
had these two, he put actions into two categories. One was kinesis, which is like, build a house,

151
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,560
you're doing it for the end. And the other was an ergea, which is something like philosophical

152
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
contemplation, you're doing it for the doing, not for the end. And he said, these two things have to

153
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,120
be separate. And I think what one of the things suits was saying was in sports and games, these

154
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,240
things are united, there is an end that you're going for. But the love of difficulty in the middle

155
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,800
is what's really important. And you're always doing something, you're intentionally doing

156
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,720
something inefficient, right? Like you could walk a ball and put it into a goal, that would be the

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
most efficient way to do it. Or you could cut across the track and get there faster, but you're

158
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,480
intentionally engineering an inefficiency in order to facilitate a certain experience. I'm sure Senna

159
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
had that love of difficulty. And one of the things, not to tie it to my own stuff, but one of the

160
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,640
reasons I think about it is, to me, I don't know that readers would say this. But to me, one of

161
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,840
the major themes of my new book is that sometimes the things you can do to cause the most rapid

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,480
apparent short term progress can undermine long term development. And that actually, you don't

163
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,520
always want to be as efficient as possible. And I think that's very much embodied in this love of

164
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,400
difficulty in sports and games where you are intentionally engineering in inefficiency in

165
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,920
order to facilitate an experience that you have some value and some learning. So sorry,

166
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,840
that was my multi jump. No, that is so true. I think that actually in one sort of story captures

167
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,600
the essence of the greatness we see in sports, which is, as you said, it has to have a struggle

168
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,160
in it. It's not interesting if there's no struggle, but it's in service of some destination

169
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,680
that can be quite arbitrary, by the way. I mean, race car driving happens to be one of the less

170
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,560
arbitrary ones. Going fast seems somewhat understandable in innate mountaineering seems

171
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,800
somewhat understandable in innate get to the top. But many sports like basketball and football are

172
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
kind of arbitrary in what we're asking people to do. Think of baseball. It's like bananas.

173
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,520
If you were just watching it with no sense of the conceptual structure, look ridiculous. Like,

174
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,240
why doesn't the guy just stay at home plate? They're already there. Yeah, that's so funny.

175
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,440
Well, before we get to your new book, because there are so many questions I have on that theme,

176
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,800
both personally and then with respect to my profession and then even more broadly,

177
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
I do want to go back to the gene because I remember when the book came out, I think it

178
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
came out on the heels of an article you had written in Sports Illustrated. Correct? Wow.

179
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm surprised you remember that. Yeah, the sports team. Yeah, yeah, it did. Yeah. I want to confess

180
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,960
something really quick. This nobody really calls me on is I wrote that article in Sports Illustrated.

181
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,080
It passed fact checking at Sports Illustrated. Because when the fact checkers called back the

182
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,240
scientists, they said, Oh, this is true. This is true. But then after a year of before my books,

183
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,200
the first year, I tried just read 10 journal articles a day every day for the first year,

184
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,040
no writing. And having done that for the year, researching the sports gene, I realized that while

185
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
I had quoted these scientists appropriately, some of them had told me things that could not

186
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,360
be concluded from their data. And so I cited my own article as one that was mistaken, but nobody

187
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,960
really called me on that. But that's I think if you're writing about science, something you're

188
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,640
writing about is going to be wrong. So you have to kind of be ready for that. Well, it's so funny

189
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,280
you bring this up. So Bob Kaplan, who's my head of research, we are in the process now of going

190
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,000
through the fact checking for this book that I've been painfully and slowly working on for more time

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,920
than I care to admit. And what we've realized is he can't be the fact checker, nor can I,

192
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,800
because it's not just facts we're checking, it's interpretation. And we are already so biased by

193
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,240
our view on this. So we actually have another one of our analysts doing the fact checking,

194
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,880
but we specifically refer to it as fact plus interpretation, fact plus interpretation,

195
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,360
which turns out to be really a long process and a very challenging process because you do, I mean,

196
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,240
I've done this a handful of times where you pull up one of the citation classics in medicine or

197
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,640
science that people have referenced so many times. It's been triply referenced internally

198
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,400
to the point where I don't think the people referencing it anymore even know what the paper

199
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,120
says, let alone what it's citing. Telephone game of citations. It's unbelievable. And the few times

200
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,720
I've had our team extract from those papers, I've been mortified at how wrong they are,

201
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,160
which again, they're not necessarily orthogonally wrong, but they've missed so many things. Like,

202
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,920
it's like, oh, well, of course this so-and-so does such and such and such and such. Well,

203
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,440
let's go back and look, wait a minute. You realize that was in one really, really, really bad

204
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,240
experiment in mice in which you could never make that inference into another mammal. And now yet

205
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,280
it's taken as sort of a fact. I have to say not that that's good, but I have noticed that that

206
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,720
sort of thing provides opportunities for people like me where I'll go and read the original

207
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,120
research of things that have just been at the core of other bestselling books. It's kind of a great,

208
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
if you're willing to do it, it's sort of a competitive advantage. It gives an opportunity,

209
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,560
not that I want people to be citing things wrongly, but I think you're totally right.

210
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,160
I started as a fact checker at Sports Illustrated, and that's where you realize how many ways there

211
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,560
are to go wrong. Are you looking for any more work right now? No, no, no. I was happy to get

212
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,120
out of my fact checking days. I'm in my post book never again phase, which I was in before,

213
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,000
but that's where I am right now. No, but yeah, I hired independent fact checkers also. And that

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,520
doesn't mean there aren't things that are wrong or interpretations that are wrong, but it certainly

215
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
certainly cuts it down compared to, I think most books probably have no fact checking at all.

216
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,960
Yeah, I'm super paranoid about it because I also realize that we can't catch them all. That's the

217
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
difference between a blog post and a book is, and I've written more blog posts than I'll ever be

218
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,920
able to count. And the good news is the week it comes out, someone smarter than you is going to

219
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,280
catch something that you did wrong. And you're like, oh my God, yeah, totally right. Thank you

220
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,080
for that. Boom, I can change it. I can't do that with a book. And that is crippling me.

221
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,880
Yeah. I mean, you can do small stuff for second printings and things like that, but it's not as

222
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,320
easy, right? It doesn't happen right away. And if it will, especially if it's the interpretation,

223
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,280
it's one thing if you get a fact wrong, when you start to interpret something incorrectly and you

224
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
come around, it's very difficult to unwind that definitely. And if you're going to change, yeah,

225
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,520
as I learned this time, the both of my books, there are 352 pages, I guess, if you count the

226
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,880
front and back and because they get printed in sets of 16, so everything has to fit to a multiple

227
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
of 16, including the index and the citations and everything. So if you have to change something

228
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,760
major, like an interpretation where it's not one sentence, if you're going to mess up the page flow,

229
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
not so doable. You're making some unhappy folks. You alluded to something there, which is

230
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,040
the opportunity to go back and look at something that people have sort of taken as dogma and

231
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,040
questioning it. And in many ways, that's a big part of what the gene does and what your current

232
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,920
book does. I'll share with you sort of my bias coming into this discussion, not this discussion

233
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,920
with us per se, but sort of this theme, which is so Daniel Coyle wrote a book in 2009 called The

234
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,640
Talent Code. And before that, there were a number of other books and pieces of literature on that

235
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,320
subject matter. And I was obsessed with this. I was obsessed with this idea of how can one be great,

236
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,200
obsessed with this even as a child. And certainly when I was doing my surgical training, I really

237
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,160
remember spending lots of time reading literature on technically achieving mastery, like what does

238
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,920
it mean to be a great musician, or a great surgeon, or a great athlete, things where there's some sort

239
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:13,600
of dexterity and skill required that goes beyond just thinking and cognitive prowess. And so I would

240
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,760
say I completely bought this idea that deliberate practice is the only thing that matters. And I

241
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,360
think a lot of people sort of have taken that to be the case. What made you question that in the

242
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,320
first place? Or did you not question that and instead stumbled organically into questioning

243
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,160
that? I did not question it in the first place. And I should say Dan's a friend and I'm a big fan

244
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,640
of his writing also. And yeah, I did not question it. In fact, if you saw my book proposal for the

245
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,680
sports gene, the Talent Code in the book proposal, sometimes you do a section that I don't know if you

246
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,480
had to do this or not. But other books that other books like yes, yes, yes. I skipped that part for

247
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
my second proposal. But in the first one, I had to do it and Talent Code was one of the ones that I

248
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,800
said it was going to be like. And obviously, I would say for the casual reader, it looks like

249
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,120
they're actually diametrically opposed in many ways. And I don't see them as diametrically opposed,

250
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,120
but there are certainly some differences. And it was probably when I went back and started looking

251
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,320
at some of the original literature, the 10,000 hours rule was who was I to question that? I mean,

252
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
the one good thing is I was in my past training to be a scientist. And I was like living in a tent

253
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,600
in the Arctic when I decided for sure to become a writer. So I knew I should leverage that

254
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
background of I was in the geological sciences, which are pretty methodologically rigorous,

255
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,760
I would say as the sciences go. And so I decided to go look at these original papers, if I'm going

256
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,880
to study them. And I come across the first, the so called 10,000 hour study that the scientists

257
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,280
wrote, I wouldn't call that but this was with violinists violinists, yeah, 30 violinists,

258
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,480
famous music Academy in Berlin, split into three groups, the top 10 who were deemed to potentially

259
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,760
be international soloists practiced in deliberate practice is highly focused error correction focus

260
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,200
practice, on average 10,000 hours by the age of 20. The first thing I noticed was that there were no

261
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,400
measures of variance reported in the study, which is not something when I was a grad student that

262
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
one could have gotten away with reporting no measures of variance. So I was explained to

263
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
some folks might not even know what that means. So like these are examples. So if you look at a

264
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,680
table, and it says, this person practice this many hours, this many hours, this many hours,

265
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,720
what was missing in that description? First of all, no range. So several of the books and the paper

266
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,880
wrote that there was complete correspondence between the number of hours of practice and what

267
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
group someone fell into. And I said, Well, I can't tell that from this data, like, maybe someone in

268
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,520
the lowest group actually practiced more than someone in the highest group, but you haven't

269
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,840
included the range of practice hours or the standard deviations of practice hours. What is

270
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,880
the individual variation? Anytime you take an average, it could be that nobody practiced 10,000

271
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
hours, it could be that somebody practiced 100,000 hours and a bunch of people were much less.

272
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,160
So sort of like what's my average, your average and Bill Gates average wealth?

273
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Sure, right.

274
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
Sometimes averages can be wildly mislead.

275
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,240
That's right. I mean, so for example, in the chess literature takes 11,053 hours on average to reach

276
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,720
international master status. So 10,000 hours would be low. That's one level down from Grandmaster,

277
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
but some people have made it in 3000 hours. And some people finished a study at 25,000,

278
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,360
they still hadn't made it. So we don't really know where their endpoint is. So you can tell someone

279
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,840
well, it takes 11,053 hours on average to reach international master status, but doesn't tell you

280
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,400
anything about the breadth of actual skill acquisition. So how is that possible? By the way,

281
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,120
I mean, I can't imagine looking at a paper that wouldn't at a minimum include a standard deviation

282
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,240
for that type of calculation. Don't know. Okay, so eventually I organized and noticed that the most

283
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,240
famous researcher on that paper, who I think has done some very interesting work, especially in the

284
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,080
area of memory, some work that I myself have tried to incorporate into things I do. So,

285
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,800
but I noticed that he was in a lot of his work saying there's no such thing as talent. It doesn't

286
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,240
matter. Just pick any random thing and you'll be great at it. You know, provided you put the work,

287
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,720
right? Right, exactly. That it doesn't matter what you match with. And I noticed he was citing a lot

288
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,640
of physiology papers that I knew something about like sports physiology papers and not, like you

289
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,280
said, not in the way the interpretation, it was kind of like these secondary interpretations,

290
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,440
telephone game stuff that, and so I organized a panel at the American college of sports medicine

291
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,960
invited him because this was, I thought a problem. He was citing a lot of their papers. His work,

292
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,320
Anders Ericsson was super influential in expertise. I think that 10,000 hours papers,

293
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,920
clearly the most influential paper ever in the development of expertise, but they weren't talking

294
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,360
to each other. So we organized this panel and in that a researcher stood up and Tim Lightfoot and

295
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
asked what's the variance around that 10,000 hours? And he said, well, that doesn't really matter

296
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,000
because the people were actually inconsistent on multiple retrospective recalls. Because what they

297
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,080
did is they just asked for retrospective recall and then had the performers keep a diary for a week

298
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,120
and then extrapolated it basically. Which by the way, don't even get me started on the noise that's

299
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
introduced by both of those decisions. Right. There was just a replication attempt by the way,

300
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,280
last month it published and failed, but we can talk about that if you want. But in that there was

301
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,280
actually in the new replication attempt, there was someone at 4,000 hours who got to the highest

302
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,320
group and someone at 11,000 hours who was still in the lowest group. But anyway, so he asked what's

303
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,840
the variance around that 10,000 hours? And Ericsson says, he said, first of all, there was inconsistent

304
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,040
recall. And so Tim says, yeah, a lot of us struggle with imperfect data, but we still put measures of

305
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,160
variance. And so Anders says, well, that'll be like more valid when we have video diaries and we can

306
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,560
really track it because we're not being that precise anyway. And he says, again, we all struggle

307
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,800
with imperfect data, but we include measures of variance. Was it? And then he asked, so what was

308
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,840
it? And he says, I don't know, I'd have to go look back. And so Lightfoot says, definitely more than

309
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,160
500. And that's where we leave it. And then I think two years ago, something couple of years ago,

310
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,560
Ericsson did publish measures of variance and turns out there was enormous variance. Not only was

311
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,600
there enormous variance in the original paper, the papers from 1993, and it was three or four

312
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,400
years ago that he finally published the variance made clear that their conclusions were wrong,

313
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
that there was not complete correspondence between the number of practice hours and the

314
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,920
group that someone was in. Well, I think that's sort of where I'm going with this question, which is

315
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,000
you can't even make an observation of statistical significance without variance. So I don't really

316
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,400
understand what the paper is saying. This is the first thing where I was reading it and saying,

317
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,560
something's not right here. And so then I started asking these very basic questions,

318
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,000
because I'd been an athlete, I'd gone from being like the worst walk on on my college team to being

319
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,080
like a university record holder. So I'm like, yeah, maybe if I had trained even more, I would have

320
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,360
been even better. And that probably is true. But but I was I was like, Oh, okay, so there is no such

321
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,040
thing as talent. I was convinced for a while. And then when I started seeing this, I started asking

322
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,720
the very basic questions like, okay, in my third year of training, I could break the women's world

323
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,320
record. So there has to be at least some basic genetic difference because I haven't worked harder

324
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,560
than the women who are pros by any stretch of the imagination. And so I said, Okay, let's start

325
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,160
with that basic question. I'd contact sort of some of the I shouldn't call them the 10,000 hours

326
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,560
researchers, because they kind of disavowed that, but the deliberate practice framework. And I

327
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,000
remember contacting one and saying, wouldn't you agree that a man and a woman who practice the same

328
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,600
like the man has advantages, which is why we separate sexes in sports. And she sort of hedged

329
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,080
and said, maybe not if they all trained the same. I said, Really? And so she sent me a paper saying

330
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,920
in fact, we think this applies to other organisms. If you look at this paper about racing dogs,

331
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,440
you'll see that they practice the best ones in the highest class practice about the equivalent to

332
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,760
their lifespan of 10,000 hours. And so I'm reading this, and I started reading all the citations. And

333
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,040
one of them notes that like half of these dogs have what is otherwise an incredibly rare myostatin

334
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,280
mutation. Let me pause for a moment explain to the listener what myostatin mutations are. So if you

335
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,000
knock out the myostatin gene, you look like a bodybuilder myostatin is a gene that inhibits

336
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,960
muscle growth. And there are lots of myostatin mutants out there that all have hypo functioning

337
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,040
myostatin and therefore super muscular. Yeah. And so racing readers had been, they didn't know about

338
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,240
the gene, but they were breeding for fast. They were clearly selecting for this trait. Yeah. Yeah.

339
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,680
And what they wanted was a single myostatin. And if you get to then you have a bully whip it and

340
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,440
Google that it's pretty cool to see bully with that thing probably can't even move. It's so big,

341
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,520
right? So they want the single mutation. Yeah. And so I'm like, okay, most of these dogs doesn't

342
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,280
even mean anything. So I wasn't gonna like use this study or anything. But I just started saying,

343
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,720
these people aren't reading the primary stuff that they're citing, or they're not tracking the

344
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,480
references back. And so I started to have doubts. Is this a broader problem with non experimental

345
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,720
science? I think so. Because we do the same dumb thing in medicine, by the way, people sort of

346
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,840
think of medicine, which we're going to get to in spades as it's so rigorous. And yeah, sometimes

347
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,320
medicine does get to leverage the scientific method and actually get to do what Francis

348
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,440
Bacon talked about. But a lot of times you don't. I mean, when you think of some of the most important

349
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,960
public health measures that are out there, oftentimes they are based on exactly the type

350
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,920
of inference you're being appropriately critical of, which is observational, heavily selected,

351
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,120
range restricted, which I can't wait to you talk about this so eloquently that I cannot wait to

352
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,600
have you go off on your tangent soapbox, whatever ran on that problem. But these are huge issues.

353
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,760
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was the other thing. I don't know if I should skip to range restriction.

354
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Well, let's start with medicine. So I wrote this one article when I was at ProPublica called

355
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,600
when evidence says no, and doctors say yes. And I should say, I love the medical profession,

356
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,640
I think it's filled with variety of people like any profession, but a lot of people who really

357
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,800
care and get into the profession because they want to do something that is challenging and useful.

358
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,400
But also there's like a lot of poor science and there are a lot of things that continue to be

359
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,880
done even once evidence shows they don't work anymore. What Mike Joyner at the Mayo Clinic

360
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,960
always calls bio plausible, something that clearly makes sense. It definitely should work. It's just

361
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,440
that when somebody does like a randomized controlled trial, it doesn't. You probably saw the

362
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,560
finished study of partial arthroscopic meniscus repair. I think there's a lot of devils in the

363
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,040
details. That said, it was interesting. They gave some people sham surgery where they basically made

364
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,640
an incision, banged around like they performed surgery and sent them to physical therapy. And

365
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,800
they did as well as the people who were getting the surgery, which is mind boggling because

366
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,480
everyone's doing something that seems like it has to work. Someone's got knee pain, you bring them in,

367
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,280
you give them imaging, they've got a tear, fix it. How could that not work? But then I guess it turns

368
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,160
out that some huge number of people have incidental tear that doesn't have anything to do with the

369
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,240
knee pain. The meniscal tear is a huge thorn in the side of the orthopedic specialty because,

370
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,760
frankly, I don't know the answer. I mean, my intuition is that that's a procedure that is

371
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,840
probably done far too much, but it's also probably a procedure that if you knew how to select the

372
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,000
right patients, you could probably make a difference. But because we don't, we end up

373
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,200
applying the tool far too broadly and we dilute the outcome. I'll give you a much more specific

374
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,480
example that is so nerdy, but there's a drug called azetamide or Zetia, which blocks cholesterol

375
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
reabsorption. So the body makes a ton of cholesterol. Virtually all the cholesterol in the body is made

376
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,800
by the body and it gets recirculated throughout the body. Well, part of this recirculation pathway

377
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,480
requires that cholesterol be dumped into, along with bile, into the gut. And then in your gut,

378
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,800
you can reabsorb it and the body has a way to regulate how much of that's happening. But it

379
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,360
turns out there's a drug that blocks this thing called the neiman pixie one like one transporter

380
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:09,040
that drags cholesterol back in. Now, when that drug is given in monotherapy, it lowers cholesterol,

381
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,960
but not that much and it doesn't save lives. So it's not a drug that's really, in fact,

382
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,880
it's absolutely therefore not considered a first line agent and it's never considered something

383
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,640
that should be used in isolation. Now, when you give it with a statin, it turns out it lowers

384
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,040
cholesterol and it reduces events. So the things that you care about, the actual heart outcomes

385
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,080
change. And it's not just the statin. Correct. That's right. Because you can compare it to statin

386
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,040
versus statin alone. So I have probably kind of a contrarian view on this, which is I actually

387
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,480
think this drug alone would work if you actually only gave it to people who were hyper absorbers.

388
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,000
But that's never been done because we can measure how much absorption capacity a person has. But

389
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,080
that's a kind of advanced measurement. You wouldn't normally do that in a clinical setting.

390
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,840
But if you select for patients who have mega amounts of absorption, it's certainly possible

391
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,720
that those patients. So I don't know the answer to this. And only if a trial was done testing that

392
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,440
way could you get it. But I do think that this problem exists in medicine, which is you dilute

393
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,720
by taking such a heterogeneous population to test an intervention on. And you're therefore not really

394
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,520
powered to detect an effect because in your power calculation, you're using the entire population as

395
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,920
your denominator. And really, it probably needs to be a subset. And so my intuition is that's

396
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:34,320
probably the case with some of these procedures like meniscal repairs, which still offers no help

397
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,360
to you or I right now if we're having knee pain with an MRI that shows a meniscal tear. I actually

398
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
don't know the answer in that setting. That's interesting on so many levels. The first is

399
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
what you're talking about with absorption is this sort of lesson that there's huge individual

400
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,800
variation in that stuff. Staggering variation, by the way. I measure absorption synthesis in every

401
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,960
single patient, non-negotiable, no questions asked. And I am constantly amazed at how much variation

402
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,040
exists. Basically, three variables are determining this, right? It's sort of how much do you make,

403
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,440
how much do you absorb, and how much do you clear out of circulation with the LDL receptor.

404
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,600
And the variation is overwhelming. And yet it's amazing to me that our profession looks at just

405
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,280
one metric, which is how much LDL cholesterol is there. And that's going to be the basis for

406
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,080
treatment. It strikes me as flying without instruments and deciding you only get to look

407
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,920
at the horizon. That's interesting. That gets at two things I want to remember. First, this idea

408
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,840
of the McNamara fallacy you've heard of named after the Secretary of Defense during Vietnam, which is

409
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,080
he said, are we winning the war or are we losing? Let's use something measurable, our bodies versus

410
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,560
their bodies. And since we're always winning, by that metric said, okay, we're winning, obviously

411
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,800
ignoring a lot of other important things. What's the collateral damage? And yeah, yeah. So it's like,

412
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,080
we often deem things important because they're easily measuring them because they're important.

413
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,920
But that individual variation gets to another thing that got me interested that sort of

414
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,160
caused the sports team to be very different from my proposal, which was underlying the 10,000 hours

415
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,840
rule, which is actually called the deliberate practice framework. So again, Erickson would not

416
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,720
call it the 10,000 hours rule. There's something called the monotonic benefits assumption. And

417
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,360
essentially, if you have two people who've never done something for every equal unit of practice,

418
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,880
they should progress exactly the same amount. So it's everyone's practice response is the same

419
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,440
is one of the assumptions underlying it. And I started, how can that be? It's not to say it's not

420
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,600
would be an interesting conclusion or but how could that even be the null hypothesis? It seems

421
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,120
so counterintuitive. I don't know does it? It might be if people started from zero. I'm not sure what

422
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,160
I would think if they would progress exactly the same or not. But then people have done those

423
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,520
studies. Meaning if we took 100 people who have never spoken Spanish and we gave them Spanish

424
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,520
lessons, give me the evidence that that if that were the case, wouldn't we see much more

425
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,520
homogeneity in schools? I would think I mean, Erickson would make the argument that well,

426
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,720
some of those kids are engaged and some of them aren't or maybe some of them had more practice

427
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,320
before. So I think to really evaluate this, you have to get some skill that nobody else

428
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,680
has tried before that these people haven't done at all, because who knows what they bring to

429
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,280
school, all sorts of other stuff. But there are studies like that where people who are sedentary

430
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,120
do the exact same exercise. One of the famous ones called the heritage family study where every

431
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,880
member of two generations of 98 families, totally sedentary, put on six months of identical cycling

432
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,240
training. And the range of variation was like 1000% doing identical training, identical training.

433
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
And you can see things like the military does this and people learning sort of perceptual

434
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,320
motor skills for air traffic controller simulations. And it very simple simulations,

435
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,120
actually, it's kind of like that, like they converge. If it's very simple, you just have to

436
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,480
see the one planes coming, move one off the runway. And then it becomes about like, how fast

437
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,640
can you basically just move the mouse when you're doing a simulation. But as it gets more complex,

438
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,440
people start diverging with more practice. And so that monotonic benefits assumption,

439
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,240
I could find no evidence of it. It's like never shown up in a study of anything unless it's an

440
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,800
extremely simple task that everyone masters very, very quickly. And so again, I was sort of saying

441
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,160
that average is just obscuring individual variation. So I keep preventing you from talking

442
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
about this because I can't stop asking those other questions. But when you look at the title,

443
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,120
the sports gene, the assumption would be, oh, this is a book that explores the notion that

444
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,600
a great athlete is genetically gifted. Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan because he clearly has

445
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,920
a set of genes that separate him from the rest of us. And that's probably a bad example because

446
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,040
it's so extreme. But talk to me about some of the things that you found in that book that

447
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,640
surprised you. And there were certain elements of that book that didn't get that much attention,

448
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,560
by the way, that I, in retrospect, thought I'm surprised more people didn't fixate on that thing.

449
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
Like, I don't know, did it surprise you what people drew out of that book as the most important

450
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,720
insights? Yeah, yeah, I didn't think the thing that people were going to find the most controversial

451
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,600
was the 10,000 hour rule, to be quite honest. I guess I didn't realize how ingrained that is

452
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,320
in our psyche. Yeah, and that people were actually planning certain training plans,

453
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,640
soccer teams to 10,000 hours on the dot. And the thing that was the most important to me,

454
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,880
I tried to write a book about one of my closest friends and former training partner

455
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,360
dropped dead at the end of a mile race. He was like one of the top ranked guys in his age group

456
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,480
in the country, young Jamaican guy was gonna be the first in his family to go to college,

457
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,480
all these things. And that kind of threw me for a loop. And anyway, I got his family to

458
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,600
sign a waiver allowing me to gather up his medical records and turn out he had hypertrophic

459
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,160
cardiomyopathy, textbook case, misdiagnosed, because not easy to diagnose. If he had had a

460
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,560
good family history, it turned out he probably clearly had a relative who it's like I went and

461
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,640
started going to meetings for families that think they have HCM in their family. And they'd say,

462
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,880
well, we're not really sure. But cousin Jimmy died in the pool, and he was a varsity swimmer.

463
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,040
And like Uncle Fred was in a one car accident. You're like, all right, these might be cardiac

464
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,120
arrest. And I wanted to write a book, one of the main reasons I got off the science tracks,

465
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,200
I wanted to write about sudden cardiac death and athletes. And that's what I tried to pitch a first

466
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,720
book on. But I didn't have the professional capital at the time and couldn't sell it. But

467
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,160
there's a section of that that I smuggled into one of the chapters in the sports team, which is

468
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,960
the most personally important thing to me that I don't think I got asked about one time ever. So

469
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,280
I don't know if that's surprising or not. It just is the most surprising findings of the book to me

470
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,880
were things like I still don't know how to summarize the book, but that things that I assumed

471
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,600
were genetic, like the reflexes it takes to hit 100 mile per hour fastball turn out not to be the

472
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,960
fact that major league baseball players don't have faster reflexes. That was a surprise to me.

473
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,520
I had assumed they did. The same is true, by the way, for Formula One drivers. Is it? Yeah. So it

474
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,440
turns out that makes sense. Perceptional motor skill, right? They're probably using cues like

475
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,560
the changing size of something in there. Well, one of my favorite exercises that you can see when you

476
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,720
compare. So if you put a novice next to Lewis Hamilton in a simulator, even adjusting for the

477
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,120
speed at which things are moving, you won't be blown away at where Lewis's eyes are at every

478
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,440
moment that he is driving, how far ahead he is able to see what's happening. So a few weeks ago,

479
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,960
I was on the track and in an effort to really force this type of learning, we have one camera

480
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,160
that is actually looking directly at me, one camera that is looking directly at the road and capturing

481
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,120
all of the telemetry. And then I sit with my coach and we review these two side by side, because what

482
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,080
I'm working very hard to overcome is the desire to narrow my field to where I'm driving. And when

483
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,720
you're going fast, that's innate. You don't want to be looking somewhere way down the road. You're

484
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,080
worried about falling off the road right now, but you can't do that. So that's the thing that they've

485
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,840
been able to train to do. It's not that they're going faster. Sorry, that's what they have faster

486
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,280
reflexes, which again, remember when I first was shown these data, I was like, wow, you're looking

487
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,840
at Senna. You'd think he has the fastest reflexes on the planet. Right, right. Once you start reading

488
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,520
about perceptual motor skills, it makes perfect sense because any activity that's happening too

489
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,120
fast, I mean, the things they have to do are too fast for any human, even if they did have

490
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,600
were the top 0.001% of human reflexes, it wouldn't be fast enough. So in boxing, there was this study

491
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I came across doing this boardstain where these someone, I don't even know if they were doctors

492
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,040
or scientists did some tests of Muhammad Ali. I think that what they were trying to show was that

493
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,800
even this brilliant black man has slower than normal processing speed in his brain or something.

494
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,800
And so they reported his, they would have him like throwing a punch in response to a light or

495
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,920
something like that. And they were saying like, look, it's lower than average. And then, then

496
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,240
someone said that they were testing it wrong. If you subtract the delay for whatever cue they were

497
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,040
giving, he actually from first perceptible motion to full extension, it was like 150 milliseconds,

498
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,240
which is extremely fast. But that means when he's throwing a punch, also, I think other people throw

499
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,640
punches that fast. I don't think it was like an alone outlier for that, that it's faster than the

500
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,200
minimum human reaction time, which is a fifth of a second, just to see that something's in front of

501
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,120
you and for that message to get to your muscles, not to dodge. And so you literally have to be

502
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,360
seeing things before they happen or else you'd get hit by every punch. Of course, his genius at

503
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,600
disguising what he was doing and was an attempt to confound people's ability to see the future.

504
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,840
And so anything I think that's happening at that speed, those aren't skills that anyone comes with,

505
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,840
there might be things that facilitate you downloading that software, but it doesn't

506
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,960
doesn't come with the machine. You talk about kind versus wicked. I'm jumping between these books.

507
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,840
I think we're just going to end up doing that, by the way. I really wanted to talk about the gene,

508
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,800
but now I can't stop, but how moving. So maybe use that example in boxing as an example. Is boxing

509
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,760
a kind sport or is it a wicked sport and explain what those two distinctions mean? Yeah, kind and

510
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,520
wicked are. So those are terms coined by the psychologist Robin Hogarth and a kind learning

511
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,680
environment. He was trying to reconcile this issue in psychology and the study of expertise about

512
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,680
why some people who studied experts saw them get better and better and better with very narrow

513
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,920
experience. And some people saw them not get better, sometimes get worse or get more confident

514
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,840
and not get better. Like what was the difference? And it turns out that the difference often has a

515
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,760
lot to do with one, the way they're training, but also the environment that they are training in.

516
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,320
And a kind learning environment is one where all your information is clear. The next steps and

517
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,440
goals are totally clear. Work tomorrow will look like work yesterday. Patterns recur. And

518
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,560
whenever you do something, you get feedback that is immediate and fully accurate. On the other end

519
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,000
of the spectrum. So golf is a really kind learning environment because the ball is never actually

520
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,800
moving towards you. You're always starting with a static ball and there are almost a finite number

521
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,320
of things that you can see in that position and there's no rush. And you get automatic and

522
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,160
real time feedback every time something happens. So I think some of the people who study golf

523
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,000
characterize it as like almost an industrial task in the sense that part of what you're doing is

524
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,320
trying to do a similar things over and over with as little deviation as possible. Archery, which is

525
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,720
my obsession, a very kind learning environment. Absolutely. Totally kind. Absolutely. And a wicked

526
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,320
learning environment on the other hand is you might not know exactly what you're supposed to do next.

527
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,240
You might not even know the goal. Human behavior might be involved. There may be time pressure.

528
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,080
And work next year might not look like work last year. And importantly, you don't always get

529
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,480
automatic feedback. And sometimes when you get feedback, it's delayed and sometimes it's inaccurate.

530
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,200
There's actually a medical example that I know the story you're going to tell. Yeah, which is

531
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,040
this doctor, this New York doctor who got wealthy and famous because he could miraculously by

532
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,720
palpating patients tongues or feeling around their tongue with his hands before they showed any

533
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,960
symptoms, he could predict they would get typhoid. And he was right over and over and over again. And

534
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,880
one of his colleagues later observed using only his hands. He was a more productive carrier of

535
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,840
typhoid than even typhoid Mary. So he was giving people typhoid by touching their tongues and

536
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,320
getting the feedback that he was an amazing predictor and so would do it over. So he was,

537
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,560
the feedback was reinforcing the wrong lesson. So I wouldn't say most of us are in that wicked of a

538
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,320
situation either. But what Hogarth was doing was setting up this spectrum of learning. What do you

539
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,520
think is a bigger wickedness within the wicked environment? Because there are really at least two

540
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:43,200
variables that I think make that type of learning environment challenging. The first is the number of

541
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,160
scenarios you can face and the unpredictability of them. So an archery, the goal of archery actually

542
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,800
is to make every single shot identical non-negotiable. So everything from the way you stand

543
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,240
to the way your shoulder sits to the way the release sits, we pay tremendous attention to

544
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,560
the feeling of the string on the nose and the feeling of the string on the corner of the mouth.

545
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,520
You're trying to reproduce the same thing ever and ever. So part of it is, well in tennis for example,

546
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,120
there are an infinite number of ways that you could be standing and your opponent could be

547
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,120
standing and the ball could be coming with this spin versus that spin. Or maybe not infinite,

548
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,200
but there are so many more variables. The second piece is this delay between feedback and reality,

549
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,840
which anybody who's ever tried to talk when they can't hear themselves or when there's a delay

550
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,920
realizes how much feedback matters. Which of those two do you think is more important

551
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,760
in creating that environment? I think delayed feedback is usually a killer. I think that the

552
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,840
changing scenarios is easier to accommodate with broader training in some ways. So this classic

553
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,680
psychology finding that can be summarized as breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer.

554
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,800
Transfer is, and by the way, I'd say tennis is definitely more on the wicked end than golf,

555
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,560
but I would still... It's still not, yeah. As Hogarth said, most of us in the knowledge economy

556
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,080
are playing Martian tennis. You see some people playing, nobody's told you the rules, you have to

557
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,800
deduce them, and by the way, they can change without notice. And so breadth of training predicts

558
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
breadth of transfer. Transfer is the term psychologists use to mean your ability to

559
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,560
take skills and knowledge and apply them to a situation you haven't quite seen before. It might

560
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,480
be similar, but something's a little different. And what predicts your ability to do that is how

561
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,400
broad your training was. If your training is broad, it forces you instead of expecting the

562
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,640
same thing over and over to build these sort of flexible conceptual frameworks that you can bend

563
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,560
when you see a new problem instead of just doing the same thing over and over. So I think you can

564
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,480
mitigate that with the right kind of training. The delayed feedback, that really screws people up.

565
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,640
In studies where people have to sort of drive remote controlled things, if they build in a delay

566
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,720
between what they do and the movement, it completely screws them up. All the way to...

567
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,480
There's some interesting studies of software project managers. There's this famous essay.

568
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,560
I had to cut like 20 or 30,000 words from the book. This was something I had in there called

569
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,400
the Mythical Man Month. And it's an essay by this guy, Fred Brooks, who was like head of research at

570
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,840
Microsoft. And he went on to found the computer science department at the University of North

571
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,760
Carolina. And what he meant by the Mythical Man Month was he had noticed that when project

572
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,160
managers, when their projects got behind in software, if they were complicated, they would

573
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,560
start adding more person power, adding more man or woman power to the team. And that would cause

574
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,800
the project to become more late. And so Brooks's law is if you add people to an already late

575
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,400
software project, it will become more late in proportion to like how many people you add.

576
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,320
And that's because there was a delay between those people adding to the team. They needed to be

577
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,800
assimilated. And the managers never learned that lesson because of the delay. And so they keep

578
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,640
doing the same thing over and over and over. And a couple of researchers sort of followed up on that

579
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
more recently and call this the experience trap where these project managers, they come up with

580
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,400
simpler projects where adding people does help it get done faster because they can right away

581
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,000
figure out what to do. And then they get promoted and promoted and end up with more complicated

582
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,800
projects. And in those cases, they do the same thing and bring people on and they never learn

583
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,240
about the assimilation delay that it takes. So these researchers were saying we need to start

584
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,800
telling them, this is the time between you bringing someone on and them making a positive

585
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,040
impact. But they never learned that lesson because of the feedback delay. So I think that's

586
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,640
from the motor skills up to these much more sort of management kind of softer skills, the feedback

587
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,920
delay is really difficult. That concept ever since I read about it in your writing, I sort of look at

588
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,000
the world a bit differently now. I actually think of that question specifically. I'm like, how kind

589
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,360
is this? How wicked is this right now? That's what happened when I was reading this. I was like, oh,

590
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,880
this is going to be the frame that I'm going to think through. I bet for everything in this book.

591
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,400
Well, I think about it a lot with kids. You have a kid, right? You've got one.

592
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,440
One, seven months.

593
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,960
Yeah. So, I mean, think about the learning that's taking place. Think about the neuroplasticity of

594
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,720
a seven month old. And for example, it's why, sort of going back to the example before, if a child

595
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,760
is deaf, it's going to delay speaking, not because they can't speak, but because they can't get that

596
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,320
real time assimilation and feedback. And watching, it almost makes you think about how much do you

597
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,920
want to intervene when they're doing something wrong too? I don't know if you've found that,

598
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,080
but it's like, okay, as long as they can't really hurt themselves, I should probably let them do

599
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,720
that thing that is going to hurt, but hopefully not irreversibly hurt.

600
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,960
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, then that's a huge question again. Like I said, what I think of as this would

601
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,600
make a terrible subtitle, so it's not the subtitle of my book range is the things that you can do

602
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,440
that seem the best in the moment, maybe are not the best for long-term development. And I think

603
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,360
that applies to like parenting. Maybe we should talk about the college admission scandal or

604
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,080
something. The snowplow parent isn't the new, but clearly that's not the best for long-term

605
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,360
development in many cases. There's a story you write about, I think it's at the Air Force Academy.

606
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah. That illustrates that point. Yeah. Explain that insight. This was one of my favorite studies

607
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,200
in range, partly because the experimental setup is so cool. You could only do this at the US Air Force.

608
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,880
It's a true experiment. It has randomization, it's prospective, and there's blinding. Check all the

609
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,840
boxes. Yeah. Yeah. So at the US Air Force Academy, about a thousand students come in every year,

610
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,480
and they have to take a sequence of three math courses, Calculus I, II, and third course. And

611
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,520
they are randomized to professors in year one, re-randomized in year two, and re-randomized in

612
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,440
year three. And the characteristics they come in with are spread evenly across classes. And so a

613
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,560
pair of scientists wanted to see, okay, this is a great experimental setup for looking at what is

614
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,600
the impact of different math teachers. So they followed about a hundred professors and 10,000

615
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:33,360
students over a decade. And one of their main findings was that the better a professor was,

616
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,280
oh, and everyone takes the same test in every class also, and it's graded by committee, so there's no

617
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,360
one can make their own students do better. What they found was the better a professor was at getting

618
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,800
their students to overperform in Calculus I, the more those students then underperformed in the

619
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,520
next two follow-on courses. So there's an inverse relationship between how well students with a

620
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,600
certain professor did in the first course and how well they did in the second and third. So for

621
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,640
example, and how they rated their teachers. So I think the professor who was rated the sixth best

622
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:08,480
by his students in Calculus I and his students got the seventh best scores overall, I think,

623
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,880
out of a hundred professors, his students did the seventh best, was dead last in how his students

624
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,120
then did in the next two courses. And essentially it turned out- And just to be clear, were they dead

625
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,880
last or were they dead last in improvement? So there was a value added score which said here are

626
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,520
the characteristics these kids come in with, and here's how we'd expect them to do. Are they over

627
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,280
or underperforming? Yeah, so it's not that they were the worst in Calc II, it's that they underperformed

628
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,440
relative to where they came in. That's right. So they grew the least maybe is the right way to

629
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,200
think of this. That's right, yeah, absolutely. Compared to other people who came, other students

630
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,280
who came in with the exact same characteristics, they did worse than them in the following courses.

631
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,360
And what these scientists found was that the way to get students to do the best in Calculus I was

632
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,840
to teach a very narrow curriculum that was tailored to the test where they learn a lot of what's called

633
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,840
using procedures knowledge, where they just learn how to execute algorithms and things like that over

634
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:04,880
and over. Whereas the professors who got rated worse by their students and their students did worse

635
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,200
on the Calculus I test, they learned more called making connections knowledge, where you have to

636
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,800
draw together concepts essentially, and you're facing different types of problems instead of

637
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,240
repeating the same type over and over, which is another thing we should talk about after this. But

638
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,080
then when they go to the next courses, they have this more conceptual flexible knowledge. They're

639
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,640
learning how to match a strategy to a type of problem instead of just how to execute procedures.

640
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,280
So they do better later on. And so there's this real conflict between how they feel they're doing

641
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,120
early, and how they rate their professors, and how they're really being set up for later success,

642
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,480
which is kind of wild. And that spoke to me on many levels, but one of which being is I love

643
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,600
mathematics. And I think we spoke before, and maybe we'll tell the story, get into that, get into the

644
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,080
issue later about, I've always wondered about the transition I made when I decided to take school

645
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:56,080
seriously. But that teacher who I think sort of turned my life around would go on to teach me

646
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:02,480
Calculus as well. And he had a very unique style of teaching, which was you approach every problem

647
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,080
through the lens of understanding what is being asked physically, and seeing if in the end the

648
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,800
question says, okay, Johnny throws a ball at this speed in this angle, where does it land? That might

649
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,120
be the question. I mean, that's a very simple calculus question, but that's an example. But

650
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:23,040
as the problems get more and more challenging, he would still really insist that you try to

651
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,080
understand graphically using sort of functional calculus, like graphically what is happening,

652
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,560
algebraically what is happening and numerically what is happening. And how can you converge the

653
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,760
numerical solution with the algebraic solution with the graphical solution? He said, in calculus,

654
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,480
you should almost always be able to come up with an estimate of where the answer is based on

655
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,440
graphing the functions and looking at how they behave. Hard. I mean, a lot of kids

656
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,400
didn't do very well in calculus, and yet those lessons took me all the way through honors math

657
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,880
and engineering. And another sort of example on that path that really spoke to me was in my

658
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,440
freshman year of calculus, I met this guy studying in the stacks. His name was JP, and he became a

659
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,440
legend to me because he had simultaneously, he couldn't decide if he wanted to be a mechanical

660
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,240
engineer or an electrical engineer, so he did both. And he literally got both degrees in four years.

661
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,080
It's not impossible to get both of those degrees in five or six years, but to do both in four years

662
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:27,200
is crazy. And he said the only way he was able to do it was he never wanted to memorize how a type

663
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,120
of problem was solved. He wanted to derive everything from first principles. At the time,

664
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,800
I think we were learning about Coriolis acceleration, which is basically the acceleration

665
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,560
of a body in rotation where the radius is changing. So named after a guy who failed to

666
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,640
figure this out when miners in a shaft were moving down. So now you actually had a shrinking radius

667
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,320
relative to the center of the earth, and that changes the forces on the elevator shaft.

668
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,920
And he said, you realize you could derive that all from Newton's first law. And I was like,

669
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,200
I never thought of it that way. And he goes, yeah, let's go through it. And it's about a one-page

670
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,680
derivation, but you can do it. And that lesson stuck with me for the remainder of my life,

671
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:12,240
which was, oh my God, if you just think of it in these broader, initially more painful ways,

672
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,960
it yields huge dividends. This gets at so many things. I'm not even sure where to start and

673
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,560
range. But first thing popped my head was I just saw somebody tweeting research on Twitter today

674
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,480
about how active learning students actually learn more, but they rate themselves as having learned

675
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,560
less. And they also rate their teachers worse. So it turns out we're early on, we're not actually

676
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,880
that good evaluators of how we're doing because the feeling of fluency and learning makes us think

677
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,560
we're doing well, but but we're actually not is what I wrote about called desirable difficulties.

678
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,960
But what you were talking about, I mean, that's serious making connections knowledge. In Japan,

679
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:48,000
they actually have a term called ban show that means the type of writing on the blackboard that

680
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,560
tracks all these different approaches to the same problem, sort of what it sounds like your teacher

681
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:58,000
was doing. But I want to get to the derivation point, because there was some research I wrote

682
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,400
only a little bit about in range, but that I read a lot more about that was about what college

683
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,760
students understand about math, essentially. And there were some really startling examples where

684
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,160
one of the problems was like, I can't remember what the exact numbers were. But let's say it was

685
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,200
500 plus 200 equals 700. And the students were asked, how can you check if this was right? And

686
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,120
so I'd say, okay, 700 minus 200 equals 500. Right. What's another way you can check if it's right,

687
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,680
and they wouldn't come up with 700 minus 500 equals 200, because they were taught to subtract

688
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,600
the number on the right of the addition sign. And when their professors were shown this sort of

689
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,440
stuff. So this is wicked feedback. So you get the feedback that the student understands, because they

690
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,880
know one way to do it, but they actually don't understand at all. And the professors would say,

691
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,200
oh my gosh, and the students would in interviews, they'd say like math is a system of rules and

692
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,520
executed procedures. Professors would say like, I went into math because I didn't have to memorize

693
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,600
stuff, because you could derive it. And it makes sense. It's just concepts. And so they were just

694
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,480
in a totally different place than the students were. And it sounds like you had some opportunity

695
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,800
to avoid that. But I think that's the norm of how math teaching works. Yeah. And it's hard because

696
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,120
my daughter who's in sixth grade, I'm doing this thing. And it's really hard. I mean, I can't

697
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,840
imagine I'm the only parent that struggles with this, but I want her to love math. I don't want

698
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,400
her to view it as a subject. I want her to view it as math is more fun than playing video games.

699
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,840
Math is the most beautiful thing in the world. I want her to look out the window and see math,

700
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,640
and see that math is a beautiful tool that we have to explain the world around us through this thing.

701
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,400
And yet every time as a parent, I try to ask her a question to ask her to think a certain way,

702
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,680
I end up sort of putting her on the spot. And so I'm struggling with this thing of,

703
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,200
one, is it just that I'm a bad parent and I don't know how to do this correctly? Definitely.

704
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,000
You're a bad parent. I didn't want to say anything, but since you brought it up.

705
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,120
Or is it that a child needs a certain base of facts? Like they have to know a handful of things

706
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,680
and be confident with the language, like the times tables and all these other things before

707
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,360
you can even get them to start thinking beyond the problem. I think a lot about this actually,

708
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,440
because I feel like I'm underperforming on this actually. It's a good point though, and I should

709
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,200
say, so again in research, these are called using procedures knowledge, which is kind of the knowing

710
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,040
stuff and making connections knowledge, which is derivation, understanding concepts. And they're

711
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,320
both important. It's just that like in some of these famous studies in the United States, almost

712
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,360
100% essential, sometimes literally 100% in classrooms would be the using procedures knowledge

713
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,160
and not the making connections. But I think that is a tricky thing. There's a study that came out

714
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,960
after range, so I couldn't include it, but was on the topic of desirable difficulties. And it was

715
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,920
about interleaving, which is, well, I'll explain the study. Seventh grade math classrooms were

716
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,320
randomly assigned to different types of math teaching. Some of them got what's called blocked

717
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,600
practice, where you get problem type A, A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, and so on. And the students get

718
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,520
better really quickly, and they rate their teachers well, they rate their own learning well.

719
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,960
Other classrooms got interleaved practice, where it's like as if you threw all the problem types

720
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,040
in a hat and you pick out randomly. And that condition, the students are frustrated at first,

721
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,000
they rate their own learning low, they rate their teachers poorly. But again, they're learning how

722
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,600
to match a strategy to a type of problem instead of just do the same thing over and over and come

723
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,920
test time, they all took the same test. The interleaving students who had interleave practice

724
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,400
blew the block practice students away. It was, I think, like the largest effect size I've ever

725
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,600
seen in an education study that was randomized, 0.83 standard deviations, it was like taking a kid

726
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,400
from the 50th percentile and moving them to the 80th percentile. But they didn't like it early on,

727
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,800
they don't feel like they're learning. And so I'm not sure what the balance is as a parent,

728
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,720
where you know some of this desirable difficulty is in the long term desirable,

729
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,360
but you also don't want to turn someone off from the subject. So what's that delicate balance? I

730
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,920
think that's sort of kind of the art of coaching and everything we do, whether that's someone in

731
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,440
sport trying to develop someone for the long term or a parent is like, how do you balance

732
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,600
maintaining enthusiasm with optimal development, and helping someone have that vision of their

733
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,080
future self like your professor did for you without having them be burned out? I don't know.

734
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,200
I really think that's why there's what like great coaches kind of do is they figure out how to

735
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,240
balance these things when to make things difficult and when to allow things to be easy and sort of

736
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,960
more easily inspirational. But I think that's an art as well as a science. So what was sort of the

737
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,240
takeaway of the idea that, and I don't like using the extreme examples because they're

738
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,320
more to silly and that's the problem with them, but if you look at a high school track team,

739
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,320
okay, and you look at you pick a big division one school, and you look at their sprinters,

740
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:48,800
are they genetically predisposed to be sprinters, but without a certain degree of training could

741
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:55,200
never appreciate it? Or could a certain amount of training overcome a lack of genetic predisposition?

742
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,000
I mean, how do you feel about that today versus when you wrote the book versus when you wrote the

743
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,680
article? Because again, you're getting smarter as we go. Yeah, when I wrote the article, I was more

744
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,280
convinced than I had been before the article that genes were unimportant, completely unimportant.

745
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,480
And by the time I wrote the book, I came to feel that there were sort of two extreme camps,

746
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,480
one that felt genes have no influence on performance, and another that I'd say the other

747
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,640
extreme wasn't that practice has no influence. I don't think anybody thought as uncontroversial.

748
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,680
So I think one extreme was only practice matters. And the other extreme was practice and genes

749
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:39,040
matter. I think that is not as extreme saying they both matter. Which and my bias is the latter. My

750
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,640
bias is just that I mean, that's what the evidence shows. And it's like, people don't randomly pick

751
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,520
to train for the marathon to the 100 meters if they're trying to get to the top level,

752
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:53,360
because there's some zero some physiology going on there. And so I think to be a sprinter, you're

753
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,760
not turning a cart horse into a racehorse as the saying goes, like you have to have some predisposition

754
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,520
to being fast and being explosive. And there's a reason why those people are particularly bad.

755
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,440
Usain Bolt would be a worse marathon runner than a random person picked off the street,

756
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,240
because it's different physiology. But, but I also think it's important to note that at the

757
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,240
beginning of the season and six months later, someone like him are very different in how fast

758
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,360
they are, even over the course of one season, they change how fast they are. So I think the

759
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:25,520
practices is incredibly important, but you also need talent. Now, which is maybe a reasonable segue

760
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,840
into a story that I know you just get asked about all the time. So but I also feel like for the

761
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,560
sake of the listener, if they haven't heard you on another podcast, it's worth them hearing you

762
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,120
explain the difference between Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. But of course, I once you're done

763
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,120
with this, I want to kind of go down more extreme examples and stuff. So is it safe to say that the

764
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:51,040
contrast between Tiger and Roger are elite examples of opposing views? Yeah, yeah, definitely. And it's

765
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,640
sort of interesting because well, I'll give the quick versions of the story first before I

766
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,800
criticize myself. The Tiger Woods story, I think, even if people don't know the details, they probably

767
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,400
kind of absorbed the gist. Seven months old father gives him a putter not trying to turn him into a

768
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,680
golfer, by the way. Oh, this reminds me, we should talk about how the Tiger and Mozart stories I

769
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,000
think are told wrong after this. So I'm just putting that on our court board here. 10 months,

770
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,720
he starts imitating his father's swing. Two years old, you can go on YouTube and see him on national

771
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,600
television, demonstrating his swing on the Mike Douglas show at three or four, he starts saying

772
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,520
I'm gonna be the next Jack Nicholas. Fast forward to age 21. He's greatest golfer in the world. And

773
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,120
that's sort of the quintessential I think that story has seeped into culture so much that people

774
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,080
don't even follow golf ever kind of know it. Federer on the other hand, every bit is famous as an

775
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:38,480
adult, but obscure every bit is dominant. I mean, it's dominant and more so over a longer time for

776
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,840
sure. And when he was a kid, he played some basketball badminton tennis. His mother was a

777
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,920
tennis coach refused to coach him because he wouldn't return balls normally. He continued on

778
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,760
to skateboarding, swimming, wrestling, soccer. When his coaches want to move him up a level,

779
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,360
he declined because he just want to talk about pro wrestling with his friends after practice.

780
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,760
He went on to play handball. Maybe I said volleyball already. I'm not sure some rugby.

781
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,040
Do we know how good he was at these other sports, by the way, he was good at soccer,

782
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,760
for sure. Most the other sports, I'm not really sure. But he kept playing badminton basketball

783
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,800
soccer, longer than some of the others. And then soccer was the one that he finally decided he had

784
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,320
to he had to choose between soccer and tennis. And what age is that when he's having to make

785
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,760
that decision? I think he was starting to think about that as he was like entering his teens,

786
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:28,000
and he wasn't focused. Tiger saying I'm music, Nick, this one I'm for Roger was actually when

787
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,680
he first got good enough to get interviewed by local paper. The reporter asked him if he ever

788
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,680
became a pro what would he buy with his first hypothetical paycheck and he says Mercedes his

789
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,040
mother doesn't want him putting all his eggs in this basket is like appalled and asked the

790
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,560
reporter if she can hear the interview recording and the reporter obliged as it turns out Roger

791
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,720
said mercedes in Swiss Germany just wanted more CDs, not a Mercedes and so his mom's like,

792
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,920
all right, fine. But it's just very different in every way from the tiger story. And the way I

793
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,360
sort of use these as a device to start range first to set up just the concept going forward,

794
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,560
the book proposal was titled Roger versus Tiger, and it was going to be like, when should you be a

795
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,040
Roger? And when should you be a tiger? But they felt everyone would think it was a biography of

796
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,400
those two guys, my publisher, and I thought it was telling that we only know only hear one of those

797
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,240
stories. And my question was, which of these is the norm? Obviously, they both worked for these

798
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,680
individuals. And I think there's many paths to the top as there are people. But what was the norm?

799
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,960
And it turns out that the norm when scientists track athletes en route to becoming elite is

800
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,560
that early on, they tend to have what they call a sampling period, where they try a wide variety of

801
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,600
activities. That often includes things like martial arts and dance and doesn't just have to be other

802
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:39,520
sports gymnastics. And they learn these broad general these physical skills. And they learn

803
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,360
about their interests and their abilities, importantly, and delay specializing until later

804
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:49,520
than peers who plateau at lower level. And that turns out to be the norm. And so I sort of felt we

805
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,200
should let people know what the norm is instead of always focusing on these very few exceptions that

806
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,720
happen to be in like the most kind learning environment sports and that aren't that good to

807
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,120
extrapolate to everything else. Now, how much of that do you think is the psychology of it and

808
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,960
the neuromuscular physiology of it? So looking at Roger, for example, who I know very little about

809
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,800
Roger Federer. That's not the obvious stuff that most people who are not. I'm not a tennis

810
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:22,160
fan or anything like that. But part of his longevity, is it possible to be explained by

811
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,160
the fact that he never burnt out versus just sort of slowly acquired a love for this thing versus

812
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,560
had it shoved down his throat? I'm sure like there's lots of stories of trying to create these

813
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:38,240
tennis prodigies where it probably backfires because by the time the kid is 16, they're great,

814
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,960
but they've lost the desire. So it's more of a above the neck phenomenon than a below the

815
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,240
like environment. How much of it do you think is that versus in playing all those other sports,

816
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:57,520
Roger actually developed synaptic connections that served him better in tennis. He basically

817
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:04,960
created a bigger foundation across his neuromuscular system that ultimately came to serve him when he

818
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,280
specialized. So there are a couple points. So this will be a sort of a longer point for us because

819
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,520
you bring up a couple good things. Initially, I thought that most of the effect was going to be

820
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,400
accounted for by the fact that if you allow people to delay selection, it's more likely you get them

821
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,560
in the sport that they're the best at. Whereas we know the earlier you force selection, the more

822
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,000
likely you put the wrong person in the wrong sport. And when selection occurs really early,

823
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,520
you end up seeing this huge relative age effect where coaches just pick for kids who are born

824
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,600
early in the selection year because they're seven or eight or nine or 10 months older than their

825
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,880
cohort. And so they're at young ages, that's a huge difference. And so coaches mistake biological

826
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,640
maturation for talent. So I thought most of it was just going to be the fact that if you delay

827
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,400
selection more, you'll get the right people in the right sport more. But then I started coming

828
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,800
across these studies of German national soccer players or people in the national development

829
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,840
pipeline, where they were matched for ability at a certain age, tracked for several years, and they

830
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,080
see who improves more. And at certain ages, you have to focus eventually, but at certain ages,

831
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,240
like in the early and mid teen years, it was those who did a wider variety of activities.

832
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,680
And so then I started to think maybe there really is something to the skill benefit,

833
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,400
which didn't surprise me intuitively, but I didn't to see it empirically was interesting. And then I

834
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,200
spent some time with I should say, by the way, my colleague, John Worth, I'm asked Roger Federer

835
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,960
about this, one of the questions you asked on the tennis channel recently. And Roger Federer said

836
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,240
it contributed to his not burning out, you know, you never know how much to trust someone's own

837
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,880
story. But it's worth noting that that's what he said. I spent some time with this physiologist

838
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,880
for Cirque du Soleil. And he noted that they started implementing this program where some of

839
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,600
the performers are former Olympians and things like that to where they would have performers learn

840
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,360
the basics of three other performers disciplines, not because they were ever going to perform them,

841
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,760
but to see if it would vary up what they were doing, maybe reduce stress related injuries and

842
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,640
stuff like that. And they track their injuries next to Canadian gymnastics, I guess it's a Canadian

843
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,600
company. And he said it reduced their injuries by like a third. So they implemented it, they must

844
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,840
feel really strongly about it if they're taking away from practice time for those performers,

845
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,760
their main discipline, there seems to be something this showed up in another longitudinal study of

846
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,240
young athletes, where the best predictor of suffering what they called an adult style over

847
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:17,120
use injury was how specialized the athlete was. And it wasn't necessarily their total time spent

848
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,640
in physical activity, it was if it was just the same thing over and over. So there was like some

849
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,200
protective effect from diversifying, we can guess at what that is, I'm sure your guesses would be

850
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:32,480
better than mine. But ultimately, my feeling is the roger pattern is more prevalent. One, because

851
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,840
you have that breadth of training that predicts breadth of transfer, you're exposed to much more

852
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,560
neuromuscular stuff, much more perceptual stuff. And when the challenge gets harder, as you go up,

853
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:46,160
you need to draw on those. There's a funny book called extraordinary tennis for the ordinary

854
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,480
player, I think by this guy, Cy Ramo, who's better known as the father of intercontinental

855
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:56,480
ballistic missiles, but also wrote some books about tennis and a couple other things. And in

856
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,600
one of the interesting things in it was that he shows he does some like serious analysis of

857
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,160
gameplay at different levels and shows that even for good amateur players, something like 80 or 90%

858
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,000
of the points are scored by just keeping the ball in play and someone making an error. And then when

859
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,240
you get to the elite level, it's totally exactly the opposite. It's like 80 90% of points have to

860
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,040
be earned. And that completely changes the kind of game that you're seeing. Because I think the

861
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,600
challenge that a lot of these athletes are facing really changes a lot as they go up in levels. And

862
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,320
so they really want to have that kind of breadth of training in this experience responding to

863
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,480
different types of things. Do you think this overlaps with the Air Force Academy example, where

864
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:42,160
having the harder, more orthogonal education in calculus prepares you for more real world

865
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,000
problem solving, which is what's happening as you go from calc one to two to three?

866
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,520
I think so. I think so. And I mean, again, that's why I think the theme of the book is the things

867
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,960
that will cause you to be the best today might not be the best for five or 10 years from now,

868
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,200
the best way to develop a 10 year old might not be the best way to develop a 20 year old,

869
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,920
or certainly isn't. And it's also I think the specialization model may well there's a surprising

870
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,040
dearth of research and golf for how popular sport it is. But I think the specialization model may

871
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:11,680
well work for golf, because you're not facing some of that same stuff. It is a very kind learning

872
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,360
environment. And I mean, I guess the best guy in the world right now, Brooks Kepka didn't come

873
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:20,640
until later. And it's unclear if he even likes golf, but I could see it makes sense to me that

874
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,360
the specialization model would work or at least not be deleterious in golf, whereas in the other

875
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,920
sports. What about the sports where physiology is undeniably huge? So the big three being swimming,

876
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,600
cycling and running. Cycling is hard to talk about because people tend to conflate the use of drugs

877
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,200
with somehow discounting the remarkable physiology of these guys. But if you take a Chris Froome,

878
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,400
for example, four time Tour de France champion, grows up in Kenya, we can speak to what the

879
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:56,640
importance of early exposure to hypoxia could have been. What is our belief about the training

880
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,880
effect and the duration of the training effect necessary to produce world class athletes at that

881
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,040
level? Because to me, that's as foreign like if you said to me, Peter, I'm going to put you in a

882
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:12,320
time capsule. You're going to be 16 or 14 years old again, knowing everything you know today,

883
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,200
if you have to become a professional athlete, which sport would it be in? The answer is none.

884
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:23,200
I positively know there's nothing I could ever be good enough in. And that includes if I was

885
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,680
willing to do everything that was necessary to become the best cyclist, runner or swimmer.

886
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,920
You have to do what some countries host the Olympics. What they focus on is

887
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,640
just recruiting more people in the much less competitive sports.

888
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,880
If there's a basket weaving, I have a friend who joked about this because my interests are so

889
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,160
diverse. He goes, Peter, do you realize that if someone comes up with an Olympic sport that

890
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:50,320
requires solving a differential equation, driving a car fast, shooting a bow and arrow, and doing a

891
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,640
deadlift, you could be one of the best. That's basically modern pentathlon. You're pretty much

892
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,160
there. And he listed off 10 other really stupid esoteric things I do. And I'm like, yep, that's

893
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,440
great. That's my claim to fame. Modern pentathlon is like fencing, horse riding, swimming, running.

894
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,760
It's like, we should have that. I think there was a time when chess and fiction writing were in the

895
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,920
Olympics. So there's hope for you. I suck at both of those things. Or like the Brits, I think, in the

896
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,320
winter sports when Skeleton got introduced, which is where you slide. Yeah, hilarious. And there's

897
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,160
a great innovation story about that if we want to get to that. But one of the guys who I talked to

898
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,160
in their program said, we've got this down like 80% to a science. We make like an open call for

899
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,560
women. We do some measurements. We know what size they need to be. We know what kind of explosion

900
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:38,080
they need to have. We pick the gold medalist and they've done that. So that stuff's kind of amazing.

901
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:44,320
But do you think that for these super physiologic things where presumably mitochondrial density,

902
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:50,880
mitochondrial efficiency, fiber distribution matter the most? Is that more of a golf? Is that

903
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,400
more Tiger? Is that more Roger? Not withstanding the psychological component, which is obviously

904
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,120
enormous. So I think in sports in general, more people, 100 years ago, you could have come to the

905
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,320
Olympics and been the only person to do anything about training or the only person who was really

906
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,960
talented and win. Now, I think in every sport, many more people are ruled out by either their

907
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,640
nature or their nurture, no matter what the sport is. But I think in those, meaning they're not

908
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,240
willing to train hard enough, no matter how much their ability. So that rules or they don't have the

909
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,520
opportunities. I mean, a huge portion of people in the world don't have an opportunity to be exposed

910
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,760
to most sports. So they don't have the opportunity. I mean, I think one thing, the impact of Title IX

911
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,680
in the US is showing in how dominant we are in some women's sports, where I think I just saw

912
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:32,320
a stat. I think Ross Tucker, he's at Science of Sport, prominent sports scientist. He tweeted that

913
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,200
the United States has something like 40% of all the women's registered soccer players in the world.

914
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,640
So like, of course, we're awesome, because we're giving more opportunities. So I think a lot of

915
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,080
people, either they're not willing to train, they don't have access to training, one of those, or

916
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,360
they don't have the nature for it. And the more competitive the sport is, the more important that

917
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,400
is, right? Because obviously, if we had everyone do identical training, only genes would separate

918
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,400
them. And if we had everyone be identical twins, only training would separate them. But I think

919
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,400
people are more quickly filtered out by their nature and things like sprinting.

920
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,680
And so how old are you?

921
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:04,960
I'm 38.

922
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,600
38. So I'm 10 years older than you. But directionally, like we're both clearly past our prime,

923
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,600
right? In the sense of like sports wise, sports wise. Yeah, I think I'm past my prime and everything.

924
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,920
Clearly athletically. Is there a reason that I, let's assume I'm a decent athlete, which I'm

925
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:26,000
actually not, but let's assume I was. Could I, if I decided tomorrow, like I want to play tennis,

926
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,480
I don't think anybody would ever assume I could become a good tennis player.

927
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,720
But is it because the deliberate practice argument would be there aren't enough hours

928
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:40,240
left for you to devote to this? Another argument would be no, you've missed a critical window.

929
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,760
Just as we say, by the way, this might be totally BS. I'd like to hear your view on it. This view

930
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,240
that we learn languages best at a certain window. And once that window closes, it's sort of like a

931
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,800
growth plate closing over a bone. It becomes really hard to learn languages thereafter.

932
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,360
Is there something about this critical window of exposure? I guess is really the thing I'm trying

933
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,320
to get at with this question when it comes to physical talent.

934
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,240
That's a tough question. And there's this book by a neurologist called Why Michael Couldn't Hit.

935
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,840
And it's about why I love this book was one of my favorite books.

936
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,000
So he was saying Michael Jordan kind of missed the critical window for developing the perceptual

937
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,880
anticipation skill that you need to see things that are coming because your reflexes are too slow.

938
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:23,200
Why the greatest athlete we'd ever seen of a generation was a 188 hitter in AAA ball.

939
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,400
Yeah, I'm a little bit of a gadfly about that, though, because I think that was a great book.

940
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,000
I love the book. I love the Wayne Gretzky story, by the way, but we'll come back to another.

941
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,440
And one season, I think Michael hit like 220 or something like that in the minors,

942
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,960
which I think if we went down and picked a random person off the street, they would hit zero

943
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,280
in double A. These are people who are stars of college and high school teams or foreign teams.

944
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,000
So did he do well or poorly? I don't know. If he had hit 10, you know, I wouldn't have been

945
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,120
surprised because he hadn't been playing in a long time. So I'm kind of impressed with what he did.

946
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,600
But I also think there is something to I mean, I think the point, though, was the expectation.

947
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,640
It's not that hitting 288 or whatever in AAA ball is horrible. No, it's just why isn't the

948
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,360
guy that seemingly has the best hand-eye coordination in the world immediately able to absorb it?

949
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,320
Right. And in that sense, I do think there was probably something to the critical period.

950
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,840
And there are always people there are always exceptions to everything. One of the most

951
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,600
dynamic players in baseball now is Lorenzo Cain. And he did not play a game of baseball until age

952
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,440
16. That surprises me. He did not know how to play. I think most people would need to have some

953
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,960
exposure, not necessarily specialized, but have some exposure at that age. So there's always

954
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,920
exceptions. But I do think you want some of that early exposure, partly just because you run out

955
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,280
of time because you want your perceptual expertise to coincide with your physical. Yeah. Right. So

956
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,680
you're just under a serious time limit. And in relating that the language, I actually do think,

957
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,200
and you know, there was a guy who tried dropped everything when he read about the 10,000 hour

958
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,040
rule and decided to try to become a pro golfer by doing 10,000 hours exactly. No,

959
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,160
and he got Erickson to consult with him and everything to name Dan McLaughlin. How far did

960
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:56,400
he get? He got to something like 7,000 hours or something like that. And then he stopped. He was

961
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:02,000
having injuries. And what happened was, I think he didn't make it and he didn't nearly make it,

962
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,320
but he got really good. So he got better than like 90% of amateurs or something,

963
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:12,080
but wasn't nearly going to get into Q school qualifying for a professional tour. And so what

964
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,120
I think, and I didn't know if he was going to make it or not, because my point has been like,

965
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,000
people were saying, Oh, you were right. He didn't make it. I wrote a little bit about him. I'm like,

966
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,120
that's not what I said. I said, there's huge individual variation. If he's going to make it,

967
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,760
it's not going to be exactly 10,000 hours. And so he didn't make it. By the way, do you think

968
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,440
there's enough variation that it almost is uncoupled? Like what would be your 90% confidence

969
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,040
interval on that? Or does it even matter? I mean, I think there has to be a 90% confidence interval.

970
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,480
Right. If you think about it, is it a thousand to 40,000? If you had to say 90% of people that

971
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,920
become, that achieve mastery do so in a certain amount of deliberate practice.

972
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,600
I think it really depends on the sport. I listed in the sports team, I listed some hours and it

973
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,400
varied a lot by sport. And so I think it sort of depends what it is. Most of them were in sports

974
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,240
were lower than 10,000 hours significantly, four to 6,000 hours kinds of things. And again,

975
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,360
these are averages in chess. It was higher than that. So I think it depends. I think it's sport

976
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,440
dependent. And again, something like skeleton, there's a great paper called ice novice to

977
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,120
winter Olympian in 14 months, where it's basically just pick somebody and then they're, they can go

978
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,680
to the Olympics. So I think it depends on what you're doing. And also when I sat in a Harvard

979
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,560
Business School class for some reporting I was doing for range, you just reminded me of something

980
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,680
where the professor asks the students, he asked them all these things like, how many subway

981
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:31,280
sandwich shops do you think there are in America? Give your 90% confidence interval. And basically,

982
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,520
we can't do it. Because if you're asked that question, if you're asked 20 of those questions,

983
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,320
you should be able to get 18 correctly in a reference range. I've played this game myself

984
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,080
and with people, I've never seen anybody come close to it. People don't go big enough, give

985
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,440
your 90% confidence interval and you'd be better off going like, well, I know there's 10, you know,

986
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,240
to like a million and instead they go much narrower and they end up missing almost all of them.

987
01:18:54,240 --> 01:19:00,000
So what would my 90% confidence interval be? And it sort of, it depends what counts too,

988
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,960
because there's some accounts of athletes who have done a bunch of different sports. So there

989
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,480
are studies that show that invasion sports are the ones that require anticipatory skills. People

990
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,360
can't see me doing air quotes, I guess we're on a podcast, but that's the term that they use in the

991
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,440
invasion sports where you have to anticipate things that are happening faster than you can react to

992
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,120
boxing, soccer, whatever, baseball, things are flying, trying to get past you. There's some

993
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,080
studies that show that people who have done a variety of invasion sports will then pick up

994
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,720
any subsequent invasion sport more rapidly. And so I think there was a case of one woman who

995
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,000
had played a variety of sports and then it only took her like 500 hours to become one of the best

996
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,160
basketball players in the world, but she'd played netball and she'd played a whole bunch of other

997
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,920
sports, volleyball and all this stuff. So it sort of depends what do you count as deliberate,

998
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,360
like Erickson wouldn't count that as deliberate practice because it's not the same sport,

999
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,520
but clearly it is like lowering the threshold. Well, and that's really the Federer point,

1000
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,280
isn't it? It's that all those other sports he's doing, soccer, badminton, et cetera. I mean,

1001
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:07,360
there's still training in a more diffuse way, a set of skills that obviously have gone on to

1002
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,400
serve him greatly in tennis. Yeah. And I think this relates to language. I want to segue to

1003
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,760
language a little bit, which is I wanted to write about language in the book. As I was going through

1004
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,840
all the research, I found so much of it contradictory and confusing that I decided

1005
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,840
to kind of stay away from it largely because I just couldn't figure out. I was hoping there'd

1006
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,920
be in my proposal, I wrote about this. I'd seen this really cool study and I had video for it

1007
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,960
where infants who were being raised bilingual, they were given like this leucite box sort of thing

1008
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,240
and plexiglass or whatever it was. And there was some object and they had to find the opening in

1009
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:47,280
this clear box and get an object out of it and then put some other object in it. And the ones

1010
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,520
who were bilingual would try more different strategies. And the researchers were saying,

1011
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,760
well, they think differently and they have more executive function. And I thought that was

1012
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,000
tantalizing and I loved the video, but I just, the research was all over. And my conclusion was kind

1013
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,560
of, there's a lot of tantalizing stuff, but nobody's quite sure really for a lot of it. But one that

1014
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,160
I did think was pretty strong was the idea that people who grew up bilingual had an advantage

1015
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,880
for then learning a third language without being taught it formally. So there were studies where

1016
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,800
they'll be given like a fake made up language and fake grammar and just have to learn it by immersion

1017
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:24,080
and they seem to do that better. And I think that's sort of akin to what we see in sports.

1018
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,480
And with regard to the sensitive period, I do think there is a real sensitive period in language

1019
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,680
where I think about after like age 12, you're not going to make something your native language

1020
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,320
anymore. And I think there are cases where kids, feral children cases, these rare cases where a

1021
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,160
kid like grows up in the woods or isolated from people. And if they haven't learned some, if they

1022
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,560
haven't had exposure to language by age 12, they never learn it basically. And that also happens

1023
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,400
to be about the age you have to start. If you don't start studying chess patterns by age 12,

1024
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,000
your chances of reaching international master status drop. International master status, again,

1025
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,680
one down from grandmaster. They drop from like one in four to one in 55. So I think there are some

1026
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:04,480
critical periods, but I don't think for most things, maybe for these feral children, but for

1027
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,800
most things, I don't think it's nearly the expiration date that people think it is. I think

1028
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,480
most people can get better at most things than they think they can. And they can get better most

1029
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:18,240
things than they think they can at older ages than they think they can too. Yeah, it's funny you say

1030
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,080
that that's kind of where I wanted to pivot for a second, which was all of this discussion is

1031
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,200
interesting through the lens of being the absolute best tennis player or the absolute best golfer on

1032
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:32,640
the planet. But isn't that really besides the point for most of us? Because if there's seven

1033
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:38,800
billion of us on this planet, 6.999999 billion of us are never going to be good enough at anything

1034
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,680
to make a living at it outside of our day jobs anyway. I was asked on a podcast recently why I

1035
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:54,560
love archery and driving a race car so much. And part of it is there is still every six months,

1036
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,680
I'm still able to look back and appreciate the progress I've made. In other words, I'm coming

1037
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:08,240
from a place of being so not expert at these things that the joy is actually in the monotonic

1038
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:14,720
increase in skill. That is actually the joy to me. It's the, I don't want to say mastery because

1039
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:22,160
that implies you are mastering it, but it's the path towards mastery that is more joyous. And

1040
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:26,720
I don't know, it's almost like on some levels it must, maybe it's not that much fun to be the best

1041
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,920
in the world at something because by definition you only have one way to go at some point. And

1042
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:37,440
that's probably a lot less enjoyable than working your way up the curve. And I guess generalists

1043
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:42,080
have the ability to, I don't know, this gets more into the psychology, but again, but you don't have

1044
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,720
to tether your identity to just this one thing. I always feel bad actually for athletes who,

1045
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,800
it's a brutal, brutal way to make a living in the sense that you have a far narrower window in which

1046
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,360
you can be the best at something versus like say any sort of normal career. Yeah. And if you

1047
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,720
interact with a lot of athletes, you hear a lot of them say now it's just a job and it's something

1048
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:06,160
that they loved at a certain point. I think we were talking about Ayrton Senna earlier. I seem

1049
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:11,440
to recall him saying something like the times of the sport that he loved the most were not when he

1050
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,520
was necessarily on the top of the world. It was earlier. It was actually during his last two

1051
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:20,240
seasons in karting. It was racing this British guy named Fullerton. Everything he did that karting

1052
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:27,840
was his favorite time. Absolutely. It was pure bliss, no politics as he said, just pure racing.

1053
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,880
I just actually interviewed a friend of mine the other day, this podcast, it'll come out at some

1054
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,200
point in relation to this one. I'm not sure when, but same question I asked her, she's an Olympian.

1055
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,600
And it was like, okay, you were the second best in the world on this day. You got a silver medal.

1056
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,560
When was the sport the most fun? And it's like, oh yeah, two years before I went to my first

1057
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,920
Olympics was when it was its most fun. Yeah, yeah, it's amazing. I mean, this makes me think of so

1058
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,400
many things. One, I think people that are performers need other stuff to do. There was a study I

1059
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,160
mentioned in range where Nobel laureates are 22 times more likely than a typical scientist have

1060
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:04,240
like a serious aesthetic hobby, even though they're certainly not as good at it as they are at their

1061
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:09,520
day job. For me, I noticed while I was writing this book somewhere along the line, I sort of

1062
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:15,200
started to forget what I loved about writing, I think. And I keep this thing I call my little

1063
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,160
book of small experiments where at least every other month, I think of some skill I'd like to

1064
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:24,480
learn a little bit about or some interest I'd like to explore a little bit. And I put a hypothesis

1065
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:29,760
of well, what could I try to almost like my grad student notebook? What could I try to get some

1066
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,600
insight into this and it forces me to try something new every other month. It doesn't have to be a big

1067
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,440
deal. Maybe it's some job that I don't know about. I just have to find somebody to talk to about it.

1068
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:44,080
But when I was sort of losing my enthusiasm for the kind of writing I was doing and starting to

1069
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,520
feel more pressure because my first book was a surprise success. And then all of a sudden,

1070
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,760
you get a lot more pressure after that. I took an online beginner's fiction writing course. I've

1071
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,480
been reading this book about the Zen concept of beginner's mind, where you just always keep your

1072
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:03,040
mindset as a beginner never as I've arrived. And in this class, it's like, nobody cares who you are,

1073
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,840
nobody cares what you've done, you get back into that feeling of being uncomfortable. And I loved

1074
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,680
it. I mean, it reminded me what I loved about doing this, it made me totally uncomfortable,

1075
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:15,520
because it's still writing, but it's very, very different. I think it had these huge benefits.

1076
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,560
Like one of the exercises was you had to write a story using no dialogue whatsoever. And after I

1077
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,080
did that, I went back to my book manuscript that I had and was like, I've been leaning on quotes in

1078
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,440
a lazy way when I don't understand stuff. I don't understand it, the reader is not going to understand

1079
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,000
it. So I need to learn it better and clarify with narrative writing instead of people's voices. And

1080
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,440
so in every way, it refreshed me. And so now it's like something I really, I really want to do. And

1081
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,800
one of the kind of share this will attack on another story here, but this is one of the greatest

1082
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,560
things I've ever seen in sports live has to do a little bit with this having something else going

1083
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:52,400
on your identity, which was at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. Yeah, 2010. I was up at

1084
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:57,840
the women's 1.6 K cross country sprint, they say sprint, but you go like way up a big hill and come

1085
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,800
back down. And there's like four rounds, they're all in a day from the prelims to the medal round.

1086
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:08,000
And this woman named Petra Meidich, Sylvanians gear, had been one of the top ranked people in

1087
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,640
the world for years and never metaled at World Championships or Olympics, totally snake bitten,

1088
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,400
something would always go wrong. They didn't bring the right skis or the technician didn't

1089
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:22,160
have the right wax or ski breaks like just freak stuff. And here she's favored to get silver,

1090
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:28,000
I think in Vancouver. And in the warm up right before the first round, she slides off a curve,

1091
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,800
falls into a frozen creek bed and bruises up all of her side. And they take her through quick

1092
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,920
examination because she has to go to the first round and say, Okay, nothing's broken. It's just

1093
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,680
pain. Like if you're okay, you can go and she goes to the first round qualifies on time when

1094
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:44,240
she's she was the favorite in that round barely makes it through. Second round similar thing,

1095
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:48,400
the examiner, it's just pain, you know, if you can do it, you can go. Third round, she falls down

1096
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,640
after the finish line screaming, they have to carry her away and examine her again and say,

1097
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,200
if anything was really wrong, we tell you couldn't go. But if you can go, you can final round,

1098
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:01,440
you hear her screaming every time she's like pulling the ground, gets the bronze medal just

1099
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,600
nips in there, then they have time to examine her and find she broke a whole bunch of ribs on her

1100
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,640
side. One of them broke off and punctured her lung. And so she came to the medal ceremony with

1101
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,840
a tube sticking out of her chest in a wheelchair. And I remember she was I talked to her sports

1102
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,520
psychologist and they were saying if we had known that she had broken all these ribs or

1103
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,840
had a frickin pneumothorax, yeah, they weren't gonna let her go to the mail ceremony. She was like,

1104
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,120
I will die in the middle of something I'm going, you know. And so they brought wielder. And they

1105
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,720
all said, well, first of all, it's a kind of a testament to the mentality that if if they told

1106
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,760
her it was an injury, she wouldn't have done it, right? But it's just pain. And I was talking to

1107
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,360
our sports psychologists about what got her here? Like, what's the journey been like, especially

1108
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:43,680
after she's always having this stuff going wrong, this must have been like, Oh, again. And he said,

1109
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,280
one of the most important things was like diversifying her identity, she was getting so

1110
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,680
fixated on and so much pressure. He was like, you need to do something else. So he forced her to

1111
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:56,640
start building a house, basically. And that became like a task for her to do and a whole new thing and

1112
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,960
a new skill. And he felt like, I thought maybe he was going to talk about some new type of cross

1113
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,040
training. He was like, No, the building the house took the pressure off, it gave her some other part

1114
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,880
of her identity. So it wasn't just as the person who's like always having something go wrong. And

1115
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,720
I just thought that was so interesting that his what he felt was his main contribution was giving

1116
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,760
her a hobby, essentially, and that he thought that really allowed her not to feel like the pressure

1117
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,600
that would break her in some way. You sort of alluded to it earlier with the story of the

1118
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,760
Nobel laureates as well. I can't remember if it was I think it was Francis Crick who said this,

1119
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,560
I could be wrong, that it might have been Watson, but I think it was Crick who said

1120
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,080
the key to doing great science is always being a little bit unemployed. And I'm also probably

1121
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,320
paraphrasing that and bastardizing it, it must have been said much more eloquently. But you get the

1122
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:49,600
point that just if it is great insight in science comes from having time to wander in your mind.

1123
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,240
You said something a while ago about which made me very jealous, by the way, and kind of pissed me

1124
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:59,440
off, you would read 10 papers a day in the exploration phase of writing. And it's like,

1125
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,040
I'd give anything to read 10 papers a day today. Instead, I feel fortunate at least to have a team

1126
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,640
that can read 10 papers a day for me. I remember that bliss of you just get to read the paper all

1127
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:16,080
day, every day, highlight it, take notes, call the author, go to journal club, like, like, that was

1128
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:24,080
unbelievable. And we don't mean it's very difficult to be a scientist today, because

1129
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:32,080
nobody's paying you to be just thinking. Nobody's really rewarding you. Nobody's promoting you

1130
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:37,680
based on that. So we've created this very perverse set of incentives. And in some ways, honestly,

1131
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,600
I consider it a miracle that there are still really good science being done. Most science being done,

1132
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,240
by the way, just sucks. I mean, if we're going to be brutally honest, if you pull up PubMed,

1133
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:51,920
and you look at every one of those 100,000 papers every month that makes the way on the PubMed,

1134
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:00,640
I think 90 to 95% of them are absolutely useless, serve absolutely no purpose to our civilization,

1135
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,720
do not advance natural knowledge, do nothing beneficial for us.

1136
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,480
They increase the publication count of the person doing them, which is why they're doing them.

1137
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,880
That's right. It's an economic tool of the journals, and it's a promotional tool. So

1138
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,160
you don't have any absolutely nefarious actors in the situation, you just have a system with such

1139
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,920
perverse incentives that nothing could- Some of the predatory journals, but those are-

1140
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I think a lot of the science is bad. I confess in range that I think

1141
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,960
my own master's thesis was not good science and wouldn't replicate, but I didn't know,

1142
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,800
like I was rushed into studying the specifics of Arctic plant physiology really quickly without

1143
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,320
learning what was actually happening when I hit a button on the statistics program and how science

1144
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,120
has to be set up to make conclusions. And I think that's kind of the norm for a lot of scientists.

1145
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,080
I think this 2005 paper by John Ionitis that was titled,

1146
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,680
Why Most Published Research Is False, that people kind of wrote off. Now it looks like

1147
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,760
he's a genius, right? Oh, and now I hope I'm not saying something John wouldn't want me to repeat,

1148
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,960
but I think John's been pretty vocal about this probably like seven or eight years ago.

1149
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,440
I was having dinner with John and I said, John, I want to know a bullshit answer on this. What

1150
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:08,800
percentage of people who do science for a living? So they apply for grants, they get the money,

1151
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:14,400
they do the thing. What percentage of those people shouldn't be doing that? Which doesn't

1152
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:19,840
mean they can't work in a lab, but they can't be principal investigators. I mean, he said something

1153
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:26,160
to the tune of 95. He's like 19 out of 20 people who basically for a living are in the business of

1154
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:31,440
generating hypotheses, testing them experimentally and evaluating the results of those experiments.

1155
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,960
That's the scientific method. 19 out of 20 people who do that can't do it and probably should not

1156
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,560
be doing it. That's scary, but also I would guess that we don't want to try to narrow it down to

1157
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:47,520
just the people that should be doing it because you'd have this purifying form of selection where

1158
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,600
you have to like allow some failure. So this is kind of where I want to go with this thinking,

1159
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:57,120
right? So why aren't we going down as tangents? So you've obviously written a lot about the importance

1160
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,840
of even generalists within science and you've given a couple of examples which we should go into

1161
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:09,280
about the hard problem that gets solved by somebody whose native scientific tongue is not

1162
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:15,120
the one that is being addressed. So I want to talk about that, but I want to contrast it with

1163
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:21,600
this other thing which is I have this thesis that I harp on all the time which is mostly my way of

1164
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:27,280
communicating with myself to not get so upset at the lack of scientific insight in the world.

1165
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:34,320
And the idea is genetics and evolution have never prepared us for science. So the scientific method

1166
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:41,200
is less than 400 years old. Even the earliest signs of formal logic as a construct to describe

1167
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:48,960
the way we think represents less than 0.1% of our genetic existence. So Attia, why would you ever

1168
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:54,880
get upset at somebody who can't think logically? Why would you ever get upset when you pull up a

1169
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,240
story on Goop that is written like the most insulting thing you've ever seen in your life

1170
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:04,640
with respect to science? Why would you let that upset you Peter? It's like you're expecting

1171
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:10,160
something that is simply too much. And you might be assuming that the people writing for Goop are

1172
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:14,560
trying to get things right. So that might be the assumption that I would love to hear you hold

1173
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:21,760
forth about Goop to be honest. So I contrast this with there has to be some degree of rigidity and

1174
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,640
formality in the training. I like to think of myself as a pretty good critic of science. I have

1175
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:32,480
the ability to read papers and immediately most of the time figure out why these are total crap

1176
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,040
and what all the biases are and all these other things. But to take any credit for that would be

1177
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,160
ridiculous. I can't take any credit for that. That's simply because I was mentored by people

1178
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,800
and I went through a formal type of training or informal type of training. Really it wasn't formal

1179
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,320
and codified, but it was informal. It's going to journal club. It's doing the experiments yourself,

1180
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,600
putting something together, thinking you're slick and having people tell you,

1181
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,320
hey, numb nuts, did you realize how many ways you screwed this up and how you've drawn the wrong

1182
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:07,520
conclusion? So how do you balance that you have to go through that type of training with, but

1183
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,000
sometimes you have to be an outsider? Yeah. And by the way, what you mentioned, informal training,

1184
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,080
I think we underestimate the importance of informal training and you have to kind of set

1185
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,000
up cultures for it and things like that. So I have a master's degree in geological sciences

1186
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,080
and I got a much better education in genetics writing a book than I did in a grad program.

1187
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,960
I wouldn't know how to run like the equipment in the lab, but I basically kept like a statistician

1188
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,760
on retainer and just to talk to me about a paper anytime. And that's an amazing way to learn. You're

1189
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,720
not just being talked at, you have a specific question of why is this right? He's like, no,

1190
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:43,600
you can't use this. And so it's amazing way to have like informal learning. And you're right.

1191
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,200
I think the way to balance that, I think it's difficult because you're right. You do need some

1192
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:52,320
formal training in it. Like in other words, the takeaway from your book is not that the person

1193
01:35:52,320 --> 01:36:00,400
who's going to crack the code on pancreatic cancer is currently working at an investment bank as a

1194
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:06,000
finance analyst who's never taken a science course. That's not going to happen. Not even close. And I

1195
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,640
don't think you're trying to suggest that, but I've heard people try to take your work and paraphrase

1196
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,720
it as, oh, well, all these scientists working on cancer, screw it, man. They're not going to figure

1197
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,720
anything out. We need to, we need to go get the history majors to solve the cancer problem. And

1198
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:24,160
I'm like, not a freaking chance without some modicum of scientific training. Yeah. And I mean,

1199
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,600
I think the scientific community, I would say the tech community in particular would do well to

1200
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,640
interact with historians. Like I think there are a lot of things they could learn. Sometimes I feel

1201
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,880
like the Silicon Valley set maybe doesn't respect history quite enough or it'd be useful for them.

1202
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,240
But that's a side point. My guess is that when people are saying that, that just like

1203
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:44,960
go pick some person at random to do science, maybe they're taking that from the chapter where I wrote

1204
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,800
partly about InnoCentive, which was the VP of research and development at Eli Lilly in the past

1205
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,480
on a guy named Alf Bingham. Who's that? I remember when I first talked to him, he said, look,

1206
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,600
I'm an organic chemist. It doesn't have a carbon in it. I'm not even supposed to play with it. Okay.

1207
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,240
I'm specialized. And I guess he realized at a certain point that chemists at Lilly were getting

1208
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,160
so specialized that there were certain things they were great at, but it also narrowed their view. So

1209
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:10,160
he talked a lot about this terminology in some of the business literature, exploration versus

1210
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,400
exploitation. Exploration meaning essentially going and looking for new ideas and solutions,

1211
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:18,160
exploitation. Once you find them, how do you make the most out of them? Both of those incredibly

1212
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:24,080
important. And he said, basically, the exploration phase is increasingly found outside because people

1213
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,000
are so specialized, so they're just not covering as much ground. And so he had this idea to just

1214
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,160
post online some of Lilly's problems in drug development. And at first everyone was like,

1215
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,760
no way proprietary information. He said, well, pick stuff. Well, nobody will know what we're doing.

1216
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:39,520
And they said, who else is going to be able to solve this? So he posts some online and like a

1217
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,240
third of them get solved. I remember one of his favorite memories was an attorney who solved

1218
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:50,960
some important chemical synthesis project because he had worked on some tear gas copyright case or

1219
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,520
something. And it reminded him of that. And so a third of those problems get solved, which is

1220
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,880
amazing. Yeah, that story amazed me actually. And in those problems, it does tend to be because

1221
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,560
they've selected for problems that have stumped the specialists, right? So it does tend to be the

1222
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,160
more likely the problem is to get solved, the diversity. And I think my question on that, to

1223
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:13,040
really double click on it is, did the generalist actually solve the problem or did the generalist

1224
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:18,000
just come up with a clue that completely changed how the specialist went about approaching it? Like

1225
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,360
in the case of that example, the attorney doesn't actually know how to completely synthesize the

1226
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,800
molecule. What they're basically saying is you guys are looking at it this way. Stop. Rotate 90

1227
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,080
degrees over there and turn around. And I think the answer is over here, to which case either a new

1228
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:38,320
set of specialists could do it. Is it sort of a bit of that hybrid? Yeah. And actually,

1229
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:44,080
InnoCentive evolved to where they give different, now they help other operations post their questions

1230
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,640
in a way that will attract what they call solvers. And there are different monetary rewards depending

1231
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:53,680
on what kind of contribution it is the person makes. And sometimes he did get people sent in

1232
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:57,520
powders and stuff. They synthesize stuff on their own. Other times it was much more like you're

1233
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,720
taking the wrong approach. And here's another thing to think about. But they were still chemists

1234
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:05,120
that had to do this, right? Not all of them. Not all of them. But there was a lot of that. Sometimes

1235
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:09,040
they'd be chemists from some other area. But sometimes it was totally random people. But again,

1236
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,320
you're farming it out to the whole world. People have not the whole world. I mean,

1237
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,880
most people don't know about InnoCentive, but a huge number of people. And I think he was surprised.

1238
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:23,520
Sometimes things would come from people who worked with machinery, but weren't really formally

1239
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,400
trained in it, but had a lot of experience. And so I think sometimes there were true outsiders.

1240
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:32,400
But most of the problems don't get to the InnoCentive stage anyway. They're being handled

1241
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,960
by the specialists. And I wouldn't extrapolate InnoCentive to mean that specialists aren't

1242
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,360
incredibly important. I mean, my broad view of this is the same as physicist Freeman Dysonry gave

1243
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:45,040
this great speech. We said we need birds and frogs. The frogs are down in the mud looking at

1244
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,360
the granular details. The birds are up above. They don't see the detail, but they're integrating the

1245
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:53,520
knowledge of the frogs. And he said, the world is wide and deep. It'd be stupid to say one's better

1246
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,520
than the other. You need both for a healthy ecosystem. His concern was we're telling everybody

1247
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:02,240
to be frogs. And so we're not having birds. And that's kind of how I conceive of it. And I think

1248
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:08,080
the biggest impact would come from what Arturo Casadaval, who's this kind of one of the prime

1249
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,800
characters of the last chapter, is trying to do where adding range to people who are within

1250
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,040
science already. Like these people are being formally trained. He's just backing up the formal

1251
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:22,640
training instead of jumping right into kind of the reductionist, studying the body as a machine sort

1252
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,320
of thing. It's like the initial classes in the program he's pioneering. And he's like one of the

1253
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,320
I think his H index, which is a measure of his productivity as a researcher, surpassed

1254
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,160
Einstein's recently, which isn't fair because people publish a lot more now, as you alluded to,

1255
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:38,720
for their careers. But it still puts him in very rare company. And so he's starting people with,

1256
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:44,160
how do we know what is true and the anatomy of scientific errors and also how errors have

1257
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,240
sometimes led to breakthroughs. And so he's just like backing up the training into these broader

1258
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:53,040
concepts and saying, you can learn the more specific didactic stuff later. But if you don't

1259
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,360
learn the broader conceptual stuff, you never get it because you're only going to get more and more

1260
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,160
and more specialized from here. So I think one way we can approach this is just by backing up the

1261
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:06,400
training basically, because I don't think we have to worry about people will learn the specialized

1262
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,320
stuff in their field just by doing it and being there. But the other stuff, but that's what we

1263
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,680
kind of teach them and start them with. But the other stuff like scientific thinking, how does it

1264
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:18,560
work? What constitutes evidence? They'll never get that stuff if they don't get it early in training.

1265
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,880
Yeah, I sort of cite the examples you've given when I get asked a question a lot, which is

1266
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,120
someone going to college who wants to go to medical school saying, what is the best thing

1267
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:31,520
to study in college? To which I don't know the answer, but my advice is anything but pre-med.

1268
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:35,200
So you couldn't really do anything. And I'm sorry, because I know there's somebody listening to this,

1269
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:39,680
I'm sure who's doing pre-med who's going to go into medical school. And my only take for you is,

1270
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:44,880
okay, I'm sorry that you're in pre-med right now, but make sure you spend a lot of time doing

1271
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,600
non pre-med stuff in college. You still have the bandwidth to take other classes. You should be

1272
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:55,040
doing so liberally, but you are better off being a history major who goes to medical school than a

1273
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:59,040
biochem major who goes to medical school. In my opinion, I could be wrong, but having seen enough

1274
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,800
people go through it, you're going to learn as much biochemistry as you're going to need to learn

1275
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:07,200
when you get there, both interpersonally and frankly in the breadth of thinking you'll be

1276
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,560
better off if you studied something else. I mean, a lot of Arturo's argument too,

1277
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,600
I saw him make this argument talking about he went from Einstein to Johns Hopkins School

1278
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:20,160
of Public Health because they're allowing him to start this new grad program. And I saw him on a

1279
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,160
panel about the replication crisis in science, this problem with a lot of work basically not

1280
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:28,480
being true. And the head editor of the New England Journal of Medicine said, you can't do that.

1281
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,120
Training is already too long. And Arturo said, it's clearly not working. He said, I'm saying drop

1282
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,880
the didactic stuff because it's not been working. I think he actually pointed out that the New England

1283
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,200
Journal of Medicine had the highest retraction rate in some study also. But so I thought that

1284
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:44,960
was interesting where he said, a lot of that stuff is in one ear and out the other anyway,

1285
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,000
if it's really didactic, people don't even know if they're going to need it or when they're going to

1286
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,840
need it. And so I thought that was an interesting take. He said, you can just drop some of that

1287
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,720
other stuff. But to your point about telling people not to do pre-med, when I was at Sports Illustrated,

1288
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,280
not so much anymore, but when I was there, I would get asked by young aspiring journalists,

1289
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,600
what should I do if I want to work as a sports writer, which I major in English or journalism.

1290
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:10,880
And my first instinct was to say journalism. If you know what you want to do, get a head start.

1291
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,320
Second instinct English. And then if I thought about it, I'd be like, well, I major in geology

1292
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,040
and astronomy, so I have no idea what to tell you. But stats course, biology course, never hurt anyone.

1293
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:23,280
You should do one of those because you'll learn the job by doing the job. And that's the only way

1294
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,120
you'll learn the job. That is the challenge of giving advice, isn't it? Because I don't feel

1295
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:32,080
this way at all anymore. I'm totally comfortable with my nonlinear path to doing what I do.

1296
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:39,120
But I spent a great deal of time frustrated that I couldn't figure out sooner in life what I wanted

1297
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:43,600
to be when I grew up. And I thought of all the time squandered. But again, that was through the

1298
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:50,400
paradigm of you only had one to two 10,000 hour windows, you didn't take them, you spent them

1299
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:55,440
doing something you will never do again. I had my 10,000 hour shot and I put it in the wrong thing.

1300
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,920
And now I never do it again. And but I think that speaks to probably the insights of your book,

1301
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,720
which is you're discounting a bunch of things you learned in doing that. And also sorry,

1302
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:09,440
I didn't mean to interrupt you. Were you gonna? No, no, no. And also, I think your insight into

1303
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,640
yourself, your skills and interests in the world are constrained by your roster of previous

1304
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:17,440
experiences as her mini a bara who studies how people find what's called match quality, the degree

1305
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:21,360
of fit between their interests and abilities and the work that they do, which turns out to be really

1306
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:26,000
important for how likely they are to burn out for their performance for all these sorts of things.

1307
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,800
And we really underestimate it. She studies basically how people seek this out and transition

1308
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:36,720
careers. And she said, we learn who we are in practice, not in theory, which means there's

1309
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:42,160
this kind of cultural idea and lots of career gurus and personality quizzes, they kind of seek

1310
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,080
to convince you that you can just introspect and know what you should do putting in that time. But

1311
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,720
in fact, the way we learn about what we want to do is we have to do stuff to act and then think you

1312
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:55,280
have to do stuff and then reflect on it. And that's the only way you figure it out. And match quality

1313
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:01,120
seems to be so important that spending some time in that experimentation is worth it. So one of the

1314
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:05,520
that I think is sort of representative of that this economist who found a natural experiment in the

1315
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,560
higher ed systems of England and Scotland where in the period he studied, students in England had to

1316
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,160
pick a specialty in their mid teen years to apply for a certain program in college.

1317
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:17,280
The Scottish students could keep sampling throughout university. And he said, who wins

1318
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,360
the trade off? Otherwise, the systems were very similar who wins the earlier late specializers.

1319
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,360
And what he found was the early specializers do in fact jump out to an income lead because they

1320
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:30,560
have more domain specific skills. But the late specializers sample more things and when they do

1321
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:35,520
pick, they have better match quality. And so they have higher growth rates. So by year six out,

1322
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,320
they fly by the early specializers. Meanwhile, the early specialized based on the economics. Yeah,

1323
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:44,080
what about when you look at things that probably matter even more is just happiness and satisfaction.

1324
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,520
He was only looking at finance and career switching. So because he was looking at huge

1325
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,200
numbers of people, but we can talk about fulfillment in a sec. So the early specializers

1326
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:54,080
then start leaving their career tracks in much higher numbers, even though they have much more

1327
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,640
disincentive from doing so they're made to pick so early that they more often make a wrong choice.

1328
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:03,600
So the return to match quality was higher than the return to getting a head start and domain

1329
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,480
specific skills. The dark horse project, which I wanted to get around to anyway, as to a fulfillment,

1330
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,080
because I think you should tell more of your story. Because sounded really interesting. And

1331
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:16,160
I want to hear more of it. But that project, the dependent variable was fulfillment. And it was

1332
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:20,160
about how people go on. Yeah. Well, before we started the podcast, I said, there's this thing

1333
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:25,760
I've always tried to explain when I've told my story to high school kids or something like that.

1334
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:31,120
It doesn't really make sense, which is growing up, all of my energy went into boxing and martial arts.

1335
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:37,920
And I didn't do anything in school. I was super mediocre. And then I had this awesome teacher

1336
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:44,160
who when I was in grade 12 in Canada, you say grade 12, not 12th grade. Sounds stupid.

1337
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,680
So weird. I can't believe we can even get a lot of the guys.

1338
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,960
It's hard that we can even have a discussion. And he called me one morning and he said,

1339
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,440
Hey, I heard you're not applying to university and stuff. And I said, that's right. And he

1340
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:57,600
certainly didn't bust my chops. In fact, I wrote about him after he died and how amazing it was

1341
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,480
that he just knew what to say. He knew the right thing to say at the right time, which was,

1342
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,800
Hey, I totally get it. When I was your age, all I wanted to do is play in the NHL. And it was the

1343
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,720
only thing that mattered to me. And you really ought to don't let anybody tell you that your

1344
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:13,120
dream of being middleweight champion in the world is a dumb idea. It's not. But he said, but it was

1345
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,480
almost like a Steve Jobs moment. Like one more thing. I think you have a gift for mathematics

1346
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:24,080
and you should at least entertain the idea that maybe that's your calling is more in terms of

1347
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:29,600
math than it is in fighting. And I remember that day as clear as, I mean, that got so long ago.

1348
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:34,640
It's more than half my life ago was that moment, but it did change the course of my life completely.

1349
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:39,760
And then I did come back to high school to finish and did better than anybody expected I could ever

1350
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:46,320
do. And I've always assumed the reason I was able to do that is I simply took the work ethic of

1351
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,120
exercising six hours a day, which was sort of what I did in high school. I was, I would run five to

1352
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:55,920
13 miles every morning, 400 pushups before bed every night, and everything in between was training

1353
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,280
around that. And I just applied that to calculus, algebra, physics, geometry, et cetera. So that

1354
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:06,240
sort of gets into the Duckworth grit stuff. The question I guess I have in that is, had I taken

1355
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:14,480
the grit of age 13 to 18 and basically with no other cognitive capacity turned it into then

1356
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:19,680
doing well in school? I definitely wouldn't say no other cognitive capacity because, well, I think

1357
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:23,600
those things take a different, certain cognitive capacity, that kind of discipline, but clearly the

1358
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,760
teacher recognized something in you that you did not recognize in yourself. Didn't just pick you out

1359
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,760
randomly. And I assumed, well, especially because I wasn't even the top student in mathematics at

1360
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,160
the time. I wasn't even near the top. So yeah. So obviously he saw something that you didn't

1361
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:40,800
yourself see. And so it seems to me like you had this training, whether that was something that

1362
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,640
was part of who you are naturally or something that motivated you, that you could take that and

1363
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:48,640
transfer that to then something that had better match quality for you. And so it was a combination

1364
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:52,400
of you using certain skills and approaches that you would learn and somebody helping you find

1365
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:57,760
better match quality, basically. I think that's like an explosive combination in a good way,

1366
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:02,880
but it is interesting. I wonder what he saw because he was right. But did you have any inkling

1367
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,640
that that was the case at the time? Was that total news to you that he thought, you know,

1368
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:11,600
no, in fact, I found math incredibly frustrating because it wasn't something you could BS your

1369
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,080
way through. At least in English class, I remember this well, because I'm actually still very close

1370
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:21,120
to my English teacher from high school. I always managed to find a way to weasel through by writing

1371
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:27,520
every essay I wrote was on Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson or Marvin Hagler or Jimi Hendrix. I basically

1372
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:32,800
screwed my way through English by always figuring out a way to read a book that I was interested in

1373
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,720
and figuring out a way to write. But you couldn't do that in math. You sort of had to do it. So what

1374
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:41,680
I remember is that math frustrated me more than anything. But I wish Woody was still alive for

1375
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:46,320
many reasons, but one of them being I wish I could ask him why he said that. Yeah, no, it's

1376
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:50,800
curious. I mean, and I think a lot of people find math more frustrating in English class. It's like

1377
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,880
English class and more subjective and you kind of get through even if you don't a lot of people even

1378
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,080
if you don't know what you're doing. But that is that is interesting. I wonder what he saw. And

1379
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,320
I think that's the reason I said I think it resonates with the Dark Horse Project, which was

1380
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:07,120
this project by these two Harvard researchers to sort of figure out how people who find fulfillment

1381
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:11,440
in their work go about it in a wide range of careers. Essentially, there was a huge variety.

1382
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:16,960
But most of the people did not stick on their first sort of dream. Basically, there were some,

1383
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,640
but it was a small minority. Most of them had this, they actually called it the Dark Horse

1384
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:24,320
Project because people would come in and say, well, don't tell anybody to do what I did,

1385
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:28,640
because I started this other thing and then I something else came up or something random

1386
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,680
happened or I realized there wasn't what I want to do. So I had to start my own thing.

1387
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:37,440
So they also felt sort of sheepish about their nonlinear path. Yeah. And they saw themselves

1388
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,560
as having gotten lucky and come out of nowhere, which you do have to get luck. Luck is important,

1389
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,160
but they all saw themselves as having come out of nowhere, which is why they called it the Dark

1390
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,520
Horse Project. What they kind of had in common was this. They would sort of respond instead of

1391
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,120
sticking to like an ironclad long term plan, they would respond to their lived experience by

1392
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:56,080
zigging and zagging and kind of finding what they were good at, whether that was someone

1393
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:01,520
helping them figure that out, which I think is often the case for a younger person or them

1394
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,640
being older and maturing and sort of realizing that. And it sounds like that kind of happened

1395
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:10,160
to you in some way. You view yourself as coming out of nowhere because you had a talent and also

1396
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,680
some transferable skills that could come together in a way that you hadn't conceived before.

1397
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,400
And it worked really well. So I think you'd be kind of the type for the Dark Horse Project.

1398
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:24,240
I mean, to take something you said a moment ago and couple it to this. So let's say we fast forward

1399
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:28,080
whatever 18 years and your son says, dad, I don't want to go to college. I'm going to learn a bunch

1400
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:33,520
of stuff that I don't need to learn because I could teach it on my own. I'm going to get a degree in

1401
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:40,720
something that doesn't necessarily imply what I'm going to do with myself thereafter. The letters

1402
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:45,840
don't really matter after my name. And by the way, notwithstanding the fact that maybe by the time

1403
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:52,080
our kids are going to college, the debt that they'd incur to do so is itself more debilitating

1404
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:59,360
than anything else. So can you make a case that one does not need formal education at that level

1405
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,800
to go far? I mean, notwithstanding the fact that sometimes you need it from a professional standpoint,

1406
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,320
like you can't become a lawyer without going to school. I don't see that changing and things

1407
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,840
like that. At least in California, you just have to pass the bar. Actually, that's a great point.

1408
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,480
You can't become a doctor, I guess, without going to school. And so does this change the way you

1409
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:18,800
think about higher education? Yeah. And gosh, I don't even know where to start with this question.

1410
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,400
I hope that college looks different 18 years from now than it does now, because if we keep ramping

1411
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:26,960
up people's debt, then we will make sure that they fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy where

1412
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,560
the more you invest in something. One of my favorite writers, Maria Kanakova, wrote a book

1413
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,080
about con men. And one of their strategies is they start with asking for small things.

1414
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:41,760
Oh, I thought you meant con-a-men. Oh, no, no, not con-a-men. No, no, con-men playing confidence

1415
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:46,560
games. Yeah, the book's called The Confidence Game. And she's a psychology PhD and a great

1416
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:51,920
writer. And she notes that they'll start with these small, lots of small asks, because the more you

1417
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,200
invest, the more likely you are to fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy of then saying, well,

1418
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,640
I've already put some in, so I should keep going, even when to an outsider, it's clear that it's a

1419
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,680
disaster. And I think the more debt we saddle people with, like that study we were just talking

1420
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,960
about with the higher ed systems in England and Scotland, the English students who specialized

1421
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,800
earlier have more disincentive from quitting, even though they should. When they do quit,

1422
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,080
their growth rates are then higher because they're quitting in response to information

1423
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:19,840
about themselves that they've learned. And I think the more time and debt we saddle people with,

1424
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:24,400
the more we make sure they will not respond to match quality information. And instead we'll say,

1425
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,960
Yeah, you blunt their receptivity to the signal. That's right. And I think we want to, Steve Levitt,

1426
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,800
the Freakonomics economist did this interesting study where he had people flip a coin to determine

1427
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,560
major life decisions. And the most commonly asked question was, should I quit my job? And what he

1428
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:41,440
found was the people who flipped, I think it was heads and changed their job were better off when

1429
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:46,000
he checked in with them later. And so I think you want like as little friction as possible to people

1430
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,400
job changing. In fact, when I was watching one of the Democratic primary debates recently, and people

1431
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,320
were talking about universal healthcare, I would think one of the advantages might be that it would

1432
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:58,640
lower friction to job changing because you're not as worried about so that maybe people can shuffle

1433
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:02,560
around more and have better match quality. So I think something has to be done about the debt

1434
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:07,760
situation. I think there's plenty of evidence that for a lot of students, so the economist Brian

1435
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,520
Kaplan wrote a book called The Case Against Education. I certainly don't agree with that entire

1436
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,240
education specifically, I certainly don't agree with everything in the book, but I think it's

1437
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:20,800
provocative and a rigorous take. And his argument, so we know that some part of college education is

1438
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,800
signaling to the job world that is not about anything that you've learned. It's just about

1439
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,200
I am smart enough and I'm serious enough. And yeah, it's like the minor leagues for the job world.

1440
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:34,480
So we're doing them a favor because they don't have to be good scouts. And basically, what he was

1441
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,920
saying is nobody says that either signaling or learning is all of the effect of college. But his

1442
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:43,440
argument was that he thinks signaling is like 80% of it, whereas other people would say, Oh, maybe

1443
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:48,480
it's 20%. So he thinks most of it is just, you need this credential to signal to the work world

1444
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,880
that I'm okay. And I don't know if he's right about how much it is. But I think it's probably

1445
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,000
more than people into it, because research seems to suggest that it doesn't change people as much

1446
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,640
as we might think in some ways. What I do think is important about it, though, is that it does give

1447
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,960
that kind of sampling ability, like I didn't know about so the Scottish students in that study also

1448
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,760
much more often the late specializes end up studying something that wasn't offered in their

1449
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,920
high school, because they didn't know about it. I didn't know about the stuff I studied until I got

1450
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:22,160
to college. And so without it, I would want it to be some other mechanism for sampling. But I think

1451
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:27,680
that kind of communication technology that we have now on the internet may, if we use it smartly,

1452
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:33,520
it can expose you to a lot more stuff. And I think there's huge potential of online courses.

1453
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:38,720
I love some of these online courses. So I do think while I would want him to be able to have a

1454
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:43,600
sampling period, my kid, I think I don't know that the same kind of college model that we have now

1455
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:48,240
will be the answer. And I think there are other things that could expose him to more other things.

1456
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,000
And but if society forces the signaling to continue, then what can you do, then it's just

1457
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,840
like you have to pay your dues because you have to pay your dues. The way I see my role as a parent,

1458
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,240
you mentioned Angela Duckworth, by the way, I should mention the week that my book came out,

1459
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:03,280
I've subscribed to her newsletter. Her newsletter was titled Summer is for Sampling.

1460
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,520
And she said, kids shouldn't be too gritty until they figure out what to be gritty in.

1461
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:12,560
And she says it took me a decade of trying stuff to figure out. So it really speaks to a broader

1462
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:19,200
point here, which is a lot of these insights that we sort of latch onto are slightly out of context.

1463
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:24,000
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And I mean, so now, if her point is you should be gritting when you

1464
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,720
should be gritty. I'm totally on board with that. I view my roles, I write a little bit in that

1465
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:33,520
section about grit, about something I should have written more about about the way the army adjusted

1466
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,960
when they realized in an industrial economy, and they had this strict up or out structure,

1467
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:41,280
it was great, because you did want to be specialized, because work next year did look like work last

1468
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,680
year. And there were huge barriers to lateral mobility, but knowledge economy comes along. And

1469
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:49,680
now there's tons of lateral mobility for people who can engage in knowledge creation and creative

1470
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:55,120
problem solving. So their highest potential officers started quitting if they didn't have

1471
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:59,360
any agency over their career matching. And so first, they tried to throw money at people to

1472
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,960
retain them and people who were going to stay took it, people who are going to leave left anyway,

1473
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,200
half a billion dollars of taxpayer money down the drain. Then they started programs like when they

1474
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,800
call talent based branching, where instead of saying, here's your career track, go up or out,

1475
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,520
they say, we're gonna pair you with a coach, and try this one career track and reflect on how it

1476
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,880
fits you and then try these other two and these other two and we'll triangulate a better fit for

1477
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,640
you. And that improved retention more than throwing money at people. They've basically built

1478
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:27,120
in a match quality sampling system. And so maybe we could do stuff. That's how frankly,

1479
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,040
how I view right now my parenting role as being the coach in the math town based branching system

1480
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:35,440
for my kid facilitate, help him know that a lot of things are available and get the maximum amount

1481
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:39,920
of signal about himself from each one. And I think there are ways that that can be done,

1482
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:46,080
possibly more effectively, and a lot more cheaply than the formal education structure.

1483
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:51,120
How do you know how long to push? So give you two examples with my daughter. And I feel so bad

1484
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:54,560
sometimes telling these stories about her because one day she'll listen to this and she'll be like,

1485
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:59,200
dad, I can't believe you embarrassed me. But when she was five, she said, I want to play the drums.

1486
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,840
And we've had lots of parents who have interacted with us who said, are you crazy? How did you

1487
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,280
listen to her? But we were like, oh, we just did. So we got her like a set of cheapo little toy

1488
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:11,440
drums just to see would she actually do anything? And she did. She wouldn't stop wailing on them.

1489
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,720
And though she was four when she said that. Then when she was five, she said, no, I really want to

1490
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:19,360
keep playing. So I said, OK, fine. So we got a drum teacher, got her a real set of drums,

1491
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:26,080
and away she went. And here she is now. She's 11. She still drums. She loves it. She's I mean,

1492
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:30,080
she's really good. I can say that without too much bias, just objectively based on what her

1493
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:35,200
teacher tells me, which is like she drums better than most anyone. And she's only 11. And we never

1494
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:40,320
pushed her. Right. So it was just she just wanted to do this. There was one time when she kind of

1495
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:46,240
wanted to quit when she was about seven. And we talked to her teacher and said, hey,

1496
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:53,360
let's spend way more time just letting her play Taylor Swift songs than doing scales for a while

1497
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:57,360
and see what happens. And then that was great. Like it all came back into the mix. A year ago,

1498
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:02,240
she starts taking tennis lessons. I think her tennis teacher is the most awesome guy. He's like

1499
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:09,280
this young Russian kid. He's so fun. He's so smart. I've watched them. I mean, he just has a

1500
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:15,680
beautiful way of explaining things to her. She never feels bad. Like he never hammers her,

1501
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:19,440
but he's strict. If she's screwing around, he tells her she's like, I don't want to play tennis

1502
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:24,640
anymore. And I'm like, Olivia, are you freaking crazy? Do you know what I'd give to have played

1503
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:29,040
tennis when I was a kid? And I don't get into the sob story of like, we didn't have the opportunity

1504
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:34,240
for private tennis lessons or whatever, but it's more the tennis is such a beautiful sport. You

1505
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:41,280
will be able to play this forever. How can you not want this? And I'm really torn. Do I push her to

1506
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:45,840
continue taking lessons? And I'm not saying like you have to go and even compete. It's just sit

1507
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,680
here and play tennis for two hours a week. You and mom play. It's fun. Why wouldn't you want to do

1508
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:56,400
this? Or do I just say, well, she only wants to play basketball, which is the only sport she wants

1509
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,360
to play right now. I just, I don't know if this is a great example, but I think you get the point,

1510
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,800
right? It's like, there's a part of me that thinks it's really good for her to keep playing tennis.

1511
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:07,440
Yeah. Yeah. And she's crazy to stop. Obviously you're saying she'll regret it. It sounds like it.

1512
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:12,320
That's my potentially stupid fear, which is you're going to be 51 day and you're not going to be

1513
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:17,040
playing basketball because nobody's playing. No 50 year old woman is running around playing pickup

1514
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:21,840
basketball, but you will still play tennis. So why wouldn't you continue to learn this now?

1515
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:25,840
Well, you have this critical window in which you could get good at this sport. Yeah. And she could

1516
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,080
play tennis at startup at 50. She just wouldn't be as good at it. Exactly. Yeah. And you're

1517
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:33,440
oriented toward achievement. So she might be a great drummer and a crap tennis player. She

1518
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:38,480
starts at 50. She might still like tennis though. Yes. And I'm trying to balance the, yes, I think

1519
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:44,320
that's the part of it. I can't let go of this idea that I'm not great at anything. It would be really

1520
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:49,600
cool if my kids had the potential to be great at something world-class. Like wouldn't it be cool

1521
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:53,520
if she could be a world-class drummer one day? I have no delusion. She won't be as the interest

1522
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:58,640
or even the talent to be a world-class tennis player, but I still think why wouldn't you,

1523
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:02,640
you have this wind. I think I'm still stuck to this idea that there's a window in which you can

1524
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:10,560
assimilate skill, be it language, music, sports, that to go a little further. If she said, I don't

1525
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:14,000
know, anyway, that's sort of. And when she's younger also, you have more time to put into it and you're

1526
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,280
a lot less concerned about making mistakes. So you'll throw yourself in and practice in a way

1527
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:21,440
that you probably won't when you're older and most things. I mean, that's a great question. It sounds

1528
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:25,520
like in drums, you found a way to sort of when she was saying, I don't really want to do it anymore

1529
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:29,280
to keep her foot in by sort of changing what she was doing. Right. And it was just this one little

1530
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,360
audible called on the line of scrimmage. Everything was fine, but also it would have never even

1531
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:39,200
occurred to me to put a kid in drums. Like this was 100% her insisting on it. And there was no

1532
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:43,680
resistance from us. I was like, right. But if she'd said piano, violin, fill in the blank, we would have

1533
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:48,960
been equally interested in letting her pursue that. So maybe it just comes back to this broader issue

1534
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:55,040
of is there an age at which parents should force some of the sampling? Is there an age at which

1535
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:59,760
parents say enough is enough. You've sampled enough. If you don't want to play tennis anymore,

1536
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,240
don't play tennis. I should make clear I don't want to prescribe diversification anymore than

1537
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:07,840
I want to prescribe specialization. Right. And this gets to something I mentioned before,

1538
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,000
which is I think we tell the tiger and the Mozart stories a little wrong. Yeah, let's do that story.

1539
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:17,440
Okay. So Tiger said in 2000, his father never asked him to play golf. So his father did put a putter

1540
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:20,320
in his hand when he was seven months old, but he wasn't attempting to make him a golfer. He was

1541
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:26,320
just giving it to him as a toy. And he responded. So he said in 2000, my father never once asked me

1542
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:31,760
to play golf. It was always me asking him, it's the child's desire to play, not the parents desire

1543
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:36,240
to have the child play that matters. That resonates with the work of this woman, Ellen Winter, who's

1544
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:42,000
maybe the world's authority on prodigies of that nature, that they're usually driving their parents

1545
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,200
crazy, not the reverse. And that there's not really. Yeah. I mean, Wayne Gretzky is a great example of

1546
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:50,880
that. He listened to these interviews with his parents like they couldn't get this kid to come

1547
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,960
in for dinner. And what Ellen Winter, I think she alluded to some research. I don't think this

1548
02:02:54,960 --> 02:03:00,000
research was exactly hers, but it's really a problem when someone's parents, if they're low

1549
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,720
socioeconomic status and they have a prodigy and the person has this incredible drive of master,

1550
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,400
whatever it is they're doing, and the parent can't accommodate that because it really is hard for the

1551
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:14,080
parents. Obviously, Tiger's father responded to his very unusual display of interest in prowess.

1552
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:18,960
Mozart is probably the second most famous example. Tell people just what's the mythology

1553
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,840
around Mozart? Oh, that his father basically was Tiger Woods' father, except for music,

1554
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:28,880
that he started a very young... Shoved the violin into the crib. Yeah, exactly. And so I was going

1555
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,200
through these letters, and one that I remember really well about Mozart's early life was a

1556
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:39,840
musician who'd come over to play with Mozart's father, who was a musician. And he recalls young

1557
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:45,040
Mozart coming in with the group of adults and saying, I want to play the second violin part.

1558
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:49,680
And Mozart's father says, go away. You haven't had any lessons. You obviously can't play violin.

1559
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:54,480
And then the letter writer, his name is Andreas, something, I can't remember the last name,

1560
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:59,760
says little Wolfgang started crying. And so I said, okay, I'll go play with him in the other room.

1561
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,280
And his father says, but play quietly. Don't disturb us. Next thing you know, they hear the

1562
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:08,560
second violin part coming from the other room. And so they walk in and look, and young Wolfgang

1563
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,920
Mozart's playing the second violin part with made up fingering, because nobody's taught him

1564
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,320
the fingering. And then the letter this part, I remember verbatim, he says, young Wolfgang was

1565
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:20,560
emboldened by our applause to insist that he could also play the first violin part. And so then he

1566
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:25,280
goes and does that. And that's when his father says, holy crap. Yeah. And responds to it. So

1567
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:29,520
neither of those cases were they like manufactured the way we tell that story. So I don't think we

1568
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,360
should be scared about missing a tiger Mozart, because the best way to find one of those people

1569
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:37,760
is probably still to expose them to a bunch of things and see if something lights their fire that

1570
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,520
way. I mean, I think a Mozart. That's a great point. That's a great point. Yeah, I think those,

1571
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,200
I'm sure there's a lot of those people who never got exposed to the thing that would have ignited

1572
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:49,760
what Ellen winner calls that rage to master. And most people, you're not gonna have a lot of tigers

1573
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,800
and Mozarts, no matter what. And obviously, those are exceptions. But I think that's important to

1574
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,680
keep in mind. To go back to when do you allow your kid to quit? This is something I've seen Angela

1575
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:01,360
Duckworth has tried to respond to a number of times. It's very difficult. She'll say things like,

1576
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:07,440
don't quit on a bad day, which I think is sensible. But also, should you quit on a good day? It's kind

1577
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:11,760
of hard to know what is the calculus for when you should quit. Like if you're having tons of bad

1578
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:16,400
days, maybe you should quit on a bad day. And Levitt and Dubner have written about this, right?

1579
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:20,160
I think it's in one of their maybe their third book. Well, Levitt is always saying my best thing

1580
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:24,880
is I know when to quit, like everything like fields of study, projects, whatever. Yeah. By the way,

1581
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:30,000
is a funny aside, you know, Steve has tried very hard to get me to take up golf? No, really? Yeah.

1582
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,440
So he's a very good golfer. I don't know. A lot of people don't know how good a golfer Steve is

1583
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:39,920
incredible. And he's convinced that taking sort of a freakinomics approach to golf, you could take

1584
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:45,120
a novice and make them really good in a short period of time. We've had very serious discussions

1585
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:50,560
about if I would give him one year, he could turn me into a really good golfer as someone who's never

1586
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:55,360
even touched a golf club. I don't know if that's true, but I'm curious enough that I'd love to try

1587
02:05:55,360 --> 02:06:01,760
it if I had the time, because when he's explained to me the logic behind it, like how many steps you

1588
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:07,040
can shortcut if you're purely optimizing around this thing and how he's figured out a bunch of

1589
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:11,040
these hacks. I'm like, it's kind of fun. It's not going to happen with me. I don't think but. Yeah,

1590
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,920
probably don't have time to do that. But if you did take him up on that, like that guy we talked

1591
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,560
about earlier, Dan McLaughlin, who dropped his job to try to become a pro. Right. Who got 7,000 hours

1592
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:24,080
into it. I think he got better. So he was getting way better at first, like anything, the learning

1593
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:29,760
curve is. But I think how quickly he got better and he had never golfed before ever was surprising

1594
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:34,560
to most people how quickly he got better early on. And so I think doing that plus,

1595
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,280
I mean, he was practicing. That was like his full time job for the time. But

1596
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:42,800
if you did that for a year, plus whatever hacks he's talking about, I bet you'd pass most of the

1597
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,080
amateur golfers out there because most of them are just going in like swatting and it's like stress

1598
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:50,480
relief. They're not even really trying to get better a lot of times. But I bet you'd surprise

1599
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:55,440
yourself with how good you'd get. But I'm not a huge golf fan. I'm putting all of that energy

1600
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,360
into the things that I'm currently doing. But this idea of quitting, it is really an

1601
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:04,000
underappreciated thing, isn't it? Because sometimes it's time. It really comes down to

1602
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,840
time and exposure. And that's the most valuable resource we have. But the when to do it is still

1603
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,840
the million dollar question. Totally. I mean, I think that's why I like this model of talent

1604
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,120
based branching that the Army use so much because they pair someone with a coach to help them make

1605
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:21,840
that decision. And it's still not a science. And I also like they call it talent based branching

1606
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:26,160
because basically it's coached quitting. But they use a different term. So it doesn't sound

1607
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,800
bad. But I don't know what's perfect. I mean, I think someone a mother asked me recently said

1608
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:35,360
her son is really good at violin and now he just wants to quit. And I think like just wants to play

1609
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,600
tennis. And she was saying but he's so good. And I know he'll love it when he's older. And the best

1610
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:45,440
thing I could think of was try to help him keep a foot in whether that's playing Taylor Swift songs

1611
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:49,520
or whatever, maybe he just needs to back off and try something else for a while. Can you keep a foot

1612
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:54,640
in that pool so that he doesn't totally detach from it? And when he feels regenerated or whatever

1613
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:59,680
can go back to it. We know that progress comes from alternating stress and rest and things like

1614
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,640
that. So maybe they just need a break or maybe they need to try some other type of training. I

1615
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:07,120
think that's undervalued. If someone wants to quit and say, Oh, either you have to stick with it or

1616
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:12,400
quit. But the approach you took was, let's try varying what you're doing. I think that's incredibly

1617
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:17,680
undervalued. We act as if it's a binary choice instead of why don't we see what else this area

1618
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,200
has to offer. Maybe you just need to get on a different track. And again, I think that's the

1619
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:25,600
brilliance of good coaches is they help personalize that environment. So the person continues to be

1620
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:30,000
interested and continues to progress. And so the first thing I would try is varying up what they're

1621
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
actually doing. And if they really want to quit, I'd say maybe keep a foot in if you can for a little

1622
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,320
while. But then ultimately, if they really want to quit, then it defeats the purpose. If some

1623
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,920
aspiration of life is to find happiness, then yeah, and make it if they want to come back,

1624
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:47,440
maybe they just needed a break, keep it available if possible. But if they quit and they don't

1625
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:50,960
regret it, then what are you going to do? The proofs in the pudding. There are a couple other

1626
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:56,720
stories in range that I wanted to ask you about. One of them is the story about the space shuttle

1627
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:01,680
Challenger. I'll let you tell the story and then I'll bring my question to it. Cass, I don't even

1628
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:05,920
know how to tell this story quickly. I'll set the stage. Everybody knows what happened. Let's assume

1629
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:11,920
everybody knows the following. January 1986, space shuttle Challenger is scheduled to launch,

1630
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:16,240
happens to be the first time there's a civilian on board. It also happens to be the first time

1631
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:21,280
it's ever launched on a day that's that cold. And everybody knows what happened, which is

1632
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:29,120
whatever, 73 seconds after liftoff, the O-ring failed to contain one of the liquid fuels. I

1633
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:34,080
can't remember if it was liquid oxygen, but basically there was a spark, an explosion,

1634
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:41,280
and the rest is history. You write about one, the decision to launch that day, two,

1635
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:47,760
the challenges of figuring out what was the cause of that. Talk about both of those, especially the

1636
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:54,240
former actually. And then I'll tell you where I'm curious. What I focused on was this emergency

1637
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:58,800
conference call the night before the launch when the weather report came in that it was going to be

1638
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:06,160
an unusually cold day in Florida. And so engineers at Morton Thiokol, which was the rocket booster

1639
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:10,640
contractor, and NASA, they get on this big conference call in three different locations,

1640
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:14,480
a group of engineers, and they say, what should we do? Is this a problem? Should we worry about it?

1641
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:18,640
The shuttle was supposed to be cleared for cool temperatures, but nobody really knew because they

1642
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:23,680
had never launched below 53 degrees. And they were concerned. As an aside, by the way, that O-ring

1643
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:29,920
was from the Apollo program. That's a great example of engineering shortcut, which is they never

1644
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:34,640
actually redesigned the O-rings for the shuttle. They literally just took the O-rings from the

1645
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:38,960
Apollo project, which had a different spec and brought them over. Maybe I should describe what

1646
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,200
O-rings are a little bit. It's like, it's a strip of rubber that runs. If you can picture the rocket

1647
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:47,520
booster, you know, it looks like a missile attached to the shuttle and the O-rings it's put together

1648
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:52,560
in different vertical segments and the O-rings run along the perimeter of the missile like rocket

1649
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:57,440
booster and seal the joints between pieces. And they have to stay sealed so that they block the

1650
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:02,320
rocket fuel coming down the booster from shooting outside essentially. And there was concern that

1651
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,360
the rubber of the O-ring launched. There were forces that moved the O-ring, that moved the

1652
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:12,000
metal pieces that were being sealed apart and the O-ring rubber had to expand immediately

1653
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,320
to maintain contact so that fuel didn't come shooting past. And the concern was that the

1654
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:21,440
rubber would harden a little when it was cold and so it wouldn't expand quite as quickly. And so some

1655
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:27,360
rocket fuel would basically shoot through the wall of the booster. And that is exactly what happened.

1656
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,240
And the question was that they were trying to answer is, should we be worried? Because twice

1657
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:39,600
before they had had cases where they saw soot on the wrong side of the O-ring, which meant

1658
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:44,160
rocket fuel had gotten past it, but it wasn't catastrophic. One of those was when they launched

1659
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:49,520
at 53 degrees, which was the coolest temperature they'd launched at. One was at like 75 degrees,

1660
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,680
which was one of the warmest temperatures they had launched at. And so... And on this day,

1661
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:57,280
it was like 30 something, right? It was like 38 or something like that? They were looking at it,

1662
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,800
that it was going to be like 40, but it ended up being colder than they expected even. And I think

1663
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:05,440
in retrospect, some of the temperatures of actual components were even colder. There was like ice on

1664
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,880
the... So it ended up being colder than anybody expected anyway. But their question was,

1665
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:13,200
in these temperatures, will the O-ring work or not, basically? And the fact was that they didn't

1666
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:17,440
really... There were only two cases of this so-called blow-by when the rocket fuel goes past.

1667
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:22,000
Again, one at the coolest temperature, one at one of the warmest temperatures, and the whole

1668
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,960
shuttle was thought by the project manager to be cleared for lower temperatures anyway. And so all

1669
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:30,480
of a sudden, they're having this last minute meeting where they're saying like, how do O-rings

1670
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:35,200
work and when do they work? And the only real... They didn't have enough data to answer the question.

1671
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:40,880
And one of the engineers was saying, we shouldn't do this because I inspected the joints and in the

1672
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:46,960
53 degree day, there was lots of black soot behind the O-ring. So that means a lot of gas got by and

1673
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:51,120
we're lucky it came back. And the 75 degree day, something else must have happened because only a

1674
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:55,520
little bit got passed. I don't know what happened, but only a little got passed. And so we go colder.

1675
02:12:55,600 --> 02:13:00,320
So he said, they asked him to quantify this. So what's the relationship between temperature

1676
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:06,560
and gas blow-by? And he said, I don't know. I can't quantify it. All I know is colder is away from

1677
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,320
goodness. That's how he put it. And they kept saying quantify it, quantify it, quantify it. He said,

1678
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:14,800
I can't. I've got photographs. That's it. And I think they're telling a story. And the fact that

1679
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:19,280
he couldn't quantify it meant that essentially it was deemed inadmissible evidence, basically,

1680
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:23,280
because they couldn't quantify what the problem was. And so he made the decision to launch.

1681
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:30,320
The rest is history. So the story is tragic on so many levels because it would almost be easier to

1682
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:35,440
accept a disaster like that if nobody had seen what could have been done. That's what makes it

1683
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:41,200
so painful. But on a second reading, what makes it even more painful is the way the questions are

1684
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:46,560
being asked, which is, were they asking for him to assign a probability? Like, I don't even

1685
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:51,040
understand what the question was. Quantify it. What does that mean? Yeah. I mean, I think they

1686
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:55,040
wanted him to say, at what temperature would it fail? Because the. Well, it clearly had already

1687
02:13:55,040 --> 02:14:00,240
failed. So really, this is a probabilistic question. Exactly. Yes. But again, that's not a linear

1688
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:06,160
question. Yeah. Right. That's an asymmetry question. That's the question of so and so has an

1689
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:13,440
actuarial risk of having a heart attack of 5.4% in the next decade. Should you take preventative

1690
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:18,800
measures? I don't know. I mean, depends on your view of the world. What's the upside? What's the

1691
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:23,280
downside? What's the risk of doing something about it versus the risk of not doing something

1692
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:27,360
about it? Those are very asymmetric risks. Yeah. And I mean, actually, if you read the Rogers

1693
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:31,600
Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster, Richard Feynman. My middle son is

1694
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:35,840
named after him, by the way. Oh, okay. So Senna. Senna and Feynman are two heroes of mine. And

1695
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:41,680
your daughter named after? Actually, she's named after her grandmother. Okay. Who was also, I'm

1696
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:46,480
sure, an exceptional person. There was a point where Feynman was asking this questions like this.

1697
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,160
Like, what were you trying to get him to say? They say, well, he couldn't quantify his case. He can

1698
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:53,200
have data. And Feynman says, when you don't have data, you have to use reason. And he was giving

1699
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:58,400
you reasons. And there is a point at which they're trying to say, well, at this temperature, based on

1700
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:02,640
this data, the chances of failure should have been like one in a, I don't know, a fulfilling,

1701
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:08,080
some enormous number. And Feynman's like, that's nonsense. You had two cases that had like a small

1702
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:13,040
failure here. And you're telling me it's basically impossible. On a small finite number of launches.

1703
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:17,200
Yeah. Yeah. And so obviously there was a lot of cover your ass stuff going. And they even knew

1704
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:22,240
that at the time. So there was this unusual on that conference call. Once Morton Diacol said,

1705
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:25,920
well, our engineer is saying, don't launch, we're going to support that. And then there was all this

1706
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:29,920
discussion. And they went for an offline caucus where they said, where they kept being asked for

1707
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:33,120
data, quantify your case, quantify your case, quantify your case. And they said, we can't,

1708
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:37,360
okay, I guess we agree to launch. And then they were required to do a sign off that they didn't

1709
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:40,800
have to do in the past. So obviously people were sort of in the CIA mode at some level,

1710
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,080
or they felt protected by the process. But yeah, I don't think they weren't the best questions that

1711
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:49,680
they were asking. I mean, I think they want to know at what, again, at what temperature will

1712
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:53,680
we suffer catastrophic failure? And the answer was that they didn't know, but that things didn't

1713
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:57,920
look good. And there was reason to be worried. Think about that question, even through the lens

1714
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:06,080
of the financial crisis at what loan to value ratio at do you see a default or if you go through all

1715
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:09,760
the metrics, it's like, it's a probability distribution. The only way you can really answer

1716
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:14,880
these questions is you can't answer them this way, but the only way you can even get estimates

1717
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:21,440
of that is to run simulations across distributions, assuming you even know how to predict the

1718
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,040
probability of failure, which in that case, I would argue they didn't even have that.

1719
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:29,920
And spatial most complicated machine ever made, maybe not as complicated as the credit system,

1720
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:34,640
but most complicated machine ever made, not whatever 24 launches, they all come back safely.

1721
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:39,200
And you're right, they didn't know. And in fact, when Morton Thiokol gave its first

1722
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:44,480
recommendation, their initial recommendation was don't launch below 53 degrees because

1723
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:49,600
NASA wanted a temperature. And I think the project manager thought that the whole shuttle

1724
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:54,800
was cleared from 33 to 99. So they were putting definite boundaries on it. So they said, don't go

1725
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:57,680
below 53. And they said, well, what's your reasoning for that? They said, well, we've done

1726
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:03,120
53 before and it came back. And that actually totally backfired. So basically, they set the

1727
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:07,760
lower bound at what they'd already done and said, don't go below it. And so it backfired in the

1728
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:11,920
sense that they NASA had this very strong engineering culture, of course, that it worked

1729
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,800
great up till then. And so he said, that's not science. That's tradition. That's not an answer.

1730
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:20,080
You've departed from engineering. Give us an engineering story. Don't say just do what we've

1731
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:25,120
done before. And I get that like as Mary Schaeffer, a NASA engineer later said, perfect safety is for

1732
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,720
people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. So you can't, it is a probability

1733
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:33,600
distribution. You can't have perfect safety. But I think their attempt to be prudent backfired

1734
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:40,000
because it was viewed as an emotional rather than a scientific case, essentially. But as Feynman

1735
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,920
said, the data wasn't there. So you have to start thinking about reason. And that doesn't mean,

1736
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:49,600
maybe they would have gone with the same solution, but they had to start thinking about this problem

1737
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:53,120
in a different way than they were used to, because usually they did have the data they needed to make

1738
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,880
a decision. And in this case, they didn't. The other challenge of these case studies,

1739
02:17:56,880 --> 02:18:03,280
because it's easy to just stop there. But we also don't realize in the 24 launches prior and the

1740
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,200
God knows how many launches that followed it, including one or more disaster, by the way,

1741
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:13,440
on reentry, what's the denominator? How many times did somebody, first of all, how many disasters

1742
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:20,080
were barely avoided? Maybe at least another one on the day that it was 53. And could you ever have

1743
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:25,360
had a full consensus on any given day? This is a great case study because it has so much, the

1744
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:32,640
richness of the data that follow are there. But we don't know if every time one of these things goes

1745
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,400
up, there was also somebody in the room that said, and by the way, with perfectly good reason,

1746
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:41,840
no way, no way, no way. And here's the reason. And if that's, so is this the price we have to pay to

1747
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:48,400
live in an uncertain world, or in retrospect was Feynman Wright, and this one should have been

1748
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:54,720
averted using reasonable engineering insight? Yeah, I think, I think, and it's so easy to say

1749
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:58,720
in retrospect, of course, these people are under incredible pressure. They've had all successes in

1750
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:02,640
the past. The astronauts know they're taking risks, everyone knows they're taking risks.

1751
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,120
But I do think there's a case to be made that this one should have been averted like voices

1752
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,640
were being raised. And in fact, I think one of the reforms that came you mentioned narrowly averting

1753
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:19,120
crisis before this the 53 degree launch. I think one of the I spent a lot of time talking to the

1754
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:22,960
head of the rocket booster program while I was reporting the book, and I think it was saying one

1755
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:28,160
of the changes that occurred was sharing information like that with the astronauts themselves,

1756
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:33,040
because the feeling was had they known what happened with that O-ring, then they would have said,

1757
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:38,000
no, no, no, no, no, we're not ready to go. You guys need to figure this out. And so I don't know

1758
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,520
whether that would have or it wouldn't. That's an interesting idea. But I think maybe I think

1759
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:46,000
it's worth getting a different view when you're assessing that risk. Was it Atlantis that which

1760
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,480
was the one that burned upon reentry Columbia, Columbia. So totally different issue had to do

1761
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:55,520
with culture. I was going to ask you, was there a cultural similarity in the screw up? Totally.

1762
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,120
Or was it a different totally different type of cultural carbon copy? In fact,

1763
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,760
the investigation commission for the Columbia accident wrote in their conclusions. This is so

1764
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:09,040
similar to the Challenger disaster culturally, that we deem NASA not a learning organization

1765
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:12,720
because they didn't learn from that experience. And what I write about is they had this incredibly

1766
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:18,160
strong process culture, essentially, that was at a sign like on the mission, one of the rooms that

1767
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:22,640
said, in God, we trust all others bring data, which is great. Like they were super rigorous.

1768
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:27,760
But when they would get into these situations where you didn't have the data you wanted,

1769
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:32,960
then continuing to sort of ask for it and follow these very strict procedures meant they really

1770
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:37,120
kind of constrained their thinking like with Columbia, there were engineers who said we'd

1771
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:41,920
like photographs of a part of the shuttle we think is damaged. And so they went and asked the

1772
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:49,200
Department of Defense for those photos. And their superiors not only blocked them, but apologized to

1773
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:53,760
the Department of Defense for going outside of the normal process for trying to acquire things

1774
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,720
like that. And so in both cases, they kept sticking to this very rigid process, we need an engineer

1775
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:03,120
case, we need a quantitative case or these concerns like they're not being quantified, and you're not

1776
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:07,200
going through the proper channels. And so it doesn't count evidence and hunches kept being

1777
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,920
deemed inadmissible because they weren't part of the normal formal process. And it happened in an

1778
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:17,200
exact same way. Both times, people suspected what was going to happen. But because their concerns

1779
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:21,840
didn't fit into the normal procedural boxes, they were discounted. No, we don't know the denominator,

1780
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,800
we don't know how many times people had concerns that were completely unwarranted and would have

1781
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:30,560
thwarted so therein lies the challenge. And that's what Alan McDonald, who was the head of the rocket

1782
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:35,360
booster program told me he's like, look, if we called off that launch for Challenger, people would

1783
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:39,680
be called as he said, chicken littles, because you have to be willing to take risk in the space

1784
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:43,680
program. And you don't really get credit for not launching. I was about to say, let's assume they

1785
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:48,240
had not launched that day, and they'd waited until the next day, and it was warmer, and they

1786
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:52,480
launched, we wouldn't be having this discussion about it. You're never a hero in that situation.

1787
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:55,440
That's right. And I think there's one sort of thing that I didn't write about, but that I think

1788
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:59,440
has been attributed a little wrongly, where some people have said there was pressure on Morton

1789
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:03,600
Diacol, for sure, more pressure, because there was a civilian and this was more high profile,

1790
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:07,040
or what was the No, for Diacol, there was more pressure because NASA said they were going to

1791
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:11,520
like open up the rocket booster contract on it. But so people have said, Oh, that pressure,

1792
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:15,120
maybe that pressure was a problem, but I call gave the initial recommendation not to launch.

1793
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:20,480
So they were okay not to launch, and then they were pressed for the quantitative case. So I don't

1794
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:24,720
think that pressure was definitive, because they initially came with the recommendation of not to

1795
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:29,600
launch. So speaking of stories in the book, this is different, but it's equally perplexing to me,

1796
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:34,480
which is the firefighters and these guys who are doing these crazy jump rescue things. It's not

1797
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:40,880
that I don't believe the stories I do, but I can't, I'm trying to be empathetic to that situation and

1798
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:45,440
say, where am I making a similar mistake in my life? So spend a moment explaining what that is.

1799
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:48,560
Yeah, this comes from the work of a psychologist named Carl Weick, who writes a lot about what he

1800
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:55,200
calls sense making, like how do people collectively make sense of a dynamic situation. And one of the

1801
02:22:55,200 --> 02:23:01,440
things he noticed when he was studying wilderness firefighting teams, hotshot firefighters who hike

1802
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:06,000
in kind of dig trenches around wilderness fires or smoke jumpers who parachute into them, is that

1803
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,720
they do a great job. They're very reliable. But sometimes something unusual happens like a fire

1804
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:16,080
jumps from one slope across a gulch to another slope and starts chasing them uphill. And when

1805
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:21,120
when unexpected things happen, sometimes they have trouble and sometimes they die. And when they die,

1806
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:27,120
what he noticed was they tend the ones who die tend to die with their tools, chainsaws, drip torches,

1807
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:32,880
axes, whatever, hundreds of pounds of equipment, and the ones who survive or much fewer have dropped

1808
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:39,520
their equipment and run. And in many cases, the hotshots or firefighters will refuse orders to

1809
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:45,600
drop their tools. And so I was going through like reports of some of these tragedies and you'd see

1810
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:50,960
victim is 100 feet from safety still carrying chainsaw and drip torch and backpack and things

1811
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:55,040
like that. And even accounts of survivors would say they'd be running, they'd be looking for a

1812
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:58,720
place to put their they couldn't believe they were dropping their equipment because it was so central

1813
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:03,600
to their identity. As a firefighter, Norman McLean, who most famously wrote a river runs through it

1814
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,480
also wrote a book called the young men and fire. And he wrote that being asked to drop your tools

1815
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:12,560
is like being asked to forget that you are a firefighter because that's your whole group

1816
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:16,640
identity. And all your training is built on never getting rid of your tools. But an unfamiliar

1817
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:23,440
situation holding onto them kills you. And so like used that as kind of an allegory for what he saw

1818
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:30,000
in other usually highly reliable organizations like commercial airlines where when things go

1819
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:37,920
as expected, these very formal strict procedures work incredibly well. But sometimes having done

1820
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:42,240
them so many times makes the organization rigid such that when things change, and when it's

1821
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:46,240
obvious to an outsider that they should drop their tools and run, they don't do it because they're so

1822
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:50,640
used to doing one thing. And so what he was arguing for is how can we make training so that we have

1823
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:56,240
those reliable procedures, but also so that people know they have to improvise and we can't train them

1824
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:59,680
exactly what to do for improvising necessarily, although now they do get trained to drop their

1825
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:03,680
tools. But who knows what the other How many people had to die to figure that out. And again,

1826
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:08,640
the more powerful part of that allegory is the what's my tool, right? What are the tools that I

1827
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:15,040
am lugging around that are probably helping me 99% of the time, but 1% of the time, not only are

1828
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:19,200
they not helping me, but they could be catastrophically wounding me? Yeah. I mean, have you

1829
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:24,000
thought about this in your own life? Oh, for sure. In fact, when I told that, and this is not nearly

1830
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,440
as it sounds like it has so little gravity compared to this, but when I was talking before

1831
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:32,560
about taking a fiction writing class, I was trying to think about the joy of it and think

1832
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:36,160
about new structure, learn new structure for writing. But what really came out of it was this

1833
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:39,840
thing where it said to me, I'm using quotes in a stupid way, because I've been writing investigative

1834
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,920
magazine articles for the last couple of years where you and the lawyers really want other people

1835
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:48,480
to explain stuff in their voice if they can. But that's not good for this kind of book. And I didn't

1836
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:53,120
even think about that it was not the right way to go about it until I was like knocked out of it by

1837
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:57,440
doing something different. Again, that's not, that's not anything on the level of tragedy. But

1838
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:01,120
some of the other things white wrote about work to commercial airlines, they have these incredible,

1839
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:07,440
incredibly safe, it's pretty remarkable, actually. But when there are problems, it was usually the

1840
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:13,360
large majority of problems would be caused when a situation would change. And the flight crew would

1841
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:17,840
do the thing they were used to anyway, even though to like an outsider would become obvious that they

1842
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:22,320
had to shift what they were doing. So I think it's this sometimes paradox of expertise where,

1843
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,720
if you haven't learned to do some improvisation, then you kind of get stuck doing similar things

1844
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:30,080
over and over, you know, you get like the typical, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks

1845
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:34,240
like a nail problem. And I think there's plenty of that in medicine. You could argue medicine is

1846
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,480
probably has more of that than anything else, given the degree of specialization, but also,

1847
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:46,960
I think the tacit kind of, it's the word I'm looking for sort of the air of invincibility,

1848
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:51,200
not invincibility, either is the sort of the, I think part of exemption, the privilege of medicine,

1849
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,480
which is like you can sit down with, you could meet a person for the very first time in the

1850
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:58,560
emergency room, and they'll take their clothes off, and you're going to examine them, and they'll

1851
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:03,200
tell you a detail about their life. They've never told another human being. There's just something

1852
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,080
about that that says, well, there's still something about this profession we place so much faith in.

1853
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:14,160
And then by extension, those in the profession start to project that faith on their own decisions.

1854
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:20,080
So I think that coupled with the stakes, coupled with the specialization, I think probably creates

1855
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:24,080
a fertile environment for exactly that type of thinking. Now, I mean, I guess the last point I

1856
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:30,640
want to ask about on this particular issue is, had those firefighters, going back to this

1857
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:38,000
particular example, been trained as lifelong firefighters versus they had been sampled across

1858
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:44,640
a much broader group of people coming in, is the point of the story that if you'd come in

1859
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:51,120
to that role, having been an accountant working at Subway, just pick a totally random distribution

1860
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:55,920
of people, would it be more intuitive to that group to have dropped their tools? That's a

1861
02:27:55,920 --> 02:28:02,400
suggestion. Yeah, that it would be. And in fact, what Wyken McLean argued is that in the first of

1862
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:09,120
the famous disasters called the Man Gulch Fire, a few people survived. And the leader of the group,

1863
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:14,000
he ordered people to drop their tools. They refused the orders, essentially, except for the

1864
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:20,000
two that did survive. And one of the things they pointed out was that he had a much broader training

1865
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,440
base. He was used to doing lots of other things with tools, not only firefighting. And so they

1866
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:30,560
thought that he was, we don't know for sure, but the argument that they made was that he had had

1867
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:34,160
a much broader experience with tools. So he didn't think of them as like only these things that he

1868
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:40,160
used in a certain way for firefighting. And so in fact, what he did to save himself was he's ordering

1869
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:44,640
his guys to drop his tools. Most of them aren't. He realized he wasn't going to, he was far down

1870
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:49,120
the Gulch. He realized he wasn't going to be able to run away from the fire. So he actually lit a fire

1871
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:54,960
in front of himself, burned the grass and dove into the ash and the fire burned around him.

1872
02:28:54,960 --> 02:29:00,400
So he improvised. And now people are trained to do that. The idea that you would stop a fire by

1873
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:04,800
lighting a fire in the grass in front of yourself and that worked. But so they made the argument

1874
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:08,720
that he was much better set up to improvise because he was used to improvising with tools.

1875
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:14,560
David, I could continue having this discussion for another couple of hours, but I want to be

1876
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:19,600
sensitive to your time. And so before we wrap, is there anything that I feel like we've only

1877
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:23,520
scratched the surface, frankly, of these two books? I actually thought we'd get through more,

1878
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,040
but I guess that speaks to how long winded I am when I ask questions.

1879
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:31,040
No, you told me before we started that I could go on and be digressive. And I told you that I'm

1880
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,120
naturally digressive. So I took you up on it.

1881
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:37,840
Perfect. Perfect. It was match quality at its finest. Anything we didn't talk about in the last

1882
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,600
few minutes that you want a chance to sort of discuss?

1883
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,840
Someone who became that I don't get asked about much in the book who became sort of a role model

1884
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:50,160
for me works not so far from here. A woman named Frances Hesselbein, who took her first real job

1885
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:56,400
at the age of 54. And I'll keep her story short here. But basically, she essentially became she

1886
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:02,640
became a CEO of the Girl Scouts. And when she had one semester of junior college under her belt in

1887
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:08,560
her entire life, but now has 23 honorary degrees, she likes to know. And when she actually interviewed

1888
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:14,160
for the CEO position, the people before her had had incredible leadership credentials. Captain

1889
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:17,840
Dorothy Stratton was one she started the Women's Coast Guard Reserve and was university dean.

1890
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:22,800
Another was Cecily Canaan Selby, prominent scientist and leader in industry and education.

1891
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:29,280
Frances Hesselbein, one semester junior college leader of one of 355 local councils of Girl Scouts.

1892
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,200
And again, first professional job at age 54. And so she says, No, no, I'm not taking that CEO job.

1893
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:39,520
I'm never moving out of Pennsylvania. She grew up in Johnstown. And her husband says, No, I'll

1894
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:42,720
drive you to New York, you can turn it down in person. And so they asked her if you took over

1895
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:49,040
Girl Scouts, this is late 60s Girl Scouts is in total crisis, free fall of membership and volunteers.

1896
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:53,680
And what would you do if you took it over? And she doesn't want the job, she feels fine to say

1897
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:59,200
whatever she just speak her mind freely. And she says, the rollout our sacrosanct handbook, I'd

1898
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:02,800
replace it with ones that appeal to girls of different ages, and start working on diversity.

1899
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:07,040
If an indigenous girl near an ice flow in Alaska, opens a book, I want her to see herself in a Girl

1900
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:11,760
Scouts uniform, she just goes through all this. I sell some of the underused campsites, even though

1901
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:16,640
it'd be painful, get rid of some of this homemaking stuff, focus on educate girls about sex and drugs

1902
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:20,320
and math and science and all this. And she's like, Well, that was fun. But I'm never gonna hear from

1903
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:24,160
that again. Of course, she comes back. I mean, it's actually the early 70s when she was interviewing,

1904
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:29,440
but so she gets the CEO job and totally transforms the organization turns the cookie business into

1905
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:35,040
like a third of a billion dollar business. Triples diversity representation adds 130,000

1906
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:40,080
volunteers people she's paying in a sense of mission, not in money, and basically saves the

1907
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:45,120
Girl Scouts. And she works every week. I'm sure she's at her office right now, because she works

1908
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:49,280
every weekday in Manhattan, she's only 103 and a half. So she has a lot of I'm sure she has a lot

1909
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:54,480
of place to go. But I think she meant a lot of things to me. One, people can make an impact when

1910
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:57,600
they're older than they think they can. She's now running the Francis Hesselbein leadership

1911
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:01,920
Institute and teaching at West Point. Also, she never expected to do any of the things she did.

1912
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,760
Every time she got offered an opportunity, she'd say like, No, I'm not doing it. And then they tell

1913
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,440
her, Well, then this Girl Scout troops gonna have to be folded sorry, and she'd be like, Fine, I'll

1914
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:13,680
do it for a month and would get to try it and then be like, Wait, I actually love this. And that's

1915
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:18,240
everything she did. So she sort of short term planned her way through life. And she had two

1916
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:23,600
sayings that really stuck with me. One was leadership is a matter of how to be not a matter

1917
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:28,480
of what to do. I think that's a powerful thing to think about so much about leadership is,

1918
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:32,000
is being a good example, not having to know everything. Sometimes I think we have this

1919
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,760
George Washington standing up in the boat crossing the Delaware, which I don't think that's an

1920
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,480
accurate depiction. I think there's a real painting of him somewhere. And obviously, he's

1921
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:41,920
sitting down in the boat. But it's like this idea that they know everything ahead. They're

1922
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,520
clairvoyant. It's like, No, they need to be a good example. And part of that is admitting that you

1923
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:50,880
don't know stuff. And the other was her saying was, you have to carry a big basket to bring

1924
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:55,920
something home. And she told me when she was at one of her first training events, some woman

1925
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:59,600
complains she wasn't learning anything, she already knew all this stuff. And then this other

1926
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:04,640
woman told that saying to Francis, and then it sort of became one of her mantras. And I loved

1927
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:08,720
that saying, because I realized, again, it was part of this, I don't want to keep coming back to

1928
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:12,480
this online beginners fiction writing class I took, but it was it was sort of the emphasis of

1929
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:16,560
hearing her say that they said, Sure, I can take a beginner's class. And I realized there's like no

1930
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:20,400
amount of beginner's classes I could take that I wouldn't learn something from. Because if you go

1931
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:25,360
in open minded, you'll learn something from it. There was one day in my neighborhood, I live in

1932
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:29,920
DC now, I noticed a bunch of increase in the population of wizards in my neighborhood. And

1933
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:33,760
so I walked over a nearby hotel notice they were having like a Japanese conference conference.

1934
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:37,760
And they had a beginning Japanese comics writing class. So I'm like, I'll sit in on that.

1935
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:42,000
Probably not gonna write a Japanese comic, but it's structure and its story and narrative and

1936
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:47,520
dialogue and all this stuff. You can't not learn from it. So it's just just made me realize that

1937
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:51,760
if you go into it with that mindset, you're just constantly learning something. And so that's an

1938
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:56,720
approach I try to adopt two of those phrases really stuck with me. And I am glad you told that story.

1939
02:33:56,720 --> 02:34:03,120
That is a beautiful story. And I think it dovetails perfectly into this idea of being a lifelong

1940
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:07,680
student, which I think, well, frankly, that's sort of one of the things that's fun about a podcast.

1941
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,720
So basically, it is an excuse to learn a whole bunch of stuff. So I figured, I mean, you don't

1942
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:15,280
have to be doing this for any professional reason. Yeah. Well, David, thank you so much. I really

1943
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:18,080
appreciate it. Thanks for coming up to New York today. I appreciate it. Pleasure. I enjoyed it.

rivalties. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely.

minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics,

1954
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:15,200

1955
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:19,120
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.
