00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
Hey, Matt. Awesome to have you back on the show. It's been a while because you were one of the

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,400
very, very initial and original guests on this podcast. So I've been looking forward to having

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,880
you back from almost the moment we finished our first discussion.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,960
Yeah, thanks, Peter. It's great to be back. Unfortunately, we can't see each other in person,

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,400
but this is the next best thing. Yeah, I know. I mean, we certainly will get together in person

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,320
soon, I'm sure. There are so many things I wanted to talk about. And I think last time we spoke,

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,080
we focused mostly on our mutual favorite drug, rapamycin, and our favorite pathway,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,120
the mTOR pathway. And certainly for those listening, I don't want them to think we're

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,320
not going to touch on that today. We absolutely are. But I want to start even broader than that

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,600
because so often you and I are having these discussions about all things that pertain to

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,040
aging. And I find you to be one of the most thoughtful people across the topic. So I sort

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
of want to start with these broader questions about aging. A lot of people have different

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
definitions of aging. And truthfully, I'm not sure I even know how to define aging sometimes.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,480
It depends, I guess, on the context in which I'm asked. I think if my five-year-old asks me about

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,080
aging, I would come up with one answer. And if I'm giving a keynote talk and somebody asks me

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,040
about aging, I'd have to give a different one. So what are some of the ways that you really

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,280
describe aging? Yeah, so that's a really good question. And I think I would probably

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,440
say the same thing that you just said, which is that I'm not sure I have a great answer and it

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,360
changes depending on the situation. I think in the past, I often gravitated towards sort of a

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,320
molecular definition of aging. So what are the types of damage that occur during aging? What are

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,600
the consequences of that damage? Sort of in some ways a hallmarks of aging framework view, right?

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,680
Where we know that things like mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening, cellular

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
senescence, things like that happen during aging at the cellular and molecular level and contribute

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,960
to many of the functional declines in diseases that go along with aging. And so given my training

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,160
in biochemistry and molecular biology, that sort of is the natural place where I go when I think

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:47,600
about what is aging. I would say over the last several years, I have developed, I think, a great

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,600
appreciation for a functional definition of aging. And so as I start to think more and more about

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,880
translation of interventions that seem to affect the biological aging process in laboratory animals

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,320
outside of the laboratory and to the clinic, I spend a lot of time thinking about, well, what

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,880
are some of the functional changes that go along with aging? And we know that across every organ

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,080
system in the body, we see functional declines that go along with aging. And so I've started to

33
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:28,560
think more about things like frailty as an important component of defining aging from a biological

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,280
perspective when we're talking about having an impact on health and longevity. So I think it

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
really depends on the context. I guess the other thing I would say is both of those definitions

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
and the way I almost exclusively think about aging, unless somebody sort of forces me out of

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,880
my box, is from a biological perspective. There are other aspects of aging that intersect with

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,320
biological aging that are probably as important as what I think of as fundamental biology of aging to

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,400
quality of life. So social aspects of aging, for example, are extremely important in people,

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,120
especially for quality of life as you get older. I don't tend to gravitate towards that kind of a

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,160
definition of aging, but I do recognize that it's important. So I think I'm naturally always

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,320
thinking about the biology of aging. And as I already said, I tend to focus on the molecular

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,040
mechanisms that drive the biological changes that go along with aging. So let's look at the sort of

44
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
two extreme views within the biologic and then kind of try to figure out where disease fits in.

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,080
So on the one hand, you referred to the hallmarks of aging, and there's a very famous set of papers

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,040
that have laid these out. And if the day comes that I can actually recite all of them, I'll be

47
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
very impressed. I always have to look it up, right? I think I can probably get seven. Yeah,

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,560
it's like so you mentioned a bunch. Who can name the most hallmarks of aging? Adder Peter. DNA

49
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,120
damage is one of them. Cellular senescence is another. Stem cell fatigue is another.

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,480
Protein misfolding is another. Telomere shortening is another.

51
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Mitochondrial dysfunction is another. My favorite. Yeah.

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,080
Let's see. Did I mention nutrient sensing issues? Now, dysregulated nutrient sensing.

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Yeah. So that's my seven. What am I forgetting?

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,080
There's intracellular communication. Bingo. And what are we missing here? I'm going to be really

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
ashamed if it's something that I study. Yeah. But yeah. So we got eight out of nine. That's not bad.

56
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
You've got those. And then at the other side, you talked about, okay, let's talk phenotype. Let's

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,880
talk about the outward expression within the organism and frailties, I think, a fantastic

58
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,360
example. Where does disease fit into this, right? Because with aging comes more cancer. With aging

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,880
comes more cardiovascular disease. With aging comes more dementia. And you could argue that

60
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,120
those are functional. Maybe less so cancer, but certainly cardiovascular disease and dementia are

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,360
very functional forms of decline. But of course, at their root, they have a very cellular component

62
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,200
and a very strong set of cellular contributions. Do you think of disease as basically the bridge

63
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,440
or the link between these fundamental cellular declines and the ultimate phenotypic declines?

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,680
No, I would not say they're a bridge. So I think that I actually, I actually personally tend to

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,920
think almost the other way around where I think that the functional declines that often proceed

66
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,520
overt disease or clinical diagnosis of disease are probably as important or more important from

67
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,480
a quality of life perspective as we get older. And this may simply reflect the fact that I'm

68
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,360
getting older. And I've noticed some of these functional declines in myself. And I think that

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,200
I think these functional declines happen, as I already said, in every organ, every tissue,

70
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,800
we don't always recognize them as such, unless we sit down and think about and try to list out all

71
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,120
of the ways that we have changed as we get older. And those often happen far before you get diagnosed

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,560
with any age-related disease. So I'm pretty fortunate. I turned 50 in February. I don't have

73
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,920
any age-related disease, at least that I've been diagnosed with. Yet I have a multitude of

74
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,520
functional declines, which fortunately don't impact me severely, but that I recognize I'm

75
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,040
functionally impaired to where I was 25 years ago. I think we, you know, it's just a fact,

76
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,280
any 50-year-old is. And so I kind of think of those as the first sort of things that you can

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,880
observe that happen during aging, often way before you get an age-related disease. The other thing I

78
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,800
would say about disease, so there's actually two things, two points I want to make. One is, I think

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,440
it depends on the disease, but we really don't have a good understanding of when the pathology

80
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,960
of the disease is no longer normative aging. And what I mean by that is, you know, we've got some

81
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,320
understanding of the molecular cellular mechanisms that drive biological aging that contribute in

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,320
some way to our risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, you know,

83
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,280
sort of all of the age-related diseases that are major causes of death and disability.

84
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,000
But in most of those cases, you know, there comes a point where the pathology of the disease is not

85
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,120
necessarily at a molecular mechanistic level an extension of aging biology. It becomes something

86
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,160
different. And I think that's really important to recognize because one of the implications of that

87
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,680
is that an intervention that affects biological aging, let's just say rapamycin, we can discuss

88
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,600
whether rapamycin really affects biological aging in people. I think that's still a little bit of an

89
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,920
open question. Let's just say for the sake of argument that it does, it's not clear that that

90
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,160
same intervention is going to be effective once a pathology, you know, progresses to the point that

91
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,960
it's not the same mechanism anymore. So I think that that's a really important point that sometimes

92
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,800
gets lost in this discussion of aging and disease. So let's actually double click on that using

93
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,440
a disease. So you want to pick one of the big three, atherosclerosis, cancer, dementia.

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,080
I think cancer is a really good example, right? So we know mTOR, which I'll go back to rapamycin in

95
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
part because, you know, it's again, something I think a lot about, but it actually it's a really

96
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,200
good, I think, example in this specific case, because we know that mTOR, which is the target

97
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,960
of rapamycin, right, the protein that rapamycin inhibits, plays this fundamental role in regulating

98
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,000
cell division and cell cycle, right? So if you inhibit in a non-cancerous cell, if you inhibit

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,920
mTOR enough, you will stop the cell cycle. The cell will stop dividing, right? But there are mutations

100
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,000
that can happen that lead to cancer that cause the cell to no longer pay attention to the mTOR break,

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
right? And so once that's happened, if that's the type of cancer you have that no longer responds

102
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,840
to mTOR inhibition, rapamycin won't do anything to cell cycle in that case. So that's a really,

103
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,240
I think, specific example that you can point to. There are, you know, sort of an infinite number

104
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
of other examples that we could use, but that's a really nice one because there rapamycin will be

105
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,960
quite effective at preventing cancer before that mutation happens. But after that mutation happens

106
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,160
and the cell's not responding to rapamycin anymore because it doesn't sense the mTOR break,

107
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,960
it's completely ineffective, right? So that, I think, is a case where the mechanisms have

108
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,320
changed, right? The mechanisms that are important for preventing cancer before that mutation

109
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,320
occurred are different from the mechanisms that might deal with that cancer after that mutation

110
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,040
has occurred. Yeah, it's funny. This is a little off topic, but I've often contemplated this

111
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,760
question in the context of nutrition because in as much as there's an optimal nutrition to prevent

112
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,760
a condition, it might not be the same as the optimal nutritional strategy to treat the disease

113
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,680
once it's present. Yeah. And, you know, an example of that in an extreme sense might be a ketogenic

114
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,720
diet. I happen to believe a ketogenic diet is probably the best treatment for someone with

115
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,880
type 2 diabetes because of course type 2 diabetes by its very definition is a carbohydrate

116
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,400
intolerance disorder. So once a person has it, you pull out the carbohydrates completely and you let

117
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,440
them heal, right? You basically let them recover and regain their ability, you know, and again,

118
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,240
we've seen that people who have been on a ketogenic diet for a long enough period of time

119
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,760
can resume some amount of carbohydrate consumption provided their other factors are changing such as

120
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,720
exercise. Does that mean one needs to be on a ketogenic diet to prevent diabetes? No, I don't

121
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,440
think so. So it's a little bit of the same idea though it's still something that's unclear. You

122
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,840
know, one thing I want to go back to on the disease front is, and I believe it was Cynthia

123
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,080
Kenyon who spoke about this once. I think I read it in a paper, something to the effect of, you

124
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,320
know, using a disease-based definition for aging is she didn't use the word tautology, but she

125
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,160
effectively said it is a bit of a tautology because at what point is a disease a disease? It's only a

126
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,560
disease when some people have it and some people don't, right? If everybody has cancer by a certain

127
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,880
age, then it's normative aging to your point. It's no longer a disease. And then we get into,

128
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,560
well, what does it mean? Like why do, you know, 0.0004% of the population live to be 100?

129
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,000
They've managed to not succumb to a disease by the age of 100. And what does that tell us about

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,200
their normative aging versus everybody else? All of this is to say I literally still don't think

131
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,760
I understand what aging is, which is unfortunate given my line of work. Well, I mean, I think we

132
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,920
have to just accept that it's extremely complicated, right? And so you're never, I shouldn't say never.

133
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,240
I don't think I will ever understand aging fully. And I don't think the field will, at least, you

134
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:28,080
know, in any timeframe that I can expect to experience, right? But I also believe that we

135
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,160
don't have to understand it fully to be able to have an impact on the biology of aging through

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,720
interventions. And so I think that, and that's kind of where I'm at. I feel like I've got a

137
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:47,120
conceptual flavor for what aging is. And I have some information about what the molecular

138
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,520
mechanisms are. And it's enough information that I can come up with rational approaches to target

139
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,360
those mechanisms with the prediction that those approaches should have an impact on health and

140
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,240
longevity as animals and people get older. And then we have to test those predictions, right?

141
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,320
That I think is, that's kind of the way I think about it. I do want to come back to one point,

142
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,280
though, which I also think is often underappreciated in this relationship between disease

143
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,320
and the biology of aging. I think, you know, sometimes people get into this debate about

144
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,800
whether or not the biology of aging causes diseases of aging, right? So does the biology

145
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,800
of aging cause Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, right? People get in

146
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,160
debates about that. And I personally think the data are pretty good that these, that what I think

147
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,000
of is the biology of aging, the molecular mechanisms, the hallmarks, whatever you want to

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,280
call them, contribute in a causal way to your risk of developing diseases. But I also think it doesn't

149
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,320
matter. It does. And this, I think is really important from the perspective of what is the

150
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,480
best strategy to keep people healthy or longer. It just doesn't matter whether aging causes disease,

151
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,680
or it creates a permissive physiological state for disease. You can't argue that biological age

152
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,360
is the single greatest risk factor for every major cause of death and disability in developed

153
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,240
countries. That is just a fact. And whether or not biological age causes those diseases or

154
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,160
creates a physiological state that allows those diseases to manifest themselves doesn't matter

155
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,440
from the perspective of how, what is the most effective way to prevent those diseases. And I

156
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,720
think that's where this debate is counterproductive, right? Should we call aging a disease? Does aging

157
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,200
cause disease? I think that those are not the right questions to be asking in my view.

158
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Yeah. Let me see if you would agree with my assessment. I think you would, but I'll tell

159
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,800
you how I think about this problem clinically, right? So let's use atherosclerosis as an example.

160
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,600
And I want to highlight what you just said in case the person watching this or listening to this

161
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,880
missed it in any way, shape, or form. This is one of the questions when I used to give talks.

162
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,400
I'd always lead with a question like this. What is the greatest risk factor for atherosclerosis?

163
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,320
Hand will go up. Yes. Smoking. No. Hand will go up. High blood pressure. Nope.

164
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,560
Hand will go up if it's an especially erudite audience. Apo B or LDLC. Nope. And they'll just

165
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,480
keep rattling on inflammation. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. The number one thing is age.

166
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:51,040
Hands down, right? You take a 70 year old person who has everything perfect about them and you

167
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,880
compare them to a 20 year old train wreck who has not a single thing that is in their favor.

168
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,560
There is no comparison about their 10 year mortality prediction. But the 70 year old is

169
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,560
in hands down or worse shape. So yeah, you can't undo that. Now, here's how I think about this

170
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,000
problem clinically. Atherosclerosis is a great example because it's the disease that we understand

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
the most of the big three, right? Which is not to say we understand it completely, but we have a far

172
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,800
better understanding of what its drivers are and how to prevent it than we do cancer and Alzheimer's

173
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:31,040
disease. Lowering Apo B pharmacologically, nutritionally, et cetera, is arguably the most

174
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,760
important strategy you have to reduce it along with probably improving metabolic health. So those

175
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,640
two things, right? So regulating glucose, insulin, lowering Apo B, all of these things can be done

176
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,800
through lifestyle, through drugs, et cetera, can dramatically reduce a person's risk of atherosclerosis.

177
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,800
None of those things are necessarily directly targeting the nine hallmarks of aging. I think

178
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,920
indirectly they certainly do. But when you give somebody a PCSK9 inhibitor, which specifically

179
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,480
targets a protein that allows the body to clear more Apo B particles out of circulation, it is by

180
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,880
no means targeting one of those nine pillars, but it's having a measurable impact on reducing their

181
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,800
risk of disease. And in the end, that's the part that I think is hard for some people to understand

182
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,600
within the aging community, is that you can still target metrics of a disease specifically without

183
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,880
going after a hallmark. Sure. And I mean, I think I don't disagree with you that I think that is a

184
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,280
concept that sometimes is underappreciated, right? Especially within the aging community. I also

185
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:47,680
think it makes sense, right? So even if the hallmarks... We focus so much on the hallmarks

186
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,680
because it's easy, right? I think there are some reasons why the hallmarks are incomplete, but let's

187
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,840
just keep using that term sort of as a surrogate for the molecular mechanisms of aging, right?

188
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,680
If we accept that the hallmarks are at some level preceding the damage, whatever that is that's

189
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,880
causing the disease, it makes sense that you could intervene sort of, if we think about it in an

190
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,120
upstream downstream perspective, right? The hallmarks being upstream, the disease being ultimately

191
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
downstream. It makes sense that you could intervene at the level of the hallmarks. It also makes sense

192
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,720
that you could intervene, you know, in whatever the bridge is that's connecting the hallmarks to

193
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,840
the disease, you wouldn't necessarily impact the biology of aging at all. And this gets back to

194
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,440
what I was talking about before, which for many diseases of aging, there comes a point where the

195
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,400
pathology of the disease is not normative aging anymore. And so you can quite successfully treat

196
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,560
or cure a disease of aging in an individual without impacting the biology of aging. In fact,

197
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,280
I would argue that's almost exclusively what is done clinically, right? Is to try to either

198
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,520
alleviate the symptoms of the disease or cure the disease. They're starting to be more on the

199
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,160
preventative side, but I still think that lags far behind, you know, waiting until people are sick

200
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,600
and then trying to do something about their disease. But you don't have to impact the biology

201
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,520
of aging to be successful at any of those things. I would just argue that impacting the biology of

202
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,360
aging is going to be a much more effective and efficient approach from sort of the overall health

203
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,880
perspective. I think the other point that's obvious but is important to make is if you don't target

204
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,280
the biology of aging, that you're really only impacting that one disease. Say it's cancer, you

205
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,560
can cure somebody's cancer, you can take the tumor out, right? And they can go on and live a normal

206
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:45,280
life. But you haven't done anything to the biology of aging. If you don't confront the biology of

207
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,560
aging, right, you still have all of these other functional declines and diseases of aging that

208
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,480
are increasing, you know, essentially exponentially as you're getting older. And so the effect on

209
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,560
health and longevity is quite small. In fact, I think J.L. Shansky was the person who originally

210
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,840
kind of did the math here, right? And it's really very striking. So if you consider a typical 50

211
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,720
year old woman in the United States and you say, you know, what would happen if we had a cure to

212
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,080
all cancers, right? Every type of cancer, we had a cure today and we implemented that. Life expectancy

213
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,680
for a typical 50 year old woman in the United States would go up about three years. That's it.

214
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,920
So we've won the war on cancer. We get a plus three on life expectancy. It's about the same for

215
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,280
curing heart disease. If you cure both of those diseases, it's roughly additive. It's I think

216
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,000
about seven years. So the impact on life expectancy is actually from curing disease is actually quite

217
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,160
small. If you compare that to the impact of targeting biological aging, which again, I think

218
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,480
we have to be honest, right? This is hypothetical in humans at this point. So all we can really do

219
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,080
is extrapolate from what is done in laboratory animals. But it's pretty routine now. There are,

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,040
I don't know, maybe a dozen, 15 different interventions that can increase lifespan

221
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,040
slow aging in mice by between 15 and 30%. If we just extrapolate that to the human condition,

222
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,920
the impact on life expectancy is about 20 years with the added value that because you've sort of

223
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,280
slowed all of the functional declines of aging simultaneously, those extra couple of decades

224
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,120
are spent in relatively good health. So I think it's just important to appreciate the potential

225
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,800
difference in health and life expectancy from targeting aging as opposed to what we do right

226
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:49,600
now, which is trying to cure individual diseases. And I've sort of adopted the term, I think of that

227
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,240
as 20th century medicine, the disease first approach, or I would even say 19th century

228
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,920
medicine. We've been doing this for a long time. And I contrast that to what I think of as 21st

229
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,080
century medicine, which is approaching health and longevity from the perspective

230
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,480
of the biology of aging. And we're not there yet, but I do believe that this is happening. There is a

231
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,840
transition occurring, a slow appreciation among the broader clinical community of the potential

232
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,360
of this kind of approach. And I do believe that we will get there in this century. So it is my hope

233
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,440
and expectation that 21st century medicine will really become targeting the biology of aging to

234
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,640
enhance health and longevity, hopefully by much, much greater amount than we're currently able to do.

235
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,960
Yeah. So I agree with a lot of that. The one thing I would throw a little bit of a question at is,

236
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,240
and I'd love to have Jay on the podcast because I don't know that I fully agree with his analysis.

237
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,640
I agree with the spirit of his analysis. So I completely agree that disease-based whack-a-mole

238
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,520
is not going to be nearly as effective as targeting the basic biology of aging. So completely

239
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,000
agree with your points. I don't know that I agree with the magnitude, the de minimis magnitude

240
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,600
of it, because I really think that Jay's analysis is focused on an independent look at each disease.

241
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,080
Whereas in reality, if you eliminated cardiovascular disease, by definition, you have reduced

242
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,960
inflammation significantly. You've reduced the burden of microvascular disease significantly.

243
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,720
Those are going to play into other diseases. So his analysis is very actuarial, but it's not

244
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,920
actually very biological. That's my opinion. Now, again, I should have-

245
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,560
I think that's fair. Yeah. I think that's fair. I think you could make the case, at least for

246
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,600
cancer, that it may be closer to-

247
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,000
I agree.

248
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,640
... just what the straight math would suggest.

249
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,960
Yeah.

250
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,520
Yeah.

251
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Now, with all of that said, I couldn't agree more with the macro point here, which is

252
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,080
delaying chronic disease is probably not going to be as effective as targeting something at the

253
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,320
foundation. Now, that said, let's take a look at NIRS data. So when you look at NIR Barzilai's

254
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:25,600
work with centenarians, the overwhelming statement here is they get chronic diseases later. They

255
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:35,680
don't live longer with them. And I remember really being struck by that. That would not

256
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,640
have been my null hypothesis going into NIRS, a study of NIRS work, and Tom Pearls as well.

257
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,920
Between NIR and Tom, you really have the greatest assessment of the centenarians and their siblings.

258
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,320
Yeah.

259
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,480
And you realize that they don't seem to have magical protection from a disease once they get it. When

260
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,800
they get cancer, they're just as hosed as the rest of us. When they get heart disease, they're just

261
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,120
as bad off as the rest of us. But they get a phase shift. They get a 20-year, 20, sometimes

262
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,280
30-year phase shift in when they're going to get the disease. And so how does that factor into my

263
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,880
thinking clinically? My factoring to that clinically is the sooner you begin prevention,

264
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,760
the more you can mimic the centenarian. What we don't fully understand is molecularly,

265
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,600
why is that the case? We've identified some of their genes. We know that they're going to be

266
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:37,280
more likely to have ApoE2 versus ApoE3 or ApoE4. They're going to be less likely to have ApoC3,

267
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,120
high regulation versus low. You have a lot of genes that produce phenotypes that are favorable.

268
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,880
But when you bring it back to our nine hallmarks, by the way, the ninth hallmark is epigenetic

269
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,640
modu- Of course. Yes, it's the epigenetic modulation.

270
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,520
Now, the other point I guess that we're both well aware of, but maybe for the listener, is

271
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,000
how difficult it is to study aging in humans targeting the basic biology because you don't

272
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,000
get to do what our clinical trials apparatus is set up to do, which is pick a disease,

273
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,800
a very clear endpoint, and target it. If your endpoint is nutrient sensing, that's a tough

274
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,440
clinical trial. Yeah. So I agree. And I think we should definitely come back to that point because

275
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,840
it's clearly a major focus of the field right now is how do we start to test some

276
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,840
of these interventions that we know work in laboratory animals in the clinic. That's a

277
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,240
challenge. I want to come back to your comment about centenarians though, because I think this

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:56,560
again is a conceptual area where there's a lot of, I think, misunderstanding both among people in

279
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:05,600
the field and also lay people who pay attention to the field. So you're right, I think, that the

280
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:13,920
bulk of the evidence supports the idea that centenarians do not live longer with multiple

281
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,200
age-related diseases, but they have genetic risk factors or genetic variants that put them at lower

282
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,840
risk, at least for the major killers. So there is a genetic component to being a centenarian. It's

283
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:33,600
not huge, but it's significant, probably somewhere I think around 25, 30%. And they tend to not have

284
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,240
the high risk genetic variants for Alzheimer's disease, certain types of cancer, heart disease,

285
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,800
things like that. And then there's a luck or environment or something else we don't understand

286
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:54,800
that comes into play. But people often look at that observation and make the assumption that we

287
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,960
don't see variants in things like mTOR or sirtuins, not that there aren't variants that haven't been

288
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,040
talked about, but that have strong effects. So I think the question becomes, why don't we see

289
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:16,160
variants in sirt6 or mTOR or pick your favorite longevity gene, foxo, that cause people to live

290
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,520
to be 180 years old? Because we can do that magnitude of lifespan extension in a mouse or

291
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,240
a C. elegans. And so they go from that. So that's an observation. We haven't found those variants yet.

292
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,920
Although foxo is one of the genes, foxo 3A, no, it's not, it's a very weak effect, but it's clearly

293
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,640
a higher amount. As is 36. Right. And as is mTOR, there's evidence for all of those things.

294
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,920
You can find genetic evidence, but the effects are relatively small. So then the interpretation

295
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,320
that people make is the reason we don't see those variants is because humans are fundamentally

296
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,760
different from mice or whatever your favorite laboratory organism is. And none of those things

297
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,000
will work the same way in people. Now I can't prove that they will work the same way yet

298
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,920
for aging in people, but that's a, that's an ill, that's not a logical sort of interpretation,

299
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,800
right? I would argue the reason you don't see strong effect variants in mTOR, for example,

300
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,960
in people is because we know that strong effect variants in mTOR are incompatible with life and

301
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,400
development, even in mice, right? You make a mTOR knockout mouse, it's dead. So, so I think the

302
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,680
reason why you don't see these strong effect variants in people is because there is such a

303
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,880
strong selective pressure. Either, either they don't make it through gestation, they don't make

304
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,320
it through development, or they're sterile, right? All of those are incompatible with, with evolutionary

305
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,480
success. And, and that's my hypothesis for why we don't see these very strong effect genetic

306
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,920
variants in people that lead to 160, 170 year lifespans. Again, it's a hypothesis, right? It's

307
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,360
hard to, it's hard to know what the explanation is, but it certainly fits with what we see in

308
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,800
laboratory animals. Any of these, any of these mutants in mice that have, you know, 30, 40%

309
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,960
lifespan extension, I mean, they are all significantly defective in, in, from a, from

310
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,960
an evolutionary perspective, right? They would not be selectively advantageous mutations. And so

311
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,240
I think that's, that's at least a consistent explanation for why we don't see these, these,

312
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,280
these, what we would think of as slower aging variants pop up in, in people. The other point

313
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,320
that's, that's important to make as well though, is that that doesn't mean that we can't intervene

314
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,600
in these pathways to have an impact on health and longevity. And for me, this has been, you know,

315
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:59,040
probably the most exciting aspect and development in the field over the last probably 15 years.

316
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:07,520
You know, if you asked me 15 years ago, whether I thought that, that it would be easy to slow aging

317
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,200
in an old mouse, I would have said no, I would have said, you probably have to start, you know,

318
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,720
at six months of age and treat them all the way through life to get, to get the benefits. And that

319
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,440
was honestly, largely based on caloric restriction, right? Which that seems to be the case for caloric

320
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,560
restriction. You know, what has emerged now is there are five or six or seven, or maybe even more

321
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,000
different interventions that can be initiated in middle age or even in late age in mice.

322
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,920
And you actually go, it's not only that you slow down the declines, you actually reverse the

323
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,000
declines, right? And again, I come back to rapamycin because in pretty much every tissue where this

324
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
has been looked at, you take an old mouse, you give it rapamycin functionally, it's younger in

325
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,600
that tissue or that organ and lifespan is extended. And by the way, to your point, Matt, I was having

326
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,800
dinner with a friend last night who asked me, why don't we start giving rapamycin to children?

327
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,440
And I said, look, I think, I think rapamycin is the most important, you know,

328
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,560
giroprotective agent out there today, but you wouldn't want to give it to a developing

329
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,760
child, right? He said, if you had to guess when would be the right age to start, I said,

330
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,720
I have no honest clue, but it wouldn't be before 25, right? It just wouldn't be before about the

331
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,960
age of 25, which speaks to your point, any genetic manipulation or in this case, naturally acquired

332
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,320
genetic variation that mimicked rapamycin would probably not be selective because you wouldn't

333
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,360
be able to turn it on and off the way you would need to with the drug. That's right. Yeah, that's

334
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,680
right. And I mean, I think that's a really interesting question about rapamycin and other

335
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:47,360
interventions as more and more interventions start to, you know, get to the same sort of level of

336
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:55,040
confidence that we have about rapamycin. When is the optimal sort of treatment period, right? To

337
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,520
get the biggest benefits. And I think, again, this is a, it's not something that often gets,

338
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,640
I think, talked about in that conversation, but it's really a, it's a balancing act, right? Any

339
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,120
intervention is going to have some risk associated with it, right? The risk can be low, the risk can

340
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:18,720
be high, but there's always some risk of side effects. And so the question of optimal treatment,

341
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:27,600
right, is a balance between the beneficial effects that you get and the risk of detrimental

342
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,840
effects, side effects. And so I think we still don't, even with rapamycin, we still don't have

343
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:41,600
a great feel for what that risk looks like, right? And that's in part because, you know, we haven't

344
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:48,160
had long-term controlled clinical trials at multiple doses, multiple strategies of, you know,

345
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,840
intermittent versus continuous treatment, things like that. So we just don't know, right? And it's

346
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,560
interesting in the case of rapamycin because my impression is that, you know, there are a group of

347
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,680
people, I think you and I both know some of them, we might even be among them, who, you know, have

348
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:13,280
self-experimented, right? And my impression is that there has been a movement towards the idea that,

349
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,600
you know, once a week dosing with rapamycin is probably better than daily dosing with rapamycin

350
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,480
for aging effects in people and that, you know, you might want to do it for three months and then

351
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,920
you stop for six months and you do it again for three months, right? I think that's where people

352
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,880
are starting to coalesce around this idea. There's not a lot of data to support that, right? It's a

353
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,800
guess. And so it's just interesting to sort of see how that, you know, is evolving in the absence of

354
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,040
long-term, large-scale controlled clinical trials. And this is getting to the point that you raised

355
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,000
earlier, which is it's really hard and expensive to do long-term controlled clinical trials

356
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,600
for aging in people. We really, I think, still as a field don't have a great strategy for how to

357
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,440
address that challenge of actually trying to answer some of these questions in the way that,

358
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,320
you know, at least traditionally we would want to see them answered in a clinical setting.

359
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,800
I mean, I think there's an even bigger problem, Matt, which is I don't think there's a regulatory

360
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,960
appetite to even do what would be necessary because we have the regulatory appetite to say

361
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,480
you take an individual who is either at very high risk for a disease or already has said disease

362
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,400
and we will go ahead and accept the risk of a clinical trial to assess it.

363
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:44,400
But by definition, if you truly want to understand how giroprotective metformin or rapamycin or

364
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,480
canagaflasm or pick your favorite molecule is, you really need to be testing it in people before

365
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,000
they have a disease. So even if you, so there's really two fundamental problems. This is one,

366
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,520
we do not have a regulatory environment that accepts that risk. So I would love to see the

367
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,040
IRB submission that says we're going to test rapamycin in healthy 50 year olds who are,

368
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,360
you know, whose 10 year risk of death is less than 1%. And then secondly, because we can't

369
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,080
logistically follow those people for the next 50 years, which is what would be necessary to

370
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:25,440
understand its true magnitude of giroprotection, we would need really good biomarkers of aging,

371
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,120
of which I will posit and you may disagree. We have somewhere between zero and epsilon of those.

372
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,880
We don't have diddly squat in the way of meaningful biomarkers of aging. By the way,

373
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,600
I want to go back to your point on rapa. So, you know, as you do know, and I'm very happy to talk

374
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,240
about, I mean, I've been taking rapamycin for two and a half years now, and I am one of those people

375
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,400
who has coalesced around once weekly dosing. I have fiddled a little bit with my dose. I've

376
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,840
varied it from as little as five to as many as eight milligrams once a week. I've also done the

377
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:03,760
cycling on and the cycling off, but I am completely flying blind. Most of my dosing

378
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,800
and frequency data comes from Joan Manick and Lloyd Klikstein's 2014 paper with Evrolimus,

379
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,120
which of course is not the same as rapamycin, but it's a pretty reasonable hand-drawn facsimile of

380
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:23,600
it. And it was from that study that I concluded that, you know, 20 milligrams versus five

381
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,680
milligrams versus one milligram, your sweet spot was at about five from a side effect standpoint

382
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,960
and an efficacy standpoint. And the daily dose of one milligram didn't seem to produce as good an

383
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,000
effect as the five milligrams once a week. But how does that stand in comparison to what we

384
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
learned from all of the ITP studies where it's continuous administration of rapamycin? And to

385
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,880
your point, because we'll come back to these and talk about them, remarkable results, regardless of

386
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:00,240
when it's initiated. Right. I don't know what to make of that. Yeah. And I kind of agree with

387
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,280
everything you said about why, you know, if you're going to pick one regimen for rapamycin,

388
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,720
that makes sense. And like you said, it's really based on two clinical trials, right? I mean,

389
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,440
really. And so it's a limited data set, but at least for immune function in people,

390
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,240
you know, it seemed to work. And that's actually, I mean, you know, we could, we could spend hours

391
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,400
talking about this because that's a whole nother, I think, interesting and informative sort of

392
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,200
experience was the failure of the phase three clinical trial at Restorbio, right? And what

393
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,880
happened there? And I don't think we actually, it's at least not in the, it's not published yet.

394
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
Well, let's talk about this because it is really interesting. So let's back up for a moment and

395
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,280
give people the context. So when Joan was at Novartis in, and both Joan and Lloyd were at

396
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,160
Novartis in 2014, the Everalymis study was done. And do you want to just tell people really briefly

397
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,720
what that study looked at? Right. So that study, so Everalymis is a derivative of rapamycin and

398
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,480
biochemically, it has exactly the same mechanism. So it's, I, at least I conceptually think about

399
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,520
them as essentially the same molecule. So anything that we see with Everalymis, we would expect to

400
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:21,200
see with rapamycin. And so that was a phase two clinical trial in healthy older adults to look

401
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,120
at whether or not a six week treatment with Everalymis could boost vaccine response. So,

402
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,480
so the ability of older adults to respond to an influenza vaccine. And that actually was based on

403
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,840
one of my favorite papers from Panjang's lab at the University of Michigan, who showed that in mice,

404
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,200
I think it was, I think it was four weeks of rapamycin. It was either four weeks or six weeks

405
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,160
of rapamycin and old mice boosted the ability of a flu vaccine to protect those mice against a lethal

406
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,520
dose of influenza. That if anybody hasn't, hasn't looked at that paper, I would just encourage you

407
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,320
to go check it out. I think it was a 2009 science signaling paper from Panjang's lab, something of

408
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,160
the title has something about hematopoietic stem cells and rapamycin. We'll look to it in the show

409
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,000
notes for sure. Okay, yeah, it's an amazing study. But but my favorite experiment there was this

410
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,320
experiment where they took young and old mice, and they gave them influenza vaccine. And then they

411
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,680
waited two weeks and then they gave them a leaf, what would be a lethal dose of influenza if they

412
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,960
hadn't got the vaccine. And in the old group, half the mice either got rapamycin or they got a

413
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,280
control, right? So the first thing that struck me about that experiment was if you look at just the

414
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,680
difference between young and old mice who got the vaccine, all of the young mice were protected 100%

415
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,040
vaccine response, I think it was about 65%. So two thirds of the old mice did not have a

416
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,800
sufficient response to the vaccine, that they were protected against influenza, right? And I don't

417
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,960
know if the numbers are, I don't think the numbers are exactly the same in people. But there is

418
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:07,920
definitely that same trend where older adults tend to not respond to vaccines as robustly as

419
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,960
younger adults. Unless those old mice got rapamycin, if they got six weeks of rapamycin,

420
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,520
they were 100% effective at responding to the vaccine. So at least for that measure of immune

421
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,360
function, rapamycin fully restored the immune system back to that of a youthful immune system.

422
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:34,400
So that was the mouse data that sort of served as support for testing this in humans in this

423
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,080
clinical trial that we're about to get to. And by the way, Matt, do you recall if the immune response

424
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,560
in question, i.e. the immune response that was better in the rapa group versus the non-rapa

425
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,720
group of older mice, was this a B cell response, a memory B cell response, or was it a T cell response?

426
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:01,360
I don't recall the data. I know they have a lot of data in there looking at the antibody titers and

427
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:08,160
different types of immune cell types and how they responded. As I said, the title of that paper and

428
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,400
the model that they proposed was that rapamycin was acting at the level of hematopoietic stem cells

429
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,440
to rejuvenate hematopoietic stem cell function in some way. I don't recall the details of the

430
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:27,920
immunology. I've tried multiple times throughout my career to become fluent in immunologist speak

431
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,720
and have failed miserably every time. So that's a weakness of mine that will likely never be

432
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,200
addressed adequately. It's just got such amazing implications for what we're seeing with

433
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,040
COVID vaccination because we are still in such a nascent stage of truly understanding. We're

434
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,640
seeing people who naturally acquired COVID who within six months have no more circulating IgG.

435
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,200
We have no clue if they still have immune function. For example, do they still have

436
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,440
memory B cells in their bone marrow that when challenged will make antibodies? Do they still

437
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,040
produce, do they still have memory T cells that will show up and immediately respond?

438
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,240
And so we're actually involved in a study that's looking at that. But my intuition is

439
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,640
you can probably still have an immune response or an immune response that's ready to go absent

440
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,360
circulating IgG. Yeah. The one thing I will say about rapamycin and everolimus is that it seems

441
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:38,240
like it's not one simple mechanism at play. So Joan, for example, has published data that one of

442
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,040
the effects of everolimus and another drug called RTB101, which is also an mTOR inhibitor,

443
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,600
is to boost antiviral gene expression. And we know also that rapamycin, at least in mice,

444
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:57,040
and almost certainly in people, tamps down on the sort of chronic sterile inflammation that goes

445
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,440
along with aging through mechanisms that still are being worked out. So I think it's probably

446
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:09,760
multiple things that are going on that can impact immune function in different ways, right? When you

447
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,680
treat with rapamycin, especially in the context of an old animal or an old person. So it's probably

448
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,240
not going to be one mechanism is my guess. So based on this study, so Joan and colleagues

449
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,400
take a group of, I believe, 65 year olds, I think they're, you know, 320 of them, so divided into

450
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,680
four groups of 80, you've got a placebo group, one milligram a week group, 20 milligrams once

451
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,240
a week and five milligrams once a week. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. And so they did a six,

452
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,840
I think it was a six week treatment period. And then they also waited, I think two weeks,

453
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,400
and then they gave them a flu vaccine. And what they showed, I mean, obviously it's people,

454
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,720
so you can't do the mouse experiment and then give those people a lethal dose of influenza. So they

455
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,680
were sort of, you know, stuck with looking at things like antibody titers and to try to get

456
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,800
an assessment of, you know, did the people who got everolimus respond better to the vaccine than the

457
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,600
people who got the vehicle control? And it looked like they did. And it was, you know, you can argue

458
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,800
about the strength of the data. I think it was pretty clear that they had at least at the

459
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,680
five MIG once a week. And I think the one MIG daily, I can't remember, maybe it was the 20

460
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,760
MIG once a week, but the five MIG once a week looked pretty convincing that they had a better

461
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,880
response to the vaccine. I think the other thing that's really important about that paper is that

462
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:40,240
the incidence of side effects was really hardly different at all between the different everolimus

463
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,600
groups and the placebo. And particularly the five MIG once a week, there really was no significant

464
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,400
increase in adverse events in that group, which gets back to how we kind of started on this

465
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
this tangent, which is that that's part of the reason why, you know, I think people are moving

466
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,800
towards the idea that you can still get efficacy from once weekly dosing and that the side effects

467
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,200
are reduced at once weekly dosing to essentially zero or close to zero. So that was the first phase

468
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,520
two trial. And then they went on and did a second. Before we leave this trial, Matt, I think it is

469
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,680
important for someone listening to understand why people like you and I and Dave Sabatini and all

470
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,240
the people who live in mTOR land. I'm not putting myself in the same category as you guys, but you

471
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,840
know what I mean? I'm an mTOR fan boy. Why was that such an interesting and landmark paper? Well,

472
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:36,400
I think it's because up until that point, the only human application for rapamycin was immune

473
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,560
suppression, right? That's right. Rapamycin is a drug I have known about forever because as a

474
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,520
surgical resident, I was giving rapamycin to kidney transplant patients, heart transplant patients,

475
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,240
and liver transplant patients, along with a cocktail of cyclosporine, you know, prednisone,

476
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:01,200
MMF, all of these other really nasty drugs. And it was one part of that in their ability to suppress

477
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,720
the immune system. So I think prior to that paper, you have the ITP that the first ITP that came out

478
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,960
in 09 suggesting this is a remarkable tool for longevity, at least in the ITP mice. But then on

479
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,160
the other hand, you're saying, wow, but it can't really work in humans because it's going to be

480
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,200
really horrible to the immune system. So you had this sort of dialectical dilemma, which all of a

481
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,880
sudden it became, well, maybe that's not the case. So how do you reconcile the data that we saw in

482
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:43,600
Joan's paper with the fact that rapamycin is at least in theory an immune suppressor as it

483
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,160
pertains to organ transplantation? Yeah, and I think you know, you're absolutely right. That was

484
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:55,760
one important aspect of that paper. And I unfortunately think that the old view, which

485
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,080
in my room is the wrong view that rapamycin is an immunosuppressant, still is prevalent in the

486
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,400
clinical community. I think most clinicians still think of rapamycin and rappalogs as immune

487
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,280
suppressants because that's often how they're used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection.

488
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,280
So I think the simple answer is it's all about dose dummy. I mean, we know every drug has a

489
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,200
dose response, right? And that you can get different effects, different outcomes, different side effects

490
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:33,040
depending on the dose. And so when you back off on the dose of rapamycin or everolimus,

491
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,000
in the context of an aged physiology. So there's multiple things going on here in that study.

492
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,600
They used lower doses, they tested once weekly dosing, and these are old people who show a

493
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,240
functional decline. You're not going to see a functional improvement in vaccine response if

494
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,880
you did this experiment in young people, right? You're only going to see it in the context of

495
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,200
older people where they already have a functional deficit. And that's, again, it's an important

496
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,840
conceptual point that I think often gets lost in these discussions. The other thing to appreciate

497
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:11,600
about how rapamycin has been used traditionally and how it was first approved is these are

498
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,680
people who had an organ transplant, right? Taking high doses of the drug and also, I think always,

499
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,360
I'm not an organ transplant physician, but my impression is these people are always taking other

500
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,840
immune suppressants in combination with mTOR inhibitors. So in that context, yes, it does seem

501
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,760
to be the case that mTOR inhibitors can help reduce the chance of organ rejection in transplant

502
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,360
patients. I could be wrong. I think there's preclinical data. I don't know of any

503
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:50,960
strong clinical data that by itself, rapamycin, even at higher doses, has substantial immune

504
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,280
suppressing effects. It might, it wouldn't shock me if it does at high doses, but I don't know that

505
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,520
that's really ever been shown clearly in healthy people taking higher doses of the drug.

506
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, that's interesting. I don't think I've ever gone back and looked at the FDA approval process

507
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,800
in 99 because obviously it was approved for that use. And I think that's the only use that it's

508
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,760
been approved for. So I wonder what trials led to that approval, whatever trials would have taken

509
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,960
in the mid-90s. Yeah, I don't recall. Another point that I think is worth making is, and I'm

510
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,400
as guilty of this as anybody else, we use broad terms when we're talking about the immune system,

511
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,560
suppression, lower function. We say the immune system doesn't function as well in older people

512
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,360
as compared to younger people, which is true. But I think when we say it doesn't function as well,

513
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,600
we tend to think of as it's functioning at a lower level. There's just less activation,

514
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,120
which actually isn't necessarily the case. In old mice, in old people, there's a lot of immune

515
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:00,400
activation that shouldn't be happening. There's a lot of sterile inflammation that's occurring.

516
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,600
So it's not necessarily that the immune system is functioning less, it's functioning inappropriately.

517
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,040
And I think there's a ton of evidence that many of the benefits that we see in mice

518
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
from rapamycin occur because it tamps down on that sterile inflammation that goes along with

519
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,680
aging, the inappropriate activation of the immune system. So in that sense, you could think of it as

520
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,400
an immune suppressant. But through mechanisms that I don't understand at all, and I don't think

521
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:41,120
anybody really understands, it seems to be more effective at targeting the bad part of the

522
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,280
aberrant immune response in an aged physiology, which might be the reason why you're able to then

523
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,640
have more of the good part. And here I'm clearly showing my ignorance of immunology because I'm

524
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,720
referring to it as bad and good. But I think in some ways it's useful to think about it at that

525
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,680
level because it's easier to appreciate that immune function isn't intrinsically good or bad.

526
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,800
And there are different types of immune responses. And if you get the

527
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,040
wrong type of the immune response at the wrong time, that's bad. If you get the right type of

528
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,800
immune response when you need it, that's good. And I think in the context of aging, we just see

529
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,680
a lot more of the bad and probably a decline in function of the good. And I don't know if

530
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,240
rapamycin is affecting both of those, but I think it's definitely affecting the bad and bringing

531
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,280
it back down, which might just be enough to allow the good to come back up where it's supposed to.

532
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,600
Yeah, which look, I think that's a great point to make. And it's very similar with reactive oxygen

533
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,720
species, right? I mean, you have to have them. They are vital signaling molecules. And yet if

534
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:53,440
they run amok, they cause damage. And so, yeah, a lot of biology is in the Goldilocks framework of

535
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,520
not too much, not too little. Yeah. Can I just throw one more thing out there as well,

536
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,800
which is, and this is, again, I'll admit, if you'd asked me 15 years ago, like how important did I

537
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,040
think that, you know, chronic inflammation and immune function would be in aging, I probably

538
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,480
would have said, you know, I don't know, but my guess is it's not going to be the major player,

539
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,720
right? Because, you know, my background came from working in yeast and worms, which, you know,

540
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,080
worms sort of have an immune system, but not really, right? I would have pointed to things like

541
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,840
translation and autophagy and mitochondria, all of which are clearly important for affecting

542
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,200
inflammation and immune function. But I wasn't really bullish on inflammaging at that point.

543
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:37,600
And I have become very bullish on inflammaging as, you know, critically important for many of the

544
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,880
functional declines and diseases of aging that we see in people. The point that I want to make here

545
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,200
is that maybe I shouldn't say every, all of the interventions that I know about that I'm

546
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:57,040
enthusiastic about translationally seem to hit inflammation in mice and they seem to tamp down

547
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,200
on, you know, the chronic sterile inflammatory signaling that we see go along with aging, which

548
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,960
makes sense. It's encouraging, right? That they all seem to have this shared mechanism.

549
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,640
But the flip side of that is people talk a lot about, people are very excited now about,

550
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,960
you know, senolytics or reprogramming now is the new, the new senolytics, right? It's the

551
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,760
thing everybody's excited about. I'm not sure that those are fundamentally different from

552
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,080
rapamycin in terms of the way that they're working. And I think we obviously we need to find out

553
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,480
because, you know, it would be nice to know whether combinations of these interventions

554
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:40,160
are going to do better than one alone. But to me, the underlying theme that seems to be similar

555
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:46,560
about all of these things that work in mice is if you look in tissues of aged mice at, you know,

556
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:53,760
inflammatory cytokines, P16, P21, markers of senescence, they seem to be tamped down by all

557
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,960
of these, these interventions, which might explain the functional improvements that we see from,

558
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,480
from using these interventions in age mice. Yeah, I think that's actually a really interesting

559
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:15,520
point. And I would kind of say I'm in the same boat. I have become probably more convinced at

560
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,400
the importance of inflammation, certainly in Alzheimer's disease and certainly in atherosclerosis

561
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:32,560
because I've seen enough people who either develop these conditions without otherwise clear

562
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,200
reasons for it and vice versa, right? People who do have other risk factors and don't go on to

563
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,560
develop, but have, you know, at least have a demonstrably low measured amount of inflammation.

564
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,120
Again, the question becomes, do you target, is there a direct target of inflammation or do you

565
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:57,520
simply reduce inflammation by targeting these other mechanisms, which we'll get to. Let's go

566
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:05,600
back to the everolomous progression. You were just about to talk about RTB101. So what is that

567
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:13,040
and how is that the next stage in the evolution of this Rapalogue? Right. So there was the first

568
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:18,000
phase two trial was done. They hit their endpoint. It looked like it worked and they didn't see any,

569
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,760
I mean, this was a phase two trial. So the important thing was they didn't really see any

570
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,160
substantial adverse effects as well. Right. So then for the next trial, they added in another

571
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:39,680
drug called RTB101, which is one of these drugs that hits multiple kinases in the cell. So mTOR

572
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:45,040
is a kinase, which, you know, means it's biochemical activity is to put phosphate groups on other

573
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,320
proteins, but you can think of it as a signaling sort of activity, right? So it, mTOR

574
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,600
senses the environment and regulates the output based on this signaling function of being a kinase.

575
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:04,400
This drug, RTB101, inhibits mTOR, the catalytic activity of mTOR. It also inhibits other kinases.

576
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,800
So it's talked about as sort of a dual kinase inhibitor, but in reality it hits multiple

577
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,760
kinases. So it's a dirtier drug. That's maybe the way that the point to make it. It's a dirtier drug

578
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,080
than rapamycin, which has a very specific biochemical effect on mTOR and mTORC1 specifically,

579
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:26,240
which we haven't, we haven't dove into the mTORC1 versus mTORC2 situation. And was the rationale

580
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,320
for using a dirtier drug simply to create a new drug to have a molecule that is novel and therefore

581
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,320
protectable by IP? Or was it designed to be dirtier without thinking of it as being dirtier,

582
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:45,840
but thinking of it as being sort of a pluripotent across several kinases? Yeah. So I wasn't, I

583
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,040
obviously wasn't involved in designing this trial. So I can't, I can't answer that question as to what

584
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:58,480
the, what exactly their thought process was. I think it is true that RTB101 has a, had had and has

585
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,080
a longer existing patent life than ever Aligna. So there is that component certainly to, to,

586
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:10,720
to moving a drug through the approval process. And if you talk to Joan, she will tell you that

587
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:18,800
they had unpublished data that RTB101, if the doses that they were using in this trial appears

588
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:25,680
to be specific for mTORC1 like rapamycin. So I think their thought process, I mean, in reality,

589
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,280
it was probably twofold, right? The IP life was greater and, and there's a biological rationale

590
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,920
for testing RTB101 either alone or in combination with ever Aligna. And so that was really the

591
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:45,520
design of the phase two trial was one, it was, it was structurally very similar to the, to the first

592
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:52,720
phase two trial, right? So you have older adults, same sort of age range. I think they had to be 65.

593
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,280
They couldn't have a pre-existing age-related condition, significant age-related condition.

594
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,400
They had a control placebo arm, ever Aligna alone, RTB101 alone, and both. And, and I'll be honest

595
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:11,040
with you, I don't remember the dosing on the RTB101. And so they looked at vaccine response.

596
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:18,960
And then they also looked at, in this study, upper respiratory tract infections over the next season

597
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,480
to look beyond just, you know, if there's an impact of the mTOR inhibitor on immune function,

598
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,880
is it specific to vaccines or does it look like it's broadly boosting immune function? And again,

599
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,400
I think you can, you know, you can look at the data and, and not be completely convinced,

600
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,680
but certainly for the ever Aligna's plus RTB101 and the RTB101 alone group,

601
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,040
I think the ever Aligna's alone group in this case didn't reach statistical significance,

602
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,440
but for the combination and the RTB101 alone group, they saw improved vaccine response. And I think

603
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,960
what was really striking was a lower risk of upper respiratory tract infection in the people

604
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,960
who'd gotten the mTOR inhibitor over the next season. So that suggested that not only is it

605
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,400
boosting vaccine response, but it's also broadly conferring protection against a variety of, of

606
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,280
immune challenges in this, this older population. And again, very, very little in the way of adverse

607
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,240
events, which, which gets back to the point, you know, you hear people talk about how mTOR inhibitors,

608
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,560
you know, you could never use them for aging and people, because the side effects are so bad.

609
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,520
And it, you know, it just gets frustrating over and over and over again to say,

610
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,840
go read the data, you know, go look at the data, right? That's just not true at the doses that,

611
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,320
that, you know, have been tested so far. It's just, that's just blatantly false, right? There's

612
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:49,440
no evidence actually for significant side effects from rapamycin monotherapy, ever Aligna's monotherapy,

613
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,200
or RTB 101, at the doses that people are talking about using in this context.

614
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,480
Yeah. I mean, statins have far, far greater side effects than rapamycin. I know.

615
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,800
I mean, it's not even close. And, you know, I think statins are a very important type of drug,

616
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,240
but, you know, I mean, to think that, to think how ubiquitous they are and that we accept, hey,

617
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,280
10% of people, I mean, I think the literature says 5%, but really clinically 10% of people

618
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,240
have debilitating muscle aches from statins that, you know, render it impossible to take them.

619
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,000
People, some people have elevated liver function tests that are otherwise unexplained. I mean,

620
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,760
yeah, it is, it is really frustrating for me to hear this, especially when people talk about

621
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,160
how, well, we could never really study rapamycin because, you know, it's just too

622
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,120
unsafe. It's like, I, I'm not sure what data you're pointing to, but when, when you have it,

623
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:47,600
let me know. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. So anyways, so that, so that was the second phase two trial,

624
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:54,720
which was successful. So then they went on to a phase three trial to, to hopefully get FDA

625
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:01,200
approval for improving vaccine response and immune function in elderly people. And in that phase

626
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,680
three trial, I'm trying to remember what they called that. They think they called it. I don't,

627
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,040
I don't remember the trial, but now what was rad 001? What was that agent? That's ever a limus.

628
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,440
That's the same. That's what they were calling ever a limus. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yeah. And they had

629
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,120
a name for the, all clinical trials have names. They had a name. I don't remember what it was,

630
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:24,960
but, but in that phase three clinical trial, they only tested RTB 101. So they, they took out

631
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:34,880
the rapalogue ever a limus and only tested RTB 101. So there was no rad 001 plus RTB 101. Okay.

632
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:40,640
That's right. No combination, no individual, a rapalogue. That's right. And that clinical trial

633
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,320
failed to hit the end point and it was, it was terminated halfway through. So they,

634
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:52,560
this is my understanding. They, they were going to do one group in the fall season and one group

635
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,720
in the spring season or something like that. And they got halfway through, they weren't hitting

636
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:03,360
their end point. So they terminated the trial early and, and then RTB 101 or sorry, Restore

637
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Bio was the company that was doing this clinical trial to try to, to move RTB 101 through to

638
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:18,000
approval. They, the board basically merged them with a, with a CAR T cell therapy cancer company.

639
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,880
And they gave up on RTB 101 because of the failed clinical trial. So, you know, why that clinical

640
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:32,320
trial failed, I think still the data has not seen the light of day yet. I don't think there,

641
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,440
yeah, I don't think it's come out yet. So, so we don't know for sure what happened. I think,

642
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,720
you know, we can observe that the Rapalog wasn't in there anymore, right? That is one difference

643
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,560
between the two successful trials and the one that failed. And I believe Joan has talked about this

644
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:55,040
publicly that, that, that they also in conversations with the FDA were required to change the end point

645
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,480
from laboratory confirmed infections, right? That, that was the prior, that was the,

646
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,920
that was the end point. One of the end points in the phase two trial to something else, which

647
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,680
involved owner reported, or not owner, sorry, thinking about dog trials here, patient reported

648
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,160
symptoms as the end point and they didn't hit it. And so I think that, I think my understanding

649
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,160
from talking to Joan is that data will come out at some point and, you know, we'll be able to really

650
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,240
take a look and, and see, you know, what the drug was doing and what it, what it wasn't doing in that

651
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,880
third clinical trial. My intuition is that it probably worked and they probably got screwed

652
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:41,440
by being forced to change the end point of that clinical trial. And if that's the case,

653
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,120
then I think, you know, we really do need to have a conversation around the way that FDA, I mean,

654
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:53,840
we need to have this conversation anyway, but the way that FDA is approaching clinical trials

655
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:06,560
in the, the aging space, right? What, what needs to be shown for an appropriate end point

656
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:15,360
and what is the acceptable level of risk when the, the goal of the trial is to test whether or not

657
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:21,520
an intervention is affecting a functional decline that goes along with aging or aging itself,

658
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,600
right? And that's a, that's a bigger question. I certainly have plenty of thoughts around that. I

659
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:30,480
know there are lots of people in the field who are thinking about this and working on it. And some

660
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,000
have talked to FDA. It's a, it's a real challenge. And I think, I think that, and I don't want to

661
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,640
blame anything on FDA, right? I think that they are, the people at FDA want to do their jobs to

662
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,760
the best of their ability. I think there are constraints around the way that FDA is required

663
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:59,680
to work and the culture that does not in my view appropriately evaluate risk reward, right? I think

664
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:08,880
that there is a culture of, you know, the risk has to be extremely low in people who are of normal

665
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,560
health status for their age. I actually am trying very hard. I still slip, but I'm trying very hard

666
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:22,560
not to use the word healthy when we talk about aging or older people. I'm relatively healthy

667
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:29,040
for my age. I would say I'm probably in the top 10% health-wise for my age group. I am not as

668
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:34,320
healthy as I was 20 years ago. We already talked about this, right? So I'm a, you know, normal to

669
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:41,040
upper health status for my age, but I would not call a 65 year old, a typical 65 or 70 year old

670
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,320
healthy. They're not, they're functionally impaired. And we really need, we being, you know,

671
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:53,760
the regulators, society, policymakers, you know, really need, I think, to start taking a realistic

672
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:02,800
look at what normal aging is, right? It is a progressive, chronic decline in function

673
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,680
that at some point will lead to overt disease and with 100% probability will lead to death,

674
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:16,640
right? And so if we can intervene in that process to slow it down or reverse it,

675
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,760
there should be some level of risk that is acceptable for that potential outcome. And I

676
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:29,200
think that because we tend to think of 65, 70 year olds as healthy as opposed to functionally

677
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,200
impaired, it makes it really hard to have a rational discussion around what the appropriate

678
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:40,080
level of risk is. Matt, I think that is so astonishingly well said. And I've had so many

679
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:46,800
discussions with NIR and to a lesser extent, Steve Osted about the choice of metformin over

680
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:53,840
rapamycin in tame. And it always comes back to this point, which is the regulators will absolutely

681
01:08:53,840 --> 01:09:02,000
positively not consider rapamycin, which of course comes back to this question, which is what are we

682
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:09,840
claiming to be studying and in whom? The other thing is the studies are being designed around

683
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:16,640
disease, progression of disease or outcomes of disease. So this really comes back to a broader

684
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:25,040
theme, which is where are we on the spectrum of understanding aging in the way that you're

685
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:32,320
defining it and getting it further away from the discrete definition that involves a disease?

686
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:39,360
Because until we really get people to center around that, your very eloquent explanation

687
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:48,240
of there being no such thing as a healthy 70 year old, until we realize that at the regulatory level,

688
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:53,200
right? At the policy level, even at the scientific level, it's going to be very difficult to study

689
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:58,720
the things that will have an opportunity to give step function changes in longevity.

690
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah. So let me start by pushing back on what you said about tame and metformin versus rapamycin,

691
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,360
because I think that's a myth that regulators would not allow you to do a clinical trial with

692
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,440
rapamycin, right? We just talked about three clinical trials that were done with mTOR inhibitors,

693
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,440
two of which were with everilimus, right? Which is essentially rapamycin. So I think that is

694
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,840
talked about as to why metformin was chosen for tame. I don't think that is true. And I don't

695
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:37,040
actually think that is the reason at all. I think that the FDA regulators- I push. I needle near

696
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,400
constantly about it. Well, I mean, honestly, I think there are good reasons why metformin

697
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,400
makes sense to test in that context, and there's data in people that support that. So I'm not

698
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,360
trying to say they should have used rapamycin. I think that people with expertise in the field

699
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,640
can come to differing opinions as to what the best shot on goal is, I guess is the way I would put it.

700
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,760
You're just saying, let's say we picked rapamycin. Let's just say we picked metformin because of

701
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,640
these reasons, but not because we thought that rapa wouldn't be safe enough, or the regulators

702
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:13,040
themselves would decline it. Yeah, I think they'd let you do the trial. Obviously, they would pay

703
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,000
attention to adverse events, and there would be concerns around adverse events, but they would

704
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,560
certainly let you do the trial, and that's been proven, right? I mean, Rest for Bio did the trial,

705
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,240
right? And it wasn't because of adverse events that it got shut down. I think that's the other

706
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:34,560
important point to make. I think the regulators at FDA are doing the best job that they can within

707
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:41,280
the constraints of how they are required to regulate drugs. I have a real problem with the

708
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,840
way we regulate drugs in this country, but I don't necessarily blame it on the people at FDA.

709
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,840
And I do think if you came to them with a clinical trial where you had an end point

710
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,920
that was quantitative and functional and related to quality of life in people,

711
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,440
they would let you do that clinical trial with rapamycin. I'm 100% certain of that.

712
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,200
The challenge is, I think the reason why this hasn't happened, one, rapamycin's off patent,

713
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:15,040
nobody's going to make money off of it. And two, there is a misplaced concern about side effects,

714
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,640
which we've already talked about. It's just not reality that the risk is significant at doses of

715
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,920
rapamycin that would be tested. So I think the real challenge though is identifying the right

716
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,360
end points for a clinical trial in aging. You're not going to do lifespan in people. We can do

717
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,720
it in dogs. You're not going to do it in people. I think we just have to accept that.

718
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,840
So what is the right approach? I don't even want to say the right approach because I don't think

719
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:47,360
there's one, but what are some approaches that one might consider if your goal is to move FDA

720
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:54,720
towards approving a drug in people of normal health status to prevent age-related functional

721
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,760
declines in disease, to target aging. That's what I mean when I say prevent age-related

722
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,120
functional declines in disease to target aging. So if your goal is to get there,

723
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:10,160
so what does that clinical trial look like? So the TAME trial is a specific example of one strategy,

724
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:15,840
which is to take people who already have one age-related disease and ask whether your intervention,

725
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,920
metformin in this case, can delay the onset of the second age-related disease. It's a comorbidity

726
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,880
trial. That makes a lot of sense because we know with pretty good precision how long that time

727
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,400
frame is on average from the first age-related disease to the second age-related disease. And so

728
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:40,480
you can quantitatively assess does your intervention increase that length of time. That's the rationale

729
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:48,640
behind TAME. In my personal view, the limitation of that approach is it's not a true healthy aging

730
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,520
study, right? It's not taking people who are who are of normal health status for their age and asking

731
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,480
whether the intervention can improve or extend the healthy period of life, right? So it's a

732
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:08,640
different design, but I totally get why that's TAME was designed that way. And I like the design. I

733
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,240
think there's a reasonable chance it'll work, but it's different from the way I would think about

734
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:22,640
a clinical trial in this space. What I would do is I would try to identify the best single endpoint

735
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,880
or set of endpoints that correspond to a significant functional deficit that impacts

736
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:38,320
quality of life in older people and assess whether or not my intervention improves that. And optimally

737
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,000
that endpoint would have quantitative markers that you could measure, right? To show that you've

738
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,520
improved it. So RestorBio went with immune function and they went with vaccine response initially and

739
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,360
then ultimately I think in the phase three trial they were also looking at respiratory tract

740
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:01,040
infections over the next season. That was their endpoint. It's quantitative. The problem is it's

741
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,160
really hard, right? It's a really noisy endpoint and I'm not at all criticizing them. In fact, I

742
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:11,360
think as you know, Joan Manick is one of my favorite people. She's a good friend. I have

743
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,160
an amazing amount of respect for her. I think they went for it and for reasons that were probably

744
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:21,680
beyond their control, that clinical trial failed. But I have so much respect for what they tried to

745
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:27,360
do. I'm just saying it's a tough clinical trial. It's a tough endpoint. It's noisy. I think there

746
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:35,040
are other endpoints that you could consider that might not be as noisy, right? That you could

747
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:40,960
consider doing a clinical trial for. So one of my favorites at this moment is periodontal disease.

748
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,640
And that's because my lab has published that aged mice get periodontal disease, that

749
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,440
eight weeks of treatment with rapamycin reverses the clinically defining features of periodontal

750
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:59,040
disease in mice. We know that something like two-thirds of older adults have periodontal disease

751
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,160
or will get it. And those who have periodontal disease are at higher risk for dementia,

752
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:10,480
cardiovascular disease, diabetes. So it's connected in some way to other age-related diseases.

753
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:18,000
And by the way, a recent podcast of mine explored this topic and it may in fact be causally related

754
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,200
through that inflammatory axis, right? I mean, I think that's probably the strongest line of

755
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:30,560
evidence connecting oral disease with systemic disease. It's through this immune inflammatory

756
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,920
pathway. So I think that's actually an elegant approach. So the reason why I like periodontal

757
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,960
disease, right, is the endpoints are extremely quantitative, right? So what we looked at in the

758
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,240
mice are gingival inflammation, bone around the teeth, which can be measured, you know,

759
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:52,800
crudely by pocket depth, more quantitatively by x-ray, and microbiome. That's really the,

760
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,840
at least in my understanding, I'm not a dentist, but I've learned a lot about oral health over the

761
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,800
last few years. That's my understanding of, you know, if you have gingival inflammation, you've

762
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,120
lost enough bone around the teeth, you don't even have to have the dysregulation of the oral

763
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,040
microbiome, but it always goes along with it. You've got periodontal disease, right? So there

764
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,880
are nice quantitative endpoints that can be looked at in people and it's extremely non-invasive,

765
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,720
right? The way that you do this clinical trial is you have people come in for a dental exam,

766
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:30,400
right, before and after treatment. So you've got a shot at seeing changes in quantitative endpoints

767
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:37,120
that we can not just delay, but actually reverse the declines in mice in people, you know, in a

768
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,720
reasonable timeframe. So you could easily imagine something similar to the structure of the Restore

769
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:48,240
Bio trial with Rapamycin or Everolimus or RTB101 or, you know, pick your favorite intervention,

770
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,080
where you treat people for eight weeks, three months, you know, they have a dental exam before,

771
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,760
a dental exam after, a dental exam six months later, and you just look and see what was the

772
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,640
impact of the intervention. So it's a pretty straightforward clinical trial. And, you know,

773
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,080
I think we're going to, I hope we will get this off the ground. We're actually trying to get some

774
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:14,000
funding to do a clinical trial now. This is, I should say, in humans or in dogs? In people,

775
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,520
yeah, in people. And this is really, the person who deserves all the credit for this crystallizing,

776
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:27,680
in my mind, is a gentleman named Jonathan Ahn, who was a DDS PhD student. So he had already got his

777
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:32,400
dental degree. He did his PhD with me. And he, you know, before he came to my lab, he came to me

778
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,960
one, one day, vividly remember this conversation because I had never thought about oral health.

779
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,720
And he goes, you know, people get periodontal disease when they get older in much the same

780
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,640
way that people get Alzheimer's disease or heart disease. If you look at the risk profile as a

781
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,440
function of age, it looks strikingly similar to these other age-related diseases. You know, what

782
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,240
do you think maybe the biology of aging is contributing? And, you know, in hindsight,

783
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,600
it's like, oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense. But I had never thought about that before.

784
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,760
And so he came to my lab and showed that we could do this in mice. We could see age-related

785
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,320
periodontal disease. We could see bone loss around the teeth. We could see inflammation of the gums.

786
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,160
And that we could reverse that with rapamycin. And so he's actually now a faculty member

787
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,240
at the University of Washington. And he's really the one who's trying to push this clinical trial

788
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:25,280
forward. So I'm sort of peripherally involved, but John is really the guy in this space. He's

789
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,480
going to be a rock star. And this would be a phase two? Yes, right. What's the approximate

790
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,080
budget for this study? I mean, we're just submitting the grant now. So I don't know,

791
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,880
you know, it's very early, right? What would be the budget for this study?

792
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,000
So it's going to be a three-year grant. You know, I don't know. I think it's R01 size,

793
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,200
couple hundred thousand a year over three years. Okay. If money were no object,

794
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,640
what secondary endpoints would you add to that study? In other words, if you could power this

795
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,880
study to hit that as your primary, but also go after multiple secondaries, let's just throw in

796
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:05,760
immune function. There'd be no reason not to repeat what was done with RAD 001. What else would you

797
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,160
add to that? Right. So if you look at the mouse data, I mean, I think the mouse data is,

798
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,240
it's a reasonable place to start. Again, obviously mice aren't people, but it's a reasonable place to

799
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:22,320
start. So where does rapamycin reverse functional declines associated with aging?

800
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,440
Hearing, right? Wasn't there that study that just came out? Yeah, just came out two weeks ago.

801
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,880
Absolutely. It reversed age-related hearing loss, which I, that was, that got me very excited.

802
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,480
Yeah, I agree. So that, and that's again, a very easy and quantitative endpoint, right? Wouldn't

803
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,800
it be amazing if you could improve age-related hearing loss with rapamycin? And so that's a

804
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,080
no-brainer immune function. I mean, I agree if money was no option, sure. But, but even in the

805
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,520
context of a, you know, let's say the periodontal disease clinical trial that I talked about,

806
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,480
if you could also measure hearing in that clinical trial, right? It's a big bang for the buck, right?

807
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,560
It costs you almost nothing. And you get potentially another endpoint that you could hit on.

808
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,800
Where else? So muscle function, there's pretty good evidence that at least rapamycin can prevent

809
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,440
sarcopenia. I don't think there's a lot of data yet on improvements in muscle function, but you

810
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,640
could do things like, you know, grip strength, walk speed, things like that. Cognitive function,

811
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,200
that's hard. Again, that's, I put that in the sort of the same category as immune function as an

812
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,720
endpoint. It's a tough endpoint, but it would certainly be interesting to look at cognitive

813
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,520
function in this elderly population of normal health status. So some of these people are going

814
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,480
to be on the road to dementia. They won't have dementia yet because that's an entrance criteria

815
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:46,320
to get into the trial. Heart function, it's another place where we see reversal of age-related

816
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:52,400
declines. This would be hard. So this is a different clinical trial, but also potentially

817
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:58,720
cool. Reproductive function, you wouldn't do that in that same patient population, probably.

818
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:03,760
But in mice, there's pretty good evidence that you can reverse, at least in females,

819
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,720
reproductive declines that go along with aging or at least delay them. Let's just pause on that

820
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:17,920
for a second, Matt. That is staggering when you consider where we are today from a standpoint of

821
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:25,840
reproductive medicine, right? Yeah. Women are having children later and later. And I can't tell

822
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,160
you the number of just patients in my practice, either male or female, for whom this isn't a top

823
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:40,000
of mind priority. It's simply unbelievable. And to think that there would be a... I never really

824
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,080
had thought of this, honestly, because I don't think I've paid attention to that subset of the

825
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:51,440
Rapa mice in literature. If you were to... And again, this is guessing, but how much of an impact

826
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:59,120
do you think you could have? So if you had a woman who was 40 years old, who's been... She's obviously

827
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:08,800
still pre-menopausal, but her AMH is low and or it's reasonable, but she's got significant

828
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:15,840
aneuploidy for the listener, meaning whenever her eggs are produced, they don't evenly divide

829
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,600
into the right number of chromosomes. So they don't show up with one of each chromosome. And

830
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:26,800
that's an enormous cause of infertility as a woman ages is this aneuploidy. So they either omit

831
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:34,320
a chromosome or include two and those almost universally lead to an early miscarriage. Some

832
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:43,520
of them like try some 13 or 21 will make it. Do you have a sense of what type of magnitude

833
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,480
of an effect this could have? I think the honest answer is no. So I think there's a couple of

834
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,560
things to say on this. One is there's not a lot. There've been, I think, two or three studies in

835
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:58,000
mice looking at this, right? And so there's not a lot of data on magnitude of effect,

836
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:08,640
even in mice. So my guess is that in people... So I don't even want to comment on magnitude of

837
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:14,160
effects. I really don't know. I think the way that you would design a clinical trial though

838
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:19,440
would be very similar to what we've talked about with rapid mycin already with the immune function

839
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:27,920
or periodontal disease. You would take a woman premenopausal, let's say early 40s,

840
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:35,600
a group of women and do eight weeks of treatment, right? And then a washout. And then you could

841
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,120
look at your endpoints or if they are going through IVF, for example, right? Look and see

842
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:46,880
whether or not you get an improvement in outcome using that functional measure.

843
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,640
I would... I think that's the way I would say...

844
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,840
Do we really believe that that would be a sufficient amount of time? I mean,

845
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,920
are we just coming up with eight weeks because that's where we saw the vaccine response

846
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:04,960
in the Evrolimus trial? If you were shooting for the moon and cost were not an issue,

847
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,040
what would be the downside of longer treatment?

848
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:14,080
Well, a couple of things, right? So one is increased risk of side effects, right? I mean,

849
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,440
I think that's one... The longer you go with any treatment, the more risk there is for an

850
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,440
adverse event, even though I think the risks are pretty low. And the other is, I think...

851
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,840
Here's a really interesting piece of data that we don't have with the immune function studies in

852
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,280
mice or people. In all of those studies, the treatment was stopped.

853
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:33,920
That's right.

854
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,080
And then there was a two week or so period before the vaccine was given.

855
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,000
So what was the rationale for that washout?

856
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,720
I think it's because people think and thought about rapamycin as an immune suppressant,

857
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,960
right? So that you might... And this is where I was going with that. What we don't know is if

858
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,760
they were still taking the drug, would you have gotten the same effects for immune function?

859
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,160
I don't know. So it's an important question that I think we just don't know the answer to.

860
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,400
But the other risk is that at least for some of your functional measures, if it requires,

861
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:13,040
let's say, hyperactivation of mTOR to get the response, you might impair that by doing

862
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,880
continued treatment with rapamycin. And at least all of the data that I've seen,

863
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:24,080
limited in people, extensive in mice, eight weeks is enough to give you essentially that

864
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,720
full benefit for whatever the functional output is that you're looking at.

865
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:34,880
Maybe not for lifespan, right? Maybe multiple eight week transient interventions would be

866
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,040
better than one. The only thing that I know of for data there is our study where we did three

867
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:44,560
months of rapamycin treatment between 20 and 23 months of age, and then let them go to the end of

868
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:50,320
life. The magnitude of effect was pretty similar to what the ITP saw. So it was reasonably close

869
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:56,400
to continuing treatment, but we don't know. But eight weeks in mice is... What would that be

870
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,160
in humans, right? Yeah, I know where you're going with that. If you were to linearly extrapolate

871
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:08,320
that, that would be a few years, right? And I agree with that. I think that the immune trials

872
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:14,000
that we've talked about suggest that that might be long enough. But I agree. We don't know is the

873
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,040
answer. I'll just say, so I haven't talked about my experience with rapamycin, and I really don't

874
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:26,800
talk about this publicly, but I'll do it here. So I've tried eight to 10 week courses of rapamycin

875
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:34,560
a couple of times. The most recent time, it was because this was probably spring of 2019. So I'm

876
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,840
pretty active. I play softball in the spring, and I noticed I had a lot of shoulder pain. And by

877
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,080
the end of the season, it was to the point where I couldn't throw a football. I couldn't go play

878
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:50,320
catch with my son. Actually, that's one of the hardest personal aging experiences I had,

879
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:55,280
was when we went across the street to the park and I was going to play catch with my son, and I

880
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:00,640
couldn't do it because my shoulder hurts so much. It was my right shoulder. And I thought I must have

881
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:07,440
a rotator cuff tear. I went in to see the specialist. Finally got diagnosed with frozen

882
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:13,040
shoulder, which is inflammation of the shoulder capsule, which happens to some people as they get

883
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,640
older. Extremely painful, completely limited my range of motion. And the doctor was like, well,

884
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:23,760
I could give you a shot of cortisol, but I don't really recommend it. That can degrade the cartilage.

885
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,400
Really, there's not a lot you can do. Some people, it goes away after a year. Some people just, you

886
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,240
just learn to live with it. And I was pretty depressed by that diagnosis, right? I was like,

887
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,320
at least if it was a rotator cuff tear, I could get surgery, get it fixed. So I go home and I'm

888
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,440
sitting there and I'm thinking, so I'm looking on the internet and I see, okay, it's an inflammation

889
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,400
of the shoulder capsule. I'm thinking to myself, what do I know that has anti-inflammatory effects,

890
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:51,840
you know, in the context of aging, right? Rapamycin. So I got some rapamycin and I did

891
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,480
eight weeks. And I mean, again, placebo effect is real, but this was so painful.

892
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,840
I don't believe it was placebo effect. Within two weeks, I had probably half my range of motion back.

893
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:09,600
Within eight weeks, I was back 95%. And were you just taking, were you just dosing once a week?

894
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,440
Once a week, eight migs once a week. Yeah. I mean, I couldn't do this two years ago, right? Because

895
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:21,520
it hurts so much, right? And now it doesn't hurt at all. Within eight weeks, and I want to be careful

896
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,560
because I want to say I'm not encouraging other people to go do this, but I am a true believer

897
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,200
after that experience, right? I don't think it's placebo effect. I don't see how it could be with

898
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,400
how painful it was, how real the limitations were on range of motion. So that goes to this

899
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:43,440
eight week question, at least for that indication, which I believe this was a real effect, eight weeks

900
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,520
was plenty and it hasn't come back, right? Which actually kind of makes sense with frozen shoulder.

901
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:53,760
I think when people recover from it, it doesn't always come back. So I think that again, a lot of

902
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:02,880
these age related conditions that are inflammatory driven, you can kind of reset that with an eight

903
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,080
week treatment and rapamycin. I suspect senolytics, if we had good senolytics, would do pretty much

904
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:13,600
the same thing. Do you think that rapamycin is itself a senolytic? I don't think it's a senolytic

905
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:18,080
in the sense that at least the classical way people have thought about senolytics where it

906
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:24,160
kills the senescent cell. I absolutely think it turns down the chronic inflammatory signaling

907
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:30,720
that is driven by P16, P21, NF-kappa-B. Yes, we see that in mice, multiple tissues, no question

908
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:37,680
about it. I also, I still think the senescence field is a little bit messy in the terminology.

909
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:44,320
I think a lot of what people call senescence isn't truly being derived from senescent cells,

910
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:53,120
the way that we think about them. It's P16, P21 mediated inflammatory cytokines, right?

911
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:58,320
Doesn't necessarily have to come from senescent cells. No question. Rapamycin shuts that off and

912
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:02,560
it shuts it off within eight weeks, at least in mice in a lot of tissues. And do you think it's

913
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,520
doing that independent of what it's doing at the mTOR or do you think that it's doing that through

914
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:13,040
mTOR? I would be shocked if it's not doing that through mTOR. I don't know of any good evidence

915
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:19,520
that rapamycin has off-target effects that aren't through mTOR. Yeah. Okay. And so really it's these

916
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:26,720
sasps getting whacked. That is how it would act through via the senescent pathway as opposed to

917
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,560
targeting a senescent cell directly. That's by the way, that's been my reading of the literature.

918
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,880
Would you agree with that? Yeah, it's really, I think that's right. I think in some way it shuts

919
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:40,960
off those chronic inflammatory signals. The secretories. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe other

920
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,400
stuff, right? I mean, we always look at the sass because that's what we know. I mean, I think

921
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:48,560
this is natural in science. We look under the lamp post. We measure what we know to measure,

922
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:56,160
right? It would not shock me at all if there are other things that go along with the canonical

923
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,440
sass that senolytics or rapamycin or caloric restriction. I think that's a big part of

924
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,480
fasting. Fasting does the same thing, right? Tamps down on that chronic inflammatory signaling,

925
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:15,120
maybe through mTOR, maybe through other mechanisms. So I think that what we know about is part of it.

926
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:19,120
It wouldn't shock me if there were things we don't know about yet that also are contributing. Yeah.

927
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:23,920
But getting back to this eight week, right? That's how we got started. So I tend to think based on my

928
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,120
personal experience and the little bit of data from these two clinical trials, that that's probably

929
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:35,200
long enough for at least some endpoints that are driven primarily by immune dysregulation

930
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:42,160
and chronic inflammation. Yeah. I think two and a half years ago when I started, I was very strict

931
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:49,600
about eight on six off, eight on six off, eight on six off. And I don't know, a little while ago,

932
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:56,720
I just sort of said, yeah, I'm just not coming off. And I wish I had a biomarker to point to.

933
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:04,960
I wish I had some way of measuring whether this is the right thing to do or if eight four, eight

934
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,400
four, eight four. There's a symmetry to eight five because you'll get through exactly four cycles a

935
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:16,160
year. Maybe I do eight five, eight five, eight five, eight five. But it really frustrates me that

936
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:21,680
we don't have a biomarker for this. Yeah. Or aging in general. Yeah. For aging in general. So let's

937
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,880
talk a little bit about that. So what does that look like? I mean, when I had Eileen White on the

938
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:32,240
podcast, gosh, it's been maybe a year and a half now, we had a really interesting discussion about

939
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:38,320
why we don't even have biomarkers for autophagy. I mean, something that is so important and we

940
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:43,840
can't measure it. And this was important in the context of people who choose to calorically

941
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:53,680
restrict or fast, is fasting for a day long enough to generate a meaningful amount of autophagy in

942
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:58,560
a human, in a mouse it clearly is, but in a human is it? No idea. It's two days, three days, seven

943
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,680
days. Seven days is almost assuredly enough. It's a big difference between fasting for a day and

944
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:09,040
fasting for seven days. Why don't we have biomarkers for that? Why don't we have a biomarker that can

945
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,840
assess nutrient sensing better? Why don't we have a, I mean, you could argue we have some biomarkers,

946
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,240
we can measure telomere length, but you know my feelings on this, Matt, I'm in the camp that

947
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:22,800
thinks measuring telomere length is not helpful at all for aging. And I think there's plenty of

948
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,240
data to suggest that while telomere length is a very important marker of cellular division,

949
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:36,080
it really speaks very little about the organisms state of aging. Despite the popularity of that

950
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:42,080
biomarker, even the epigenetic clocks I don't find to be helpful. I find them to be far too,

951
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:47,440
and I'd like you to push back on this if you feel as much, but I've seen how easily they can be

952
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,520
manipulated by short-term interventions that don't seem biologically relevant.

953
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,480
Yeah, so I think I'll start with the epigenetic clock because everybody, that's a big, you know,

954
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,080
let's explain to people what that is. Let's start from the beginning. Assume people don't know what

955
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:09,040
an epigenetic clock is. Right, so the epigenetic clock refers to typically chemical marks on DNA

956
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,800
that regulate gene expression, whether or not, you know, the gene that is located at specific points

957
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:20,960
in your genome gets turned on or off. And what has been observed is that those marks change

958
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,600
with age in pretty much every organism where it's been studied, and that you can identify

959
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:32,080
patterns of change at specific locations in the genome. So specific changes in these chemical

960
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:41,600
marks with age that correlate very strongly with chronological age. And so that has led to the

961
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:48,640
idea that you can create clocks that look at specific changes in chemical marks in the

962
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:56,080
DNA, the genome, that are telling you something about how long that organism has been alive.

963
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,080
And then what sort of has emerged from that is that there may be, there are two things that have

964
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:08,720
emerged from that. One is you may be able to use that chronological aging clock to find individuals

965
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:14,160
whose marks don't fall on the line that you would expect it to fall on based on their chronological

966
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:18,800
age. In other words, you know, they have marks that make them look older or younger than their

967
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:25,760
chronological age says that they are. And so you might, you would hypothesize that those individuals

968
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:31,920
biologically, if those marks are really reflecting biological age, might be aging more slowly or more

969
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:37,520
quickly. And what's been shown is that indeed those individuals who tend to be off the line,

970
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:42,400
depending on whether they seem to be aging more slowly or more quickly, are at lower or higher

971
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:49,680
risk for specific diseases. So that adds some level of confidence that this epigenetic clock,

972
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:56,720
chronological epigenetic aging clock, is actually reflecting biological age. And so the idea is maybe

973
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:04,080
we can use that information to develop epigenetic clocks that will, in a predictive way, tell you

974
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,960
how old you are biologically, right? So you can get tests now, there are plenty of companies now

975
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,600
that are selling these things, where you can go buy your epigenetic blood test. Mostly this has

976
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,920
been done in blood cells. That's one limitation to think about is almost all of the literature in

977
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,560
humans is developed on epigenetic clocks from blood. And it's still, I think, a little bit of

978
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:28,560
a question, you know, what if the, even if this is reflecting biological age, it's the biological age

979
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:33,920
of your blood, which may or may not reflect the biological age of your entire body. But you can

980
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,160
buy tests now that based on your, you give them some of your blood, they will tell you your

981
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,960
epigenetic biological age or some number. So they're looking at PBMC, I assume?

982
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:52,240
I don't know. Honestly, I'm not involved in any of this stuff. So I don't know exactly what, yes,

983
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:58,720
most of the studies that have been published are PBMCs. They may even have saliva tests now. I don't

984
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:02,880
know, honestly, how these commercial companies are doing it. I mean, some of the clocks I've seen

985
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,920
where I've just immediately discounted them is when some of their inputs are things like glucose

986
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,240
level, vitamin D level, which are things that vary so much from day to day. And by the way,

987
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:16,400
are so easy to manipulate. Like you can take a vitamin D supplement or not take a vitamin D

988
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:21,440
supplement. You can, you know, have a high cortisol spike one morning and your glucose is

989
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:27,440
110 versus have a good sleep the night before and your glucose is 95. So something that's that

990
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:35,360
malleable, I just don't think makes sense as an ironclad marker of true biologic age.

991
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,080
Yeah. So let me take a step back. So the epigenetic clocks are probably the one that

992
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,800
people talk about the most and have gotten the most traction in the field. And I'm not,

993
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,360
I guess I'm a little bit of a skeptic, but I mean, I believe these clocks,

994
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:55,840
I believe the data and I believe that the correlations are extremely strong. I'm a

995
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:04,160
little bit worried still that there are so many data points in the epigenome that you can find

996
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:10,240
a pattern that will fit anything you go looking for. And that, so I'm a little bit worried about

997
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:16,720
the dimensionality of the data and whether or not, you know, it's pattern matching in some cases

998
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:23,360
rather than it's really truly going to be a robust predictor of biological age.

999
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:28,560
That probably reflects what is admittedly, you know, my limited understanding of the

1000
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:34,320
mathematics behind a lot of the epigenetic clocks that have been built. So I don't view that as a

1001
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:38,720
strong criticism. It's just a personal sort of concern that I have. So you're basically saying

1002
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:45,840
without doing the complex mathematics to correct for so many, the multiple looks that you can take

1003
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:52,240
at the data, you could be tricked. And I have not spent enough time looking at that either.

1004
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:56,800
I would like to have Steve Horvath on the podcast at some point, because I think Steve could speak

1005
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,680
to that probably better than anyone else. He's the expert. Yeah. So that's, but the other, the other

1006
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:06,880
point I wanted to make is what you alluded to is now what people are doing is going beyond the

1007
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,360
epigenetic clocks to try to look at every possible thing you could measure, sometimes combining that

1008
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,600
with the epigenetic clock to build these super clocks or multi-clocks or multi-omic clocks.

1009
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:21,920
Right. And I think there's huge power in that. But it also increases that dimensionality problem.

1010
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,120
I just mentioned, because, you know, all of a sudden now you've got, if you're doing omics

1011
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:32,160
stuff, you've got tens of thousands of additional data points that you can measure and you can fit

1012
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:38,080
a pattern where a lot of this, and I think, I think even Steve and other people who are in the

1013
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:44,720
epigenetic clock field would agree with this, where a lot of this has yet to really mature is in

1014
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:51,040
getting us to biological explanations for what the patterns are telling us, right? What genes

1015
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:59,520
are they that these, these marks are located at and are those in any way causal for, you know,

1016
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,840
biological aging. So I think if you get to the point where you can understand mechanism,

1017
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,080
it's going to be much more powerful. I also think though, this gets to the fundamental

1018
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:15,520
challenge with biomarkers. And I think this is where you're dissatisfied. We have a lot of

1019
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,960
biomarkers of aging. We just don't have any validated biomarkers of aging, right? And it's,

1020
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,040
and it's a, it's a real, this has been a problem, you know, since I was a graduate student,

1021
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,400
everybody's wanted biomarkers of aging. The, the NIA had a huge program where they, they did all

1022
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:35,120
this funding to identify biomarkers of aging. I think it was back in the eighties, maybe before

1023
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:42,000
my time nineties, maybe you can identify all sorts of things that correlate with age. How do you get

1024
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,080
to the point of convincing yourself first and other people second, that these things are actually

1025
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:56,160
telling you something about biological aging that can then be used to understand whether an

1026
01:41:56,160 --> 01:42:00,960
intervention is working first of all at the population level, but ultimately where we want

1027
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:07,280
to get to is at the individual level, right? So what we all want is a test that you can take

1028
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:13,920
and you can fast, you can do your fasting regimen. You can do your rapamycin, you can take metformin,

1029
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:20,000
whatever. And you can come back and find out, is it working from this set of biomarkers? And,

1030
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
and that's where we want to get to. And, and we're not there yet. I think everyone would agree.

1031
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:30,000
I'm not sure when we're going to get there. So who's the natural owner of getting there? Because,

1032
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,920
you know, I had this discussion with Steve Osted recently and he, he made the same point you did,

1033
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,560
which is, look, the NIA tried to do this a long time ago and, and, and tried, you know,

1034
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,880
validly, right? They put a lot of money into it. You could make the case that the technology

1035
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:50,320
simply wasn't mature enough to do this. 30, 30 years later, we have a lot more tools at our

1036
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:56,560
disposal, right? It's, it's, you've got, you've got the entire world of omics at your disposable.

1037
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:03,200
Plus you've got machine learning plus, plus, plus. Is there any reason this couldn't be done today?

1038
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:09,200
And if so, is this, this strikes me as a project that's almost too big for, for academics, right?

1039
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:14,960
Cause it's too disjointed, but at the same time, it's not a particularly interesting, um, commercial

1040
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:21,200
problem to solve because it's far too big an investment before you could get to why you would

1041
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:26,800
care about it, right? A commercial problem is give me a drug. Yeah. But I'm arguing you can't

1042
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:33,360
develop a drug really well without this. So who's like, there's a bit of a cart and a horse thing,

1043
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:41,120
which is someone's got to pony up a lot of money to develop the foundation of a pyramid that will

1044
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:47,520
ultimately become a great tool for drug discovery and, um, a much more streamlined manner in which

1045
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,960
we could do clinical trials around this. Yeah. So, so I think it, I think the answer to your question

1046
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,840
is it depends on whether you're talking about doing this pre-clinically or clinically, right?

1047
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,280
I actually think this is a problem that is. Don't you think it has to be done both?

1048
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:07,280
Well, eventually yes. It's, it's, it's a problem that can be solved today pre-clinically. Like

1049
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:14,720
there is no real barrier to doing what you just said. So multi-omic analysis of aging in mice

1050
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:22,080
with interventions, applying machine learning to identify patterns that predict the effect of

1051
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,560
interventions and individual outcomes for longevity. You obviously have to think a little

1052
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:33,040
bit about, you know, what, what can you measure? Um, if you want to do this longitudinally,

1053
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:38,400
right? You can't kill them, the animals, right? Uh, um, so you could, you're sort of restricted

1054
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:44,400
to blood, but so there are some practical aspects, but there's no, there's no technical barrier to,

1055
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:50,080
to doing that now. Who should do it? Who might be doing it? Right? Um, I mean, I think this would

1056
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:55,200
fall maybe in the realm of what Calico could do, right? They've got the resources, they've got the

1057
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:00,240
expertise. Is there any evidence that Calico is interested in this type of a problem? Um, I think

1058
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:04,240
so. I, I don't, I don't know. I don't honestly don't know anything about the inner workings of,

1059
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:10,080
of Calico these days. Um, I think conceptually they are interested in, in multi-omic signatures

1060
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:15,680
of different aging processes. I don't know if they've done this particular experiment. They

1061
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,920
certainly have the resources and expertise to do it. Um, they're not the only ones, but they're the

1062
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:26,880
first ones who come to mind and they sort of fit this space between true academia and industry,

1063
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,000
right? Where they're kind of, they're kind of this interesting beast in the middle. Um, so I think

1064
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,280
it could be done pre-clinically and you could actually then once you, let's just say you have

1065
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:40,240
this test, right? You get to the end of day, you say, okay, these are the most predictive,

1066
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:48,560
I don't know, whatever, 24 things that, that give you, you know, 95% confidence on remaining life,

1067
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:54,160
right? Or whatever, whatever your end point is. Um, then you, you get that test and then you show

1068
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:58,560
whether it works or not in an independent study. And if it does, I'd be pretty convinced, right? If

1069
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,120
you can show me that you create this test and then you go do a separate experiment and you can predict

1070
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:09,120
when the mice are six months old, how long they're going to live at an individual level, I'm impressed.

1071
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:13,280
And if you can show that this intervention, when you treat them, makes the signature go in the way

1072
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,280
that you think it should go and you can predict they're going to live 30% longer, I'm even more

1073
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:22,160
impressed. I'll believe it at that point. That's not easy, but I think it's doable. I think we know

1074
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:26,240
enough now and we've got enough things that we could measure that you could certainly, you could

1075
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:31,200
certainly build the test and then whether it would work in the validation step or not, I don't know,

1076
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:37,040
but I wouldn't, I think you could probably get it to work. Um, you can't take exactly that same

1077
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:41,120
approach to people. And this gets back to that, that they know the same issue that we talked about

1078
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:46,640
with clinical trials, right? It takes a long time to do the validation step and know that you have

1079
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:53,520
actually changed somebody's biological state so that as they get older, they are at lower risk

1080
01:46:53,520 --> 01:47:03,920
for disease and are likely to live some X% longer. So you're almost obligated to have some level, you

1081
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,680
have to have some level of faith in the test at that point, right? And I don't know, it's going to

1082
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:13,280
be different for everybody. And I honestly don't know what the regulatory step has to be, right?

1083
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,440
Before you could convince regulators that you can actually, you know, go out and tell the general

1084
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:25,280
public that this test works. Although I will say there are already people doing that and the

1085
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,440
regulators aren't doing anything about it as far as I can tell. So, you know, there you are.

1086
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:36,480
Let's come back to your dogs. We spoke about them at length, um, three years ago when we sat down to,

1087
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:43,040
to talk about rapamycin. But again, let's assume a clean slate and folks might not be familiar with

1088
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:50,480
some of your work specifically around dogs and how working with companion dogs, uh, offers many

1089
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:55,200
advantages over working in mice, beginning with some of the obvious, like they're far more

1090
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:01,280
genetically similar to us. They live in our environment. Um, and you know, they also seem

1091
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:07,680
to, to die of things that more closely replicate how we die. They die of heart failure. They die of

1092
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,240
cancer, but not the same type of cancer that a mouse gets. That's almost genetically predetermined.

1093
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:21,760
Yeah. So, um, so just to start from ground zero, uh, we, um, at the University of Washington and

1094
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:26,880
Texas A&M and at several other institutions have a large project called the Dog Aging Project.

1095
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:35,440
And so the goal of the Dog Aging Project, um, is really to understand the biology of aging in

1096
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:40,080
companion dogs or pet dogs. Some people, when I say companion, some people think I mean,

1097
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:44,480
you know, like, like seeing eye dogs or things like that. Yeah, no, pet dogs. Um,

1098
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:51,600
and there are really two aspects of this project. One is a large scale longitudinal study of aging,

1099
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:57,840
completely observational. The goal there is really just to understand what are the most important

1100
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:03,600
genetic and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs. And part of that, this is

1101
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:09,520
getting back to the conversation we just had, is to measure as much as we can about those dogs

1102
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:15,280
every year as they go through their lives, um, in order to be able to identify patterns,

1103
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:21,360
right, that are associated with health outcomes during aging, lifespan, disease incidents. Um,

1104
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,680
so in some respects, it's a similar approach as to what you would do if you wanted to create

1105
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:31,120
biomarkers of aging, right? Um, so that's the longitudinal study of aging. The second goal,

1106
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:35,600
and that, so one way to think about that is that's to try to understand aging in dogs.

1107
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:40,720
The second goal, and this is really where I'm, you know, focused, uh, uh, largely is to do

1108
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:48,160
something about it. So can we slow or reverse biological aging in pet dogs to increase healthy

1109
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:55,520
lifespan? And so that, um, ultimately I hope will be a series of veterinary clinical trials

1110
01:49:56,240 --> 01:50:03,600
to test interventions to figure out can we slow aging, reduce disease, and increase lifespan

1111
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,760
in pet dogs. The first clinical trial is with rapamycin. Um, and so that's our first shot on

1112
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,360
goal, uh, but I hope it won't be the only one. Um, and so you talked about, so why, why dogs,

1113
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:20,560
why pet dogs in particular? And I think you hit on, I think most of them, the most important,

1114
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,760
um, reasons, right? So they've got this really interesting and powerful genetic architecture.

1115
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:31,280
We have a couple hundred purebred breeds of dogs, which you can almost think of as inbred strains,

1116
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:37,120
right? And then on top of that, we have this mixed breed population. Um, and that's coupled with,

1117
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:42,560
with phenotypic diversity. So for almost any trait that you think about, dogs are more diverse

1118
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,440
than people are even. Body size is a really easy one. Everybody can just think about the difference

1119
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:53,280
between a great Dane and a Chihuahua. Um, so that combination of, of unique genetic architecture with,

1120
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:59,440
with phenotypic diversity is really powerful for mapping genotype onto specific traits. And

1121
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:05,680
lifespan is another case where you have this strong diversity, right? A great Dane will grow

1122
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:12,320
old and die, you know, maybe in eight to 10 years. Uh, whereas a Chihuahua often will live to be 16,

1123
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:18,080
17 years old. So, you know, we're talking a hundred percent difference in lifespan. Um,

1124
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:24,640
so that, so, so that's really powerful for mapping genotype onto lifespan. Uh,

1125
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:29,920
dogs share the human environment is, is another big one, right? And that's, that's for me, one of

1126
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:36,080
the most important because we cannot model that in the laboratory. In fact, we do exactly the

1127
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:42,160
opposite. We really try to limit variation in environment to extreme measures. Dogs share our

1128
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:47,600
environment with the exception of diet, share almost all aspects of the, of the human environment.

1129
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:53,440
And so that's a, a bridge in some ways between laboratory studies and, and human studies. And

1130
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:58,720
as I've already alluded to, they age more rapidly than we do. Their lifespan is substantially

1131
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:03,680
shorter. We all are familiar with the idea of one human year is about seven dog years, right?

1132
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:09,040
That's just another way of saying dogs age about seven times faster than people do. Um, that's,

1133
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,400
and we can talk about that. It's interesting. If you actually look at the epigenetic clock,

1134
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:17,360
it's not a linear seven time rate, but, but they, but I think it's close enough, right? It's close

1135
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:23,680
enough. Uh, and as you suggested, they age very similarly to the way that people do. They get

1136
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:28,880
essentially all of the same age related diseases and they're all age related and they show the

1137
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,920
same functional declines that people do. So dogs get arthritis as they get older, right? Uh, you,

1138
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,920
you know, an arthritis is, I guess it's a disease, but it's also starts as a functional decline,

1139
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,400
right? Anybody who's ever had an old dog, you will notice that your old dog doesn't move around as

1140
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:49,840
much. Doesn't walk as fast, right? So, so, so they are going through the same changes with aging at

1141
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,040
the functional level that we are. Again, it just happens seven to 10 times more quickly. So they're

1142
01:52:55,040 --> 01:53:01,200
very powerful animal in which to understand aging and test interventions for that reason.

1143
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:06,080
And you can do it in a timeframe that's, that's, you know, feasible. That's again, I think, you

1144
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:12,080
know, we've talked about the challenges with doing a clinical trial for lifespan in people, even if

1145
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,720
we believe metformin is going to extend lifespan in people, you're not going to do a clinical trial

1146
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:22,720
to prove that you can do that clinical trial in dogs. And so we've designed the, the rapamycin,

1147
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:28,080
the test of rapamycin in aging dogs or triad. That's, that's what we call our clinical trial.

1148
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:34,240
We've designed triad so that we'll be able, we'll be powered statistically powered to detect a 15%

1149
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:40,000
change in, in lifespan within a three year window, right? So we can do a three year clinical trial,

1150
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:45,760
reasonable cohort sizes to see an effect on lifespan that's comparable to what rapamycin

1151
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:52,000
does in mice. That's a pretty high bar, Matt. That's are you at all worried you've underpowered

1152
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,520
that given that you only have, and they're being administered the drug for the entire three years?

1153
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:09,600
No. So, so yes. Yes, I'm worried that the study is underpowered. I will say from my experience now

1154
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:14,160
we've done two safety clinical trials and this is our big clinical trial. So this is my third

1155
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:19,760
veterinary clinical trial. I've learned that there are many reasons to be concerned

1156
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,400
when you do a clinical trial. Clinical trials are a lot of guesswork. You have to take an educated

1157
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:29,840
guess about a lot of different things. You can't test every dose. You can't test every duration.

1158
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:36,080
You're, you know, you can't test, you know, an infinite number of study subjects. So I'm,

1159
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,880
I'm worried about this clinical trial for many reasons. I think we've done the best that we can,

1160
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:45,920
you know, given what we know and given the constraints that we have to work under

1161
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:53,440
to give ourselves a reasonable shot. 15% might be a high bar, but it, you know, it's,

1162
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:58,800
it's consistent with the lower end of what people see in mice. So the first study at the lower,

1163
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:05,440
low dose of rapamycin in mice from the ITP had a 14% effect, I think in females and a 9% effect in

1164
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:10,960
males. Subsequent studies at higher doses had larger effects. So do you expect to see a sex

1165
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:17,920
difference in dogs? I don't know. I don't know. So people still don't completely understand

1166
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:26,240
why female mice seems to respond to a given dose of rapamycin better than male mice. So it's

1167
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:32,160
correlated with blood levels. So I think the simple idea is that, that male mice either take up

1168
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:38,400
rapamycin less effectively or break it down more quickly. There's no evidence for that in dogs. We

1169
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:43,760
will be measuring rapamycin levels in the dogs. So we will see if there is a difference in blood

1170
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:49,760
concentration in females versus males from the limited data that we've got so far. We don't have

1171
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:54,400
any evidence that that's the case in dogs. And I don't know of any evidence in people that that's

1172
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:59,920
the case either. So that might be a mouse specific thing. I think there's this misperception that

1173
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:07,360
rapamycin works better in female mice than in male mice. That's not true. At a given dose,

1174
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:13,120
at a given plasma dose, we don't know if it's true, right? No, no. At a given dose in the food,

1175
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:18,480
at lower doses, females show a bigger lifespan extension. When you go to higher doses,

1176
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:24,480
the males catch up. And if you push it too far, you can actually find a dose where female mice,

1177
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,920
the lifespan extension starts to go back the other direction and male mice actually get a

1178
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:33,600
bigger lifespan extension. So I think it's more about effective concentration than it is a male

1179
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:40,560
versus female, truly sex specific response. And in the dogs, you give it daily in their food?

1180
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:46,960
No, no. So it's once a week. So this is a now, now, you know, guesswork, right? What's the best

1181
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:53,280
way to do it? Now we're back into the alchemy. Yeah. So we've tested three times a week and once

1182
01:56:53,280 --> 01:57:00,800
a week, and we decided to go with once a week for triad. And, you know, it's a guess.

1183
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,880
And how many migs per Kig are they getting? Is it one dose?

1184
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:13,360
0.15 migs per Kig once a week. And that was based on our observations from 0.05 migs per Kig,

1185
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,880
three times a week. Yeah. That's how we get, you know, 0.05 times three.

1186
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:22,960
So let's talk about what might be going on in the ITPs, which I've had Rich Miller on.

1187
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:27,840
Let me just come back first to the dog study. Because I want to make another point, which is

1188
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:33,120
that you asked if I was concerned about being underpowered for a 15% lifespan effect. So lifespan

1189
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:39,040
is our primary endpoint, right? Which is important because I think this is the first clinical trial

1190
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:46,560
that has lifespan, you know, in a healthy or normal health status population as the endpoint.

1191
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,400
I will say also, it's funny, because I get pushback from clinical people, you can't call

1192
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:56,320
this a clinical trial. It's just in dogs. It's not in people. And I just simply respond that

1193
01:57:56,320 --> 01:58:00,960
a veterinary clinic is a clinic. It's a veterinary clinical trial. But it is a clinical trial. And I

1194
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,440
think this is the first clinical trial with lifespan as the endpoint. I don't know if you can

1195
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:09,760
hear my dog. I can. I can actually stop sparking. No, no, it's funny. It's totally appropriate that

1196
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:15,200
as we're talking about dogs, we can hear the environment. So the point I want to make though

1197
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:20,240
is that lifespan is our primary endpoint, but we are tracking multiple secondary endpoints to

1198
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:26,800
give us a picture of is rapamycin broadly impacting the aging process. So we're looking

1199
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:33,040
every six months, the dogs get echocardiograms to look at heart function. The dogs will be fitted

1200
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:38,160
with activity monitors periodically to look at spontaneous activity. Every six months, the dogs

1201
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:43,520
will get cognitive assessments to look at cognitive function. We're getting blood chemistry, serum

1202
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:49,120
metabolome, fecal microbiome, and of course, we'll be tracking disease incidence as these dogs get

1203
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:55,920
older. So, you know, over this three year window, I hope that even if we don't see that magnitude of

1204
01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:01,680
lifespan extension, and we don't reach statistical significance, if there is a broad effect on

1205
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:09,600
multiple age related outcomes that we will be able to detect changes in other secondary endpoints.

1206
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:13,600
What's the sample size? You're going to have two groups, placebo versus dose.

1207
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:21,520
Right. Half placebo, half treatment. The goal, the intention is to randomize 350 dogs equally split

1208
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:26,880
between the two groups. So 175 of each. And do you know roughly if you had gone with a 10%

1209
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,400
effect size, how many that would have required? How many more?

1210
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:34,720
I don't recall off top of my head. I think probably around 500. Yeah.

1211
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:42,000
In your previous work, you had already got a sense of what was happening in animals with heart

1212
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,000
failure. Remind people a little bit about that if they don't remember the first episode.

1213
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:53,680
Sure. So there's really good data. Three, at least three, maybe four now,

1214
01:59:54,320 --> 02:00:00,400
studies from different labs in mice showing that if you look at age related declines in heart

1215
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:06,240
function, particularly left ventricular function, so several measures of left ventricular function,

1216
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:12,000
decline with age, that eight to 10 weeks of rapamycin is enough to reverse those changes

1217
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,720
and make the young heart by echocardiography look functionally like a, make the old heart look like

1218
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:25,520
a young heart. There's also data in mouse models of a few different types of heart failure. So

1219
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:31,680
dilated cardiomyopathy is work that we've done in particular, where you can reverse dilated

1220
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:38,480
cardiomyopathy in mice with rapamycin treatment. So I think there's really strong evidence in mice.

1221
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:45,440
In our first clinical trial, which was, it was designed to really only be a safety trial. There

1222
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:52,720
were 24 dogs. 16 got rapamycin, eight got the placebo, but we had the dogs also get echocardiograms

1223
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:58,080
before and after the treatment period. And in that study, there were statistically significant

1224
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:04,000
improvements in two measures, two of the three measures of left ventricular function by

1225
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:09,360
echocardiography in the dogs that got rapamycin compared to the placebo. What was, I think,

1226
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:17,360
to me most interesting in that data was that the improvements that we saw were exclusively found

1227
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:22,480
in the dogs that came in with lower function. Now, one thing to note is none of these dogs

1228
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:27,520
had functioned so low that it would be clinically diagnosed as heart failure. So,

1229
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:35,280
it was normal age-related declines in function, and it was exclusively the dogs with the lowest

1230
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:41,120
function that showed the improvements from rapamycin. That is an interesting observation,

1231
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,360
which my gut feeling is real. Again, a small cohort, so I don't want to make it out to be

1232
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:54,880
stronger than it is, but it also is intuitive. We know that individuals have individual

1233
02:01:54,880 --> 02:02:01,200
trajectories of aging and develop a unique spectrum of functional declines. It makes sense

1234
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:06,800
that some of these interventions that are restoring function would primarily be effective

1235
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:12,720
in people who've lost function. That's just intuitive. So, I think that's probably what we'll

1236
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:19,200
see in our long-term study in triad, where we follow the dogs for three years,

1237
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:25,600
is that there's going to be variation at baseline, and it might be the case that those

1238
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:30,160
individuals that have the lowest function at baseline are the ones that are going to see the

1239
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:36,080
biggest benefit, if there is a benefit at all. Now, in triad, will you be trying to create

1240
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:43,280
somewhat of a homogeneous sample in size? By that, I mean the size of the dogs, or are you going to

1241
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:51,040
be completely heterogeneous with respect to the size of the animal? And also, what is the age of

1242
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:55,360
the animal? What are the exclusion criteria around the age on either end, lower high?

1243
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,000
Age, they have to be at least seven years old to come into the study, so that'd be middle-aged.

1244
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:09,600
We do have a size range, so the dogs have to be between 40 and 100 pounds to be randomized into

1245
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:14,640
the study. So, it's not for little dogs? That's right. And the reason for that is not because we

1246
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:19,120
have any reason to think rapamycin will work differently, or better, or worse than little dogs.

1247
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:24,000
It's because big dogs age faster than small dogs. Let me come back to that in a minute, because that

1248
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:31,040
might not be an oversimplification. But they certainly live shorter than small dogs and develop

1249
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:37,120
many age-related diseases and functional declines at an accelerated rate compared to small dogs. So,

1250
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:43,600
we need a population that's already middle-aged and that will be aging rapidly to be able to

1251
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:49,520
see potential benefits from rapamycin in the time frame of this study. And that was all factored

1252
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:56,000
into the power calculations, the demography of dogs in that age and weight range. I said that

1253
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,880
it may not be completely accurate to say that big dogs age more rapidly than small dogs, because

1254
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,560
there's a growing body of evidence, which we have some preliminary data in support of as well,

1255
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:13,200
that for brain aging and cognitive function, that might not be the case. That the rate of

1256
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:21,360
cognitive decline in big dogs looks, from a chronological sense, very, very similar to small

1257
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:27,680
dogs. Even though the big dogs are dying at an earlier age, they don't seem to show accelerated

1258
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,440
cognitive decline, which is interesting. And I think there's a little bit of data

1259
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:39,280
in people, although obviously people don't show the same diversity in body size that dogs do,

1260
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:45,040
so that's harder to see. It doesn't really seem to be the case that accelerated aging due to

1261
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:50,080
increased body size is reflected in brain aging. And the mechanisms there might turn out to be

1262
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:56,160
really interesting. So, just an observation that I've noticed recently and I think might be important.

1263
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:05,280
You're using once a week dosing. Explain to people, because we just mentioned it briefly and then said

1264
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:12,560
we'd come back to it now, we're going to bifurcate mTOR into mTOR complex 1, mTOR complex 2, give

1265
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:19,520
people a sense of how those function and why it, on the one hand, is leading you to do what you're

1266
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:26,240
doing, me to do what I'm doing, and why in some ways it makes it a little bit interesting why the

1267
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:31,200
ITP found what it did with daily dosing. Let's tie all of that together, but first with an explanation

1268
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:38,400
of how mTOR works. Sure. So, mTOR of course is a protein, it's a kinase, we already talked about

1269
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:49,440
that, but it acts in a complex with other partner proteins. And so the mTOR protein acts in at least

1270
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:56,800
two, I think there's only two that we know of, two different complexes called mTOR complex 1 or mTORC1

1271
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:04,560
and mTOR complex 2 or mTORC2. And the difference between those complexes is that they have different

1272
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,600
partner proteins for mTOR. So there are a couple of things that are the same across both complexes,

1273
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:16,320
and then there are a set of partner proteins that are unique. And the two complexes do functionally

1274
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:25,920
different things in the cell. So mTOR complex 1 is largely thought of as the mTOR complex that

1275
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:32,160
is most responsive to nutrient levels. So when nutrient signals are low, that leads to lower

1276
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:39,760
mTOR complex 1 activity, and mTOR complex 1 downstream is known to regulate things like autophagy,

1277
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:49,040
mRNA translation, effects on metabolism. And mTOR complex 2 does different things. And I think we

1278
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:55,520
know a lot about what mTOR complex 1 does. We know much less about what mTOR complex 2 does, although

1279
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:01,200
people are studying that and learning more and more about what mTOR complex 2 does. From the

1280
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:08,640
perspective of aging biology, people have focused almost exclusively on mTOR complex 1. There's a

1281
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:13,680
little bit of data on C. elegans on mTOR complex 2 affecting lifespan. But outside of C. elegans,

1282
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:23,200
almost all of the data for rapamycin or mTOR as a regulator of aging is thought to be mediated by

1283
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:28,320
inhibition or reduced signaling through mTOR complex 1. So that's what people almost always

1284
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:35,920
think about when they think about effects of mTOR on aging. And rapamycin as a drug, biochemically,

1285
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:42,080
is a specific inhibitor of mTOR complex 1. So the way rapamycin works is it actually,

1286
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:48,960
it's a small molecule that binds to another protein called FKBP12 or FPR1 in yeast. And once

1287
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:57,360
rapamycin binds to FKBP12, that complex of rapamycin with FKBP12 goes to mTOR complex 1,

1288
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:01,920
and you can think of it as sort of just messing it up, breaks it apart. So it inhibits mTOR complex 1

1289
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:08,880
when rapamycin is bind to FKBP12. So biochemically, rapamycin is an extremely clean drug,

1290
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:14,160
and that as far as I know, and I haven't really seen any good data otherwise, there's no direct

1291
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:21,120
inhibitory effect of rapamycin on anything other than mTOR complex 1. What people have observed

1292
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:30,480
is that chronic long-term inhibition of mTOR complex 1 can have feedback effects on mTOR complex 2.

1293
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:35,680
And it's kind of confusing because there's actually some data both directions that chronic

1294
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:42,000
inhibition of mTOR complex 1 can lead to activation of mTOR complex 2 in some context. Mostly, I think

1295
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,040
the data supports the idea that chronic inhibition of mTOR complex 1 with rapamycin can lead to

1296
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:54,000
inhibition of mTOR complex 2 in the long term. And that's definitely true in mice at higher doses of

1297
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:03,120
rapamycin. At lower doses of rapamycin, it's not completely clear to me how much effect on mTOR

1298
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:08,080
complex 2 there is. So the reason why that's interesting from the perspective of aging is

1299
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:13,040
I just said that almost all of the data for lifespan at least is that it's inhibition of

1300
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:18,640
mTOR complex 1 that leads to lifespan extension. Work from David Sabatini and Dudley Lamming when

1301
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:25,760
he was in David's lab led to the development of a model which I think is still the sort of preferred

1302
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:31,840
model. I will say up front, I think it's at least partly wrong, but it's the preferred model which

1303
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:37,520
is that the side effects associated with rapamycin, particularly the metabolic side effects associated

1304
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:44,480
with rapamycin, are due to this chronic effect of inhibiting mTOR complex 2. So people will talk

1305
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:51,040
about rapamycin as if it induces something like diabetes, a pseudo-diabetes. And this is true in

1306
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:56,320
mice. There's evidence for it in humans as well that chronic long-term treatment with rapamycin

1307
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:02,480
leads to glucose intolerance. So if you give a mouse who's been on rapamycin for a year,

1308
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:08,880
glucose tolerance test, they will not clear that glucose as rapidly as a mouse that never saw

1309
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:15,600
rapamycin. And the model is that that's due to the chronic effects of rapamycin on mTOR complex 2.

1310
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:20,960
Most of the evidence in support of that model comes from genetic experiments with mTOR complex

1311
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:27,920
2 deficient mice. So I have yet to see a really clean experiment showing that that's what accounts

1312
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:33,280
for the rapamycin effects on glucose tolerance. I think it's a reasonable model. In other words,

1313
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:39,360
that evidence comes from creating genetic mice where you manipulate mTOR quantum mTOR2

1314
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:45,760
rather than experiments where you give them mice rapamycin. I didn't ask Rich Miller this question

1315
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:51,600
because I'm pretty sure the answer is they didn't do it. But in all of the ITPs where the animals

1316
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:58,000
are getting rapamycin every single day, did they see impaired glucose tolerance despite longer life?

1317
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,320
Yeah, my recollection is they did not look, but there have been other studies,

1318
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:08,800
I think mostly in the C57 Black 6J mouse strain. So that's a different strain than the ITP,

1319
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:13,920
we don't need to get into it, but it's a different genetic background. But in the C57

1320
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:22,480
background, you do see the same changes in glucose tolerance test at the 42 part per million for sure

1321
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:30,480
rapamycin dose. So the higher ITP dose in older mice. So I think it's a real effect. I think you

1322
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:34,400
see that effect with rapamycin. And like I said, there's evidence in organ transplant patients

1323
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:39,680
for impaired glucose homeostasis as well. So I think it's a real effect. There's a couple of

1324
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:45,280
things that I actually, my intuition is it probably is due to mTORC2. I don't have any

1325
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:50,640
reason to doubt that. I just don't think it's been shown cleanly that that's the mechanism.

1326
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:55,520
Where I differ a little bit, certainly from Dudley, I'm not sure what David's view on this

1327
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:01,440
is right now. Where I differ from Dudley's interpretation is that I am less convinced

1328
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:09,840
that these effects that we see for glucose homeostasis are bad. I think there's at least

1329
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:16,160
as much likelihood that what this really reflects is an underlying change in metabolism

1330
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:21,360
that might actually account for part of the beneficial effects of rapamycin, where they

1331
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:27,360
shift away from primarily relying on glucose as the preferred carbon source and switch over to

1332
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:34,320
fat metabolism and maybe even ketogenesis to some extent. And in that context, so it's a different

1333
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:40,560
physiological metabolic state. In that context, when you challenge them with a non-physiological

1334
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:46,720
amount of glucose, they don't respond the same way. So I don't know that it's actually a defect

1335
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:53,440
in glucose homeostasis. I think it may reflect the test that's done. And in some ways it's an

1336
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:59,280
artifact of that test that you get a different response, which is in the context of diabetes

1337
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:04,560
would be interpreted as a bad response. It might just reflect a different underlying physiological

1338
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:12,080
state. And I haven't seen anybody really try to address that. And what makes me believe that

1339
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:18,640
might be the case is we and others have seen that rapamycin treatment has pretty profound effects on

1340
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:28,320
fat mobilization, fat metabolism, adipogenesis, and at higher doses, ketogenesis. And so it would

1341
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:34,400
not surprise me at all if that metabolic adaptation accounts for some of the beneficial

1342
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:41,280
effects of rapamycin and is also leading to this apparent, aberrant response to a glucose tolerance

1343
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:46,800
test. Yeah, it's interesting. I've spoken with one other physician who uses rapamycin, although he

1344
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:54,160
uses it very liberally in many of his patients. I think his patients are coming in much older and

1345
02:13:54,240 --> 02:14:01,120
much more metabolically deranged. And the results that he's seeing in an uncontrolled manner,

1346
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:05,600
meaning you simply have no idea what the performance effect of rapamycin is. So when

1347
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:10,960
you give it to somebody who's expecting to get better, they may go and change many other behaviors.

1348
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:18,080
But he's shared with me some of his data and it's quite profound, right? So triglycerides falling

1349
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:27,200
from unhealthy levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter to 70 milligrams per deciliter. And

1350
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:30,720
actually they're seeing the opposite, right? They're seeing improved glucose homeostasis.

1351
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:36,080
Again, these are people starting who are prediabetic and in some cases diabetic.

1352
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:41,520
And I think your point's a fair one about oral glucose tolerance tests are very unnatural.

1353
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:49,200
And you can see a physiologic insulin resistance when you do them on people who are either calorie

1354
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:55,040
restricted or carbohydrate restricted because that initial form of muscle insulin resistance is

1355
02:14:55,040 --> 02:15:02,560
actually a protective element there. So all of that said, you've decided to go with once a week

1356
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:10,160
rather than daily, despite all of the other animal models that have shown great success with

1357
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:16,480
daily dosing. Is that a hedge? Yeah, so there's a couple... I don't know if I would define it as a

1358
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:24,480
hedge. I mean, I think that... So the rationale there is both based on the human data, which

1359
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:30,880
again is limited, right? But we've talked about the daily versus weekly dosing for immune function.

1360
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:35,120
And again, we've also talked about why I think that readouts of immune function

1361
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:40,560
are probably telling us about the underlying inflammatory state, which I think is a big part

1362
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:48,960
of what rapamycin is doing. So that is suggestive that weekly dosing is at least as good as daily

1363
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:55,760
dosing. And it's also suggestive that weekly dosing has fewer side effects. And because this

1364
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,360
is a challenge with human clinical trials, as we've already talked about, it's also something

1365
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:04,800
you have to be absolutely aware of when you're talking about doing a clinical trial in

1366
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:10,480
companion dogs, right? These are people's pets. There is an extremely, rightly so, an extremely

1367
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:15,200
low tolerance for significant side effects when we're talking about people's pets, right? I love

1368
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:21,600
my dog and I would be devastated if I hurt anybody else's dog in this clinical trial.

1369
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:27,040
So you want to do everything you can to reduce the likelihood of side effects. And there's reason to

1370
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:34,000
believe that once weekly dosing is likely to have fewer side effects. And there's also the pragmatic

1371
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:40,480
aspect of, we're asking owners to give this medication to their dog in the context of a

1372
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:48,000
clinical trial. We expect that there will be better compliance and fewer mistakes with once a week

1373
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:57,200
dosing versus daily dosing or three times a week. So let's pivot a bit from Rapa to Torin 2. You

1374
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,360
recently, you and I have shared a couple of emails on this topic. Tell people a little

1375
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:09,600
bit about what that is and why you're excited. Right. So Torin 2 is a different version of an

1376
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:14,640
mTOR inhibitor. So we just talked about mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2 and how Rapamycin,

1377
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:22,720
at least biochemically, is a specific inhibitor of mTOR complex 1. Torin 2 is what's called a

1378
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:28,240
catalytic inhibitor or an ATP competitive inhibitor of mTOR, which at least in theory-

1379
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:29,760
Versus what we call allosteric.

1380
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:35,040
Allosteric inhibitor, which is Rapamycin, meaning it interacts not through the catalytic site. Yes.

1381
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:43,280
At least in theory, Torin 2 and Torin 1 and other catalytic inhibitors will equally inhibit both

1382
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:51,520
mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2. And for reasons that I still am not sure about,

1383
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:59,840
as far as I know, nobody has tested Torin 2, Torin 1, other catalytic inhibitors

1384
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,080
for effects on aging in mice. It seems like an obvious-

1385
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:06,080
Why is this not-

1386
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:10,240
Yeah, this seems like something that needs to be submitted to ITP tomorrow, right? Or at

1387
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,280
least for the next cycle.

1388
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:18,160
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why it hasn't been done, to be honest with you. And maybe it has

1389
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:23,120
and I just haven't seen the data. That certainly is possible. But I don't know of any data, not

1390
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,600
just for lifespan, but for other functional measures of aging. I don't know of any data.

1391
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:35,200
So I don't know that I would say I'm- I can tell you why I think there's additional reason to test

1392
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:42,320
it beyond the rationale that seems obvious. But I don't know that I would say I'm excited about

1393
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:48,400
Torin 2. It seems like an obvious gap in knowledge and would be actually a nice way to test the

1394
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:53,440
question we were talking about previously of Torque 1 versus Torque 2, good, bad, right? All of that

1395
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:59,200
stuff. It seems like an important set of experiments to do. And as far as I know, nobody's done it.

1396
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,640
So part of the reason, additional reason why I think it's an interesting set of experiments to do

1397
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:10,320
is, in addition to studying aging, my lab also works on mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial

1398
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:16,960
disease. And we have worked for many years in a mouse model of a childhood mitochondrial disease

1399
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:22,960
called Lee syndrome. So this mouse is defective in complex one of the electron transport chain

1400
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:28,880
of the mitochondria. And it is very short-lived. It lives about 55, 60 days. And it develops

1401
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:36,880
many of the same molecular phenotypes and neurological phenotypes as kids who have

1402
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:41,920
Lee syndrome, this childhood mitochondrial disease. And these children typically live how long?

1403
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:48,720
It's variable onset, but it's anywhere from infants to eight, nine years old. Typically,

1404
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:54,880
kids with Lee syndrome don't make it to be teenagers. It's a horrible, horrible disorder.

1405
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:01,360
So we found out many years ago that rapamycin could roughly double or triple the survival of

1406
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:06,560
these mice and basically prevent the neurodegeneration and brain lesions that

1407
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:11,360
are thought to limit lifespan in both the mice and the kids with Lee syndrome.

1408
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:18,320
And presumably, Matt, that's because when you knock out complex one, you're destroying oxidative

1409
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:24,240
phosphorylation. And presumably, the neurons are going to be the most sensitive to that.

1410
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:25,360
Yeah.

1411
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:25,840
Is that the thinking?

1412
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:30,000
It's an interesting question. We don't really know. I mean, I'll tell you the sort of current

1413
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:36,240
thinking in the field. So first thing is to recognize is this particular component of complex

1414
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:43,840
one is an accessory stabilizing factor. So the mice are not 100% deficient in complex one. They

1415
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:48,160
have a low level of complex one. I think you'd probably be dead if you didn't have any complex

1416
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:54,400
one. And the same thing is true in the patients. So it's a deficiency in complex one. And you're

1417
02:20:54,480 --> 02:21:01,200
right. So one idea, there are actually several reasons why being deficient in complex one

1418
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:07,040
could be a problem. One could be you just can't generate enough ATP and neurons or a subset of

1419
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:11,760
neurons are particularly sensitive. Another could be that you're generating high levels of reactive

1420
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:20,000
oxygen species. We know subsets of neurons are especially sensitive to that. And you could come

1421
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,800
up. There's also an inflammatory component to this disease where we see a lot of neuroinflammation in

1422
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:30,480
the brain regions where the lesions occur. So we don't quite understand what's causing that

1423
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:36,320
inflammation. So there are multiple ways that this could be causing the symptoms of the disease.

1424
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:44,240
An interesting body of work from Vamsee Mutha's lab and Isha Jane, who was in his lab and now has

1425
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:51,360
her own lab, shows that hypoxia can also rescue these mice. And hypoxia actually rescues these

1426
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:58,320
mice to a greater extent than rapamycin. So that at least is consistent with an oxidative stress

1427
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:04,080
model. So one idea would be that when you're deficient in complex one, those neurons are not

1428
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:09,520
using as much oxygen because they've switched over to non-oxidative glycolytic metabolism

1429
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:14,320
and fermentation. So you have higher oxygen levels in the brain that leads to higher oxidative

1430
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:19,760
damage. When you reduce oxygen through hypoxia, you've suppressed that. By the way, have you ever

1431
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:26,480
tried the experiment where you give them excessive amounts of lactate, which neurons like lactate,

1432
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:32,800
and if you gave them lactate in theory, you would also come up with a way to bypass the ETC. I mean,

1433
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:38,000
it would be an interesting control or way to test that hypothesis. We've never tried that. So what I

1434
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:42,000
can tell you is they have higher levels of lactate in their blood. That's common in mitochondrial

1435
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,160
disease because they switch over to fermentation. But that doesn't mean that your experiment

1436
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:52,880
wouldn't work. It's just an observation. And rapamycin suppresses that high level of lactate,

1437
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:57,600
interestingly, as well as the accumulation of all the glycolytic intermediates upstream of lactate.

1438
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:05,280
So anyways, oxidative stress is that there's at least some reason to believe that oxidative stress

1439
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:12,800
is important. Another phenotype that these mice get is a dramatic loss of fat. So they are extremely

1440
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:18,240
lean and rapamycin suppresses that. So we think that there is some... we know there's something

1441
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:26,400
going on with fat mobilization, adipogenesis, when we treat with rapamycin that spares those mice

1442
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:32,320
from presumably using up all their fat. Presumably they're trying to burn the fat in some way.

1443
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:37,840
And that's why they become so lean. So that's another observation. So how do we get to mTORC2

1444
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:45,520
and Torin2? So we did a phosphoproteomic study with Judith Villan, who's at the University of

1445
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:53,040
Washington in Genome Sciences, to try to just take a sort of a global picture and ask,

1446
02:23:53,040 --> 02:24:00,160
what is the effect of rapamycin on the proteome and the phosphoproteome in the knockout mice

1447
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:04,480
compared to wild type and then with rapamycin treatment? There was a lot of interesting stuff

1448
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:09,360
in there. This work is published. It was published in Nature Metabolism, I don't know, several months

1449
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:14,560
ago. So if people are interested, they can look at that paper. There's a lot of interesting stuff

1450
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:21,680
in that proteomic data set. But one of the striking things that we saw was that mTORC2 components were

1451
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:29,520
at the protein level decreased, which actually fits with the idea that high-dose rapamycin

1452
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:37,040
chronically leads to inhibition of mTORC2. And associated with that was an inhibition of

1453
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:44,400
protein kinase C, which is another kinase that's regulated by mTORC2. So that led us to hypothesize

1454
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:49,440
that... and protein kinase C is known to regulate some aspects of inflammation. So that led us to

1455
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:55,200
hypothesize that maybe some of the effects of rapamycin, at least in this mouse model, are through

1456
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:02,560
protein kinase C and mTORC2, as opposed to what we had assumed was all mTORC1 related effects

1457
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:10,080
of rapamycin. So we tested a few drugs that are known inhibitors of protein kinase C,

1458
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:16,400
and they rescued part of the lifespan of the mitochondrial disease mice. So it weren't as

1459
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:21,840
good as rapamycin, but they did give significant increases in survival and delayed some of the

1460
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:26,720
neurological symptoms that the mice experience. So that is consistent with the idea that this

1461
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:33,680
inhibition of mTORC2, inhibition of protein kinase C, is part of the effect of rapamycin.

1462
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:41,440
So now we've gone back and we've tested Torin-2 in this mitochondrial disease model,

1463
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:48,160
seems to work, you know, as well as rapamycin, which is interesting. No negative side effects

1464
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,440
that we can see from inhibiting Torc2 in that context. And then we're also working in another

1465
02:25:54,400 --> 02:26:00,160
mouse model of a severe metabolic disease. And I think I'm not going to talk about it because this

1466
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:04,720
is a collaboration and it's not published yet. And so I don't want to give away, you know, what the

1467
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:09,840
initial observation was, really the observation of our collaborators. But let me just say in another

1468
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:17,760
childhood metabolic disease, which is on the surface, completely unrelated to complex one of

1469
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:25,600
the mitochondria, we see dramatic rescue from rapamycin and Torin-2. So this makes me wonder,

1470
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:34,080
first of all, I thought for a long time that mitochondrial disease might be a good model for

1471
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:38,560
normal aging in some respects. We know that, I mean, we talked about mitochondrial dysfunction

1472
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:43,440
as one of the hallmarks of aging. So severe mitochondrial dysfunction, I would not argue,

1473
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:49,040
is accelerated aging. But I think interventions that are effective in a model of severe mitochondrial

1474
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:54,880
disease might also be effective in the context of normative aging. Everything we've seen so far

1475
02:26:54,880 --> 02:27:02,480
is consistent with that. And it makes me wonder if Torin-2 or other catalytic inhibitors of mTOR

1476
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:08,160
might be as effective as rapamycin in the context of aging and maybe even more effective in the

1477
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:14,400
context of some age-related indications. So to me, it just seems like a gaping hole in the literature

1478
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:23,280
that, you know, really needs to be explored and, you know, we'll learn from doing that sort of

1479
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:28,880
exploration. The other point that's interesting to make is RTB101, the drug we talked about previously

1480
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:36,560
in the Restorbio Phase III clinical trial, is a catalytic inhibitor of mTOR as well as other

1481
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:42,560
kinases. So it would fall, at least biochemically, into the Torin-2 class as opposed to the

1482
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:49,840
rapamycin class. How is Torin-2 discovered or synthesized? Was it synthesized directly to be

1483
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:54,720
a catalytic inhibitor? Was it discovered and modified? You know, David Sabatini would be

1484
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:59,120
the person to ask. I should know the answer to that. So rapamycin is interesting, right?

1485
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:04,160
Of course, we found that. It was found on Rapa Nui, made by bacteria. I think Torin-2 came out of a

1486
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:11,760
more traditional sort of chemical screening as a mTOR inhibitor and then was modified to be a more

1487
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:17,280
potent catalytic mTOR inhibitor. But I honestly don't know that literature. And does it already

1488
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:22,720
have an IND? Is there already a molecule that's in a pipeline than an FDA pipeline? That's a good

1489
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:28,240
question. I have looked a little bit, and I don't know of anybody who's developing Torin-2 or Torin-1,

1490
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:33,680
which is another catalytic inhibitor for FDA approval. And I've wondered about this, and

1491
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,440
honestly, I just haven't had the bandwidth to really dig into it. Is it because people

1492
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:41,440
tried and there were side effects? I don't know. But I don't know of anybody who's actively

1493
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:49,680
developing the Torins, at least, for FDA approval. RTB101, again, we talked about that's being

1494
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:54,960
developed or has attempted to be developed for FDA approval. There are other dual kinase

1495
02:28:54,960 --> 02:29:00,800
inhibitors that are used clinically that hit mTOR in addition to other like a PI3 kinase,

1496
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:06,720
a different class of kinase. So there are molecules that have similar types of activity,

1497
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:10,480
but I don't know of anybody who's really trying hard to develop the more specific

1498
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:14,560
mTOR catalytic inhibitors. And again, I'm not sure why.

1499
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:21,040
Let's change gears for a second and talk about NAD, NR, NMN, all these things.

1500
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:26,160
I've had David Sinclair on the podcast a couple of times. He's very eloquently explained what

1501
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:32,720
Sirtuins are, how they work, why they require NAD. So for folks who want to get up to speed on that,

1502
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:38,400
you can do so in great depth. Do you want to give the 30-second answer as to why Sirtuins matter

1503
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:44,400
and why they need NAD? Sure. But I would start by saying that I'm not sure that Sirtuins are

1504
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,600
the only or most important reason why NAD is important.

1505
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:51,040
Sure.

1506
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:57,360
So Sirtuins are a class of NAD dependent, mostly deacetylases. They also can do some other

1507
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,480
activities. But basically one way to think about it is that Sirtuins

1508
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:11,200
take acetyl groups off of other proteins, that's their activity, and that requires NAD. And it

1509
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:16,400
actually consumes NAD. So NAD is a cofactor for many metabolic reactions where it gets converted

1510
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:23,040
between NAD, which is the oxidized form of the coenzyme, and NADH, which is the reduced form.

1511
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:27,600
Many, many different metabolic reactions use NAD in that way.

1512
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,680
Including the electron transport chain.

1513
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:33,280
Including the electron transport chain and glycolysis and fermentation, yes.

1514
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:44,160
Sirtuins are fundamentally different in that they use up NAD. And so NAD is required for

1515
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:49,840
their activity. NADH, the reduced form of NAD, is actually an inhibitor of Sirtuins.

1516
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:56,160
So the NAD to NADH ratio can be used as a proxy of likely Sirtuin activity.

1517
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:03,280
So Sirtuins are important in the aging field. This really goes back to my work as a graduate

1518
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:08,560
student in yeast when I was a grad student with Lenny Grenti. When we first showed that you could

1519
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:14,640
over express the yeast Sirtuin, which is called Sirtu, that's where Sirtuin comes from. So the

1520
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:19,920
yeast protein is called Sirtu. If you over express Sirtu, you increase lifespan in yeast. And since

1521
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:26,160
then other people have shown that activation or over expression of Sirtuins in worms or flies

1522
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:31,920
or mice can have interesting effects on aging. You and David must have overlapped, right?

1523
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,400
You guys must have both been in Lenny's lab at the same time.

1524
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:38,400
David and I overlapped in Lenny's lab. He was a postdoc when I was a grad student. And I

1525
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:42,080
got to give David, I mean, David and I have had our scientific disagreements over the years,

1526
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:51,280
but I got to give David a ton of credit as a postdoc. He mentored me in important ways and I

1527
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,920
think actually guided me to the project looking at Sirtu, which is what I just talked about when

1528
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:01,360
we over expressed Sirtu. So David was a very important early influence on my scientific

1529
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:08,080
career. And the Grenti lab at that time was full of really smart, I'm sure it's still full of really

1530
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:12,240
smart people, but it was just a really great environment. It was a powerhouse. Yeah, with

1531
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:18,960
lots of really fantastic scientists. So that was the first, and it was really Lenny's lab that

1532
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:26,960
established Sirtuins as important in aging in multiple model systems. So in mice, I mean,

1533
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:31,360
I think, you know, David might disagree with this a little bit, but I think if you're being honest,

1534
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:38,800
right, the evidence that Sirtuins are potent regulators of lifespan in mice is mixed. It's not

1535
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:44,640
strong. There are a couple of studies out of probably, you know, a dozen that have been

1536
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:49,040
published, and there's probably two dozen that are unpublished where people saw no effects on lifespan

1537
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:54,320
from manipulator or activating Sirtuins. There are a couple of studies that show in one case of a

1538
02:32:54,320 --> 02:33:00,000
brain specific activation of one of the Sirtuins called Sirti-1 could slightly extend lifespan.

1539
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,440
And another that overexpression of a different Sirtuin, Sirti-6, could slightly extend lifespan,

1540
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:11,600
I think, only in males, but nowhere near the reproducibility or magnitude of effect of other

1541
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:20,480
things, including rapamycin. So the data on Sirtuins is broad, but the absolute effects on

1542
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:26,560
lifespan at least are, in my personal view, unconvincing. Like it hasn't been broadly

1543
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:32,160
replicated like rapamycin has, and they're not big. What we do see with Sirtuins is abundant

1544
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:39,520
evidence that metabolic markers of health can be improved by activating Sirtuins. And in a few

1545
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:44,160
other disease specific models, pretty good evidence, heart disease in particular, some evidence for

1546
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:49,760
cognitive function as well, improvements in age related outcomes. So there's a lot of smoke there,

1547
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:58,560
but I think there's a lot of confusion in the field about the relative strength of data for

1548
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:04,080
different interventions. And at least in my view, there's really no comparison between the effects

1549
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:09,120
you get from inhibiting mTOR and the effects at least so far that people have reported from

1550
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:14,320
activating Sirtuins. It's like mTOR is head and shoulders above Sirtuins when it comes to

1551
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:19,840
the magnitude of effect. Yeah, I think it would be impossible to dispute that. I don't think there

1552
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:25,040
could be any dispute of that. What's interesting is if I were to tally up the number of questions

1553
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:36,720
I get per month about NR and NMN versus rapalogs, the ratio is the exact opposite to the magnitude.

1554
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:43,520
So if the effect size of rapamycin and the importance of mTOR is 10X that of Sirtuins,

1555
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:51,200
it's flipped in the number of questions I get about it and just the pop culture awareness

1556
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:58,160
of that. So let's put the marketing of that aside and talk about the chemistry of it for a moment.

1557
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:07,440
Sure. So Sirtuins are NAD dependent enzymes. So they need NAD to do their action. And we've

1558
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:12,800
already talked about in general, the model is that turning up Sirtuins is a good thing, that you're

1559
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:17,200
going to get... if you're going to get benefits in the context of aging, that's going to happen from

1560
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:23,200
activating Sirtuins. Again, that's probably a pretty massive oversimplification because there

1561
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:27,200
are seven Sirtuins and they do different things and different things in different tissues, but

1562
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:31,520
that's kind of where the field has gotten stuck. The idea is that activating Sirtuins is good.

1563
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:40,080
And so if you accept that and NAD is an activator of Sirtuins, then more NAD is good. And there's

1564
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:47,280
good evidence that NAD homeostasis becomes impaired with aging, that the ratio of NAD to NADH,

1565
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:54,560
the oxidized to reduced form of NAD, in many tissues at least, shifts towards more NADH and

1566
02:35:54,560 --> 02:36:00,000
less NAD. And so that with age. And so the prediction would be that you would have declining

1567
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:07,680
Sirtuin activity due to that metabolic shift. And I will also note, because I think this is important,

1568
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:13,920
that in mitochondrial disease, you see the same shift. It's just much, much more pronounced.

1569
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:20,240
You see a shift towards NADH and less NAD. And that's exactly what you see when mitochondria

1570
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:25,360
are less functional because the cells will switch over to glycolysis and fermentation,

1571
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:32,000
fermentation to lactate. And the whole reason why we ferment to lactate is to restore NAD levels.

1572
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:38,240
Fermentation to lactate takes NADH and turns it back into NAD. So this probably reflects an

1573
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:43,440
underlying metabolic defect, which could be mitochondrial in origin, that leads to this

1574
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:51,280
shift towards the reduced form of NAD with age. So those two observations, less NAD, bad,

1575
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:58,720
Sirtuins good, the prediction is that if we could boost NAD, that would be good. Because that would

1576
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:04,880
then restore Sirtuin activity and have effects on aging. And so this led to the development and

1577
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:10,800
popularization of these molecules called NAD precursors or NAD boosters. The two of which get

1578
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:18,000
talked about the most are nicotinamide riboside, NR, that was kind of the first to gain popularity.

1579
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:24,400
And then nicotinamide mononucleotide, NMN, both of those are precursors of NAD that within cells

1580
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:33,760
can be converted into NAD. And so there's a large body of literature in a variety of model

1581
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:43,840
organisms showing that treatment with NR or NMN sometimes leads to benefits that are associated

1582
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:52,400
with healthy aging. And in one study, Lifespan Extension in MICE, I say sometimes because there's

1583
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:57,200
also a large body of literature that doesn't reproduce those results. Including the ITP.

1584
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:02,400
Including the ITP, that's right. Which is what I think has to be considered the gold standard for

1585
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:07,280
at least MICE data. I think that's true. Although, as we talked about before, it's a different genetic

1586
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:13,120
background than C57 Black 6. And I would argue it's a much better genetic background. I think

1587
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:21,200
you can make that argument and there are good reasons to believe that argument. Nonetheless,

1588
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:26,560
I think it's important to note that that could be why it worked in one context and it wasn't working

1589
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:32,400
in another context. And we've struggled with this as well in my lab. So it's been reported in this

1590
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:38,880
mitochondrial disease mouse by a collaborator of ours who I trust their data. That NMN could

1591
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:44,080
increase lifespan in that mouse model. We've tried multiple times with both NR and NMN in that mouse

1592
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:52,320
model and been unable to get these effects. So I think these drugs are tricky from a biological

1593
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:58,560
efficacy perspective. There's something we don't understand about delivery or uptake.

1594
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:01,600
Do you think they're temperature stable?

1595
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:08,240
Probably, well, I don't know. I'm sure there are people who know the answer to that.

1596
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:14,480
I've read conflicting things. I've read that, and I need to go back to the sources on it,

1597
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:19,120
but I've read that at least through the lens in which they're provided as supplements,

1598
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:24,080
the likelihood that by the time that thing arrives at your door, it still has the biologic activity

1599
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:28,560
that it would have had in a refrigerated manner is low. Now, I don't know that the companies that

1600
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:33,360
sell them recommend refrigerating them, but they might not recommend refrigerating them because

1601
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:37,200
then it would imply that they're being shipped in an unrefrigerated manner, which nullifies the

1602
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:43,200
whole benefit. But I don't know if you've looked at any of that.

1603
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:49,280
We haven't. So definitely in our mouse studies, we are careful to keep the food in the refrigerator

1604
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:56,400
until we put it in the mouse cage. I suspect that there certainly might be some truth to the idea

1605
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:02,000
that the biological activity goes off over time at room temperature. But I think that reflects a

1606
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:09,600
bigger problem with the NAD precursor field, which is that there's a lot of controversy even

1607
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:13,840
among the two camps. So I mean, it's sort of funny, right? Because there's an NR camp of researchers

1608
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:19,520
who really think NR is the tool that we should use. And then there's an NMN camp, and they both

1609
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:25,120
say that the other camp, that their molecule doesn't work, right? Because it's not biologically

1610
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:30,880
available or all sorts of reasons, right? So there's a lot of lack of clarity around

1611
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:37,280
biological availability and efficacy with these molecules in the preclinical literature, right?

1612
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:43,040
Where in theory, people should be able to exactly reproduce the way that other people do the work

1613
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:48,000
and get the same results, right? There are lots of reasons why scientific results don't get replicated.

1614
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,960
It's my impression that in the NAD precursor field, that's a bigger problem than in some other areas.

1615
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:58,080
And I don't know the reasons for that. But all I can say is we've experienced that in my lab as well.

1616
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:05,040
So I've tried to stay on the fence here because I think there's a ton of smoke, right? There's a ton

1617
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:10,240
of smoke with sirtuins. There's a ton of smoke with NAD precursors that they can, if you do the

1618
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:15,920
experiment the right way, have positive effects that look a lot like what we would expect for

1619
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:20,240
something that's impacting the aging process. And as I said, I mean, it's funny because people who

1620
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:24,960
are in the field, I think sometimes think of me as this anti-sirtuin guy, which is absolutely not

1621
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:30,400
the truth. I'm the guy who first showed that you could overexpress a sirtuin and increase lifespan.

1622
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:35,040
If anybody's going to be pro sirtuin, it's me. I think the problem is that I've seen a lot of

1623
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:42,400
data that people have struggled to reproduce, right? And I just honestly don't know how to

1624
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:47,120
interpret that. Whereas with rapamycin, it works for everybody, right? It's robust and everybody

1625
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:52,800
gets the same result over and over and over again. So I'm less enthusiastic, I would say, about

1626
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:58,960
sirtuins and NAD precursors as opposed to some other interventions, right, in the field. But I

1627
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:05,760
think there's a lot of data that suggests that these molecules and that sirtuins are important

1628
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:11,600
for aging. I think what we haven't done yet is figured out how to tweak the system in exactly

1629
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:18,400
the right way to get robust and reproducible experimental results that I personally would

1630
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:23,680
feel comfortable moving forward with clinically. And it might be that the answer is you have to

1631
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:28,000
hit this system with two prongs. You have to provide more of the precursor and you have to

1632
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:34,720
activate the sirtuin in the way that resveratrol attempted to do but wasn't doing, right? So maybe

1633
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:39,520
the answer is it's both. Again, that's literally just- Yeah, right, sure. That's a possibility.

1634
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:45,840
Yeah. The other thing that I find weird about the NAD precursor literature and the limited

1635
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:52,800
work that's been done clinically is often, I mean, in principle, it should be trivial to determine

1636
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:58,080
whether or not you have boosted NAD levels, right? If you treat somebody with an NAD precursor, we

1637
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:03,600
know how to measure NAD. That's not hard. Okay? So we know what the biomarker is at least that far

1638
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:08,720
in this case. And oftentimes that's not done. So, you know, if you're treating somebody with NR

1639
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:12,720
or NMN and you're not increasing NAD levels in the blood or in your target tissue,

1640
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:15,920
that should tell you something important, I would think.

1641
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:19,600
Well, and the other question is, is increasing it in the blood sufficient?

1642
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:24,160
That's a different question, but it is an important question. I agree. That's why I said

1643
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:28,400
target tissue and we can't biopsy certain tissues, but we can biopsy some tissues. Yeah.

1644
02:43:28,400 --> 02:43:34,800
No, it's super messy. Look, I get asked about it at least once a week by patients and I usually

1645
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:37,760
point them to something I've written on the subject matter. But in the end, I say, look,

1646
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:43,280
I will say, I think it's very safe. I really don't see a downside other than to your pocketbook

1647
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:50,720
of taking NR or NMN. So they check the first box of any intervention, which is,

1648
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:56,640
is the downside sufficiently low? And I think the answer is yes. I'm just having a hard time

1649
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:03,200
seeing upside. So yeah. And I'll tell you, honestly, I would love to test NR or NMN or both

1650
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:10,400
in dogs for exactly that reason, right? Because there is essentially no risk and we could

1651
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:16,320
actually find out, does it work? Three years from now, five years from now, I could tell you,

1652
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:24,080
do NAD precursor slow aging, at least in pet dogs. And I think if I saw NR slow aging,

1653
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:29,280
increased lifespan and or improved multiple functional measures of aging in dogs, I'd be

1654
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:33,120
much more bullish on taking NR myself. Wouldn't prove it's going to work in people, but it

1655
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:40,400
gets you a part way there and a pretty big part of the way there. And I would put that on the

1656
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:45,600
shortlist of things I would like to test. The fact is nobody's going to do the definitive clinical

1657
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:49,760
trial in people because they don't have to, because they can sell that stuff to people now,

1658
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:53,760
right? They aren't required to do the clinical trial to show that it works.

1659
02:44:53,760 --> 02:45:01,680
Yeah. Matt, you probably don't remember this, but there was one night, oh, four,

1660
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:05,360
four or five years ago. Are you making comments about my cognitive decline with aging?

1661
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:11,360
I just don't think you'd remember some random night of us having dinner in New York, but

1662
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:13,360
it was about four years ago. Is this with you, Shin?

1663
02:45:13,360 --> 02:45:18,880
Yes. Okay. Wow. You do have the cognitive function. So the three of us were having dinner

1664
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:25,440
at my favorite, not my favorite, but a decent Persian place on the Upper East Side. And I don't

1665
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:30,880
know if I said so at the time, but I might've told you after, it was after that dinner that I decided

1666
02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:38,160
I got to do a podcast because the three of us had such an enjoyable, she's at Einstein, isn't she?

1667
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:43,280
She was, yeah. She's actually moved to Columbia. So now she's running a reproductive aging center

1668
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:48,320
at Columbia now. Apropos with our discussion today. Right. But we just had such an amazing

1669
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:53,760
discussion, which really means me asking the two of you guys nonstop questions. And I remember

1670
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:59,120
thinking after that, goddamn, why didn't I record this dinner? Why didn't I have my phone sitting

1671
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:06,240
on the table to record it? And it was literally that moment that made me realize this happens

1672
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:10,320
the same time. Every time I go out with Sabatini, I have the same feeling. Every time I go out with

1673
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:15,360
so-and-so, I have the same feeling, I got to just do this podcast thing. So for anybody listening

1674
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:20,800
to this who is appreciative of the podcast, they owe you personally a great debt of gratitude

1675
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:27,120
for always providing. I got to say, I'm sure it was you Shin who made most of the really

1676
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:35,280
insightful comments at that dinner. I think it was both of you guys. But it is always such

1677
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:39,200
an awesome time to be able to sit down with you. I think as the listener appreciates here,

1678
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:44,800
the breadth of topics within the space of longevity that you can cover is broad. So you're

1679
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:50,880
one of the few people who can go very wide and very deep. And I think today's discussion

1680
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:55,440
demonstrated that. So thank you very much, Matt. Really, as always, enjoy this discussion.

1681
02:46:56,080 --> 02:47:01,600
Sure. Yeah. Anytime. I enjoy the discussion as much as you do, I think. So it's been a lot of fun.

1682
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:06,480
All right. And best of luck with the triad study. I know a lot of people are probably more interested

1683
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:12,160
in that than any of the human stuff because the dog owners I know care far more about what

1684
02:47:12,160 --> 02:47:15,520
Rapamycin can do for their dogs than they care about what it can do for them. So

1685
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:19,040
hopefully we'll have those results by the next time we speak.

1686
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:25,360
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1687
02:47:25,360 --> 02:47:29,760
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1688
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:35,200
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1689
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:40,480
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

1690
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:46,480
bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper,

1691
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:51,840
person thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these.

1692
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:57,040
Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely.

1693
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:02,720
Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen

1694
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:08,320
to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday

1695
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:12,960
through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes

1696
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:17,920
of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and

1697
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:23,680
necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not

1698
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:28,400
getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in

1699
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,480
as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits, you can head
