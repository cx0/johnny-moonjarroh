Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,360
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,320
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,680
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,000
today's episode. Welcome back to another special episode of the COVID-19 series of The Drive.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Joining me today is Dr. Emesh Adalja. Emesh is a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,960
for Health Security. He has long been focused on pandemic preparedness and emerging work on

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,840
infectious disease, biosecurity, et cetera, for many years long before this coronavirus

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,360
entered our consciousness. I wanted to talk with Emesh for a couple of reasons. One, I'd heard him

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,200
on other interviews, particularly the one with Sam Harris. Also, I'd seen him in interviews,

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,400
read some of his work and just found him to be a very thoughtful guy who could put the

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,320
coronavirus pandemic in the context of all the previous pandemics and not just the ones that are

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,480
immediately in our recollective memories, such as SARS, MERS, H1N1, but even going back a little

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,560
bit further than that. This is a very brief discussion. He was incredibly busy. We were

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,520
very fortunate to get 40 minutes of his time between other interviews, but we do cover quite

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,320
a bit of ground and certainly everything I was hoping to speak with, which is a bit of a more

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,480
clear history of when this virus likely emerged, how it came here and what we know about it relative

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,360
to other coronaviruses. We talk a lot about what the plan forward should be and we end with really

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,840
what he is most optimistic about. So though this interview is relatively short for the standards

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,240
of interviews that I do, like I said, it's about 40 minutes, I think we cover a lot and there's no

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,200
question I would like to have a mesh back. I do think it is really just an inevitability that we

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,200
will once again face a pandemic and whether it's a coronavirus or another virus is probably less

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,480
the point here, but unquestionably there are things that we could do better the next time we're

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,760
faced with this. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Emesh Adalja.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:47,320
Thank you so much for making time to speak this afternoon. I know you're incredibly busy and we

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,640
were lucky to sort of catch you in between interviews and television appearances. So thanks

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,280
very much. I'll just sort of jump right to it. I reached out to you because I was

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,600
very interested in your perspective on the historical similarities and differences between

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,000
this pandemic and previous ones. Maybe just briefly tell us a little bit about your background

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,680
and why it is that you're not just someone who came to be interested in this in the past three

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,520
months. So I'm an infectious disease emergency medicine and critical care physician whose focus

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,480
his entire career basically on the issue of pandemic preparedness, pandemic prediction,

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,680
infectious disease and national security, emerging infectious disease. Even from the time when I was

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,720
a trainee, that's basically all I focused. And I work at a think tank that's devoted to this issue.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,240
And I've been there basically full time since 2010 or so, but had been there since 2008 working on

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,120
this. I published on pandemic prediction on what the characteristics of certain pathogens that

41
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:52,200
cause pandemics would be on H1N1, on Ebola, on agents of bioterrorism. So I really focused and

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,440
tried to niche myself into this aspect of infectious disease in medicine. So this is

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,560
an outbreak that had been on my radar before it hit headlines. And I've been following it almost

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,360
the way people follow sports teams that they like. Tell me a little bit about what you thought in

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,720
call it December when we at least in the West saw the first report of the case in China. What was

46
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,880
your intuition at the time? At that time, I was trying to take what the Chinese were saying at

47
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,280
face value, meaning that they had learned from the lessons of SARS about transparency. And we're

48
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,480
going to do this in a different manner. And they did produce the virus sequence very quickly that

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,960
allowed diagnostic tests and vaccine development to start. And we were able to identify novel

50
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,400
coronavirus. But initially, a lot of the reports were saying, this is something that was animal to

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,360
human, really tied to wet markets in Wuhan, that there wasn't evidence of human to human spread,

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,560
there were no deaths yet. But I did think that 41 patients getting something from one animal

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,560
at one market really seemed very odd to me, that that seemed to be too much. So I was a little bit

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,720
skeptical that this was just an animal to human event, unless there was something different going

55
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,560
on, or there are multiple animals that were infected and infected multiple people. But as

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,720
soon as I saw the first paper, and that was the Lancet paper where they showed the first case got

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,240
ill on December 1. And he had no contact with the market. That told me that we were dealing with the

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,240
transmissible human to human respiratory virus. And that this was going to be a pathogen that was

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,400
going to spread and not be containable and that we were going to have to get ready. I had a lot of

60
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,960
questions about the case fatality ratio, the hospitalization rate, which I still have. But I

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,560
knew at that point, when you had a virus that spreads efficiently between human to humans

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,480
through the respiratory route, you really have to prepare for this being everywhere, especially when

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,440
you know that this had a head start at least spreading since mid November in China. And nobody

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,720
knew about it until late December. So that gave a virus a very big head start and could have been

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,120
anywhere by the time we actually knew it was as soon as we discovered that it actually existed.

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,240
Based on that, do you think it's possible that this virus was in the United States potentially

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,160
even within an individual prior to December 31? This is a little bit of controversy. I do know

68
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,560
that with past novel coronaviruses that have been discovered like HKU1, which isn't one that people

69
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,360
think about, but it is one that was discovered post SARS, it was everywhere as soon as they found it.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,920
This one, it doesn't appear that at least that there wasn't widespread presence of it before

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,840
maybe January. However, I don't rule out the possibility that it could have been mixed in our

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,040
flu and cold season, maybe a sporadic case here or there that was mild, that didn't get diagnosed.

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,200
But it doesn't appear at least from the phylogenetics, the genetics of the virus that we're

74
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,240
seeing from both New York and in Washington, that this was around before that. But I do think it's

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,640
going to be important to go back and look at bank samples and look at people to see if there were

76
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,080
cases. I don't think there were a lot of them. I think we would have noticed if there were a lot of

77
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,160
them, but I think there may have been sporadic cases that were mixed into flu and cold season,

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,680
but it's an open question. And I think it's a good hypothesis. And I think it's something

79
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,440
that deserves a lot more attention. At what point, Amesh, were you becoming convinced that this was

80
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,560
going to enter the US in a manner that was going to pose real difficulty for the country?

81
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,880
So I knew it was going to enter the United States almost from the onset, as soon as we knew that

82
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,240
this was transmitting between human to human, that this wasn't going to be containable, just

83
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,840
like when H1N1 appeared in 2009 and was found in Mexico, that we knew that this wasn't going to be

84
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,000
something that would spare the United States. What I wasn't quite attuned to was how difficult

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,400
it would be to contain in the United States. Because I, like many of us, believe that our

86
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,000
diagnostic testing and our case finding and our contact tracing would have been really much better

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,880
than it was. But the fact was, we didn't know who had this, who didn't have it. Our testing

88
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,320
made it much harder to actually do that. And we weren't even testing mild cases. And those mild

89
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,200
cases are arguably more contagious than the severe cases. So that let this slip from something that

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,480
was potentially controllable and wouldn't have been a problem, or a major problem, not putting

91
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,200
cities like New York City under the stress that they're under, to one that became completely

92
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,240
unmanageable because we basically were allowing this virus to have about two months of unabated

93
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,480
spread in the United States. And that's something that most of us did not think would happen,

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,440
because we thought that we were much more resilient to these types of infections than we

95
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,360
really were. And I think that's, it didn't have to be that way, but that's basically how it turned out.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,520
When you go back and look at the history of not just the other coronaviruses, which have gotten a

97
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,560
lot of airtime lately, of course, most people, even if they don't remember the ins and outs of SARS

98
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,080
and MERS, they're certainly familiar enough. But when you go back even further and look at some of

99
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,040
the flus that occurred in Asia, Hong Kong in the 1950s, 60s, and of course, going back even further

100
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,680
to the Spanish flu of 1918 to 1920, what are some of the similarities that you see with this novel

101
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,840
coronavirus? Then of course, I'll contrast that in a moment with what the differences are. And the

102
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,440
point of this exercise is less about just abstract history, but more to understand what we can learn.

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,240
Sure. So if you go back to 1957 and 1968, these were pandemics that were marked by the emergence

104
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,000
of a novel flu virus that spread around the world very rapidly. And if you look at the United States

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,360
experience, about 1957 and 1968, about 100,000 people died from that, which is a substantial

106
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,600
number because on record right now, the worst flu season we've had outside of 57 and 68 has really

107
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,240
been 2017, 2018, where about 80,000 people or so may have died. So these were severe outbreaks. And

108
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,000
flu has a lot of similarities with coronavirus, but there are some differences. So one thing is,

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,040
I mean, they both are transmitted through the respiratory route. They both have symptoms that

110
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,120
are included coughing and sneezing and sore throat and muscle aches and pains and fevers. So they

111
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,080
have a lot of overlap clinically. And I think that because of the way they spread and their symptoms,

112
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,040
you can look at their spread. And there's a lot of analogies that you can draw. But what I would

113
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,920
say is with flu is sometimes it's difficult because people have already taken flu and put it into

114
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,160
their own risk of daily life that they know that there's going to be maybe 30,000 to 50,000, 60,000

115
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,600
people who die every year. So even during a pandemic like 1957 and 1968, most people still

116
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,200
carried on because this was still a flu virus. And the same thing happened to an extent with 2009 H1N1,

117
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,360
especially when we realized that its case fatality ratio was actually less than seasonal

118
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,040
flu, even though it infected 61 million Americans led to a lot of hospitalizations and put hospitals

119
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,880
into distress. It wasn't that deadly. So people kind of took it in stride. This is something

120
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,680
that's a little bit different because it's on top of flu, it's additive to flu. I think that's one

121
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,200
of my pet peeves of the media coverage is sometimes they try to compare it to flu. But

122
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,000
remember that we're already going to have 40 to 50,000 deaths from flu. And this is on top of that.

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I do think that influenza gets a short shrift by people because it's something that they take for

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,680
granted and don't realize the burden of infection that it has. And that influenza still even today

125
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,560
remains the biggest pandemic threat that we face. If you think about some of the influenza viruses

126
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,760
like avian influenza, they have case fatality ratios about 65%. That's too much for the world

127
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,840
to bear. So if one of those like H7N9 became able to efficiently transmit from humans, that's a

128
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,760
totally different type of pandemic that we're talking about than what we're dealing with today.

129
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,520
And I think that's important. And maybe that's why I seem a little bit more optimistic than most

130
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,960
people are a little bit more measured when I'm talking about this, because in my mind, I'm

131
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,680
thinking about avian influenza and what that kind of a pandemic would represent. And I used to say

132
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,200
that this is kind of a trial run because it's less than 1% case fatality rate, maybe as low as 0.3

133
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,680
case fatality rate. But we didn't do that great of a job with it in terms of diagnostic testing

134
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,600
and hospital capacity and personal protective equipment. So that's magnified this. And that's

135
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,840
the human factor that's magnified what the virus could do. And I think that's an important point

136
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,640
to make. And that's how I would kind of leave it is that you have certain ways to think about this

137
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,880
using flu as an analogy. But I do think that I'm a little more worried about our pandemic

138
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,600
resiliency based on how badly we've handled a 1% case fatality rate pandemic virus where you've

139
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,440
got cascading decisions by governors in states and countries all around the world that really have

140
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,160
magnified the damage that the virus has done. One other question I want to ask before we leave

141
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,040
the historical, which is the sort of ebbing and flowing recurrences that occurred back in some of

142
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,720
these other pandemics where it's easy to sort of think of them as this was the impact on the United

143
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,880
States, but not realizing, well, actually, it had a different impact on this city versus that city.

144
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,680
And they were not just different in terms of the strain they put on the healthcare system or even

145
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,680
the mortality rate, but even temporally, they could be separated by quite a period of time.

146
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,120
Is that something that also applies here in your opinion?

147
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,760
I do think so. We have this tendency to think of a pandemic as a homogenous

148
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,280
wave over the whole world or even a country. But it's actually many small outbreaks together. And

149
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,760
everybody's on a different timescale based upon when the virus is introduced into that area,

150
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,160
what their population density is, what their hospital capacity is, what demographic got

151
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,000
infected. So you aren't going to see synchronous outbreaks. They're going to be a little bit

152
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
staggered. And there's going to be differences on, for example, when did somebody do social

153
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,280
distancing? When did someone not do social distancing? How do they vary between this state

154
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,560
and that state? That's also going to impact the trajectory of the outbreak. You might see places

155
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,200
like I'm sitting here in Pittsburgh right now, which hasn't had a bad experience with this virus

156
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,320
yet. But we've had the opportunity to learn from New York and Seattle and San Francisco.

157
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,360
And that's gauged the way that we've dealt with testing and hospital capacity. So our outbreak is

158
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,880
going to be different because we've learned from them. And we don't have the population density

159
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,360
issue. So I do think there is going to be ebbing and flowing, especially with social distancing,

160
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,760
varying, and maybe lifting in certain places of the country and not lifting in other places.

161
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,560
And you may find that this virus is going to have some degree of seasonality. I don't think it will

162
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,880
have complete full seasonality because there's so many people that are susceptible to it. But you

163
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,120
may see this come back in successive waves. And remember, there are four other coronaviruses that

164
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,640
circulate every year and cause about 25% of our colds. This is something that I suspect will be

165
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,960
the fifth one that does that. And it looks like it has an intermediate severity. It's not as severe

166
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,000
as SARS, for example, which has a case fatality ratio of about 10%. But it doesn't seem to be as

167
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,600
mild as the other four coronaviruses. So I do think you're going to see ebbing and flowing,

168
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,760
especially as social distancing changes across the country until we have a vaccine.

169
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,920
And is it your view that this will now be a fifth coronavirus that will fit into the mix,

170
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,720
and it's never really going to go away in the way that at least SARS and MERS, because of their

171
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,840
severity, they don't really factor into that recurrent cycle we see every year?

172
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,720
I do think this is going to be the fifth season of coronavirus. And I would say with SARS and MERS,

173
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,880
it's not just that they were more severe, which they are, it's that they're poorly transmissible

174
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,520
from human to human. They are mostly zoonotic, or meaning animal to human transmission. So

175
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Palm civet cats, Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS from camels. So that's something that's

176
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,520
really limited to their spread. It's only those individuals who are in contact with those animals

177
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,200
that are really at risk. And when you look at their outbreaks, they're very specialized,

178
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,800
they're happening in healthcare facilities with poor infection control, and it doesn't really

179
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,280
sustain itself in the human population. Whereas if you look at the other four coronaviruses,

180
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,600
the ones that cause common colds, they are ubiquitous, they transmit very easy,

181
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,360
they have a mild spectrum of illness, which allows people to go about their daily life

182
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,080
and spread. And this new novel coronavirus does appear to be more like them in terms of their

183
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,160
transmissibility. So that's why I think that this will be the fifth seasonal coronavirus until

184
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,640
there's a vaccine. Do you think a vaccine is going to be specific to this coronavirus, or do you think

185
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,920
that it will be more geared towards all coronaviruses to cover not just this one, but perhaps others

186
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,600
that will potentially emerge, you know, a SARS-CoV-3 that's five years away? Right now, vaccine

187
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,480
development is premised on making something specific to this specific immunogenic protein

188
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,800
that the immune system recognizes for this virus. So it will be specific to that. But I do suspect

189
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,960
you might see some cross reactivity between the vaccine for this SARS-CoV-2 and other related

190
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,280
coronaviruses, maybe the SARS-CoV-2 clusters in something called the beta coronaviruses,

191
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,880
maybe the vaccine will work against all beta coronaviruses, but it would be great if it worked

192
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,040
against all coronaviruses and we had a pan-coronavirus vaccine. We might get something

193
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,200
like that because coronaviruses are different than, for example, influenza, which has been very

194
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,320
hard to make a universal flu vaccine. The coronaviruses in general tend to be much more

195
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,000
stable, even though there's some diversity among them, and we might have cross protection, which

196
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
would be useful to take other threats like Middle East respiratory syndrome and the original SARS

197
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,720
off the table as well. When H1N1 hit, you sort of alluded to this briefly, the case fatality rate

198
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,920
was initially deemed to be much higher. It was only once we appreciated how prevalent it was

199
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,160
that the case fatality rate came so far down. I believe in the end it's less than 0.1% correct?

200
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,040
Yes, yeah, definitely.

201
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,400
What is your real assessment now? And again, you can only be speculating at this point,

202
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,320
I understand, but what do you think is the true case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 specifically?

203
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,000
And if you want to answer that, by the way, in terms of I think that the CFR is going to be this

204
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,480
for people over 60 and this for people under 60, and it blends out to this, I mean, answer it any

205
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,600
way you see fit. So the CFR has been really hard to calculate because we have a severity bias

206
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,400
because testing has been so heterogeneous around countries. So what I do is try to look at a place

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,360
that's tested extensively and use that as kind of a barometer. And right now, it used to be South

208
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,840
Korea that tested, and now it seems to be Germany is doing the best testing. And you're also looking

209
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,440
at modeling studies. So some of the modeling studies from Imperial College put the case fatality

210
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,200
ratio at 0.66%. Germany looks like it's at a 0.3 something percent.

211
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,920
Yeah, I think 0.37 this morning, yeah.

212
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,640
Yeah, doing antibody testing to try and understand. So I do think it's probably in that range,

213
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,040
probably in the 0.3 to 0.66. I say that with some confidence, but it may drift lower or higher,

214
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,880
depending upon how much severity bias is in the samples. And it's very hard. We probably won't

215
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,080
truly know until we do retrospective studies looking at antibodies to understand how prevalent

216
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,000
it is. And there's differences amongst that because that's an average number. If you're above

217
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,360
80, your case fatality ratio may be as high as 15%. If you're eight years old, your case fatality

218
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,680
ratio may be 0%. So I think it's important to remember that these are average numbers, and it's

219
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,640
not every person carries that risk. Some people will have much, much higher risks, and some people

220
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,880
will have lower risks. And I think that's sometimes lost in nuance when you try to come up with one

221
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,760
number.

222
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,440
Absolutely, yeah. Blending that is, there's lots of glib examples of how you can drown in an average

223
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,640
of three inches of water, of course, if you're walking across a river that has vacillating depth.

224
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Because you're, again, kind of a veteran of this, what do you think was sort of the

225
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,440
overslash, underdoing of some of the predictions that came out in the sort of Gen 1 models that

226
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,240
showed up in sort of February where they were saying, look, this is something that is going to

227
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,040
infect 200 million Americans. It's going to kill two to four million Americans. Do you think that

228
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,760
that type of modeling historically has ever shown to be accurate? Or do you think that, yes,

229
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,800
that was accurate, and it's the measures that are in place that are going to hopefully prevent that

230
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,280
from happening? Because it seems less likely now that we're heading in the direction of those types

231
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,240
of doomsday scenarios. But again, it's hard to know how much of that is in response to the

232
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,480
measures that have been enacted versus predictions that were predicated on poorly understood things,

233
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,640
including what the R0 was. I think that models you have to realize have assumptions built into

234
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,640
them. And you have to look at those assumptions, because just a small difference in the assumption

235
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,480
can lead to a big change on the end of it. And what I would think, at least from my

236
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,720
understanding of many of the models, is that the hospitalization rate was probably overstated.

237
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,520
Because we know, for example, that the diagnosis that we're talking about in any given city or town

238
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,760
are likely understated by a factor of at least maybe 10. And I can say that from my own practice

239
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,280
when I order the test and don't order the test. There's many patients, I think, have the disease

240
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,560
and I don't order the test. So there clearly is a severity bias in who gets tested. And then I

241
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,760
think you see this idea of 15% to 20% getting admitted to the hospital. I think that that

242
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,880
doesn't necessarily mean everybody of the people that get infected, maybe that's 40% of the

243
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,440
population over time, that 15% to 20% of those individuals get admitted. It's more like, of the

244
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,920
40% of the population that get infected, the ones who go to an emergency department,

245
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,360
15 to 20% get admitted. And maybe the real hospitalization rate is 5%. If you look at,

246
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,120
for example, Westchester County's data, which I haven't looked at lately, but the last time I

247
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,520
looked, they did a lot of heavy testing in that part of New York State, because they had that

248
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,880
outbreak in New Rochelle. And their hospitalization rate was around 5%, a little bit less than 5% the

249
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,640
last time I calculated it. And that changes, that gives you a major change from going down from 20%

250
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,680
to 5% in terms of what your ventilator needs are, what your ICU bed capacity needs are,

251
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,960
and what the case fatality ratio is going to be if you look at what the hospitalization rate is.

252
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,920
And I think that that's at least one of my criticisms of some of the models, the hospitalization

253
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,280
rate was set too high. And if they were taking too big of a fraction using the wrong denominator,

254
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,680
I think, to come up with what their case fatality ratios are, what their ICU bed needs would be,

255
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,520
and what their mechanical ventilation needs would be. And that happens because models have lots of

256
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,760
assumption in them. And they should be used as tools. They're not ironclad. And I think that

257
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,560
sometimes that gets lost in the press reporting of them, they get looked at as if they are the truth,

258
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,960
and they need to be revised. And when you have real data from real hospitals and real people,

259
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,360
it should supplant what you're using with a model. So if your model is not matching reality,

260
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,480
then I think you need to either change the assumptions on the model or actually look at

261
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,520
reality. These are tools and all models are going to be wrong. Some of them are going to be useful,

262
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,680
and some of them are not going to be useful. I agree. I think it's unfortunately the press

263
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,120
sometimes views corrections of models as a sign of weakness as opposed to a necessary part of the

264
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,000
evolution of utilizing the tool as you described it. We've talked a little bit about this being a

265
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,360
dress rehearsal for what is coming unquestionably at some point, very likely in our lifetimes,

266
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,120
which is another pandemic, another virus, and potentially one that could be much more devastating.

267
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:20,520
You used an example of viruses that are typically transmitted only from animals to humans that can

268
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,640
potentially be much more catastrophic. But if those viruses ever figure out how to go human to human,

269
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:34,760
they spread much more. What is your view on the role of local versus central government in

270
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,800
dealing with that? Can't imagine there isn't a role for both, but I feel personally very confused

271
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,520
when I try to sometimes play the game. If I was czar for a day, what would I do different? But the

272
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,440
reality of it is it's easy to play armchair quarterback. I'm not really sure I know

273
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,720
what the federal government should be doing in this situation versus the state governments and

274
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,360
local governments. This is something that's pretty unique to the United States because we have a system

275
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,560
of a federal government with states and locals having most of the power, especially true in

276
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,400
public health because most of the public health powers are vested at the local and state level.

277
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,200
The federal government is more of a coordinator. Even the CDC can't actually get involved in

278
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,480
something unless they're asked by a state. You will often see differences and heterogeneity

279
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,360
between recommendations from maybe one county to the next and definitely from one state to the next.

280
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,040
Sometimes that can be confusing. I do think that I'm generally supportive of local health departments

281
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,320
being the ones running it because they actually know their community, they know their capacities,

282
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,840
they know where their gaps are, and they're able to really be on the ground with the people and

283
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,960
able to do great things when it comes to stopping an outbreak. But often what we find is local health

284
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,040
departments aren't appropriately resourced. You've got one person doing four different roles in a

285
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,440
small town's health department, and that can be very constraining. What you need to really do is

286
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,920
have those local health departments actually operating the way that they should be and thought

287
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:03,640
of as part of the whole pandemic response apparatus, whereas many people think of just the CDC, the NIH,

288
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,840
and parts of the Health and Human Services Department as the main pandemic apparatus.

289
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,760
It's actually the local health departments that do all that case finding and isolation and talk to

290
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,920
the public and deal with hospital capacity levels. It's the local health department, so I can't

291
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,960
overstate how important local health departments are. I do think that that system works well,

292
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,920
but you do need to have federal leadership to guide the nation as a whole on what to expect

293
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,400
and what's going on. I think that's sort of been missing a lot during this outbreak compared to

294
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,040
other outbreaks. Because of that, you've seen governors at state health departments take on

295
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,120
roles that they usually haven't taken, where they've deferred much more to federal experts,

296
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,880
not the powers, but the guidance and looking to them to set the tone. I think now we're finding

297
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,960
governors basically stepping into that role for the most part, and even mayors in some places.

298
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,640
I think that can be confusing to a member of the general public because they don't know who to

299
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,400
believe, especially if there's conflicting information. You have a press that's constantly

300
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,760
trying to pit one governor against another governor or against the federal government,

301
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,760
and that makes it much harder. I do think that when the process works well with local,

302
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,320
state, and federal government all in step, all doing the appropriate roles, I do think it works

303
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,440
pretty well. You have a locally managed, federally coordinated response, which I think is the best

304
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,040
way to think about how it would be ideally done. Is it safe to say that testing is really something

305
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,920
that like if you go back in time and maybe change one thing, if we're sitting here and it's January

306
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,520
12th and we now have the sequence of this virus, would that have potentially been one of the more

307
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,080
important things for the federal government, for that centralized piece of government to have put

308
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,120
in place? The CDC could have said, look, we're going to make this the highest priority because

309
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,800
it strikes me as that's something very difficult to be done in a decentralized manner.

310
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,800
What happened was the CDC put out guidance on who should be tested, which basically was taken as

311
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,120
gospel by the state health departments. That included only people that had traveled to China

312
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,280
in the last 14 days, as well as someone who had to have lower respiratory tract symptoms. You

313
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,600
couldn't have just had a sore throat. You had to have evidence that maybe you had pneumonia to be

314
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,760
tested. So we weren't testing mild cases and we weren't testing people that hadn't come to China.

315
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,440
That was a federal decision. And I think that could have been done better and allowed much more

316
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,000
latitude. Because you can remember that first case in California that didn't have traveled to China,

317
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,360
they, the hospital had to actually fight to get that test run. And there were many cases like that

318
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,320
all over the country. And if you look at New York's epidemiology, their introduction of the virus

319
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,680
was not from China, it was from Europe. And that slips through the type of testing algorithm. So

320
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,840
I do think that there could have been at the beginning, an idea that somebody could have said,

321
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,520
this is a respiratory virus, it has many overlapping symptoms with common colds and

322
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,720
flus. You should think about this in your patients. And we are going to allow testing to be done,

323
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,120
if you have certain risk factors for this, and they shouldn't just be restricted to you having

324
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,000
severe disease or having traveled to China. That would have changed the way that the general public

325
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,680
and clinicians would have thought about this. The other thing is, is that there were bureaucratic

326
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,480
wrangles that paradoxically, once a public health emergency was declared, they were unable to make

327
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,880
diagnostic tests as freely available as would have been if there wasn't a public health emergency

328
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,040
made. So for example, you had university labs and big commercial labs not being able to make a test,

329
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,680
even the CDC test had to go through FDA emergency use authorization before it could be distributed

330
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,720
to the states. So there were a lot of bureaucratic hiccups that created a problem that compounded

331
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,520
the testing protocol with the scarcity of tests and a delay in getting testing kits everywhere.

332
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,480
And then we still have shortages of reagents and nasal swabs, and we're still not to where we need

333
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,920
to be with testing. And not to get too far ahead of ourselves, but do you get the impression that

334
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,040
the response to this is serious enough that it will now be taken more seriously to have kind of

335
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,760
that type of emergency response ready five years from now when people have long forgotten about

336
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,920
this? I hope so. I think this is something that's going to leave a mark on society. This

337
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,200
hasn't happened in modern times, not during the 68 or 57 pandemics. And it did happen in 1918,

338
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,600
but that's not in anybody's living memory anymore. So I do think that this is something that people

339
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,760
will remember. And they will remember the costs that they personally had to incur filing for

340
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,600
unemployment for the first time. All of that type of stuff is going to hopefully push the public to

341
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,760
demand that pandemic preparedness be taken seriously. So this doesn't happen again,

342
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,920
and that this should be a priority. This should be something that's in a candidate's campaign

343
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,360
literature. This is what I think about pandemic preparedness, and it always should have been.

344
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,240
But we've gone through this cycle for a long, long time. You can think about anthrax in 2001,

345
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:37,720
bird flu scares in 2005, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, Ebola in 2013, 2014, Zika, right after that.

346
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,240
We've had multiple types of episodes, and you get this cycle where everybody runs to fund this

347
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,360
reactively, and then it disappears from the headlines, and no one remembers it. And then

348
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,680
the same cycle happens. They cut positions at the National Security Council when there's nothing

349
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,600
going on. And they do lots of things that make us less resilient to pandemics, not realizing that

350
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,160
this is a perpetual threat, just like any other national security concern, that you have to be

351
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,920
prepared for this at all times. And you have to actually think about it that way and fund it that

352
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,440
way and have the proper personnel, even between pandemics and between outbreaks.

353
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,040
But you are optimistic that this time, I mean, just based on the economic consequences of this,

354
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,400
even if not one more person were to die in the United States, which means frankly, let's be clear,

355
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,760
if not one more person died in the United States as of today, this would not be a major source of

356
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,800
mortality. This would still be a rounding error compared to influenza. But you're just saying the

357
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,680
economic consequences of this have been so severe that you're optimistic that we're not going to

358
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,240
walk away from this one in 18 months and sort of forget about it and do all the wrong stuff all

359
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,200
over again. Yeah, I do suspect we're going to have many more deaths, probably closer to that 60,000.

360
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,720
I do think that the fact that this outbreak touched people personally in a way that Ebola did not,

361
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,520
the way that Zika did not, the way even that H1N1 did not, H1N1 actually engendered complacency

362
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,120
because only about 12,000 Americans died. And then people said we all overreacted to H1N1. So I

363
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,200
think this is actually something that every American is feeling right now because of the

364
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,080
economic shutdown, the stay at home orders, all of that, the fact that they had to adjust their

365
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,400
entire life. This is something that's been extremely disruptive. And I think that hopefully

366
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,720
the public remembers that when they vote. And when they ask their policymakers about what their

367
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,280
plans are for the future, that pandemic preparedness becomes something that is a platform issue now.

368
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Based on where we are, what do you think is the right strategy in, for example,

369
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,720
a place like New York versus a place like you could pick any city you like, whether it be

370
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,640
Pittsburgh, Houston, cities where it's been nowhere near that. I mean, how would you start to think

371
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,120
about changing any of the policy or is the answer until we have more testing, we can't make any more

372
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,680
decisions? I do think based on modeling, if these symptoms are valid and what's going on in the

373
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,160
ground and hospitals, you can start to see this heterogeneity across the country. And not every

374
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,480
place is going to be New York City, not every place has that population density or hospitals

375
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,280
that are at the brink all the time. So I do think that there are places where you can start to think

376
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,240
about relaxing some of the social distancing recommendations as well as the economic shutdowns,

377
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,720
especially things like elective surgeries at hospitals and opening clinics at hospitals.

378
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,320
I think that already needs to happen, especially so in places where they're not

379
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,800
undated because you're going to get other health consequences that are not captured by the models,

380
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,600
which are really measurable and will pay for down the road. I do think you can look right now at

381
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,920
the governor's lists of what is an essential or a life sustaining business and what is not,

382
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,600
and look at who they're granting exemptions to and try to be a little bit broader about that.

383
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,400
Think about looking to see what your school system is like and can you open schools in a safe manner

384
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,400
right now based on what the conditions are in your area, because even the whole closure of schools

385
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,480
was very controversial and not supported by everybody in my field. So there are things

386
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,720
that you can do. And I do think it's not going to be one size fits all, it's going to be dependent on

387
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,040
what's going on locally, how much transmission do you have? What is the antibody status of your

388
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,680
population? What's your hospital capacity? And what is your ability to do diagnostic testing?

389
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,720
Do you have the new rapid test available in many different places? All of that can help condition

390
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,880
how we get back to normal or a new normal, because I do think that things like mass gatherings are

391
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,920
going to be very hard to have for some time until we have a vaccine, because I think a mass gathering

392
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,800
is kind of can put a town over the edge if they get multiple episodes of transmission at a mass

393
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,560
gathering. But I do think that we can start taking steps and I hope that we start doing it,

394
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,280
because this cost is something that is measurable and it increases every day. And I do think that

395
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,280
there are going to be consequences that are not captured by our models, which are really only

396
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,120
focused on coronavirus. Yeah, it's an interesting point you raised there with respect to mass

397
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,120
gatherings. I mean, I think the German data, which just came out basically last night, would suggest

398
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,960
that it's really the mass gatherings that are disproportionately driving the spread versus

399
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,560
two people having dinner at a restaurant. Is it your view that there's really something quite

400
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,800
devastating about concerts and live sporting events that is not necessarily captured in

401
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,240
going to the grocery store? Yeah, a mass gathering brings people from

402
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,040
wide geographic areas. If you think about, I live in Pittsburgh and there are Steeler fans that

403
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,800
come from everywhere in the country to watch a Steeler game and then they go back to their

404
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,160
hometowns. That's a way you can disperse things. And sporting games are not people sitting

405
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,440
quietly with just one person. They are social gatherings where people are yelling and screaming

406
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,760
and eating and drinking and all types of things that a virus would look at is an easy way to get

407
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,240
from one person to another. We know that when people shout and scream, they make particles

408
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,920
come out of their mouth. That can transmit. We've seen this at choir practice, for example,

409
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,280
with this coronavirus. Just think of that. It's at a football stadium and you can imagine how these

410
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,000
types of things can transmit. I do think that mass gatherings, because of the density, because of the

411
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,400
fact that people come from different geographic regions and then disperse, are a particular

412
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,760
problem when it comes to communicable infectious diseases. And we see this every year with,

413
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,600
for example, religious pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia, where they make sure that you have this

414
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,080
type of vaccination. They have a whole division of the World Health Organization devoted to mass

415
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,000
gatherings because we know what their role is in spreading infectious diseases. And I think that's

416
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,760
going to be something that's going to be a challenge to have until there is a vaccine.

417
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,560
And I want to go back to something you said about HKU1. Tell folks a little bit more about that

418
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,280
coronavirus and the concern it gives you. It's less of a concern that it gives me now,

419
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:27,080
but it's more of understanding what happens with coronaviruses. So go back to 2003 and SARS is the

420
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,000
first coronavirus that really hits the map as a pandemic threat before they're thought of as

421
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,640
common cold viruses. Now everyone's on the lookout for any new coronavirus. And what they do is,

422
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:41,960
in Hong Kong, HKU stands for Hong Kong University, they find a novel coronavirus in some individuals

423
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,040
that had pneumonia. And they start looking, they find more, they actually look at bank samples

424
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,400
that were negative for SARS, positive for HKU. They look at other countries, they find HKU1.

425
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,840
They actually find it in Cleveland. In the proportion of patients that were hospitalized

426
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:00,280
for coronavirus, HKU is disproportionately found, even in patients who died or on ventilators.

427
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,920
And it was basically everywhere you looked. That's interesting because it kind of flew under the

428
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,160
radar because no one knew it was there because we do such a poor job at testing for respiratory

429
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,240
viruses. Many times people go to the doctor and they say, Oh, you've got some virus. We don't know

430
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,520
which one, but you're going to get better. And that's even the case for pneumonias, because most

431
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,880
people don't get a specific microbiologic diagnosis of their pneumonia. So we really have this biological

432
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,240
dark matter everywhere. And I initially thought maybe this coronavirus was around hidden in our

433
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,480
cold and flu season. It clearly was hidden in China's cold and flu season since at least November.

434
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,480
But it doesn't appear, at least from what I've seen now, that there was much burden of that

435
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,360
in the United States prior to 2020, that this might have been something that really only began

436
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,320
in earnest in January. But I would not be surprised if you find a bank sample that there were cases

437
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,720
in December that were mixed in just like with HKU1. But I do think we would have noticed if there

438
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,520
was a lot of these people getting really ill and ending up on ventilators and were flu negative and

439
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,000
not negative and negative for everything else. At least enough of them would have raised some alarm

440
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,640
bells, I would hope. But I do think that's an important lesson to think about with a virus

441
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,720
that can spread surreptitiously. And you don't know about it because our diagnostic

442
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,400
curiosity is so bad for many infectious disease syndromes.

443
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,720
Yeah, that's a nice way of putting it, poor diagnostic curiosity. Have you been following

444
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,200
the sort of natural experiment that's going on in Sweden? Natural experiment meaning there's no

445
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,800
randomization, but rather Sweden has sort of elected to not shut down to the extent that other

446
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,240
European and Scandinavian countries have. Have you paid attention to the transmissibility in Sweden?

447
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,360
Do you have any comments on it?

448
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,680
I've looked a little bit at what Sweden is doing where they're trying to pursue a herd immunity

449
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,760
strategy. And I do think that you're going to see more cases there, which is what they're aiming

450
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,880
for. I'm just worried because their per capita ICU bed numbers are not very high. And that's what

451
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,280
we're really worried about is, do you put an ICU into crisis? Do you have problems with ventilators?

452
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,360
And I think it will be really instructive to see if they can get through this because I know they

453
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,000
have a steep curve of infections. But it's all going to depend upon who's getting sick and how

454
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,360
well they can sequester their high risk groups, which I think is very daunting and challenging.

455
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,520
I'm all for cocooning the elderly and those with other medical conditions. But I know it's very

456
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,920
challenging because they have to interact with other people to get their food, to do other things.

457
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,160
And that can be really challenging. So I do think that everybody's eyes are on Sweden to see if this

458
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,520
type of thing can work. But I'm worried about how challenging it might be for them because there is

459
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,880
that group of people that are going to get hospitalized and could put a hospital into crisis.

460
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,920
Last thing I want to ask you is what role do you think masks are going to play as we start to

461
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,600
slowly ease restrictions in the coming months? Do you think that we kind of got off to a bad

462
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,440
start on understanding the potential benefit of an N95 mask for people in public who are otherwise

463
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,720
at relatively low risk? So this is controversial in my field. And I tend to be someone who's not

464
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,920
someone supportive of masks by the public, especially not N95 masks, which I think are

465
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,480
in short supply, unclear whether the public can actually bear wearing them for a long period of

466
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,840
time because they're not comfortable to wear. And really what we saw in the beginning was a

467
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,920
recommendation to not wear masks for the general public because it wasn't going to protect you

468
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,840
from getting infected to one that's transitioned to wear a mask so that you don't infect other

469
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,480
people. So I would say if someone is sick, if they have a cough, if they have a fever, if they're

470
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,040
sneezing or a sore throat, they should be wearing a mask when they're out in public. Question is,

471
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,640
are people who are asymptomatic having no symptoms, how transmissible are they if they don't wear a

472
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,440
mask? And this is an open question, but CDC made a recommendation for people to use homemade masks

473
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,200
in that event. And I'm not sure how well those homemade masks prevent you from spreading it if

474
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,680
you are one of those asymptomatic persons, because they don't even stop the coughs and sneezes very

475
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,480
well based on some studies that have been published. So I'm someone who doesn't necessarily think

476
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,280
that these masks are going to be very beneficial. And they could be paradoxically negative because

477
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,920
people may then refrain from washing their hands as much. They may not social distance as much.

478
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,080
They may contaminate other people with their mask if they don't store it properly or wash it.

479
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,160
So I have a lot of concerns about masks. But I think that this is a decision that's going to be

480
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,400
made on a political basis. And there is enough scientific controversy that I think politicians

481
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,160
may use it as a way to move forward in a way that allows us to open schools, open businesses up if

482
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,400
they have people wearing masks. But I'm not sure if we'll get much benefit from them. But it is

483
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,280
something that's going to be an object of controversy for some time in the field.

484
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,840
What are you most optimistic about today?

485
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,960
I would say that I'm most optimistic about the fact that we have seen plateauing in New York,

486
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,440
Seattle, California, we've heard about for example, California actually taking ventilators

487
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,600
and giving them to other states. We've heard about Washington State dismantling their field

488
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,240
hospital that they made that did not see any patients. We've heard about Washington returning

489
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,280
ventilators, Chijic National Stockpile, all of that makes me very optimistic that we will be

490
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,360
able to meet the challenge of this virus without putting any of our hospitals into crisis,

491
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,120
that this is going to be a severe challenge for this country, but it's not something that

492
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,520
that is going to break the country. And it's not going to be cataclysmic. So all of those types of

493
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,040
things, which are not well reported, the fact that ventilators are going back to the stockpile,

494
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,440
or that field hospitals are closing, I think that makes me optimistic because there is a narrative

495
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,800
that's rightly focused on areas like New York and New Orleans and Chicago and Detroit. But you also

496
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,720
have to tell the good stories that there are places that were preparing for a surge. And now

497
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,400
they're downsizing their nursing staff because less people came. So I think that that's an

498
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,840
important part to know that it's not going to be doom and gloom in every place and that we need to

499
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,080
help New York and New Orleans and Detroit and Chicago get through this, but not every city is

500
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,440
going to have that experience. So we're going to learn from those experiences. And I think,

501
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,400
hopefully, we'll get to a better pandemic resiliency position after this. So I am

502
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,880
generally more optimistic than most people in my field, I think.

503
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,040
Mesh, thank you very much for all of your insight today. I'd like to reserve the right to invite you

504
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,040
back when the dust has settled and we have much more time to talk about what a true preparedness

505
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:55,320
strategy would look like. Because again, I do have a significant fear that as visceral and palpable

506
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,520
and disturbing as all of this is today, both in terms of the physical suffering, but the fear,

507
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,520
the economic devastation, that we're a species that is relatively hardwired to have remarkable

508
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,040
amnesia. I don't know. I think it would be an unmitigated disaster if two years from now we're

509
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,680
sitting here and this is not at all a topic of discussion and someone like you is not able to

510
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:25,240
command the type of audience of policymakers to do what's necessary. So I hope that we can have

511
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,720
that longer discussion when there are fewer fires burning, but when I think the stakes are equally

512
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,000
high. Thank you.
