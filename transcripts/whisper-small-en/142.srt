00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,360
today's episode. I guess this week is Robert Abbott. Robert is a documentary filmmaker. He's

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,800
a director, an amazing storyteller. He's a six time Emmy award winning producer and a director

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,840
with over 30 years of experience in sports and entertainment for that matter. He's the co-creator

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,040
of E60 on ESPN. He's also the director of the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, The Last Days of Night,

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,000
looking at the untold story behind the scenes, story of Bobby Knight and the events that

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,040
ultimately led to his termination from Indiana University. I wanted to talk to Robert for reasons

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,680
I will explain in this podcast because you may be wondering what the heck does this have to do

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,880
with longevity or anything that has to do with living better. And the short answer is I can't

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,520
really explain that in a sentence or two, but it becomes very clear throughout this episode why I

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,960
wanted to talk with Robert, who I would consider to be one of the experts now on sort of Bobby

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Knight. We talk about a lot of things here, but most of it really is about the investigative work

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,560
that went into The Last Days of Night. And of course, some of the things that Robert learned

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,800
along the way and basically the 15 years of his career prior to that and why I think that prepared

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,360
him to be the right person to do this. There's one note I want to make before we jump into this,

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,400
which is there is a lot of profanity in this. That's just the nature of what this episode is

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,920
about. So it's a little graphic at times and there is quite a bit of profanity. So I just want

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,160
folks to be aware of that. If that upsets them in any way, shape or form, I apologize. And without

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:36,800
further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Robert Mavitt. Hey Robert, it's awesome to sit

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,520
down with you today. You're one of the few people that I just sort of randomly reached out to who

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,000
actually responded to me. So I was super excited that day when I sent you a direct message on

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Twitter and then next day you said, yeah, let's chat. And I really appreciate it because I know

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,760
responding to random strangers is always buyer beware. I'm really excited to do this because

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,320
once you reached out to me, I listened to some of your podcasts and I said I'd love to do it. So

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm ready to go. We're going to talk a lot today about a guy named Bobby Knight, who I suspect

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,680
most people listening to this know a little bit about or maybe even know a lot about. And I

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,880
suspect some of these people will have even seen the unbelievable documentary that you

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,240
produced with ESPN the last days of night, which we'll get to in significant detail. But I think

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,720
to understand the work that you did there, maybe people need a bit more of an understanding of who

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,400
you are as a journalist and some of the other things that you have done. So I'll start with

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,320
perhaps the most pedestrian of questions, but what drew you to journalism? Growing up, I was always

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,400
a fan of sports and I watched a lot of TV. So I think it was natural that I got into sports

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,120
television. I went to Florida State University. I was, to be honest, in my early life golf drove

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,320
my life. I was a competitive golfer. I played in the future Masters, Junior Orange Bowl, Tournament

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,560
of Champions, all the major tournaments for young people, her juniors. And I decided to walk on and

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,760
try to play for Florida State. So I went there for golf. That lasted about a year. It was just so

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
much work and I got redshirted, played in a couple tournaments. And once I gave it up, I got into

45
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,160
media performance or the communications department at Florida State University. And specifically media

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,760
communications was media performance. I wanted to be an on-air kind of sportscaster. And I took a

47
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,200
journalism class, ironically, at Florida A&M University. Florida State didn't offer it. And I

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,760
was just fascinated by it. It interested me. I never thought that's where my career would go. My

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,560
career started once I graduated. I had done an internship at CNN Sports. And I had done one at a

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,280
local TV station. So the day after I graduated, I started at the local TV station as a cameraman,

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,360
an editor, an on-air reporter. I was like the nighttime reporter. They would send me to city

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,640
commission meetings and a lot of things that bored me to death. And I would always be like, send me to

53
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,000
the high school football game, send me to the high school basketball game or the college game. So I

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,360
always wanted to gravitate to sports. I got laid off ironically from that first job. They canceled

55
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,720
the 11 o'clock news, got rid of three quarters of the staff. They decided to play MASH reruns instead

56
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,100
because they would get the same commercial dollars in for MASH. And they didn't have to fund a 30

57
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,440
person newsroom. So I went back to CNN. I started there as an associate producer, then a producer.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,760
And I started to gravitate into becoming a storyteller. First and foremost, I love sports.

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,400
And the drama of sports and the stories of sports. But after I covered a number of World Series

60
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Masters, you name the event, that became boring. And I don't want to say unfulfilling, but who wins

61
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,440
and loses is pretty simple. And I always wanted to go deeper. I always wanted to go deeper. So I

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,880
started doing profiles, becoming a feature producer, traveling around the country and spending time with

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,040
people. I just love the psychology of sports, what makes someone great, what they have to sacrifice

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,840
to give it up. And that's kind of what shaped my early career at CNN. Was there ever an experience

65
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,280
where you were deciding, okay, I'm going to do a profile on such and such an athlete, and you finally

66
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,360
get to meet them. And there's a letdown because of either just their personality and doesn't match

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,400
what you expected or the depth or introspection that you would be hoping is there isn't there.

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,800
I would say I've had that experience myself, not just with athletes, frankly, sometimes with people

69
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,240
in other professions where when you don't know them, you create a persona of them that's probably

70
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,600
unfair. You meet them and you're sort of like, that's arguably the most uninteresting person I've

71
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,800
ever met. Did you ever have that experience with athletes when you were doing this? Dozens of times,

72
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,280
countless times. Interestingly, I started at CNN, excuse me, sports in 1987. On around 91,

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,640
they wanted me to go up and head up the New York Bureau. That fell through at the last minute. And

74
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,640
my boss at the time, Jim Walton, called me in and said, hey, I'm sorry, it fell through. I really

75
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,360
wanted that to happen. Would you be interested in covering the Olympics? And I said, sure.

76
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,240
I grew up as a kid watching the Olympics, watching Olga Corbett and Adia Komenic, all of the

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,160
profiles. And I didn't realize this until I was much older, probably in my 40s, maybe even my 50s.

78
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
How much of an impact that had on me. Like I sat in front and I was fascinated by their human

79
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,440
stories, which Rune Arledge did, Dick Ebersol has since done. And when I got that job, exactly what

80
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,600
you said came true. It was my dream job. And I went and met a number of these Olympic athletes.

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,240
And I want to say more often than not, that may be a little unfair, but to become great,

82
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,000
many of them were one dimensional. And they weren't interesting to me. They were either

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,960
speed skaters, skated in a circle for six hours a day, went home rested and came back and skated

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,160
for two more hours, or weight lifters. I remember I did some pieces on some weight lifters and I'm

85
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,840
like, what do you do? What do you do for fun? And they wake up at six and they have their workout,

86
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,440
then they go and eat, then they rest, then they work out again. And doing those in the early years,

87
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,200
when I did a lot of profiles for the Olympics, I remember the people who fascinated me because

88
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,720
they were just different. And I realized that's what I'm drawn to. People have a story to tell.

89
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,840
The way I describe it is, I'm only interested in a story if it's an onion.

90
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,440
If you can just peel off layer after layer after layer after layer, and the more layers you can

91
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,400
peel off, the more interested that character is to me. I did a piece on a swimmer, Gary Hall Jr.

92
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,760
lived out in Phoenix, and he was just a free spirit. He had taken a VW bus and redone it.

93
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
And I found that fascinating. We shot it. It's very visual.

94
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,880
He would wear a boxing robe out in shadow box on the blocks.

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,480
He was just a character, and I loved him. And I loved the three, four days I spent with him.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
And one day we were there and I said, well, what do you do? He goes, I skateboard a lot. And he's

97
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,440
like, hey, let's bust my little brother out of school. So we rode along with him as he walked

98
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
into the principal's office and said, hey, my brother has a doctor's appointment. I need to

99
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,800
get him out and need to get him out now. And he came and we were skateboarding and his little

100
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,920
brother was holding on to the bumper of his VW bus as we're rolling down the street. And guys

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,200
like Gary Hall Jr. fascinated me. And so I always gravitated to people like that. I did early on in

102
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,440
91, the winner of 91 for the 92 Winter Olympics. I went up and did, I spent some time with the

103
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,760
Jamaican bobsled team, hung out with them. It was just great because there were a bunch of

104
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,400
characters. Did a story on Prince Albert who drove for Monaco, their bobsled team, the Latvian

105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,640
bobsled team, because the wall had just come down, communism had ended. And I didn't know this,

106
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,360
but most of the gold medal winning drivers for Russia were Latvian. So for the first time in

107
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,120
their life, they had pride. They're like, if we win a medal, it's for Latvian, not for the Soviet

108
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Union. So when you peel away the layers, that's what interested me as a storyteller. I always

109
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,600
try to gravitate to stories like that. So let's say it's 91 and you're up and running on these

110
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,440
other things. By this point, bringing the story back to our main character, Bobby Knight,

111
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
he's already won three national championships, right? Bobby Knight at this point is probably

112
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,440
in his early fifties. He's coached the 84 Olympic men's team. So he's got a gold medal in three

113
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,080
national championships to his name, including that epic season. I forget which one it was,

114
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,760
maybe 77, 76 was the 75 when they went undefeated as well. 75 was they lost one and then 76, they

115
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,920
went undefeated. So how much were you paying attention to this guy, Bobby Knight back in the

116
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,960
early nineties? I was a sports fan as a kid in the 70s. So I don't remember the undefeated season,

117
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,320
but I do remember Isaiah Thomas winning the national title in 81. I do remember him coaching

118
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,680
the Olympic team in 84. I remember vividly reading John Feinstein's book, A Season on the Brink.

119
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,120
I just graduated college. I love to read books and I read a number of not just in sports. I read

120
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,840
everything on the Vietnam War. I could get my hands on across the board. And I remember grabbing

121
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:46,320
that book and devouring it in a few days. And I was fascinated by him. He would, in the book,

122
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
Feinstein painted a picture where Knight would ride somebody, I believe it was Darryl Thomas,

123
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
and call him a pussy and you have got no guts or whatever. And then Thomas would go back to his

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,280
locker and he'd open it and there'd be a box of tampons in there. And I was just like, whoa,

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,560
I couldn't believe what I was reading. And yet, as I thought about it at the time, and this is,

126
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,480
the book came out in 87. As I thought about it, the book ends, Feinstein ends with a line that says,

127
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,520
it always comes back to the question that ends justify the means. And I remember closing the

128
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,360
book and in my own mind saying, yes, he's won three national titles, an Olympic gold medal,

129
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,640
and I've never heard a player speak negatively about him. So when I closed that book, I said,

130
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,200
yes, the ends do justify the means. I had no idea that 13 years later, my boss would give me an

131
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,200
assignment that ultimately I would be asking that same question and presenting it kind of to the

132
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,800
country. You see, to me, that's probably one of the most interesting coincidences of this story,

133
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,520
right? Is that that book comes out, as you said, it's sort of 87, whatever you read it immediately.

134
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,680
And at that point in time, you see the part of the iceberg above the water, again, as you would

135
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,760
learn later, and we would all learn through your work, even in 87, there were plenty of indications

136
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,000
that there were players who had they been asked would have something different to say than maybe

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,520
what was presented. But I really love this thing that 13 years later, your world collides with this

138
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,480
guy in a way that you couldn't have imagined. And of course, in the intervening time, a lot would

139
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
happen. You would go on to cover the Atlanta Olympics, which in and of itself is kind of an

140
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,920
amazing story, not just because of the bombing, but all that went on there. So fast forward me

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,720
a little bit from call it 87 into the 90s. What else are you working on it? Perhaps more importantly,

142
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,640
how is it helping you prepare for what might turn into be one of the most difficult assignments of

143
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,360
your career? After reading that book and leaving the local station going back to CNN, covering a

144
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,440
lot of sports in the moment, and you name the event, I've covered it, and you have to turn stories

145
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,480
quickly, you know, a guy hits a home run in the bottom of the ninth, and within 30 minutes, you

146
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,680
have to have the story written and sent back to Atlanta and then to the world. As a journalist,

147
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,240
I learned to make decisions quickly, not always the right one, but you get a ton of at bats,

148
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,000
and you learn. I always, like I said earlier, gravitated toward telling the story of people,

149
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,240
and the psychology of people, and what makes them tick. I used to sit around, Nick Charles and I

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,360
traveled the world. He was the lead anchor in CNN sports. I remember vividly being at the

151
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,800
Cooperstown for the Baseball Hall of Fame and sitting on the back porch, and Nick loved his

152
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,920
wine, and he's having wine and cheese, and we're just talking, and we were knocking around names

153
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,680
of people we wanted to profile, and we talked about Bob Knight. We both wanted to go fishing

154
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,680
with him, wanted to hang out with him, just to see what made him tick and look inside, because

155
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,360
not knowing it at the time, but he was that onion to me that I knew if you peeled away layers that

156
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,440
he would be a fascinating character. Again, not knowing that in 1999, four, six, eight years later,

157
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,520
I would be asked to look into him. Prior to 1999, for the first handful of years I was at CNN,

158
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,200
I covered events, then I became a feature producer, the Olympic producer, and then I started getting

159
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,400
special projects. I did some documentaries for CNN. I did one on Title IX, which is about its,

160
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,880
you know, shoe leather reporting. They were getting rid of then-swim programs,

161
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,400
gymnastic programs to try to balance the scales of Title IX with football, so that was some long-form

162
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,320
storytelling where you spend a lot of time on a story. I also did one that I didn't know the

163
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,560
impact it would have until, actually, I did this film. I did a documentary called Field of Screens,

164
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,200
and it was about the first documentary was so successful for CNN, and we did it on such a small

165
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,880
budget that the documentary department for news wanted us to do more. The World Cup was coming to

166
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,320
the United States, and I was fascinated by soccer hooligans, and so I had pitched a story like,

167
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,680
is this going to be coming to America? I read the book Among the Thugs, if you've never read it,

168
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:22,480
it's a great read. It's a literary kind of editor who immersed himself among the soccer hooligans

169
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,200
in England and went into the psychology of how those riots start, and it was fascinating to me,

170
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,040
and that's what I wanted to do. But my bosses said, nah, it's not really going to translate to

171
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:44,720
an American audience, but the idea of fan violence in sports did. So my film became much more about

172
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,000
stalking, death threats. I went and we spent some time, Jim Hubert and I, with Mitch Williams,

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,120
who gave up the home run in game six to lose to the Toronto Blue Jays. He and his wife talked about

174
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,480
what it was like. This was the guy that played for the Phillies? Yes, he was the reliever,

175
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,040
wild thing, Mitch Williams. Yep, yep. A real character. Again, he peed all the way layers.

176
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,600
He was a character. He said what he would think, and to sit there and listen, we went out to a

177
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,200
ranch. He had a ranch out in Texas, and he and his wife were there explaining what those days were

178
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,000
like during the World Series. He had given up the home run. He was back at his home in New Jersey,

179
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,120
and he had gotten tons of death threats. His wife said, we lived in an old house and the floors

180
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,680
creaked. She said, I remember vividly him walking around with a gun in his hand, because the wind's

181
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,240
blowing outside and things are creaking and people have been outside the house. So I tried to take

182
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,320
people inside because we hear it. We hear somebody gets a death threat. It doesn't really sink in,

183
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,480
but to really have someone take you behind what that threat is and how it impacts them mentally

184
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,400
and emotionally was fascinating. The other thing I looked into is stalking. This was part of it.

185
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,920
It was kind of like why fans will riot after winning the World Series of the Super Bowl.

186
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,120
What will happen when a fan sends a death threat to an athlete? And the other one was stalking.

187
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,120
We looked at the Monica Seles stabbing. I ended up meeting two of the more fascinating people

188
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,520
I've ever interviewed. Dr. Park Dietz runs a threat assessment group in San Diego, and he's

189
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,720
the psychologist, psychiatrist, and I'm probably going to get his title wrong, who spent 40 hours

190
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,400
interviewing Jeffrey Dahmer so he could prove that what he did was sane, the thought process of what

191
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,160
he did so he couldn't use the insanity play. So just to talk to him over lunch was fascinating to

192
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,160
me. And the other one was Dr. Gavin De Becker. And at the time, he was the one that every star went

193
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,800
to if they got death threats or threatening mail. Madonna, Letterman, all the stars of that era.

194
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,560
And I followed the story of Katerina Witt, who was stalked for three years. So you ask me how

195
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,640
these things prepared me. This is, I spent nine months on this documentary. It wasn't

196
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,960
two days, three days, three weeks, three months. It was a long time. So these documentaries prepared

197
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,080
me in how to tell a story at an hour level, how to tell a story at a two hour level, all the different

198
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,960
places you could take kind of a narrative yard. So I had done those two documentaries at CNN.

199
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,800
Those two things probably prepared me the most for what the assignment I was going to get in 1999.

200
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:34,160
Now in the 90s, were there other examples that came to you that would ultimately serve as

201
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,400
basically reminders of this idea that the cost of excellence in sports, you know,

202
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,760
were there other examples of sports or athletes even that you covered where you could say, hey,

203
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,920
have we gone too far in society? Have we let this athlete or coach get away with things

204
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,800
simply on the basis of their greatness? And maybe we need to revisit that. I can think of a couple

205
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,240
of examples in retrospect, although I will admit at the time I was blind to it. Who came to your

206
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,880
mind? Who are the two that came to your mind? I think Mike Tyson comes to my mind. I grew up as

207
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,080
a huge boxing fan, like lived for boxing. Absolutely the single most important thing

208
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,920
in my life from the age of 13 onward. When you think about the Mike Tyson of the late 80s and

209
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,560
early 90s, I mean an incredible talent who was completely out of control. And in retrospect,

210
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,640
of course, now with the wisdom of being an old man, it's a very clear understanding of what a

211
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,520
traumatic childhood he had and how that childhood would produce a knife that is very sharp on two

212
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,120
sides. Right. On the one hand, it made him an unbelievably rage filled fighter and he built up

213
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,320
an armor to make sure he could never be hurt again. But without fixing any of the underlying

214
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,360
problems, he basically was going to be a nonstop hurting machine outside the ring as well.

215
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,440
That's certainly one example that comes to me. I think the other one, just sort of looking back

216
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,520
would probably be Tiger Woods. I don't follow golf that closely, but when you look at everything

217
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,000
that sort of unfolded in Tiger's life, call it 10 years ago, you get the sense that this guy who

218
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,480
was such a prodigy may not have had enough people around him that could say, Hey, let's revisit how

219
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,120
you're going to sort of live your life. And things probably just got out of control. But again,

220
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,160
when you're so dominant and you're winning and the money is there and the titles are there,

221
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,120
I think it's easy to overlook these things. So I guess I'm not saying these things to be critical

222
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,400
of the athletes. I'm saying them more as with a little bit of wisdom, I look back and go, huh,

223
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,800
that's interesting. And of course, Knight, I think will end up being arguably one of the most

224
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,160
extreme examples of that. Kind of goes back a little bit to the onion where people,

225
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,840
why do you like Andre Agassi, but not Pete Sampras, because people whose great moments and

226
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,960
worst moments aren't separated by that much are not as fascinating, but you get somebody like

227
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,480
Knight who in one area is brilliant and a genius. And he's exceptional at so many different things.

228
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:12,640
And he's so flawed and others. That's why people like Tiger, Tyson and Knight fascinated me. I

229
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,040
didn't spend any time around Mike Tyson. We had a group that did a lot of our boxing. Ironically,

230
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,840
I was going to go out for the Tyson Holofield fight, but when he got arrested and incarcerated

231
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,000
for rape, that fight never happened. That was going to be my first time out there. But when

232
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,400
he got out of prison, I did a show for ESPN of him returning to the ring. And I was fascinated by him.

233
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,480
And to this day I am. I have a curiosity, I think like you, into what the environment and the

234
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,400
situation that forms these people. There's things that, as you eloquently said, that it sharpens the

235
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,320
knife and it's on both sides, good and bad. And I always wonder with Mike, if he was surrounded by

236
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,920
better people, would his better character traits have come to the surface? I think you've seen

237
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,480
Mike in the last five to 10 years that he does have a sensitive side. He does have a caring side.

238
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,720
He's not a horrible monster, but there was years where he acted that way. When I did that

239
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,120
documentary, I spoke to the president of HUO Sports at the time. And after the interview ended,

240
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,480
he told some stories of Mike and his guys renting hotel rooms, suites in Philadelphia,

241
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,880
and just marching as many women through there as they could in a three-day span. Told you things

242
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,880
that the general public didn't know what was going on. And he was surrounded by people. I think the

243
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,720
challenge is when you're a cash cow for everyone, they're worried about you making money. They're

244
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,880
not really worried about you and the underlying things that you need to work on that you mentioned.

245
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Because that doesn't make them money. They want to get as much money out of you as they can.

246
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:02,640
So they're going to let you do what you want until that gravy train of money runs dry. And I think

247
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,560
that's sadly what happened to Mike with Don King or Rory Holloway. I always felt that when you go

248
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,880
back to the beginning of Tyson's career, I mean, look, there's probably nobody who was able to

249
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,240
look at him purely as a person, including custom auto, who was really a father figure to him. But

250
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,000
there was a guy back involved in his life early on, Steve Lott. Most people probably wouldn't

251
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,280
recognize that name unless they're real aficionados of Tyson history back in the mid 80s. But I always

252
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,400
felt like Steve Lott was probably along with maybe even Teddy Atlas were kind of people that

253
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,000
could have kept Tyson on the straight and narrow. He was also managed by these two guys that were

254
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,840
ridiculously shrewd and created kind of a grotesque deal where they took a third of his purses, which

255
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,840
was legally permitted, but obviously by any stretch of the imaginations, completely disgusting. But one

256
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,120
of the two Tyson did have a fond affection for a guy named Jimmy Jacobs who died in early 88. The

257
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,040
other guy, Bill Catean, he had no relationship with. And I always felt that the end of Tyson

258
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,600
was actually the death of Jacobs because DeMato died in 85. He'd already by that point,

259
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,080
kicked Teddy Atlas out of the camp. Actually, DeMato did, which was a huge mistake. He'd canned

260
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,480
Steve Lott on the basis of Don King sort of brainwashing him and then Jimmy Jacobs dies. And then

261
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,200
this is all before the Sphinx fight. The Sphinx fight was really the last fight, in my opinion,

262
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
where he went in as a great fighter and everything thereafter was sort of downhill.

263
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,560
Let's turn to Bobby Knight. Let's talk about when this first became the lead thing for you. So is it

264
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,200
easier, I guess, maybe you could give people a little bit of the history of what's happening

265
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,600
tonight in the 90s and then how you're getting brought into it. He won his last national

266
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:59,360
championship in the late 80s. And in the 90s, he still had good teams, 20 win seasons,

267
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,240
but he started getting bounced in the first or second round of the tournament. And again,

268
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,560
other than being a sports fan, I was never assigned to cover him. I was never, but I followed it like

269
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,880
probably the rest of America. You kind of just kept waiting for him to get that player or get that

270
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,600
sign of class that would put him back on top. He had gone from 76 to 81 to 87. There's five to

271
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,880
six years in between each of those. So in the early 90s, you're like, oh, he's going to come back. And

272
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:39,040
he just wasn't. And other than just being a sports fan, he really wasn't on my radar. Then in 1999,

273
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,960
Luke Rector announces he's leaving Indiana. For those people who don't know, Luke Rector was the

274
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,920
leading scorer, got the most minutes. He was kind of the star of the team. What year was he in?

275
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:59,200
Sophomore? He was after his sophomore season, he did leave. That's when my boss, Steve Robinson,

276
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,040
I was at this point at CNN, I did the Olympics, I did special projects, and then wherever they needed

277
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,360
me, because I like variety, I get bored doing the same thing all the time. So, hey, you need somebody

278
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,680
to cover the World Series. I'll go. If you need me to do this, I'll go, hey, if somebody's going

279
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,920
on vacation, you need a line producer in the studio. They'd plug me in there for three weeks.

280
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:25,840
So I had variety. I had come back from a site survey in Sydney, Australia for the 2000 Olympics.

281
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,080
I went ahead a year in advance to set everything up for CNN. And I had just gotten back and my boss

282
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,480
said, oh, what do you want to do? We're just talking about it. I don't know, a day or two later,

283
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,680
Steve called me in the office and said, hey, Luke Rector just left Indiana. And we talked about it.

284
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,280
And he said, why don't you look in to why? He's the third McDonald's high school all American in

285
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,800
the last two and a half years to leave the program. And he's the most popular player there, getting the

286
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,480
most minutes. Normally, somebody who's unhappy leaves a program. Your leading scorer usually

287
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,720
doesn't leave. And I remember sitting in Steve's office, not being very excited at all about this

288
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,120
assignment. I was just like, it's going to be a waste of time. Steve and I talked about how we

289
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,560
thought it may be more of a story on AAU basketball, and how these athletes are coming out of high

290
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:25,280
school with inflated egos, big sense of themselves. And they can't play for a guy like Coach Knight

291
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,560
anymore. They have a sense of entitlement. So we thought the story may kind of focus on that.

292
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,360
The explosion of AAU basketball, how these guys are stars now at 16, 17 and 18. And they're not

293
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,800
willing to be coached in college anymore. I vividly remember walking out across the newsroom

294
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,720
of Steve's office back to my desk, just not being that excited, thinking it's going to be a waste of

295
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,440
time. And maybe for the listener, Robert, give people a bit of background on Bobby Knight's

296
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,360
coaching philosophy, starting at West Point, himself obviously winning a national title,

297
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
really being a guy that coaches a team, not a star, even though stars came out of the program.

298
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,160
What about his coaching style led you to the conclusion that, hey, a 16 year old high school

299
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,200
star might just be not willing to be coached under that system. What was your preconceived idea?

300
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,920
I thought what I think most people in America thought is these guys just aren't tough enough.

301
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,560
Coach Knight came out of Orville, Ohio. He went to Ohio State and he was a role player on their

302
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,800
national championship team with John Havillacek, Lucas, et cetera. And shortly after that, he went

303
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,600
on to army to coach by the age of 24. He was the head coach at army. And then from there,

304
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,920
he went on to Indiana and he very much took what he learned at army and applied it. The sense of,

305
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm going to break you down to nothing and then build you back up into the person I want you to be.

306
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,240
So he was hard on players. It was team before I or me or you. It was very much about his system.

307
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,520
It was very much about unselfish basketball, playing defense, moving your feet. It was about

308
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,280
sharing the basketball. It was about there's no stars on my team. Other than Isaiah Thomas,

309
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,680
I mean, the 76 team had a lot of great players, but Isaiah Thomas was probably, I don't want to

310
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,640
offend anybody who went to IU, probably the only transcendent player that went there. Isaiah was a

311
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,400
little different, but the 87 team, again, they had Steve Alford, et cetera, but there was no

312
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,560
superstar talents. So Knight was all about team basketball and he was very hard. The portrait I

313
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,400
had of Knight in my head and the knowledge I had of him and the assignment, it just kind of added

314
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,760
up that these kids weren't tough enough. They're wimps. They're soft. They're pampered. They're

315
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,720
entitled and they couldn't take it. And that's kind of the message that was put out when they

316
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,880
left. Year and a half, two years earlier, Neil Reed had left and they said he wasn't tough enough.

317
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,160
And then Jason Collier had left and then there's whispers and rumors of why, et cetera. And then

318
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,600
it wasn't until Wrecker left that my boss said, wait a second, something's going on up there. And

319
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,120
Steve had a great sense. Steve Robinson had come from Sports Illustrated when CNN and Sports

320
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,360
Illustrated merged to create CNNSI, a sports network. And he had headed up their investigations

321
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,000
for the magazine. So he had a great sense for news. It wasn't me. I didn't think this was a story he

322
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,200
did. And he said, go look into it. And so that's the mindset I took into it. I knew who Knight was.

323
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,200
I knew how hard he was on players. And I just thought what I was going to find out is these

324
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,960
guys just didn't want to do it. And they wanted to go somewhere where a coach would just roll out

325
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,760
the basketballs, let him play, let him be the star, not play defense, maybe not even work as hard.

326
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,120
So I wasn't excited. I didn't think there was anything there. So when you show up, is Wrecker

327
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,240
already gone? Yes. Is Reed still playing at this point in time? And Reed went to where? Reed went

328
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
to Kentucky, if I recall, right? Reed went to, he was recruited by Kentucky, but he went to Southern

329
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,720
Miss. Okay. And Collier was already gone as well. He had gone to Georgia Tech to play for Bobby

330
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:36,880
Cremins. So Reed, when I called him, he had just finished at Southern Miss. Collier was playing at

331
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,080
Georgia Tech. And Wrecker was transferring at the time he was going to go to Arizona,

332
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,480
got in a horrible accident in Colorado. He decided to stay closer to home. So he enrolled at Iowa

333
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,600
after I started looking into it. So Steve called me into the office the morning after the announcement

334
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:03,520
that Wrecker left. Interestingly, Wrecker faxed in notice to Coach Knight at midnight,

335
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,120
sent a fax at midnight saying, I'm not returning. It happened to be when Coach

336
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,520
Knight was leaving for a trip for Cuba. And it was just like, that's a weird way to say I'm leaving.

337
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,680
That interested me a little bit. So the next morning, my boss says, Hey, do you see the news?

338
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,400
Luke Wrecker just left. Start making some phone calls, go up there and try to figure out what's

339
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,920
going on. Why are really good players leaving Indiana and Bob Knight's program? That was the

340
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,880
assignment. And what I've learned since then is all great investigative assignments start with

341
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,920
a really simple question. Why did somebody break into the Democratic National Headquarters?

342
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,840
That led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. It's a simple question. And my simple question was,

343
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,280
Steve said, go find out why good players are leaving Coach Knight's program. And it was as

344
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,840
simple as that. It wasn't an investigation. It's just a question. And we thought it would take us

345
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:09,680
down this society kind of a look at society entitlement. It was not an investigation at all

346
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,680
at the start. But it became an investigation with a couple of my first phone calls. I did a lot of

347
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,400
reading. Two days later, it was a Sunday night. I called and Neil Reed's dad picked up and he and I

348
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,800
talked. And he didn't hold anything back. Terry told me everything. And this was off the record

349
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,200
or on the record. It was off the record. Again, I was just trying to understand the story.

350
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,000
And then I called Neil that Sunday night. And Neil and I talked for about 90 minutes. And in the film,

351
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,960
for those people who haven't seen it, I saved everything. I can't tell you, I probably had a

352
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,440
dozen notebooks from the 18 months I reported this, where I took notes on people's phone calls and

353
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,800
everything. And I saved them all. They were in a box in my basement for 15 years. And when I did the

354
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,680
film, I went back and just opened the box, sat here in my office with three cameras on me, and

355
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,960
just went through every single thing I pulled out. It took like six or seven hours. And it just

356
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,600
refreshed my memory and it became the spine of the film. So Terry Reed spoke to me and then Neil

357
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:23,200
spoke to me. And what did Neil tell you on that first call? He told me why he went to Indiana.

358
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,080
He loved Indiana. His father was a basketball coach. His father, much like Coach Knight, was a

359
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:37,840
hard ass. His father admired, I think probably loved Coach Knight's style. And Terry was very

360
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:46,720
much a coach in the mold of Bob Knight. So much so that the family moved to Bloomington for Neil's

361
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,160
beginning of his high school years, freshman and sophomore. Then he moved back to Louisiana. Neil

362
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,760
became two-time state player of the year. He never made another visit. He knew he was always

363
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,520
going to go to Coach Knight. He wanted to play for Coach Knight. Neil was a tough-minded kid.

364
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,320
The tougher it was, the tougher he got. He wanted to go to Coach Knight, play for Coach Knight

365
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
because he wanted to go play for somebody who's going to push him and make him better.

366
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:23,280
And he told me, you could just tell the love he had for Indiana basketball and specifically Coach

367
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,320
Knight. And that's why he went there. And then we started talking about why he left. And he just

368
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,280
took me through his three seasons there. And he started painting a picture of what it was like

369
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,200
day after day after day after day. There was three things that stuck out to me that became the spine

370
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,120
of my reporting in 1999 and 2000 when I was at CNN. One was that at a practice one day,

371
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,520
they were running a drill. Larry Richardson was a big man. And Coach Knight had always taught Neil

372
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,680
the point guard, hey, talk to your team. Command their presence. Command their attention. You're

373
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,320
running it. And he always wanted him to talk to the players during the play. So they ran this play

374
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,280
where Neil threw a bounce pass into Larry Richardson. Larry made the layup. And Coach

375
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
was like, that's great, Larry. That's great, great. And then Coach Knight laid into Neil.

376
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,320
Why the hell didn't you call out his name? Why didn't you talk to him? Why didn't you

377
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,120
basically direct him to what to do? He gave all this praise to Larry and then just laid into Neil

378
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:38,720
in kind of an unrelenting fashion that was Coach Knight's style. And Neil said, I did. And Knight

379
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,880
was like, no, you didn't. Yes, I did. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. And then Neil made the mistake.

380
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,360
If you look at it as a mistake to say, Larry, did I? And Larry Richardson said, yes, you did.

381
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,480
And that embarrassed Coach Knight. And that's when Coach Knight, according to Neil at this time,

382
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,360
came at him and grabbed him by the throat. That story interested me because if it was true,

383
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,560
it's an assault. I kept talking to Neil about the aftermath and other things that had happened.

384
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,240
And he told me two other stories that jumped off the pages of my notes. One was

385
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,240
that one time he had kicked the president of the University Miles brand out of practice.

386
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Anybody who's been around Indiana basketball knows that practices are closed.

387
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,600
You're not allowed in there and let's Coach Knight let you. There's a padlock and a chain

388
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,800
on the doors. No one's allowed in to see what he does. So one day the University president was

389
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,600
there, brought some people in on a tour and was kind of talking out loud to hit the group that he

390
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:48,640
was with. And Coach Knight said something to the effect of shut the F up. I don't come into your

391
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,520
office and talk while you're trying to work. Get the hell out of here. And Miles brand and the

392
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,040
people who were with got up and left. And looking back, I don't think Coach Knight like literally

393
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,320
got in his face and said it. I think he said it out loud for the whole gym to hear. He may have

394
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,800
not even been looking at Coach Brand, but the message was sent. At that point I was like,

395
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,560
holy shit, you've got the balls to throw the president out of practice. Like who's running

396
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,480
this school? And then the third story Neil told me is one time they were playing real poorly

397
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,440
and they were in the locker room and Coach Knight came out of a bathroom stall with his pants

398
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,640
around his ankles with toilet paper in his hand. And he had wiped himself and he showed the toilet

399
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,000
paper to the players and said, this is how you guys are playing. You're playing like shit. And

400
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,680
he brandished soiled toilet paper to the team. And those three stories, I mean, jumped off

401
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,160
A, my notes that night and jumped through the phone in the 90 minute call we had. So I had this

402
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,480
all on background off the record, not for attribution, but as I wrote in my note to my

403
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,080
boss, Steve, I said to him and I read it in the film, I go, I think he's going to tell me this

404
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,880
on the record one day. And so that first phone call that I made to Neil Reed, and when he picked

405
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,240
up the phone, all of a sudden it turned from a story in my mind about society entitlement of A,

406
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,360
you pass cabal players, are they willing to be coached? Is night too tough to an investigation?

407
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,920
Did these three things happen? Can I confirm that these three incidents took place?

408
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,400
So when you get off that phone call, what does your intuition tell you? Does your intuition say

409
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,640
this kid is making this up? He's a disgruntled former player. Or does your intuition say,

410
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,600
this is possibly right? The ends no longer justify the means. Which way are you leaning at this point?

411
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,320
50-50, because exactly what you said ran through my mind. I'm like, he's probably disgruntled. Is he

412
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,680
exaggerating? Did it really happen? But he described them in such detail that there was

413
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,560
a lot of validity to what he said. And again, part of what I've learned is if you're going to do a

414
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,960
good investigation, you can't get too excited and you can't get too down. Like you just have to be

415
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,560
even keel. And the one thing I'm proudest of is during this process, I just kept my nose to the

416
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,680
grindstone. I never really looked up. We can talk later. There's three times I kind of popped my

417
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,880
head up and saw what was happening. But the rest of the time when I got off that phone call,

418
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,200
exactly what you said was rushing through my mind. Is he a disgruntled player who's out to get coach

419
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,640
night? Or is there truth to this? And that was kind of my mantra. And as I say in the film,

420
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,200
I got on a plane the next day, I talked to my boss and I'm like, I got to fly to Indiana.

421
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,600
And I'm looking out the window and I was like, is he lying to me? Is this kid lying to me or not?

422
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,160
As I looked out the window, that's what I was thinking. And I was also thinking that if he's

423
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,480
not, there's a story here. That's when I got interested. After that first phone call with

424
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,120
Neil, I said, I have to figure out if he's telling me the truth. And if he is telling me the truth,

425
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,280
how do I turn this into a story where people are willing to sit on camera and talk about it?

426
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,440
So where do you go from there? Do you go to Collier? Do you go to Wrecker? How do you,

427
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I assume they're going to be an easier place to start than any currently active player, right?

428
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,200
Basically what I did is I took a big step back and I said, I have to understand Indiana basketball.

429
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,800
The first person I interviewed is Gary Donner. He passed away just within the last two years.

430
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,720
And he's the first person I sat down with. And he started Hoosier Basketball Magazine. For those

431
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,000
people who don't follow high school and college basketball, it is the thing in the state of

432
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,520
Indiana. High school basketball is the heartbeat of that state. And he follows high school basketball.

433
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,640
Every season he puts out the definitive thing on high school basketball. So he knows all these

434
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,800
kids from seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth grade, all the way through high school. So when I spoke to

435
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,720
him, it was the first interview I did, he just told me what he knew about it. And what he said

436
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,960
that made my initial reporting and is also in the film is that Coach Knight is like Dr. Jekyll and

437
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Mr. Hyde. That he could be the most charming, brilliant person in the world. And then when he

438
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,120
gets behind the closed doors, I told you his practices are closed. When he gets behind the

439
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,880
closed doors, he can lose it and he wants nobody to see that side of him. And what you said earlier,

440
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
you'd see the tip of the iceberg, but you never saw the whole iceberg underneath. So everything

441
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,280
he told me led me to believe that there may be truth to what Neil said. But again, as a journalist,

442
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,720
Gary Donner wasn't there. So he can't confirm any of those stories, but he painted a picture in an

443
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,760
environment. I think there may be some validity to what he said. The other thing that gave me a

444
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,400
sense that what Neil may have said is true is because Gary Donner told me, he said, I've known

445
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,240
these kids, many of the in-state kids, and even the out-of-state kids who come there, he follows

446
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,200
recruiting so that they talk to him. A lot of them had gone to the school and they'd see him at an

447
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,360
event or a high school game and they just talked to him. What's it like? What was your time like?

448
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,280
So they talked to him because his magazine doesn't print that, right? So he just told me story after

449
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,800
story after story. So that was the baseline. That first interview kind of was foundational for me,

450
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,760
that it gave me a sense of what it's like and why the administration is afraid of coach Knight.

451
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,520
It didn't confirm what Neil said, but he painted a picture of an atmosphere where what Neil told me

452
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,480
now I understood that it may have happened and it could have, that environment exists.

453
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,880
Now look, it wasn't like Bobby Knight hadn't said and done things up until the point that we're

454
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,320
talking about now that weren't already putting in a mental league beyond what you're hearing from

455
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,880
from Neil Reed, right? I mean in 1988 he made an absolutely ridiculous statement to Connie

456
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,560
Chung on air that, I mean to this day I still can't believe a human would say that, let alone

457
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,080
a guy would say that and still have a job. You remember the statement of course? Yes, ironically

458
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,200
Connie Chung was doing a special on stress and they picked coach Knight because he has a stressful

459
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,600
job or whatever. Somehow the topic of rape came up and coach Knight said something to the effect of

460
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,880
if rape is inevitable, lay back and enjoy it. And what he went on to say is hey, you can't control

461
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,840
it, the plane's down, you can't do anything about it. He would have been fired within 15 minutes in

462
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:03,440
2020 if that came out and probably in 2005 and probably in 1995, but in 1998 he was the most

463
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,160
powerful man in the state of Indiana. I was aware of that incident. I was aware of the chair throw

464
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,120
a number of years before during a game where he threw the chair across the court while someone

465
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:22,320
was at the foul line. I didn't know the impact of it and to be honest Peter, I didn't realize

466
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:30,160
how important that moment was until I did the film 18 years after my reporting. What I learned by

467
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:36,160
having 18 years of hindsight is that at that point Knight had won three national championships

468
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:44,160
an Olympic gold medal in 84. In 1987 in my reporting I had uncovered that the Bloomington

469
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,640
Faculty Council was so offended by the John Feinstein book that they wanted to look into

470
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,960
Knight's conduct and they put together kind of a bill of rights for athletes that said no coach

471
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,040
should verbally or mentally abuse their athletes and I uncovered this. This was in 1999 during my

472
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:12,160
reporting and I was like wow they knew about this in 1987 and I'm reporting on it in 1999.

473
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,800
The timeline is they were looking into kind of reprimanding Coach Knight,

474
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:23,040
reining him in, knowing he's out of control and what does Knight do? He wins the national

475
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,840
championship. Now they cannot put a saddle on. There's no way the horse is out of the barn and

476
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:34,080
it is so far down the road that there's no coming back. He was a legend. He was the most powerful

477
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,760
man in the state so when he said that with Connie Chung there was a huge outcry initially. The

478
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,480
president released a tempered statement that said something to the effect of Coach Knight's quote

479
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,680
does not reflect Indiana University. It was very middle of the road kind of. It didn't chastise him

480
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:59,520
or go after him and what Coach Knight did is he went and interviewed for a job at New Mexico

481
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,200
and as Alexander Wolf, Sports Illustrated basketball writer, he's written so many books on basketball,

482
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,040
one of the best minds in the sport. In my film he said it was a shot across the bow at the president.

483
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,760
Coach Knight was like really you're going to put out a statement about me? I'll go to New Mexico

484
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,120
and let's see what happens. All of a sudden the entire state is up in arms now attacking

485
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,520
the president. Not attacking Coach Knight for what he said but attacking the president like

486
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,360
you're going to drive away Bob Knight. He just won a national championship. Three national

487
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:36,240
championships and Olympic gold medal and so that shot across the bow gave Knight the power he needed

488
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:42,720
to survive up until 2000 if that makes sense. They knew about him in 87. They were trying to do

489
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,240
something. He won the national title. He makes a horrible statement to Connie Chung in 88 but he

490
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:55,920
survives all the way until 2000 and that's because he basically showed who was boss in the state.

491
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,760
The president of the university wasn't. Coach Knight was and a number of presidents changed

492
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,760
during his 29 years in Indiana but Coach Knight remained and that's why he was allowed to exist

493
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,640
through the late 80s and early 90s all the way up until 2000. Did his behavior publicly get worse

494
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,240
over time? I mean you go to YouTube and you can find no shortage of best moments in press

495
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,280
conferences and you could watch that and come away thinking there's not a press conference where

496
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,680
this guy is not unhinged but presumably those are just the highlights. So it was clear that he had

497
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,840
unbelievable disdain for the press when he didn't like their questions. I mean he was unbelievably

498
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,520
rude in a way that you just don't see it even amongst professional athletes. There were many

499
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,240
examples of him just telling a reporter to go fuck themselves. Like you're a fucking idiot. I

500
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,080
mean what the fuck shut the fuck up. That's a dumb fucking question right? Yeah yeah showing up to a

501
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,800
press conference with a bull whip telling everybody he's going to whip his players with it you know

502
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,720
as you said throwing chairs. Having an African-American player this was at the NCAA tournament.

503
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,920
I believe it was Calvert Cheney. He had a player bend over and he went and he's like you can't

504
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,160
touch me. I'm going to do what I want. To answer your question as media grew from the 70s to the 80s

505
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:23,520
to the 90s up until 2000 we had greater access to him. I don't think he fundamentally changed.

506
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,560
People have asked me this a lot. Was he the same person in 2000 as he was in the early 70s when he

507
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:38,080
went to Indiana? And I said fundamentally he was the same. What I think changed was he had success

508
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,280
at Army. He came to Indiana had immediate success took him to the Final Four in the second year won

509
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:51,120
a national title in 76 won two more in Olympic gold medal. So the ends justified the means

510
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,080
during that run from when he first got to Indiana up until 1987. But when he started getting

511
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,440
eliminated in the first or second round of the tournament and these incidents became more and

512
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:12,080
more public I personally believe he took it out on his players and said it can't be me. I won three

513
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:18,400
national titles Olympic gold medal. It has to be you. And if you put yourself in the position of

514
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,800
those players I don't know if what he did to Neil Reed's class was any different than what he did

515
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,440
to Kent Benson's class or Isaiah Thomas's class. But you'll put up with a lot of shit all year long

516
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,840
and if you win the national championship you forget about a lot of it and you're a hero forever.

517
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,800
But when you start losing in the first and second round of the tournament you're less willing to

518
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:49,920
put up with that. So did he change did he get worse. I think what I've come to understand is

519
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,760
in the early 70s and 80s right when he'd push you to your breaking point he'd throw his arm around

520
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,120
you walk out of practice say something to you for 15 seconds and it all went away and you're

521
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,040
willing to run through a wall for him. And next thing you know they're fitting you for a national

522
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,240
championship ring and you're like hey it was all worth it. But in the 90s instead of throwing his

523
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:17,360
arm around kids there's the tirade that was caught on audio in 91. He took it out on them

524
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,600
and anybody can google you know Bob Knight audio locker room. Yeah this is the one for the Purdue

525
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,640
game. But there's an interesting point about that Robert which is any player that was asked about

526
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,440
that doesn't remember it specifically because they basically say something to the effect of

527
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,400
that happened every day that just happens to be one that got recorded but that's what every single

528
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,800
day in the locker room was like. It's not like okay that was a really bad day and we were really

529
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,760
playing badly and he went a little too far but it stands out and I remembered it's like nobody

530
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,440
actually remembers that discussion. That's one of my questions to Richard Mandeville who played for

531
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,200
five years for Coach Knight. I said you've heard the audio on the internet and he immediately said

532
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,280
that's what I wish everybody who was watching this would understand that that's every day. And what

533
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,960
interests me because I recommend everybody who listens to this go listen to the audio and you

534
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,680
hear the F-bombs and the GDs and all the profanity but listen to how many times Coach Knight says I

535
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:25,040
or me. Here's a guy from his days at Army. It's about team. It's not about an individual. It's not

536
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,880
about I. It's not about me. And that's what everybody in the state of Indiana and that's what

537
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:39,600
I admired about him. That it was about teamwork. But in that you will not put me in that fucking

538
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:46,960
position again. I've had to sit around for a year with an eight and ten record. If you do that to me

539
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,560
again I will run you. It's I and me. I and me. I and me. I and me. And I think that's where Coach Knight

540
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:02,400
possibly changed in the 90s. He had been so successful that when he started not being successful

541
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,320
in his mind it was it can't be me. It's got to be my players. And then he wasn't throwing his arm

542
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,000
around him. He'd push him to the breaking point in the 70s and 80s and then reel him back in just

543
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,560
enough to push him again to reel him back in to win titles. But in the 90s he didn't do that. And

544
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:29,120
then come the tournament they were mentally and physically done. And they wanted no part of

545
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:35,760
winning. A number of players told me that in the 90s when the NCAA tournament would come probably

546
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,440
the greatest three weeks in sports for people who love basketball we didn't care if we lost.

547
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,960
Yeah we wanted to win but if we lost we knew we didn't have to go to practice the next day.

548
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,880
So the silver lining in losing was the season's over and I don't have to listen to that again.

549
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,200
And that's why you saw him lose often in the first and second round in my opinion.

550
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,000
You make a really important point here which is there's this view that Knight is this guy who

551
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,640
places the importance of the team at the highest level. But I think you hit the nail on the head.

552
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,840
I think this was really about his ego. And I think that whether that was something that changed

553
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,080
from the 80s into the 90s I can't speak to that of course perhaps nobody can. But I think a lot of

554
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:27,680
people who give off this aura of team first team first team first are really quite ego driven when

555
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,760
you really get underneath the surface. And that's a great example. There are times when I find myself

556
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:40,240
doing the same thing. There are times when I find myself being so ego focused, so focused on myself

557
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,600
that I sort of lose sight of what the purpose is with respect to others. And if you stay in that

558
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,240
state for a very long period of time it's a bad place to be. You're going to behave badly. And

559
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,760
the other point you make is that really he had lost all sense of checks and balances. There was

560
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,240
nobody in that guy's orbit that could offer any sense of sanity. Do you have any sense by the

561
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,720
way of what his private life was like? Because it's one thing for a group of 20-year-olds who

562
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:17,120
worship you to show up and take that type of abuse. But do we have any sense of what his personal

563
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,880
relationships were like with friends, with family? And was he able to sort of put some sort of

564
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,680
restraint in place with respect to his anger in that setting? Do you have any indication of that?

565
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:35,200
The only indication I have is he was divorced once previously. When I started doing, again,

566
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,840
after I spoke to Neil Reed, after I flew up to Indiana at first and did a basic kind of

567
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,960
round of interviews to get a sense in the lay of the land, literally I backed up all the way to

568
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,880
Army and started talking to people who knew him there, why he left there. It didn't point to

569
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,920
what my assignment was, was why did three players leave in the last two years, but I wanted to get

570
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,480
a sense of that. I wanted to understand him from head to toe. At one point I got a phone call and

571
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:14,480
was put in touch with a professor at the school who on background, he has since passed away so

572
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:22,000
I can share it, at the time he was on a hunting trip with Coach Knight in Argentina and he said,

573
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,720
I don't want to go public, but I just want to make you aware that I was there in a hunting lodge with

574
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,560
he and his son and Coach Knight got in a fight with his son. And I don't have my notes in front

575
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,560
of me. I don't know if he dislocated his shoulder and bloodied his nose, but it wasn't pleasant.

576
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:49,440
The professor told me, described it to a tee of what took place. At the time I had done my

577
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,920
reporting and CNN had done our initial report. It was a 16-minute piece alleging the three things

578
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,600
that Neil had told me. Coach Knight had grabbed him by the throat, he had kicked the president

579
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,880
out of practice and he had brandished soiled toilet paper. So it's front page news around the country.

580
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,520
Everybody's attacking CNN, me, Neil, Reed, anybody in the piece. And so I start getting phone calls

581
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,880
from people. I'm put in touch with this professor who said, hey, I don't want to go public, but I

582
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,480
want you to know what I know. And again, much like Neil, he told me everything. And I went to

583
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,200
my bosses and said, I got to fly to Argentina to find out if this is true. And we didn't have huge

584
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,400
budgets at CNN Sports at the time. We were getting attacked as if we were going after night.

585
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,160
So my bosses said, hey, just we can't go down there. We can't make it look like we're out to

586
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,040
get him. And I go, I'm not out to get him, but people are calling me. So I kind of went around

587
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:48,560
my bosses a little bit and called a stringer. A stringer is in the news businesses. We have

588
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,160
contacts at different places, countries, cities, towns around the world that aren't on our staff,

589
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,200
but if we hire them for the day, they'll do work for us. So I found out a stringer for CNN and I

590
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,120
called, I said, can you go over to this hunting lodge? And can you talk to this person? Here's

591
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,880
the phone number, this, this, this, and the stringer came back and said, he confirmed what happened.

592
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:18,240
He runs a very high end lodge. He doesn't want to bad mouth his very wealthy clients.

593
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,880
But he did confirm to me that he drove them to the hospital and said to coach night,

594
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:32,240
you're no longer welcome here. And that really, to me, you talked about the tip of the iceberg or

595
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,200
what we see, you asked me about his private life. And I'm like, that was evidence to me that he

596
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,040
couldn't control his temper in his private life. And I wanted to report it. I had two different

597
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,560
people who wouldn't go on the record or confirm it with me at the time. So I couldn't, as a

598
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,400
journalist, I can't report it because I can't definitively confirm it. So what did I do? I called

599
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,520
Christopher Simpson. Christopher Simpson was Miles Brand, right hand man. He was the vice president

600
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,840
of kind of media communications and he was the voice of Indiana University for Miles Brand.

601
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:11,680
So I'm like, well, at least I'll let him know that I know. So I start poking as a journalist,

602
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:19,760
poking and prodding and people. I'll never forget it was the day where they would ultimately announce

603
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,480
zero tolerance. And I may be getting ahead of the story, but I'm on the phone with them.

604
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:31,440
And I said to Christopher Simpson, I said, if coach night can't control his temper,

605
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:38,960
so much so that he would harm his own son, how can you as a representative of this university

606
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,320
ensure that if mothers and fathers around the country are going to send their sons to play for

607
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:50,240
him, that they're not going to be safe? And I was appalled at his answer. I was walking on the

608
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:57,120
sidewalk outside of the, who is the center in Indianapolis where they're going to have the press

609
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,560
conference. And I remember pacing up and down the sidewalk and he said, Robert, that has nothing to

610
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:10,480
do with his coaching. And I about jumped through the phone at him and I said, how can you not see

611
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,520
the connection and the correlation? They can't control his temper and we'll do that. It's one

612
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,360
of his sons. How can you ensure that kids who come here to play are going to be protected?

613
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,160
We went back and forth at that day, but that gave you a sense of where the university was in

614
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:36,880
trying to do damage control and protect them. So what ultimately gave you and the senior

615
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,720
leadership at CNN the confidence to publish the story and when was that? So 99, you start looking

616
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:48,720
at this, how long did it take and how much digging did you need to do before you were willing to write

617
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,120
this? And I don't want to give the story away, but there's a tape in here somewhere. And I can't

618
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,920
remember if the tape came before or after the publication of the piece. I'll back up to April

619
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,880
of 99 is when I get called into Steve's office. Luke record just left the third player in two and

620
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:10,240
a half years to be gone. Talked to Neil that Sunday night, several days later, fly up to Indiana. And

621
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:17,840
literally for the next nine months or more, I'm reporting it. And other than peripheral people,

622
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,920
no one's going on camera. No one wants to speak out against coach night. And as I said in the film,

623
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:31,760
I could hear and feel the fear in their voices as I spoke to them. And that's something that

624
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:39,040
fascinated me as a journalist. I'm like, why are they so afraid of this guy? Why will they tell me

625
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:44,880
everything on background or off the record or maybe on the record, but not for attribution,

626
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,320
which means you can use what they say, but not tie their name to it. That drove me. That actually

627
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,760
drove me for a long period of time. I said, there's something here and I have to be patient.

628
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:02,560
And I have to give Steve Robinson, my boss credit because I did a lot of different things during

629
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:10,000
this nine months, but he allowed me to pursue this story at my tempo because I knew if I called you,

630
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,640
Peter, and you told me a lot of things, and then I give you the full court press a week later,

631
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,760
trying to get you on camera, you're probably going to say no. I had to play and develop a

632
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,040
relationship with each individual and they're all different. So I had to kind of keep everybody on

633
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,480
the hook until I could start getting, I knew if I got one person on camera, I could probably get

634
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,520
the second. If I got two, I could get the third. And if I got three, I could get five. But who was

635
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,800
going to be the first? So I interviewed professor Murray Sperber. I interviewed other people in and

636
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:47,200
around campus. And I basically, to be honest, I had the story the first night I called Neil

637
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:54,880
Reed. Those three things became the backbone of the story. I just had to confirm it. So you asked

638
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,880
earlier at one point, early on, I called Luke Grecker would not speak with me. And even speak

639
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:07,040
with you on background. Nothing at all. No, no, no. And what about Collier? I spoke to Luke's mother

640
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:14,640
on background. And I spoke to others who told me that Luke wanted to quit after his freshman year.

641
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,760
And he and his mother went in to speak to Coach Knight about, hey, he doesn't want to play here

642
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,360
anymore. And Coach Knight basically said, I'll change, I'll change, I'll change. I understand,

643
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:31,440
I'll change. I don't want to lose him. And so Luke decided to stay and year two, nothing changed.

644
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,240
So at the end of year two, Luke wants out. So I had a sense of his story through other players,

645
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:42,560
through his mother. And then I call Collier. And I was based in Atlanta at CNN in downtown Atlanta,

646
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,760
at the CNN center for anyone who knows Atlanta, Georgia Tech's two miles away, three miles away.

647
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,200
So I get his number and I call him. And he, as I say in the film, he's like, no, no, not interested,

648
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,920
not interested, not interested. And as an investigative reporter, you just don't want

649
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,800
them to hang up. Because if I can keep them on the phone for two minutes, I can keep them on for five.

650
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,680
And you can't keep them on for 10 unless you can keep them on for three. So you just try to tread

651
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,480
water. And I was like, well, how about background? I'm right up the road. Let's grab a cup of coffee.

652
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,640
I'll take you out to dinner. I'll do it. Like I'm just trying anything to get him to say,

653
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:26,080
okay, I'll talk to you. And he was no, no, no, no, no. And I just I said, Jason, I'm not going to put

654
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,520
your name out there. I'm just trying to understand what it's like to play for Coach Knight. And he

655
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,440
goes, you know what it's like to play for Coach Knight. And I had heard this a number of times

656
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,920
before. And usually it would lead to an hour conversation. So I'm like, Oh, I've broken

657
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,160
through. And he goes, go rent full metal jacket. And then he hung up on me. And for those of you

658
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,960
haven't watched full metal jacket, it's about an army recruit, someone in the military, and they

659
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,640
have a drill sergeant that is just relentless on them. And the army recruit goes crazy, kills

660
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,680
himself kills the drill sergeant. And so I had seen the movie. But right after Luke said that I

661
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,800
was taken back as he hung up the phone. And I went, I think it was the blockbuster still existed back

662
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,920
then rented the movie, brought it home and watched it again, to try to understand what he was talking

663
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:19,120
about. And that was the extent of my conversation with Jason Collier, you want to know what it's

664
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:25,200
like to play for Coach Knight rent full metal jacket. So I did. I now knew that Jason wouldn't

665
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,560
speak with me. Luke wouldn't speak with me for now. So I started going through the roster that

666
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,840
year. And I started trying to track down Charlie Miller. He was Neil Reed's roommate at one time.

667
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:42,960
He was a guard kid out of Miami. And it took me forever to track him down. I called Miami, made a

668
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,280
number of phone calls down there. I heard he was playing in Sweden and Finland and started calling

669
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,360
teams over there. And all of a sudden, I can't even remember how I found out but I heard he was in

670
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,720
Chicago. And I tracked him down and he said, yeah, I'll talk to you. And that was a huge breakthrough

671
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:05,200
for me, because he went on camera. First, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes, the interview told me how

672
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,160
much he loved Coach Knight. He had the respect for Coach Knight. Coach Knight gave him an opportunity.

673
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,400
Other people didn't. He was just praising Coach Knight. And then I asked him about Neil Reed and

674
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:21,120
why he left. And he said, yes, he did put his hand around Neil's throat. I don't think he should have

675
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,240
do I think he choked him no. But I don't think he should have done it. So he confirmed that there

676
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,440
was physical contact and he did it on camera. And that was a huge breakthrough for me when I got

677
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,760
Charlie Miller on camera. And once I got Charlie, I was hoping pretty confident that the dominoes

678
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,240
would start to fall. That once, you know, I could go back to Neil and say, hey, Charlie Miller

679
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,280
confirmed what you said. So you're not going to be out there by yourself. And I had called Richard

680
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,200
Mandeville had mentioned earlier he had played for Knight for five years. And I had spoken back

681
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,960
and forth with him a number of times. And he said, No, I'm not interested, blah, blah, blah. And I

682
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,400
came back and I said, Hey, I spoke to Charlie Miller. I spoke to Neil Reed, would you now go

683
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,200
on camera? And then he sat on camera. And so did Neil Reed. So those are the three players that I

684
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,680
got to go on camera. You know, it's probably worth pausing for a moment, because I'm sure the listeners

685
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,960
sort of sitting here wondering, what is it about Bobby Knight? That's so interesting to me, right

686
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,720
on this podcast. I think the reason and I don't even know if I really explained this to you,

687
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:27,280
Robert, when I reached out to you, but I'm a perfectionist. And I've been that way as long as

688
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:32,880
I had any sort of conscious awareness of anything. I mean, my mother tells stories about me as a kid

689
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,720
doing things that my siblings didn't do as far as just being such a perfectionist. And also I've had

690
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:44,320
a terrible temper my entire life. Again, one of those things that I didn't know how to explain it,

691
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,480
especially because neither of my parents have a bad temper and neither of my siblings have a bad

692
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,720
temper. So it's always this sort of weird thing. Like if I'm five years old and I was building a

693
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:57,840
big Lego tower and it broke, I'd smash it into a million pieces. And I was just utterly pissed off

694
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,720
beyond words when I couldn't do something perfectly. My guess is there are probably a lot of people

695
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:08,720
listening to this who can relate to that because that phenotype can lead to some pretty good

696
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,320
accomplishments, right? You can become pretty good at sports. You can do really well in school.

697
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,520
You can do really well professionally, but it comes at a great cost. And I think now that I'm

698
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,760
older, I'm becoming more and more and more aware of that cost. So much so that in the past year,

699
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:32,720
one of the biggest kind of breakthroughs I've had in therapy, which was very difficult,

700
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,880
I consider it the single biggest step function I've ever experienced in my life,

701
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:44,240
was becoming aware enough of my inner sort of monologue, not dialogue, but monologue with myself.

702
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:51,520
And I was actually going through my journal because journaling is a pretty big part of what I

703
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,520
sort of do to kind of keep track of myself. I came across a sort of an entry from maybe

704
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:04,240
seven months ago where my therapist said something to the effect of, look, your lack of

705
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:12,880
self-compassion is really extreme. I want you to sort of personify that entity inside of your

706
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,600
brain that is constantly berating you. I want you to become more aware of it, and I want you to

707
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,000
actually give it an identity. And without hesitation, the identity was Bobby Knight,

708
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,680
and that assumed the name. So now in the journal, I could refer to Bobby Knight and what Bobby Knight

709
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:33,920
says to me. Luckily, I've been meditating for a number of years, and meditation gives you enough

710
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,800
of a pause or at least an awareness of the inner voice. So now I just had to listen for it.

711
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:47,760
And it was really shocking what it would say over some of the most trivial things. People who listen

712
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,520
to this podcast probably aware, like I love archery, I love race car driving, all these things,

713
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,320
even a mistake in one of those things, which are completely inconsequential, right? I'm not a

714
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,320
professional anything. Like I do these things as a pure hobby, but just what I would say to myself

715
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,040
when I make a mistake, it would never be, try again better, you know, do it better the next time.

716
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:16,480
It would be, you fucking idiot. You are so bad at this. How dare you practice this hard and still

717
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,800
be this shitty. I mean, what is wrong with you? Can you imagine being this bad at something and

718
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,880
caring as much as you do talk about it? And it was just this never ending insult. And so this

719
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:35,120
idea expanded into something of how like we're all made up of these different pieces of our

720
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:41,120
personality. You have sort of the child and you, you have this adaptive child, you have this entity

721
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,040
that's trying to become a functional adult. But unfortunately, what I realized was, hey, the

722
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,400
chairman of my board is Bobby Knight. And it's going to be really hard for me to make progress

723
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:58,720
in life when the chairman of the board inside of my head is Bobby Knight. And somehow seeing your

724
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:06,640
documentary is I think what allowed me to come up with this idea, you know, again, be able to

725
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,760
put a name and a face to it and a character so that I could literally picture Bobby Knight in

726
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,640
my head screaming at me every time I made mistakes. And that was step one. But then step two was

727
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,280
learning to offer an alternative explanation, which was basically my way of saying you're no

728
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,960
longer the chairman of the board. Thank you very much. In fact, you can leave the board room now.

729
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,720
Now you're still going to be knocking and you're going to be very loud for very long.

730
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,000
We're going to a place where you're not allowed to talk to me that way.

731
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,640
And eventually when you stop talking to me that way, I'm going to stop talking to others that way.

732
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,800
I'm going to stop talking to myself that way. Those are the things. So I throw that interjection in

733
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,880
because I want people to understand like where my fascination comes from with this, because I just

734
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,560
don't believe I'm alone in this. And while Bobby Knight may be one of the most extreme examples of

735
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,640
the outward manifestation of this, I suspect there are many people who can relate to that

736
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,080
inner critic that is brutal and this sort of lack of compassion we can have for ourselves.

737
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,840
Fascinating to me because there's a number of similarities and words that jumped out to me

738
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:14,000
that make what you just talked about so connected to Coach Knight. The similarities are you talked

739
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,600
about a Lego tower and you would explode. There were stories of Coach Knight, he read every book

740
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,800
in the library when he was a kid supposedly, and he'd play board games with his grandmother and

741
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,680
she'd let him win because if he didn't he'd throw a fit. And the first thing that came to my mind

742
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:37,280
is that story when you're telling me your story. So the similarities and the connective tissue and you

743
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,840
using him as a character and a name to define it, he's a perfectionist like you said. He has a

744
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:52,880
terrible temper. That's actually what's his greatest undoing, his temper. I to an extent have some of

745
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,600
those character traits so I could understand Coach Knight. My dad was great but he was a direct

746
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:06,480
communicator who would yell and it would be tough. I knew he loved me so it wasn't didn't go that deep

747
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:12,160
into me. I get frustrated quickly when things aren't perfect, when things don't work out well.

748
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,440
I can have a temper. I'm a perfectionist. I could understand Coach Knight at a level.

749
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,960
The one word that you use that jumped out to me a number of times was awareness.

750
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,040
The awareness you've come to realize is powerful and if you're not aware of it you can't help

751
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:37,040
yourself or help solve it. And when you said that I wrote down that a story came to mind. I

752
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:43,360
interviewed Dave Kindred. When I did my film I didn't want to interview Knight haters or people

753
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,240
who love Knight. I wanted to interview people who had known him for a long long time and knew

754
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,800
the good side and the bad side, the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dave Kindred, long-time journalist

755
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,760
at the Atlanta Constitution. I think USA Today, he's known him since the early 70s and he told me

756
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:10,400
a story where he attended a basketball game in the mid-70s, Indiana versus Kentucky. It was a

757
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,560
famous game where Coach Knight and Joe B. Hall kind of met at mid-court on the sidelines and Knight

758
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,640
kind of cuffed him on the back of the head. There was a photo of it. It was a big deal and Dave

759
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,680
Kindred kept asking Knight about it in the press conference and Knight would not answer it and got

760
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:33,440
angry and got frustrated. And so Kindred leaves the press conference and he goes to write his story.

761
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:39,120
So he goes back out onto the court where press row is and he's writing his story with a couple of

762
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:45,280
other writers and here comes Knight walking across the court. And Kindred looked at the other sports

763
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:51,360
writers and said this isn't going to go well. This looks like trouble. Not in a bad way but just

764
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:57,440
observationally. And he said Knight sat down with him and he said how do I get myself into

765
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,800
these situations? And he went on to tell how he and Coach Knight, he's like how does this keep

766
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:09,840
happening to me? Which led me to believe that Coach Knight had an awareness of his flaws as early as

767
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:16,880
the mid-70s. Unlike you, he didn't try to address them, maybe he tried to and just couldn't. But that

768
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,000
story I found fascinating. It didn't fit into my reporting because my reporting was on the teens in

769
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,800
the 90s why there's three guys left. But it was a story that never made the film, never made

770
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:33,680
everything but really told me a lot about Knight. That he very early on knew that there was something

771
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:39,280
in his nature and his character and that he had a temper and that he would keep putting himself in

772
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:45,760
situations that maybe after they were over he'd look back and go why the hell did I do that? But

773
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:54,320
he never got it under control and it ultimately led to his downfall 25 years later. But he was aware of it.

774
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:59,920
I interviewed an amazing therapist named Terry Reel for the podcast and we've spoken a lot about

775
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:06,160
this idea of the anesthetic that is anger. So anger is actually kind of an interesting emotion

776
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:14,640
because in the short run it is actually quite anesthetizing. It overcomes a lot of the inadequacy

777
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,880
that underpins it. Inside there's a hollowness, I think. There's a void that needs to be filled.

778
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:27,120
There's a grandiosity that stands in the place of a true inner strength. The anger kind of fills

779
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,160
that void and numbs that pain in the short run but it's immediately followed by quite a bit of shame.

780
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:38,080
If you're any reasonably sane human being, which is to say you do not have true psychopathology,

781
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:45,760
you have to feel shame after these outbursts. There's no way that Knight isn't screaming

782
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,600
at his players every single day and shoving toilet paper with shit in their face and leaving the

783
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,600
locker room thinking I'm a great guy. No, he's feeling ashamed of what he's doing and as a result

784
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,800
of that he's beating himself up more and it's creating this greater and greater vicious cycle

785
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,080
of needing greater grandiosity to overcome that shame which leads to more outbursts of anger.

786
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,960
That's a very difficult cycle to break and I don't say that to make an excuse for him in any way,

787
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,160
shape, or form or frankly to make excuses for me in times when I've found myself on those roller

788
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,080
coasters but I can just say from personal experience and from observational experience of

789
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,080
countless people it's hard to break that cycle without somebody else to help you do so. You

790
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:33,840
really need a person who can challenge you and push you or sometimes you need a devastating

791
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:40,640
crisis. I trained in surgery and I knew people that I trained with whose anger was so bad

792
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,680
that they got into real trouble basically became an existential crisis, a threat to their career.

793
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:52,960
If you don't get your anger under control it will threaten your career. So my guess is it's just a

794
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,680
combination of all of these things. In that sense he became a victim of his success. His success

795
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:03,440
kept him far enough away from crisis that there probably wasn't enough impetus to change until

796
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:09,520
it was too late. You're exactly right and for people who didn't see my original reporting on

797
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:16,880
CNN or the film, that crisis, I'll back up to April of 99, the following college basketball season,

798
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,800
I released my first story and it has Neil Reed, Charlie Miller, Richard Mandeville, a number of

799
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,440
other people and they make those three allegations. He kicked the president out of practice,

800
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,960
he brandished soil, tore the paper and he grabbed Neil Reed by the throat, chokes Neil Reed.

801
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:40,960
So those are the allegations in the 16 minutes. Indiana rallies the troops, everybody says it's

802
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,800
not true and we can go back to it in a minute but I'm going to jump to the crisis. So I do that

803
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:54,240
first piece. I do a second piece and we can talk about it in a minute where I actually get the

804
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,880
videotape that's proof that he grabbed Neil Reed by the throat and that changed the entire narrative

805
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:05,040
of the nationwide story. Explain for a moment how that makes it to you because that's, I mean look

806
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,880
at this point people who haven't seen the documentary I hope are going to see the documentary

807
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,160
because it's very powerful for reasons we haven't even got to yet by the way. That changes the game

808
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:19,600
and it's out of a movie how this tape makes it to you. I do my first 16 minute story making those

809
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,840
three allegations. Indiana, all the players, the university, everyone, even people in the media

810
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:33,280
push back and say it's actually not true, CNN's out to get him. A lot of it wasn't directed at me

811
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,680
or I didn't pay attention but it was directed at Neil Reed, anybody in the piece and CNN in

812
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:45,280
particular. Once I had heard almost immediately, almost a year before when I heard about the joke,

813
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:51,680
I was told that a tape exists of it because Indiana tapes all their basketball practices.

814
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,880
They have student managers up in the stands on the sidelines and they videotape it

815
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,360
and Coach Knight analyzes it at night, has his assistant coaches analyze it, shows it to the

816
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,160
players, it's just part of their process. So if something happened on that court chances are it

817
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:12,240
was captured on video. I had heard about it forever and it's just, I don't know, it's my style as a

818
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:18,000
reporter that I never want to ask for something if the percentages are that the answer would be no.

819
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:28,320
So I didn't pursue the video because I thought if I pushed or asked about it, much like I said,

820
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,480
if I was talking to you Peter and tried to push you to go on camera and I got a no, then where

821
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:40,080
do I go from there? I work every one of my sources, how I feel I can best connect with them, gain their

822
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:47,200
trust, whatever. So I had heard about the video. I was in Indianapolis to do a site survey for the

823
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:53,200
Final Four, it was going to be in the Final Four that year and I made the rounds with a number of my

824
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:02,880
sources at the school and I went out and had lunch and a few beers with one of them and

825
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:11,520
a source invited me back to their home and I kind of knew what may or may not happen,

826
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,040
but I never let on and somebody goes, hey I want to show you something. I'm like, oh what do you

827
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:24,880
want to show me? And so I saw the tape of practice from high above, Coach Knight going towards Neil

828
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,360
Reed and Neil Reed's head snapping back and even in that moment I didn't ask for the tape. I didn't

829
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:37,280
ask for it and people who are listening this may say, how the hell do you not ask for it? You idiot,

830
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:44,560
are you a moron? Because for a month now CNN's under fire or my reporting is under fire. I just,

831
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,440
I wasn't sure that the answer would be yes here. I'm proud because I've been in this business for

832
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:56,880
33, 34 years and I've tried my hardest that I'm not perfect, but I try not to use people.

833
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:06,000
I try not to use people to get something and I think because it took me almost a year to report

834
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,360
this, people got that sense with me who had, the more I talked to somebody and it's not on the

835
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,440
front page or it's not in the news, the more they trusted me so what would they do? The more they

836
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,960
would tell me, the more they would tell their friend, you can trust this guy. Oh you should

837
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,600
call this guy. Oh you have something you should call Robert. That's how I got everything I got

838
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,360
in this story. So in that moment where I watched the video that kind of vindicate my reporting

839
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:34,480
and shut up all the critics, I didn't ask for it and it was just an instinct of mine.

840
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,600
A number of days later I remember it vividly. We were watching an episode of The Sopranos,

841
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:48,560
my wife and I and the phone rings and it's my contact talking about

842
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:55,840
some stuff that was going on and I said, ah just send me the tape. I won't use it until you

843
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:04,720
get a lawyer and so I made a deal with that person in the moment. Actually to be honest,

844
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,680
let me back up. I had a conversation, I said let me call you back. I called Lester Munson,

845
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,800
who people may know from ESPN, I hired him at ESPN. He used to be, he's a lawyer, he was an

846
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,280
investigative producer for Sports Illustrated, somebody I'd work with at CNNSI. I had the utmost

847
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,840
respect. I go if there's anybody I can trust, it's Lester. He's a lawyer. I said hey Lester,

848
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,200
here's the situation. I may be coming into a possession of a tape that may or may not

849
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,640
be perceived as stolen by somebody. I want to make sure I don't do anything incorrectly and how I get

850
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:40,400
it blah blah blah. He gave me some great advice. The tape shows up at my house a number of days

851
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:47,360
later. It's vindication for all my reporting. From the time you get the tape until the tape

852
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:52,480
is made public is how long? You gave the university a heads up first right? Because they had dug their

853
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,600
heels in and said you guys are wrong. Yeah they had dug their heels in. Everybody was attacking

854
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:05,120
Neil, CNN, me, anybody in the piece. That Monday I'm at Augusta National for the Masters. So Monday,

855
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:12,000
Tuesday, Wednesday I'm doing all the pre-story coverage for the Masters. But because this night

856
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,720
thing is a number of weeks before our first piece had aired, I was kind of scheduled to leave the

857
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:23,120
Masters and come back. I come back on a Wednesday and the tape had arrived in my mailbox. I knew

858
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:29,600
what it was. I popped it in but I didn't really even have to look at it. But I actually didn't

859
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:36,960
tell my bosses I had it. And people may wonder why because I had given someone my word that I

860
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:45,200
wouldn't run it until the person got legal advice and called me back. And I trust Steve Robinson and

861
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:50,800
Jim Walton with my life. Those are my two immediate bosses. I worked for Jim for 14 years and Steve

862
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,520
quarterbacked this whole investigation with me. We're literally the only two people who were

863
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:01,040
involved. There was no reporter, no nothing. At the end we had an editor that put it together.

864
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:07,280
But it was just Steve and I. So I trusted them impeccably. But I didn't know if somebody up

865
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:13,280
the food chain would say we have that tape CNN's and under fire we're running it. I never wanted

866
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:19,360
anybody to say that I lied to them and that I used them. So the only way to prevent that from

867
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:25,920
happening and probably being in complete control, whereas a producer I am much of a control free,

868
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:34,400
I didn't tell my bosses I had it. That's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday morning I get a phone call.

869
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,920
I remember it like it was yesterday. I was walking down the hall of my house. The phone rings and I

870
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:47,200
pick it up and I can tell them on speakerphone and I hear this is so and so and so and so and so and

871
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,880
it's a law firm. A bunch of names and I'm like here's the moment of truth that I make the right

872
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,920
decision or the wrong decision because I'm in possession of a tape that vindicates my reporting.

873
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:03,680
But if this phone call goes in another direction and I keep my word I may never be able to show it.

874
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,080
But my instincts told me I was doing the right thing. So there's this long conversation back and

875
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:15,840
forth and I explained here's how I think it'll all go down. I kind of convinced the people on the

876
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:24,160
phone call that the best thing to do is let me air the tape. So I go into the office later that day

877
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,800
and I walk into Steve's office and I say I got the tape and he's like what? Rick Davis, he's the head

878
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:36,000
of standards and practices at CNN, had been there probably close to 40 years. He's still there and

879
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,480
he was involved in all the reporting of the first piece and he says it in an interview I did with

880
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:45,360
him for the film. He's like we got the tape? Like he's so freaked out that we had it. So I bring

881
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:50,960
Steve, the head of sports Jim Walton who later became the president of CNN into a room, shut the

882
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:56,880
door and I play it for him. And I remember Steve going holy shit. And I remember Jim who was the

883
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,560
president of sports would go on to be the president of the network. He just looked at me and he said

884
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:07,440
you know if you did that at CNN you'd be fired immediately. And we discussed what should happen

885
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:12,000
and they said hey you got to start working on a second piece and we want to air it Monday.

886
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,560
This is Friday afternoon. So I'm sitting there going okay. So Saturday I'm starting to think

887
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,760
about how I'm going to put together this follow-up piece to my original 16-minute piece. I had just

888
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,080
been at Augusta National on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and for those who are not members of

889
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:33,200
the media which is 99.9 percent of the people listening to this. When you cover Augusta you can

890
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:38,880
drop your name back then it was like into a fishbowl in the media center and they'd pick 20 names out

891
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,480
of that bowl who could play the course Monday morning after the tournament was over. I'm starting

892
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,360
to put together this piece on Saturday and I get a phone call from my colleagues and my best friends

893
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:54,000
who are covering the event and they go dude they drew your name. You got a tea time at Augusta

894
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,760
National 9 o'clock Monday. So I have to call my boss and say I know you want this piece on Monday

895
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:05,040
but please for the love of God can I play Augusta and can we air it on Tuesday? And my bosses were

896
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:13,200
so good they said yes but I hope people understand why I didn't tell my immediate bosses because I

897
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,720
didn't want somebody to overrule their decision and I never wanted anybody who placed their trust

898
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:24,560
in me to think I fucked them. And the only way I could ensure that a hundred percent

899
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:31,040
is was to hold the tape and not let anybody know I had it. So we air the piece. I put together the

900
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:36,080
piece on Tuesday when I get back. We're going to air it on Wednesday or Thursday. I think we were

901
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:42,240
going to air it on Thursday. My bosses say we have to call Indiana. So I've been reporting this story

902
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:47,680
for almost a year. My bosses say in order to be fair journalists we have to give them a chance to

903
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:55,600
respond. I had been battling them for nine months to a year and I go we don't owe them anything.

904
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,520
They should see it like the rest of the world. Like I wanted to throw a haymaker and just have

905
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:05,360
them watch it on TV like everyone else. And to Rick Davis's credit, Jim Walton's credit, and Steve

906
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:11,520
Robinson's credit, they push back, push back, push back and say no. To be honorable journalists, to be

907
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,880
fair, we have to give them a chance to respond. So they called Indiana and I kept saying I don't

908
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:22,880
think this is a good idea. And I said what if they slap an injunction on us for having stolen property

909
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:28,080
then we may be in possession of a tape that we can't air. So there's back and forth between us

910
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,240
and they're all my bosses so they're going to win. I knew they'd win but I just kept presenting

911
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:38,080
a front. Plus it was probably personal frustration of all of the roadblocks and hurdles that

912
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:43,120
Christopher Simpson specifically and the lies he had said to me over the nine months,

913
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:48,720
ten months of my reporting, or now it was over a year actually, of my reporting that I didn't

914
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:56,240
think we owed them anything. So we call them and four individuals get on two private planes,

915
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:02,080
three come out of Bloomington, one was on vacation in Key West and gets on a private plane,

916
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:07,200
the president of the board of trustees and they all come to Atlanta. When I had gotten the tape

917
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:13,840
I arranged to have Neil Reed fly into Atlanta to view the tape to verify it. So Neil flies into

918
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:19,040
Atlanta, I watch the tape with him, I take him into his studio, I play the tape with him, he has

919
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:24,000
a microphone on, I'm interviewing him while it's playing, probably do 40 minutes of an interview

920
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,520
with him, watch it over and over again, talk to him about it. I need to get Neil Reed out of CNN

921
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,560
Center because the four Indiana board of trustees and vice presidents are on their way in.

922
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:40,960
They probably passed on I-85 coming to the airport and from the airport about 40 minutes

923
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:47,680
after I put Neil in a cab, sent him back to the airport, they arrive. Did Neil come by himself?

924
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,240
No, he did come by himself. I called Neil and I said I have something you may be interested in

925
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,720
seeing. There's a ticket waiting for you, I'll have a ticket waiting for you, I'll have a car

926
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:03,280
waiting for you. So we paid for him to come to CNN but he came by himself and I had spent nine

927
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:09,680
months with Neil. I had talked to him over those nine months before the initial report had come

928
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:14,960
out. Now it was another month later. I had talked to him probably a couple times a week. Sometimes

929
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,640
it was just we were just shooting the breeze and Neil later did an interview with ESPN for another

930
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:26,240
project about it and he told them, yeah Robert and I became friends, we just started talking

931
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,480
and that's my style. If you're real with people and they trust you, they'll tell you anything.

932
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:39,520
And Neil told me everything and I never reported, I never hung him out to dry, I never betrayed his

933
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:46,640
confidence in me. In fact, when I got married during this whole time and I went on my honeymoon with

934
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:52,640
my wife to Turkey and then like a cruise through the Greek islands and I called Neil before that

935
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:57,440
and then I called him from my honeymoon to say, hey I'm in Europe, he was playing in Holland at the

936
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:02,240
time. I go can I come by and interview you? This is before the first piece aired. So he and I had

937
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,640
talked forever. So when I called him and said will you come here, he would kind of almost do

938
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:13,120
anything I asked him to. So he came and watched it and then 40 minutes later that Indiana, two members

939
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,200
of the board of trustees and two vice presidents of the school including Christopher Simpson

940
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,880
came to CNN center to watch the tape. What was their reaction? As I had predicted to my bosses

941
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:32,240
but they didn't believe me at the time, I said you can't trust them, specifically Christopher

942
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:37,760
Simpson. So we literally go into a conference room, it's Frederick Eichorn who used to be

943
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:44,560
the president of the Indiana Bar Association, John Waldo who's the president of the board of trustees,

944
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,000
Christopher Simpson and Terry Kleypex who's a vice president oversaw the athletic department.

945
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,880
The reason I thought they may slap an injunction on us is because Frederick Eichorn was the head,

946
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,440
he was the head of the Indiana State Bar Association at one point. So I knew he's a

947
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:06,240
lawyer. They may try to legally stop us from doing anything. So when we sat down it's myself,

948
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,960
Steve Robinson, my immediate boss and Jim Walton, the president of sports on the opposite side of

949
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,600
the table of these four and literally as our butts hit the chair on our side of the table,

950
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,560
Christopher Simpson, Miles Brand's right hand man says we understand you're in possession of

951
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:28,560
stolen property that belongs to Indiana University and we want it returned immediately. I was like

952
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:38,560
holy shit you have balls coming into our office and fucking dropping that bomb. And I kind of looked

953
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,440
to my bosses and I was just glanced and I was kind of like now you know what I've been dealing with

954
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:51,280
for the last year. For me I was like you didn't believe me and I'm not going to be able to paint

955
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:58,800
a picture of how powerful the next 20 seconds was. But without missing a beat because literally

956
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:06,640
he dropped a nuclear bomb in the room that normally would have put 99.9 percent of the people on the

957
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:13,840
defensive. Steve Robinson, my immediate boss without missing a beat, there was just a breath of silence

958
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:23,840
and he said and I'm not going to do it justice but in the most even keeled emotionless tone,

959
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:29,440
just said something to the effect of well I'm disappointed that you would come in here and say

960
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:36,320
that we were kind enough to invite you down to view this tape. If you'd like to pursue legal action

961
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:42,320
we'll escort you out the door to the bank of elevators outside. I'll push the button for the

962
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:47,600
13th floor and you can speak to our legal department. But before the door opens on the

963
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:54,080
13th floor this tape will be on CNN, CNN international headline news. We'll send it out to 300 affiliates

964
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:59,680
around the country. Now did you come here to threaten us or would you like to watch the tape?

965
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:06,160
In my 34 years of being a journalist I've never seen a more powerful moment by someone I worked

966
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:13,920
with. I mean Christopher Simpson came in with a lot of balls and my boss literally there was just

967
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:20,560
a breath of air and then he just surgically castrated him and he just said no what would you like to

968
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,080
do? And so then there was some conversations back and forth. I don't think they expected that answer

969
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:32,080
for Steve. I looked at Steve with as much admiration as any journalist I ever did in that moment. I

970
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:39,360
just went wow like how did he not get emotional? How did he not attack them? But he just surgically

971
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:43,040
cut their legs out from under him castrated him and said do you want to watch the tape?

972
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:50,240
And then there was some back and forth where Indiana's representatives mostly Christopher

973
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:56,960
Simpson said well we'd like to watch it in private. And at first Jim Walton said sure we don't have a

974
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,840
problem like that. And then I cleared my voice was like and Jim looked at me and I just shook my head.

975
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:07,600
And then we adjourned for a second and Steve Jim and I walked out and I go I don't trust him.

976
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:13,760
And I said oh by the way my source said don't ever let anybody see the actual tape because

977
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,640
it may give them a clue as to who shot it where it came from blah blah blah blah blah. And I actually

978
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:23,920
I made dubs the tape but I was actually showing them the exact tape so they couldn't say it was

979
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:31,040
dubbed altered or anything. I'm a journalist unlike you I'm a perfectionist. So I had the tape in a VCR

980
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:36,800
and so we walked back in and Jim my boss said hey these are going to be the ground rules if you

981
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,680
agree to him. You can watch the tape as many times as you want what happens in this room is off the

982
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:46,240
record. Robert will be in here with you and operate the machine. We're not going to let you watch it by

983
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:53,200
yourself. So they agreed and then I didn't think about it at the time. I'm 35 years old I think at

984
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:59,840
this time. Jim and Steve leave the room and I didn't think about it until years and years later

985
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,680
when somebody asked me about it. And so I'm sitting in there Steve Delson he's an investigative

986
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:11,280
journalist he worked for ESPN for years he wrote a book and there was a chapter on this and he said

987
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:19,360
Robert was left alone in a room with four men who wished he was never born. It was a great line

988
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:25,280
and I was like I never thought of it until I read it in his book. It's the four of them and me. I had

989
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:30,640
spent a year covering this. I knew everything that was going on in Indiana. I had the tape. I

990
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:37,360
didn't think anything of it in the moment and once my bosses leave one of them starts asking me

991
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:41,200
again everything's off the record in this room. So one of them asked me how many games have you been

992
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:46,400
to how many this how many that and all he was trying to do. I am probably much like you. I'm

993
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:52,000
a perfectionist my mind races and works really I make connections very very quickly and I'm like

994
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,240
I know what you're trying to do you're trying to find something that you can use to undermine my

995
01:38:56,240 --> 01:39:02,720
credibility to this story and I just said hey everything in this room is off the record. Do

996
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,480
you want to sit here and ask me a bunch of questions or do you want to watch the tape?

997
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:14,080
And then Christopher Simpson said he wanted to see the tape. He was sitting across the conference

998
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:20,560
table for me in this big room and he got up. You got to understand I was frustrated that whole day

999
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,920
because I didn't want him there. You know I had argued with my bosses you shouldn't bring him here.

1000
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,160
Christopher Simpson's lied to me for a year. I don't trust him then they came in and dropped the

1001
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:37,440
bomb so I'm sitting there going. I didn't want this situation to happen kind of meaning I didn't

1002
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:43,360
want them there. I just wanted him to see it on the air. He gets up and he starts going towards

1003
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:49,840
the tape machine which I had on the floor in the corner like I was in between. I said sit down and

1004
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:57,520
he didn't took another step or two and I said Mr. Simpson sit the fuck down. I don't care what

1005
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,080
my bosses say. If you don't sit down right now I'm going to unplug that machine walk out to my car

1006
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:07,040
and drive back to my house and you guys aren't going to see this tape. Did you come here to see

1007
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,800
the tape or did you come here to ask me questions? Did you come here to look at the tape? You're not

1008
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,760
going to see the tape sit down. You want me to do it. At that point it's probably the only time I

1009
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,560
really lost my cool. It was like 10 seconds and I just told him to sit the fuck down because he

1010
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,440
was starting to piss me off to be honest. I'm like you don't come into my office and tell me how

1011
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,760
things are going to go down. And so he sat back down. I played the tape. They watched it a number

1012
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:35,280
of times. They didn't say anything and even if they did it was off the record so I couldn't report it.

1013
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:41,760
And then we had made an agreement when Jim said you could watch the tape and then afterwards Robert

1014
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:48,640
will interview one of you. So I played the tape for them. We adjourned the meeting and then I went

1015
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:54,640
into a studio and interviewed John Walda. He was heading up the investigation by the school. He was

1016
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:59,120
the head of the board of trustees. I think for five weeks or so he had been investigating it.

1017
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:06,080
As it states in my film my first story came out a month before John Walda, head of the board of

1018
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:12,320
trustees, was quoted in the Indianapolis Star saying I put no stock in what Neil Reed says.

1019
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:18,080
If CNN's saying it then I don't believe it. Something to that effect. So he's on the record

1020
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:23,440
saying he doesn't believe the guy and then he's placed in charge of the investigation

1021
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,120
into the guy's allegations. So my first question to him was you've now seen the tape.

1022
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:35,680
Do you put any stock in what Neil Reed says? And John Walda was really good. I got to give him

1023
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:42,160
credit. He was a broken record of just saying we've seen the tape. We're in the middle of

1024
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,560
investigation. It's going to be part of our investigation. No matter what question I asked

1025
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,400
him he gave me the same answer. You got to understand for 10 months I had been waiting

1026
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:58,800
to interview anyone from Indiana and hold him accountable. And so he started to frustrate me.

1027
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:04,720
I'd ask him is that conduct you want your coaches at Indiana to do? We've seen the tape. We're taking

1028
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:09,200
it part of our it was just this broken record after about four times. I knew I was going to

1029
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:16,560
get nowhere. So then I got to be honest it was just more of self-satisfaction for me because I

1030
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:23,040
kind of had him. So I kind of wanted to squeeze a little bit the balls like I was just for the

1031
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:27,520
longest time I wasn't not proud of it but I wondered if I crossed the line as a journalist.

1032
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,720
So I said what do you say to people who want to send their sons to play for Bob Knight? Is

1033
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:37,440
that what's going to happen to him? We're going to look at it. And so I asked a couple of personal

1034
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:43,280
things like to piss him off and prompt him. And ironically I heard Christopher Simpson behind me

1035
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,720
say to my bosses he can't ask that. And once I heard I got a reaction out of him I was done with

1036
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:54,000
the interview. I asked about four more questions just to prolong the agony of him standing there.

1037
01:42:54,640 --> 01:43:00,560
And then they left and we put the story on about two hours later where we had Neil watching it.

1038
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:05,760
We had the four members of Indiana University watching it. We did our follow-up piece and it

1039
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:11,920
was front page news across the country. Everybody had a still at the grab. Everybody had it but it

1040
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,040
was a pretty eventful day having Neil Reed come in and leave having them come in and leave and

1041
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:22,880
having to turn the story around in about an hour or two after that. How long would it be after that

1042
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:29,040
before you realized what you missed the first time which was when you sat down with Neil and

1043
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:33,840
Neil watched the video with you. You comment on this. I think it's actually the most powerful

1044
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:39,680
part of the documentary but I don't recall how long after you realized what you sort of missed

1045
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:43,680
that first time. It's certainly understandable why you would have missed it. There was a lot going

1046
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:49,600
on that day. It was getting Neil in, getting Neil out, getting the bozos from Indiana in, getting

1047
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,400
the bozos from Indiana out, getting the story out, the legal stuff, the heated emotions, there's a

1048
01:43:54,400 --> 01:44:03,680
million things going on but the human tragedy of this is a guy Reed has to sit down and watch over

1049
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:09,840
and over and over again. One of the most traumatic experiences of his life and for anybody listening

1050
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:16,400
to this who's suffered trauma it's bad enough once and for most people they never have to see it again

1051
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,880
or have a visceral reminder of it again and yet Neil had to watch it over and over and over again.

1052
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:30,240
You noticed that later. I noticed it immediately. I had spoken to Neil for 10 months.

1053
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,680
To be honest he had probably told me things that he had probably never told anyone else like that's

1054
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:42,400
how close we were with regards to this incident, this moment. There's things he can or can't tell

1055
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:47,680
his parents. He didn't really speak to other teammates. Once he left Indiana he had no contact

1056
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:54,000
really with any of them. In the moment I knew how difficult it was for him. In the moment I knew how

1057
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:02,800
much he trusted me. I knew how far I could push him maybe the right wrong word but dig and pull it out

1058
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:11,840
of him. I knew in the moment how painful it was for him but sadly the focus of that day and to answer

1059
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:20,480
your question probably 15 or 16 years later until I really I truly honestly noticed how I

1060
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:27,440
fucked up or what I didn't do. You have to understand as a journalist you have to be impartial.

1061
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:33,920
I can't be Neil Reed's friend. I have to report the story but in order for him to trust me I have

1062
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,720
to spend a lot of time and have this trust. He would tell me anything and everything so when the

1063
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:44,160
first story comes out and he's under fire I spoke to him for a month after that and then when he

1064
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:50,880
comes back in and watches it the purpose of that second story was to say we did a first story where

1065
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:56,560
this young man alleged these three things and everybody said it's factually incorrect. Oh by

1066
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:03,120
the way it was correct and here's why you can see it for yourself. The trainer for Indiana University

1067
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:07,920
after our first story came out said the choking thing never happened you can give me a lie detector

1068
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:14,400
it never happened. We lined up all the people who discounted our original story and our second

1069
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:22,240
story as I say in the film just focused on the journalism of was what we reported right

1070
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:28,720
and was what Neil Reed initially said to us was it factually accurate and that's what the second

1071
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:33,840
piece was. What I say in the film is I missed the human story sitting right in front of me.

1072
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:40,800
I didn't miss it. I knew it was there because I had developed a relationship with Neil. If I could

1073
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:47,760
turn back the clock 20 years or whatever I probably would have done a follow-up piece with Neil

1074
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:54,800
several weeks several months whatever later to say what was this like personally but the original

1075
01:46:54,800 --> 01:47:00,880
story was about an investigation and a journalism to show wrongdoing. It was poo poo denied and

1076
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:07,680
attacked. The second piece was to say no it was factually accurate. The third piece I should have

1077
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:15,680
done was this was the damage it did to this young man and as I stayed in the film Neil and I stayed

1078
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:21,600
in touch for a number of years after that and I probably erred on the side of in the moment

1079
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,960
keeping him somewhat at arm's distance. There's this balancing act. If you get too close to story

1080
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,800
you're going to make mistakes. If you become friends with the people in your story your

1081
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,240
credibility is going to be questioned and there's a fine line to walk. Looking back as a human being

1082
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:42,960
and that's why I devoted so much time to it in the film is when I was asked to do this film one of the

1083
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:49,280
first things I did is take out the box where I had all the materials from my reporting and I watched

1084
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:54,240
that and Hilary Horgan who is a producer on the film with me she had worked with me a number of

1085
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:59,840
times at ESPN that I had hired her to work on shows I had done. She was in my office when I

1086
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,880
played it. She watched the 40 minutes and said you could just hit play and watch that 40 minutes I

1087
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,400
can't take my eyes off of it. To answer your question in a long roundabout way that's really

1088
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:17,600
the moment when I was in this office with Hilary and she watched it and she just said oh my god

1089
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:22,960
look at the trauma on him look at this and that's why when I went to do the film I showed everybody

1090
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:29,200
and I confessed that I fucked up as a journalist and I did the journalistic part of the story but

1091
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:34,160
I missed the human story sitting right in front of me which was Neil. It's just got the saddest

1092
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,840
ending in a way I mean it's sort of a bittersweet ending as you walk us through in the documentary

1093
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:46,320
which is that Neil seems to go on and do okay I mean he marries a wonderful woman he has these

1094
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,720
great kids he's coaching kids in high school playing basketball he seems to be an amazing

1095
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:57,120
coach the athletes love him and he dies of a massive heart attack at the age of 36. You

1096
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:01,680
just couldn't script something like that it's so tragic and so while there's a part of me that

1097
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:09,120
thinks how amazing is it that this guy who is so traumatized so humiliated manages to not pass

1098
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:15,280
that on to others and that's a big deal most people who traumatize people are themselves

1099
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:21,280
traumatized and he could be someone who stopped the cycle at such a young age is amazing to me

1100
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,200
and yet I don't know not knowing anything about him I can't help but wonder was he able to sort

1101
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:31,200
of reconcile all the horrible things that had happened and why did he have to go so soon?

1102
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,920
I thought that was the most powerful thing again as I look back I saw so many things

1103
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:44,560
16 17 18 years later as I put the film together and relived my reporting from long ago

1104
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:52,160
and one of the more powerful things to me was what happened that caused Neil Reed to leave Indiana

1105
01:49:52,800 --> 01:50:00,880
took everything from him he once told me he said Robert I don't know what's worse

1106
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:08,960
never having your dream come true or having your dream come true and it turning into a nightmare

1107
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:15,840
and that's what happened to him his whole being from probably six seven eight years old on you

1108
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:21,760
can see him in the film in a Bob Knight basketball camp t-shirt when he's under 10 his whole life was

1109
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,640
to go there play he said it was an out-of-body experience for him to put on the candy stripe

1110
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:32,160
sweats at Indiana and walk out on your run out onto assembly hall so when it turned into a nightmare

1111
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:38,560
for him he questioned his entire being and everything that his life had led to to that point

1112
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,560
when Neil Reed left Bob Knight didn't lose anything but a point guard who he quickly

1113
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,680
replaced he still had three national championships an Olympic gold medal he was still in the hall of

1114
01:50:49,680 --> 01:51:00,400
fame and yet all these years later he never overcame Indiana firing him for that and yet Neil was able

1115
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:08,320
to put it behind him for 20 plus years Knight wasn't able to put that firing behind him he

1116
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:17,920
finally returned to assembly hall last year but it took him 20 years to come back so he held that

1117
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:26,320
grudge for 20 years whereas Neil struggled for a number of years but ultimately put it behind him

1118
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:35,840
and the abused as you point out the abuse didn't turn into the abuser I went out to California to

1119
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:42,000
the high school where he was a teacher and a coach he only coached basketball one year he coached

1120
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,600
football he was mainly the golf team coach and I talked to a number of students I talked to the

1121
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:53,600
principal I talked to the athletic director in many ways he was the pied piper at that school

1122
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,960
he would walk through the courtyard and everybody would go hey coach hey coach hey coach they said

1123
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:06,960
he had an infectious smile and it was everything I almost think Neil turned into everything he

1124
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:13,760
wanted coach Knight to be and everything he wanted from coach Knight while Neil was at Indiana

1125
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,360
everything he yearned for and a number of the players have said that that a lot of the players

1126
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:24,720
I interviewed in the late 90s to a man they all said I didn't have a relationship with coach off

1127
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:32,640
the basketball court if you look back to the guys on his 75, 76, 16 his 81 team his 87 team

1128
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:38,800
many of them have had relationships over the years with him I think that 90s era because they didn't

1129
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:46,160
have the success he turned on them and never let them get close enough to him I think Neil became

1130
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:52,000
the coach that Bob Knight never became yeah he's won three national championships an Olympic gold

1131
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:00,320
medal and he's in the hall of fame but the kids at pioneer valley high school loved Neil Reed

1132
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:05,440
and I'm not saying that because I'm biased or anything I went out there and I was shocked

1133
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:11,200
by the emotion they still held for them I interviewed one student who said he's been

1134
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:17,600
gone four years I still have the last texts he sent me on my phone I've never deleted him

1135
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,680
it's a kid who's a golf pro Neil helped him get a job he played on the golf team for him he said

1136
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:28,800
Neil was a Nike guy he goes every day I only wear Nike so I have Neil I have the Nike swoosh on my

1137
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:34,960
chest or my arm or my hat to remember how I got here it was Neil there's all these stories that

1138
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:41,040
just blew me away as to the man he became before he passed away and at such a young age that's the

1139
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:46,480
part that just amazes me is to put yourself back together after all this it's humbling you sent me

1140
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:51,360
an email a month ago maybe longer and I couldn't believe you dug it up which was the last

1141
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:58,560
tweet that Neil sent about 10 days before he died do you remember that yeah do you have it in front

1142
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:04,720
of you because I don't I can recite it but if you have the exact wording I do so it was six days

1143
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:12,880
after Jerry Sandusky was found guilty in the Penn State scandal and it was 10 days before Neil died

1144
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:19,520
he tweeted I now realize that kids deserve to be punched spit on choked and raped in the shower

1145
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:26,960
so a select few can be worshipped like God's when I first started doing research for the film

1146
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:34,240
I came across that and it it literally took my breath away I mean I read it and read it and read

1147
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:39,200
it again because I found it on Twitter on his Twitter account and then I cross-referenced like

1148
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:45,280
when did he write this and I went oh my god it was 10 days before he passed and then I'm like

1149
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:51,200
why the reference to rape in the shower and then I googled the timeline and I was like oh my god

1150
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:57,040
that was right in the middle of the Jerry Sandusky the Penn State football coach who's now

1151
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:03,280
spending the rest of his life in prison for taking advantage of young men and one of them

1152
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:09,360
that was detailed in the court in the shower and when I read that what it told me is and this is

1153
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:16,720
before I went out to Pioneer Valley High School in California to see what became of Neil Reed I'd

1154
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:21,600
stayed in touch with him for a number of years I'm asked to do the film I come up I read this tweet

1155
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:29,520
and immediately I'm like he died a tortured human being is what that tweet kind of said to me

1156
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:37,040
it never left him it aided his mind it aided his heart it aided his soul he never escaped

1157
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:44,320
what happened to him at Indiana and yet when I went out to speak to his wife Kelly I actually

1158
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:49,920
interviewed his two daughters which was amazing I didn't include it in the film out of respect for

1159
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:55,440
them but it's something that Kelly will have forever them talking about their father I was

1160
01:55:55,440 --> 01:56:00,960
amazed because I went out there having read that tweet and when you read that tweet what do you

1161
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:06,960
think of when you know Neil Reed's story and that's what was in his mind and that he tweeted

1162
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:14,160
10 days before his death what comes to your mind it's everything you said which is he is still he

1163
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:20,800
still has PTSD and yet when I went out there that's what I was expecting to hear I interviewed

1164
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,800
his best friends I interviewed guys who were in the office with him in the athletic department

1165
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:29,120
I interviewed all the kids I interviewed the principal she said he worked here probably for

1166
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:36,400
three years before I even knew that was him the kid who got choked Kelly told a story his wife

1167
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:43,360
where they were wrestling around on the bed once and she's like he's so much bigger than me I kind

1168
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:48,880
of went up at him and just by where they were her hands kind of went up and was kind of near

1169
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:55,760
his throat and literally he just stopped and she didn't say turn white but she noticed a

1170
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:03,680
distinctive change in him and I included that in the film because it showed me that he did have

1171
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:11,200
PTSD and that moment never left him even where he's in a playful loving moment with his wife

1172
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:18,240
that flashback still came to him I had seen the tweet so I knew even 10 days before he died it

1173
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:24,240
was still in his mind and his heart and his soul and yet when I went out there the story I uncovered

1174
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:30,000
was the exact opposite that he had kept it from everyone and he kept it locked up in a way and

1175
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,520
even his best friends would say he rarely ever talked about it he didn't bring anybody down he

1176
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:43,360
didn't wallow in what had happened he wanted to move on from it and admirably he did what do you

1177
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,600
think Knight's legacy is going to be I mean I guess just for posterity we can finish the story

1178
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:57,360
somehow to the amazement of any sane person despite having video evidence that Knight chocked a player

1179
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:04,480
which by extension effectively means every other allegation is true somehow this university in its

1180
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:12,000
infinite wisdom decides not to fire him and instead in arguably one of the top 10 acts of

1181
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:19,040
cowardice in the history of at least the modern civilization comes up with this goofy idea of well

1182
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:24,960
you get one more chance but it's going to be under a zero tolerance umbrella I don't think it took

1183
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:29,520
very long for him to violate his zero tolerance right it wasn't it later that year it was in the

1184
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,320
fall of 2000 that he grabbed another kid's arm and I don't even want to go into the story it's

1185
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:40,480
so idiotic but the point is it didn't take long for him to violate zero tolerance he got fired and

1186
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:48,080
I gotta tell you I hope that the kids that chanted his name and cursed the kid who got grabbed that

1187
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:52,240
ultimately led to his firing and all the best I hope those kids are able to watch the videos of

1188
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:57,440
themselves 20 years ago and at least have some some degree of appropriate shame and remorse for

1189
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:02,560
the way they behaved he goes on to coach eight years I think at texas tech before retiring and

1190
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:08,080
I don't know he's done some commentary work on ESPN look he's at the end of his life now he's 80

1191
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:14,720
at least to my eye doesn't look too healthy what's his legacy I think it's mixed I think it's very

1192
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:21,360
mixed I want to back up one thing because you spoke earlier about having a devastating crisis

1193
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:28,560
that kind of brings an awakening to someone in a perfect world my reporting of what happened

1194
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:36,640
my getting the tape could have been that moment for coach night I'm an optimist and at that point

1195
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:43,920
as much as I had battled Indiana when they placed him under zero tolerance which means if you do

1196
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,680
you know we're going to wipe the slate clean you've been here 29 years we don't want

1197
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,880
the faucet just to keep dripping of all these bad things you've done over the 29 years we're

1198
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:56,880
turning it off but if there's one more drip if there's one more outburst you're gone

1199
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,440
you would think that would have been the devastating crisis that would have given him an

1200
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:07,840
awareness that he had to get his temper under control and all these things but it didn't when

1201
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:15,840
he grabbed a student that was a public violation of a breaking of zero tolerance I was getting

1202
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:23,600
phone calls almost immediately after zero tolerance of the ways he was breaking zero tolerance

1203
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:30,000
he wasn't showing up to functions I think what ended up happening with coach night is he met with

1204
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:36,480
Miles Brand and kind of for lack of a better term begged and pleaded for his job Miles Brand gave

1205
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:41,680
him one last opportunity partially I believe because what he had accomplished at the school

1206
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:48,800
and partially because he believes Indiana the university system was partially responsible for

1207
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,760
allowing it to happen so how can the school allow it to happen forever and then all of a sudden say

1208
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:59,040
you're out of here because of this and again as a journalist I try not to take sides in it but I see

1209
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:06,240
his thought process and giving him one last chance and in a perfect polymeric world he changes

1210
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:11,920
the people around him keep him under control and he breaks Dean Smith's record for all-time wins

1211
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:19,200
at Indiana and this is a learning experience for him but it was anything but immediately after

1212
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:27,680
zero tolerance and keeping his job he resented the people at the school he resented from everything

1213
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:34,560
that everyone told me he was like how dare you humiliate me like this after everything I've done

1214
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:40,480
for the school for 29 years winning national titles graduating young men winning an Olympic

1215
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:47,440
gold medal like how dare you question me and that's where it becomes about I and me and he's

1216
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:52,240
a bully and all that stuff so this could have been that devastating crisis that you talked about

1217
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:58,160
earlier the hope was that it would be but immediately after it wasn't I was getting phone

1218
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:04,880
calls one of them I got that I talk about in the film was that he was suspended for three games

1219
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,440
and had to pay a thirty thousand dollar fine so he met with the head of the university council

1220
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:14,160
for the school Dottie Frappweld to decide what games he was going to sit out how he's going to

1221
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:19,920
pay the fine five thousand dollars out of six checks however they were going to do it I was told

1222
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,280
he screamed and yelled at her called her to see where did this this this this this and so I get a

1223
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:31,200
phone call that this happened so I can't report it because I don't have two eyewitnesses as a

1224
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:38,480
journalist me I like to have three or four verify it so I can't report it so what do I do I pick up

1225
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:44,640
the phone and I call Dottie Frappweld and it was a great phone call because I don't know if it was

1226
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:48,080
her assistant but whatever picked up the phone goes Dottie Frappweld's office I goes Dottie there

1227
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,720
yeah she's standing right here may I ask who's calling I go Robert Abbott from CNN may I ask

1228
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:58,160
what this is regard to oh a meeting she had with Coach Knight I'm put on hold Dottie can't come to

1229
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:02,960
the phone right now can I take a message I said yeah have her call me here's the number because

1230
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,960
I don't know this is true I've heard it but I don't know as a journalist I can't report it I

1231
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:12,320
don't know if it's true my phone rang in less than a minute and it was Christopher Simpson

1232
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:19,520
vice president of the school and I remember mouthing into the phone you dumb mother blankety

1233
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:25,920
blank like how stupid are you like I wasn't sure it happened but the fact that he called me back

1234
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:33,040
within like 30 seconds told me yeah now I'm pretty sure it happened now I gotta find out if it did

1235
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:37,920
and when he was ultimately fired it was put in one of the reasons he was fired that exact moment he

1236
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,440
berated her etc etc which he denies by the way if you look at Jeremy Sharpe's interview with

1237
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:53,280
Knight I mean just pathological lying just pathological lying probably to the level of

1238
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:59,120
what a psychopath is capable of right again when I go back to what we talked about early what

1239
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:06,240
fascinates me in a story is an onion you could peel away layer of layer upon layer of the genius

1240
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:12,880
the brilliance the perfectionist that is Bob Knight I will say this I interviewed and spoke to

1241
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:21,600
a lot of players throughout his tenure there and I can't think of one that was a punk he recruited

1242
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:28,320
really really quality individuals I remember after my original reporting being how impressed

1243
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:36,000
the body of people I spoke to were and I interviewed Angelo Pizzo for those of you

1244
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:42,240
don't know as a screenwriter he wrote the film Hoosiers which is based on Mylon basketball

1245
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:46,800
Gene Hackman plays the role that was kind of fashion about Bob Knight he also wrote the film

1246
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,720
Rudy the Notre Dame kind of walk-on football player I interviewed him and the reason being

1247
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:59,040
is Hoosiers came out right before he won the 1987 national championship and Angelo

1248
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:04,000
told a great story about the academy awards his film was up for I think two academy awards

1249
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:11,760
Dennis Hopper was up for one sorry for the tangent but it's an interesting story so Angelo

1250
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:19,280
is an Indiana grad and so is I believe it's David Onspar is co-writer producer whatever they did the

1251
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:23,840
film so it happens to be the academy awards are being played the night of the national

1252
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:30,480
championship game in Indiana wins and is now in the national championship game so Angelo Pizzo

1253
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:34,560
has to decide do I go to the academy awards where my film's up for two I think it was up for

1254
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:40,640
Dennis Hopper and score a musical score something like that or do I stay home and watch my beloved

1255
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:48,080
Indiana so there was a rehearsal for the academy awards and they gave Dennis Hopper like a Sony

1256
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:53,520
watchman and they said hey when you're there for the rehearsal can you turn on the Sony watchman

1257
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:58,080
and see if you can get ABC or NBC whatever the network is that's going to show the game the night

1258
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:04,000
before so Hopper's in there for the rehearsals and he's like there's no way there's so much RF

1259
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:09,520
in this building you'll never get a signal so the two directors writers producers of the film

1260
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:14,880
stayed home to watch Indiana and didn't go to the academy awards when Knight wins the national

1261
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:21,600
championship that night he invites Angelo Pizzo to a practice and Angelo tells me the story he

1262
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,680
goes I go into assembly hall and like I told you it's usually locked and you're not allowed in there

1263
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:31,120
he's sitting way up high and he sees Knight looking at him and he's like god I felt so uncomfortable

1264
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:36,400
and awkward should I be here and he's such a great story teller and he says he almost gets up to

1265
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:41,680
leave but he stays and then a trainer comes up to talk to him right at the end of practice coach

1266
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:46,320
Knight would like to meet you he says he walks down to coach Knight and they start talking I

1267
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:50,080
liked your film blah blah blah he goes what are you doing he goes why he goes I'm going on a

1268
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:54,160
recruiting trip and you're coming with me so he gets in a car with coach Knight I think they

1269
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:59,120
drive to Chicago or maybe they got on a private plane and then flew to Chicago I forget but he

1270
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:04,480
basically spends like the next 10 hours with Knight as he goes on a recruiting trip and he said he

1271
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:10,640
talked about Russian history with Knight for like six straight hours and the reason I bring this up

1272
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:18,080
is in many ways coach Knight is brilliant a genius he's as only god can do give some of us

1273
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:24,480
amazing gifts in one area and so many flaws in another Pizzo talked about how smart he was they

1274
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:29,840
jumped from topic to topic mostly about Russian history and he goes I consider myself a Russian

1275
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,720
history buff Knight blew me away with the stuff he knew we rarely talked about basketball

1276
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:42,640
and that's the genius of coach Knight how well-read he was how he can motivate people but ultimately

1277
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:47,600
like Icarus he didn't understand his flaw and he flew too close to the sun he couldn't control his

1278
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:54,080
temper Dave Kindred who I mentioned earlier says in my film he goes he had an anger in him I don't

1279
02:07:54,080 --> 02:08:00,560
know where it came from or why it was there but it never left him and that was ultimately his

1280
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:07,120
undoing. Robert the story is it means so much to me on so many levels and it is a cautionary tale

1281
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:13,920
even though Knight is a very extreme example of this I don't think I would have gone to the lengths

1282
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:19,120
to have this podcast with you if I didn't believe that others could benefit from sort of a deeper

1283
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:24,880
examination of this the work you did on this was was amazing I'm so grateful you did it first and

1284
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:33,040
foremost for Neil I think you probably deserve at least some credit for the fact that even though

1285
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:43,280
Neil's life was taken too soon he was validated he got to spend that last 12 years of his life

1286
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:48,400
the last decade of his life knowing that what happened hopefully he understood it wasn't his

1287
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:54,640
fault which is easy to say because cognitively of course it wasn't his fault but that's not always

1288
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:59,520
easy to understand as a victim so first and foremost I thank you for what you did for someone

1289
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,080
I've never met but have great affection for and obviously for the rest of us who have benefited

1290
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:12,240
immensely from such an unbelievable story. I owed it to Neil it's as simple as that I owed it to Neil

1291
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:19,280
at one point one of the cuts of the film I got some feedback from ESPN and one executive said

1292
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:26,320
you need to cut that Neil Reed part down to maybe one minute and I was kind of like over my dead

1293
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:35,040
body it's what gives the film its heart and soul I screwed up 16 17 years before by not telling his

1294
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:45,120
story sooner and I feel I owed it to him to make his story part of this film because when somebody

1295
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:51,280
trusts you like that I'm working on another film now where that trust is almost even greater

1296
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:59,520
for the situation the person I'm going to profile is in it's a weight it's a weight on you and as a

1297
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:06,800
journalist you don't want to let that compromise your objectivity I think as a 35 year old

1298
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:15,360
journalist at the time I think I kept Neil possibly too much at a distance not personally

1299
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:20,880
but at least to the rest of the world I felt like if I did a story then I was doing it because

1300
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:25,840
I knew him not because we were friends I was just like I gotta be careful I gotta be careful

1301
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:31,360
and I'm angry with myself because I was too careful and by doing this film at least I told

1302
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:38,560
Neil people who the real Neil Reed was who the Neil Reed I came to know was and as I say at the

1303
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:46,320
end thank you for trusting me to tell your story that's what was the most important thing in the

1304
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:53,200
last days of night to me is the ending and that's what gave the film the heart and soul of it it is

1305
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:57,120
about Bob Knight but it's not about Bob Knight it could be about a local sheriff it could be about

1306
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:03,680
the president it could be about anyone but it was really about a young man who somehow found the

1307
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:09,120
strength to put it behind him and someone who had out all the success in the world more success than

1308
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:14,800
anybody could ever imagine and that human being couldn't put it behind him and to this day is

1309
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:23,200
angry bitter has a temper Neil was the opposite and that juxtaposition has always amazed me as I

1310
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:29,520
look at this story the one kid who had everything taken from him was able to move on and the one

1311
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:37,920
person who in reality had very little taken from him yes he had his job maybe some humiliation

1312
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:43,040
but he still had three national champions an Olympic gold medal hall of fame he just couldn't

1313
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:49,600
move beyond it and it tells you about the character of both individuals Robert thank you very much
