00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,760
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,160
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,040
today's episode. Welcome to another special episode of the Drive. As the podcast is now over

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,120
four years old, we realize we've covered certain topics in a variety of ways across multiple

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
episodes. We realize of course at times it can be hard to piece together this information,

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,040
and it's also difficult for new listeners to be able to go back and keep track of information

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,160
that's been covered in great depth in previous episodes. As a result, we wanted to release

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,480
another episode that is kind of a compilation of clips from previous episodes. We did this before

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,920
and it was a huge success. So for this one, we want to focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,800
disease, ASCVD, cholesterol, and ApoB. This episode includes clips on why it is so important to care

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,080
about ASCVD, the role of cholesterol in ASCVD, and why I don't think anyone should refer to

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,280
cholesterol as good or bad. And finally, we look at why ApoB is an important metric to track when

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,160
looking at your lipids. I put these clips in the order of what we think is the best way to listen

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,280
to them from top to bottom, and also provide some commentary in between clips to give you a little

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,360
bit of context. Our hope is that not only will you understand this topic better, but you will

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
also be able to identify some past episodes you may want to go back to and listen more deeply.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,320
Final thing is that some of these clips are taken from AMA, so if you're not a subscriber,

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,400
we hope this gives you a little bit of a sneak peek of what's covered in those episodes.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,160
This is still a fairly new concept. We've only done this once before. We got great feedback on

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,600
that, which is why we're doing it again. So if you continue to like this, please tell us,

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,160
and if you don't, tell us why. So without further delay, I hope you enjoy this special episode of

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:29,440
The Drive. What we thought would be important is just answering the first question, which is,

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,640
why should someone care about this? It's such a complex topic. Why is it important for people

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,520
to put the time in to really think through and understand it? It really starts with the ubiquity

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,760
of this disease and its assault on human longevity. People have probably heard me say

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,240
this before, but atherosclerosis is really the only inevitable disease of our species. Cancer,

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,960
while prevalent with aging and dementia, while prevalent with aging, do not appear

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,440
inevitable the way atherosclerosis does. So not everybody dies from atherosclerosis, but I think,

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
to my knowledge, everybody dies with it, assuming they live long enough. So you have a condition

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,160
that, as I said, is inevitable, is ubiquitous. Also, I think based on what you're going to hear

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,120
me talk about today, we know a lot about this condition and we really have tools to mitigate it.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,920
To me, that's the reason you want to really understand this. The impact is huge and the

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,640
tools that we have are also huge. So again, we talk about longevity. Longevity has two parts,

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,360
healthspan, lifespan. The lifespan part comes down to delaying the onset of chronic disease,

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,760
of which this is the most common chronic disease. So you can think of a couple of different paths

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,280
to get there, but really the two biggest risk factors, I am putting smoking aside for a moment,

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,440
which is a very straightforward behavioral risk factor. In terms of less clear behavioral risk

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,800
factors, the two biggest are clearly hypertension, high blood pressure, and lipid abnormalities.

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,960
That's the one we're going to focus on here. So atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,600
we'll just abbreviate ASCVD for short, is really what we're here to talk about.

47
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,600
As we get started on this topic, Peter, I think we have people who listen to this podcast of all

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,600
ages, young, old, everywhere in between. I think it's a common thought for people under 30, 40,

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
even some people under 50, where they're just like, this is something that only affects old people.

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll think about this when I'm older, but right now it doesn't really affect me.

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
How would you answer the question in its basic form of, isn't this just a disease of old age,

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,480
and why should those people who think that not just shut off the podcast at this point and instead

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,640
continue to listen and continue to put in the effort?

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,040
Probably have told this story before, and if not, folks haven't heard it, I think it's worth

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,080
hearing again. I remember in my first year pathology lecture in medical school, the pathologist

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
said, what's the most common presentation for a first heart attack? If a person is having their

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
first heart attack, what is the most common thing that they will present with? That's the terminology

58
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,240
we use in medicine. Of course, the hands shot up, chest pain being the obvious. Nope, that's not it.

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Nausea, nope, that's not it. Left arm pain, no, that's not it. It was a trick question,

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,640
of course. The answer was sudden death. The answer was that over 50% of people's first heart attack

61
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,920
is fatal. Now, the good news is today that number is a little bit less. It's probably

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,360
slightly below 50%, but that's still a staggering number. Now, another way to think about this

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,040
is through the lens of understanding the age distribution of people who have their first

64
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,720
major adverse cardiac event. That is a heart attack, stroke, or sudden death due to one of those.

65
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,240
If you don't mind, Nick, pull up figure one. This graph shows the age distribution for both male

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,880
and female in the United States in terms of these incidents. I think the easiest graph for me to look

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:22,240
at here is the one on the right, total annual events. What you can focus on is the first two

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:31,040
bars. That is the bars that are for people up to the age of 65. If you look at the male bars,

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,120
which are the darker bars, you can see that the sum total of those two bars, slightly below 25%,

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,520
slightly above 25%. The implication of that is over 50% of men who are going to have a cardiac

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,200
event in their life will have it before the age of 65. For women, you do the same exercise.

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,320
You can see that it's one third of women. It's clear that there's a shift in time and that women,

73
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,640
while subject to the exact same burden of disease, seem to experience it about a decade later. Still,

74
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,880
fully one third of women are going to have their first cardiac event, which is going to be heart

75
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,880
attack, stroke, or death as a result of those things before the age of 65. A little over 50%

76
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,720
of men will be in that camp. As we're going to talk about in this episode, that's not the whole

77
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
story. It's even more compelling to care about this when you're young, when you understand how

78
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,720
long it takes for this disease to take hold and the implications therefore for prevention.

79
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,800
The most sobering thing for me when you look at this is it's not even the 50% under 65. It's

80
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,400
especially for males, the almost 25% under 54. Especially when we get to what we get to later,

81
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,560
which is for that to happen to someone who's 45-50, it doesn't mean it started two years earlier.

82
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
I think it's pretty crazy when you see these types of stats laid out,

83
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,200
how it creates that shift in your mind around why you should care about this.

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,400
What we need to do is first almost step back and look at what exactly is

85
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,560
ASCVD. I think people have to understand what it is to then really understand how it comes about,

86
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,520
how to think about prevention. What do you think the best way to walk people through

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,880
in a relatively simple form what this disease is?

88
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll explain it at a high level now, and I think we should go through it in some detail in a moment.

89
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,880
The pracy on this would be that ASCVD is a disease state characterized by the deposition

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,000
or the buildup of cholesterol more clearly or more rigorously sterols, which include

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
cholesterol and phytosterol in the artery wall. It initially starts as something called a fatty

92
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,880
streak, which I'll explain in a little bit more detail later. Then it later consolidates into

93
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,560
things called plaques. These can ultimately lead to a reduction in blood flow. Of course,

94
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,640
it's this reduction in blood flow that leads to what's called ischemia. Ischemia is the reduction

95
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,120
in blood flow, and therefore the resulting tissue damage that occurs to the heart is what results in

96
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,520
a heart attack, which can be fatal depending on the amount of the cardiac tissue that is impeded

97
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,000
from appropriate amount of oxygenation. To have this disease, you don't have to be obese. You

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
don't have to have high blood pressure or things of that nature. It's really a question of the

99
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,200
cholesterol in your blood. That's really what defines the disease. The essential condition

100
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,720
of atherosclerosis is the presence of cholesterol in the artery wall, which by the way, is not

101
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,280
necessarily related to the measure of cholesterol in circulation, which we will talk about in great

102
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,760
length. Although these often coexist, patients with cholesterol in their arteries do not necessarily

103
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,560
have to have co-aggravating factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, family history,

104
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,560
smoking, all these things that exacerbate it. You mentioned cholesterol a few times,

105
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,760
and obviously it's a topic that's been talked about on more podcasts than I can even count or

106
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
recall right now. But for this conversation, can you define cholesterol just in its simplest form?

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
So everyone's aware of exactly what we're talking about as we're going to get into

108
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,240
kind of the more nitty gritty. Cholesterol is an organic molecule that resides in the lipid family.

109
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,200
We typically characterize these molecules by their solubility in water, and this is a not

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,760
soluble in water molecule. It is a hydrophobic molecule. I think the easiest way to sort of

111
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,680
picture those things is to think about oils. If you took an oil like olive oil and you poured some

112
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,720
of it into a cup of water, you would immediately see what it means to have a hydrophobic substance

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,680
in contact with something, which is the ultimate hydrophilic substance, water, right? So they

114
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,960
repel each other. Now, of course, cholesterol is about one of the most important molecules

115
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,040
in the body. To be clear, if we didn't have the ability to make cholesterol, we would cease to

116
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,160
exist. In fact, you couldn't be born without the ability to do this. There are rare genetic

117
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,880
conditions that impair the ability to make cholesterol, and these are uniformly fatal.

118
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,520
Why do we need cholesterol? There are broadly two things that cholesterol is essential for.

119
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:33,760
The first is that they contribute heavily to the cell membrane of virtually every cell in the body.

120
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,560
So cells are actually kind of fluid things, spherical things, and what allows them to have

121
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,160
that fluidity and what allows them to have membrane channels that allow things in and out of them

122
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,960
is the cholesterol layer that forms the membrane. Secondly, cholesterol is an essential substrate

123
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,360
for the production of some of the most important hormones in the body, cortisol, estrogen,

124
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
testosterone. It's also essential for the creation of bile acids, which are necessary to be able to

125
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,360
digest food. So the mantra that I like to say is no cholesterol, no life, period.

126
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,760
You should put that on a bumper sticker on your car. Just roll around Texas with that guy.

127
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,360
No, I think that's great. Why don't we look at and discuss, Peter, how does AS CBD come about?

128
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
So before I jump to the figures, I want to make one other point that I should have made a moment

129
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,280
ago, and that is the necessity of the body to make cholesterol. So I think most people, when they

130
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,680
think of cholesterol, will probably first think of what it is that's floating around in their

131
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,640
bloodstream, but will very quickly turn to cholesterol within food because it turns out

132
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,520
that when you eat certain foods, you can also eat cholesterol. So everybody knows, for example,

133
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,080
eating eggs means eating cholesterol. And a natural question is, what is the relationship

134
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,600
between the food that I eat that contains cholesterol and cholesterol you're measuring

135
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,720
in my blood steam? And the short answer is very little. And the reason for that is the cholesterol

136
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,800
that we eat is in a form that the fancy term for it is called esterified. So it has a chemical bond

137
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,280
that swings between an intermediary oxygen and then another side chain. From just a straight

138
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,880
mechanical problem, that is too large for the receptors in our gut to absorb. So most of the

139
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,600
cholesterol that we eat is, in fact, excreted out of our backside. We don't bring it into our body.

140
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,840
And therefore, most of the cholesterol that we are going to talk about today is actually cholesterol

141
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,680
that we have made and that's transported between cells through these things called lipoproteins.

142
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,880
One of the things I remembered from pathology A, so it's the first of the three major classes you

143
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,600
take in pathology, was something that the professor said, which is he said, no doctor has more

144
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:10,240
experience with what it is to have heart attacks than pathologists because 50% of the people

145
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:19,360
who have a heart attack die on their first heart attack. So he said, I'm seeing 50% of the people

146
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,680
who have a heart attack and their first presentation is death. So I kind of remembered that. And it's

147
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,480
a very sobering fact to think that half the time, and again, I don't think that's true today,

148
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,240
but I think 25 years ago, that was the case. The numbers are probably a bit better today.

149
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,800
It might be a third of first events are fatal, but nevertheless, it was sobering. So you have

150
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
this sort of weird factoid that's again, often the recesses of my brain somewhere.

151
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,240
And then you hand me this textbook and it actually made sense with what he said, because

152
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,400
in addition to going through in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis,

153
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,840
it was littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries of people who had died

154
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,320
for other reasons. Notably, they were quite young. So here's a 26 year old male victim of

155
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,160
a gunshot wound. Here's a 27 year old female who died in a motor vehicle accident. Here's a so and

156
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,640
so and so and so. And when you look at their coronary arteries, you realize they already have

157
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:33,440
atherosclerosis. They already have oxidized apo B bearing particles engulfed by macrophages

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,240
and thickened intima. And while they may not have calcification in their arteries yet,

159
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,840
or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months,

160
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,080
they nevertheless had atherosclerosis and they were in their 20s and in their 30s.

161
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:56,080
So all of a sudden, what this professor said 20 some odd years earlier made sense, which is this

162
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,080
was now an explanation. This was a bridge to explain what otherwise seemed hard to understand.

163
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:09,440
Atherosclerosis, it's a disease in the tissue. And almost everything that lipid people talk about

164
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,080
is in plasma. And if we don't understand the natural history of the disease, how can we

165
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:24,800
construct a strategy to prevent it? And although much of my work has been on apo B, the more

166
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,400
important part, I think has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis

167
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:41,920
should direct our prevention strategy. What that leads to is that every major guideline in the

168
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:50,880
world bases their selection of subjects for statin prevention on the 10 year risk of disease.

169
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:03,360
And that was a huge step forward in 1980 and 1990. But it totally, or not totally, but it very

170
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,280
fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible. When you plug in the

171
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,960
numbers to calculate somebody's risk for any of the risk algorithms that American College of

172
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:27,600
Cardiology 2019, AHA, multi society, you plug in numbers that belong to the, that particular patient.

173
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,160
And what comes out is what you think is the risk for that particular patient. It actually isn't.

174
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:45,680
But what drives that calculation is the age and the sex of that patient, things like cholesterol,

175
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:53,200
blood pressure, they contribute minimally to the actual calculation of 10 year risk.

176
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,400
So what that means is if you're 35, well, there is even a risk calculator for you, but if you get to

177
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:09,280
40, almost everybody's risk is low at age 40. And it is until you get to about 55, 60, that risk

178
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,480
gets you over the threshold for the American prevention guideline treatment. So prevention

179
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:28,960
really starts at 55 to 60, but half, almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 60.

180
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:37,200
So how can that be? What Starian and his colleagues established was for the first three decades or so

181
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,400
of life, the disease begins, gets a foothold in the artery. But it's only in the fourth decade

182
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,080
that you start to develop the lesions that can actually precipitate a clinical event.

183
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,440
But risk is low. And yet the event rate is high. How can that possibly be? Well, the answer is

184
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,520
stunningly obvious, which we've published. There are a ton more people under 60 than over 60.

185
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:15,840
So the rate of events is low, but the absolute number of events is high. That's problem number

186
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,520
one. Problem number two is, say you get to 60 and you didn't have an event. Well, the disease was

187
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,560
developing and extending during your 30s, 40s, and 50s. So by the time we start to try and prevent

188
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:42,160
an event, the disease is well advanced in the arteries. That to me are the two fatal flaws

189
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,640
in the 10 year risk approach. And we published a paper pointing this out in JAMA Cardiology a few

190
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,600
years ago, born Nordiskaarden, his colleagues have done exactly the same thing with the European

191
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:04,000
guidelines. You can't beat these numbers. So rather than what Stary taught me, and it took some

192
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,280
years before we could develop the methodology, of course risk is a good concept. Of course it is.

193
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:21,280
But we should be selecting people also based on causes. I can measure your APO B pretty precisely.

194
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,320
I could measure your non HDL cholesterol a little less precisely, but pretty well. And I know it's

195
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,240
yours. When I calculate the risk, if I said, okay, Peter, you're my patient, you're a healthy guy,

196
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,640
I calculate your risk is 4.1%. Now what does that number mean? Is that your risk?

197
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:54,240
Nope. It means that out of 100 people at 4.1%, 4.1 of them will have an infarct. But we know that

198
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,480
within that category, there's a tremendous variance in real risk. Not everybody's at 4.1.

199
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:10,080
Some are higher, some are lower, some are dead on. So if I had two risk algorithms,

200
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,880
the philosopher, AJ Heyer, the English, the logical positive, he was actually

201
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,640
darn good on probability. There's a real challenge predicting singular events. I'm either going to

202
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,280
have an infarct in the next year or I'm not. It's not really a probability. So I either am or I'm

203
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,960
not. If one algorithm said I had a 10% risk and another one said I had a 15% or 20%, whether I

204
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,120
have an infarct or not, both of them were right. Because they said there was sort of a chance you

205
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,480
could. And there was a far larger chance you wouldn't. When we say people should be treated

206
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,080
with a risk above 7.5%, that means 92.5% of the time, nothing will happen. Well, that's not a

207
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,200
great incentive, I think, for helping people understand what's truly going to happen.

208
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,880
So the way we can deal with this and what we've done is develop what's called a causal benefit

209
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:20,880
model. We measure non-HAL or APO-B and we can project the risk over 20 or 30 years. If you're

210
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,720
30 years old, the period of time you should care about is up to age at least to 60. And so if you

211
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,680
were in a group, let's say, and let's say I make you 35 again, and I say your chances of having an

212
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:44,640
infarct or a stroke before you're 65 are 30%, now that's a number you can deal with. That's a number

213
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,760
that has meaning. And we could also calculate how much the risk can be reduced by starting at age 35

214
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,760
or how much you lose by starting at age 45 or how much more you lose by starting at age 55.

215
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,920
This next set of clips is a deeper dive into cholesterol, the limitations of the standard

216
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,920
cholesterol blood panel, and an important segment on why I think no one should ever

217
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,080
refer to cholesterol as good or bad.

218
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,360
I recently posted something on social media about my frustration with the way that the press,

219
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
and frankly, even sometimes the medical establishment, writes about cholesterol,

220
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,600
referring to good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. Now, if you've ever listened to me on podcasts,

221
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,640
you understand that I talk about this in great detail. But a number of the comments suggested

222
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
that there are a lot of people that are kind of new to this discussion. They haven't necessarily

223
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,640
followed me. They certainly haven't heard the, I don't know, literally 25 hours worth of content

224
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,200
on cholesterol over the last four years on my podcast. And they were kind of looking for a

225
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,040
little bit of, call it the TLDR version of cholesterol. And I thought this would be a

226
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,920
great excuse to do it. So if you want to understand why I wail on people when they say bad cholesterol

227
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,960
and good cholesterol, you have to really understand what cholesterol is and why that type of

228
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,200
imprecise language is unhelpful, to put it mildly. Okay, so let's take a step back. What is

229
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:26,080
cholesterol? So cholesterol is a lipid. It is synthesized by every cell in our body. That means

230
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,720
every cell in our body makes cholesterol. Okay, so why do we make this stuff? Well,

231
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,800
this stuff is super important, where every cell in our body wouldn't make it. It's essential for

232
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,840
the creation of a cell. So a cell, when you look at a picture of a cell in a book or online or

233
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
something, they look like two dimensional structures, right? They're sort of these flat

234
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,800
things. But really, that's not what cells look like. That's kind of a cut open cell projected

235
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,320
onto 2D. The reality of it is cells are three dimensional, and they are fluid. They have to

236
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,520
be able to be more than just perfectly open spheres. So what gives them that fluidity is

237
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,800
their membranes. And it's the cholesterol within the membrane that provides that fluidity. It's

238
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,280
also what allows transporters to go across the surface of cells. These transporters are what

239
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,440
allow various things like glucose, ions, hormones, etc., to traverse cell membranes. So it's important

240
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,160
to understand that if we didn't have cholesterol, we wouldn't have cells. If we didn't have cells,

241
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,240
I wouldn't be making this video, and you wouldn't be here to watch this video.

242
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,280
No cholesterol equals no life. Full stop. There are things that are almost equally essential

243
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,480
for life that go beyond that. Cholesterol is the precursor to some of the most important hormones

244
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,920
in our body, which ranges from things like vitamin D to cortisol to estrogen to testosterone,

245
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,120
progesterone, etc. It's also essential for bile acids. We wouldn't be able to digest

246
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,480
most of our food without bile acids, especially fatty foods. So the list goes on and on as to why

247
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,400
cholesterol is essential. So why does the story not end there? Why are we having this discussion?

248
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,640
Well, when it comes to something as essential as cholesterol, not every cell in the body is capable

249
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,560
of making enough cholesterol to meet its individual needs. So the body has to be able to traffic

250
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,680
cholesterol. So there are certain cells that tend to be net exporters of cholesterol. The liver,

251
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,120
for example, as a general rule, the liver makes more cholesterol than it needs. Whereas there are

252
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,080
parts of the body that need more cholesterol than they are typically capable of making, especially

253
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,320
during periods of high stress. So those parts of the body need to receive cholesterol.

254
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,080
And this poses a little bit of a problem because the main channel that we like to use in the body

255
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,440
to transport things back and forth is, of course, the circulatory system. It is not the only system.

256
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,640
We have a lymphatic system, but the circulatory system is the system that we tend to use most to

257
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,800
transport things like this. Now, there are lots of things we transport in the circulatory system,

258
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,600
and we do without any difficulty. We transport glucose without any difficulty. We transport

259
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,400
electrolytes without any difficulty. We transport lactate without any difficulty. Why? Because all

260
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,520
of those things that I just stated are water soluble. And of course, the circulatory system

261
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,080
is made up of plasma and proteins. That's what your blood is. And plasma being basically the

262
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,040
water of the cell. And so things that are water soluble, like all of the proteins, hemoglobin,

263
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,200
and things like that, things that I already stated, glucose, electrolytes, they are soluble

264
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,960
in water, and therefore they transport easily. But as I said at the very outset, cholesterol is a

265
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,320
lipid. And if you remember a little bit from a chemistry class, you'll know that a lipid is not

266
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,080
water soluble. It is hydrophobic as opposed to what we say is hydrophilic. So things that are

267
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,600
hydrophobic can't move in water. Just as you would dump olive oil into a glass of water, you would

268
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,640
quickly realize how much they repel each other. So we have this totally essential thing that we

269
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,280
have to move around the circulatory system. Otherwise we would die. And we can't do it

270
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,960
directly because the medium through which we need to transport it repels the thing we're trying to

271
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,280
transport. Aha, there's a solution. We need to create a vehicle that we can transport this in.

272
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,960
And that vehicle is called a lipoprotein. And as its name suggests, lipo and protein,

273
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,200
it's part lipid, part protein. And it's engineered in a way that the lipid part is on the inside.

274
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,400
The protein part is on the outside. Protein is water soluble. So now you create this spherical

275
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:52,800
molecule, which on the inside you can package the cargo that is hydrophobic, repels water.

276
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,760
And on the outside you have a coating that is hydrophilic, that is attracted to water

277
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,560
and moves effortlessly through the water. And that's how we transport cholesterol. Now,

278
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:13,120
broadly speaking, these lipoproteins traffic in two types of families. A family that is defined by

279
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,320
apoB, which is a lipoprotein that wraps around it or an apo lipoprotein that wraps around the

280
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,360
spherical larger lipoprotein. And apoA, there's an apoA family, there's an apoB family. Technically,

281
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,480
there's two apoB families. There's an apoB 100 and an apoB 48. I'm going to ignore the apoB 48

282
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,760
right now. That just exists on kylo microns. And we could do another class on that at another day.

283
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,640
But for now, we're going to focus on apoB 100, which defines the lineage of lipoproteins

284
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,960
that are terms you've probably heard of, VLDLIDLLDLPLA. And the apoA lipoproteins define

285
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,160
a totally different class of these called HDLs. So what do those names mean anyway? VLDLIDLLDLHDL.

286
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,240
They all refer to another feature of the lipoproteins that is distinct from the

287
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,880
apo lipoprotein that wraps around them, which is their density. So if you think about the high

288
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,840
school experiment where you take various different substances and you put them into water,

289
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,680
you might notice that you can separate how they would float. Now, water is a bad example

290
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,360
of how that works because things are typically binary behaving in water. Either they're sink or

291
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,840
they're going to float. But I think that gives you a conceptual understanding of the difference in

292
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:44,640
density. Density is mass over volume. And a higher density object relative to a lower density

293
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,400
object will sink versus float. So if you take all of those lipoproteins that I mentioned,

294
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,240
all of the apoB ones, all of the apoA ones, and you put them in a certain type of gel in the lab,

295
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,720
you can see a separation of them based on their density. And the highest density ones of those,

296
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,440
we just call the high density lipoproteins, the HDLs. You have more than one apoA on an HDL and

297
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,640
you have different subclasses of HDLs. HDLs are really complicated and we don't even come close

298
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,360
to understanding all the ins and outs of them, which by the way, is why I get really annoyed

299
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,240
when people say having a high good cholesterol is good. Again, what they really mean to be saying

300
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:32,160
is having a high HDL cholesterol is good. And while it's true that on average, higher HDL

301
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:40,720
cholesterol is associated with and traffics with metabolic health in a way that low HDL cholesterol

302
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,200
tends to traffic with bad metabolic health, you can absolutely not tell by looking at an individual

303
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,600
based on how high their HDL cholesterol is if they're in good shape or not. Because that single

304
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,560
snapshot of how much cholesterol is in the HDL tells you nothing about the functionality of the

305
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,360
HDL and it's the functionality of the HDL that matters. I'm not going to talk any more about that

306
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,440
because I have an entire podcast coming out on HDL biology where we'll go into that in great detail.

307
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,560
But it should be stated that efforts to raise HDL cholesterol pharmacologically have by and large

308
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:23,360
mostly, not exclusively, but mostly failed in improving outcomes. Okay, so over on the LDL

309
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:31,920
APO B side, the most abundant APO B 100 or APO B for short lipoprotein is the low density lipoprotein.

310
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,160
That's the one that gets called bad cholesterol. And again, on the APO A side, we have HDL,

311
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,000
which gets called good cholesterol. So a couple of things I want to say on this one.

312
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,120
If you're talking LDL, you are referring to the low density lipoprotein. If you say HDL,

313
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,160
you are referring to the high density lipoprotein. But if someone says, what is your HDL, what is your

314
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,400
LDL, they're asking for a laboratory metric. They are asking incorrectly. There is no laboratory

315
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:11,840
metric called LDL or HDL. There is HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, abbreviated LDL C and HDL C.

316
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,000
There is LDL P and HDL P, which is the particle number of LDL, which can be counted via electrophoresis

317
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,680
or NMR. Of course, my preferred way to count the number of these particles is to look at APO B.

318
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,000
The APO B concentration to me is the most important number you want to understand

319
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,360
to predict from a biomarker standpoint, your cardiometabolic risk,

320
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,920
AOCVD risk, because it captures all of the atherogenic particles. So APO B counts the total

321
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,040
of the LDLs, inclusive of the LP little A's, the IDLs, although they virtually never exist. They

322
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,120
have such a short residence time, and the VLDLs, which can become problematic in people with

323
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,000
metabolic syndrome and high triglycerides. So APO B gives you the total atherogenic burden of those

324
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,400
lipoproteins. And therefore, I think it's the preferred metric by which we want to assess risk.

325
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,720
But if you want to look at LDL, you have to look at LDL C, LDL cholesterol, and HDL, you have to

326
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,800
look at HDL cholesterol. Now, is the cholesterol in the HDL any different from the cholesterol in

327
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:20,240
the LDL? No, of course not. Therefore, it is totally erroneous to say, HDL is good cholesterol

328
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:28,640
and LDL is bad cholesterol. Now, instead, what is true is that LDLs themselves as lipoproteins

329
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:35,920
are bad actors because of what they do. What they do is they go into artery walls where they get

330
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:43,680
oxidized, and they basically dump their oxidized sterile contents into the subendithelial space,

331
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,680
which elicits an immune response and a whole bunch of other things that lead to atherosclerosis,

332
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,000
which I'm not going to get into now. But the point of this discussion that I want people to understand

333
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,400
that LDLs and HDLs are lipoproteins. If you want to talk about the cholesterol, you talk about LDL

334
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, but the cholesterol in them is the exact same. And there is no such

335
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,600
thing as good cholesterol or bad cholesterol. And so you just have to be careful when you see things

336
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,240
written that are written through that lens, because what it tells you is the person writing

337
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,080
this doesn't understand the basics of lipids and lipoproteins. And if they don't understand the

338
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,360
basics of lipids and lipoproteins, because what I just told you guys is literally the 101 on this

339
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,440
subject, we didn't get to the senior level class, let alone the graduate level class. And this is

340
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,760
complicated stuff once you get into that level. So if someone writing to me is butchering the 101,

341
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,440
you can stop reading, because whatever else they're saying, they're undoubtedly screwing it up.

342
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,160
So there it is. There's the TLDR on lipids.

343
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,800
If a doctor gets a report now, he gets total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDLC,

344
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,120
LDL-C, HDL-C, five numbers. Do you think he actually looks at any of those numbers? He's trying to do a

345
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,040
good job. He does. But let's say the triglycerides are high. Can he do anything with that?

346
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,440
Nope.

347
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,720
Because everything is based on LDL-C. So he's got, in reality, four numbers that are doing nothing.

348
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,760
Let's explain that to people, Alan, because you and I know the ins and outs of that very well,

349
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,840
but I think most people here don't understand the difference between the calculated and measured LDL.

350
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,280
So let's start with that. And then let's talk about how VLDL has been estimated.

351
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,160
And let's bring this all back in terms of some other work you've done, which is understanding

352
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,600
the role of triglyceride in APO-B. So let's start with the basic. You go to the doctor,

353
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,680
you get a set of labs done, and the LDL number comes back at 140 milligrams per deciliter.

354
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Is that actually what it is, or is that an estimation?

355
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,400
That's an estimation. It's almost always a calculation. And there are at least eight

356
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,600
different methods to calculate LDL cholesterol. So if there are eight different methods, they don't

357
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,120
all give the same answer, or you wouldn't have eight different methods. LDL cholesterol can also

358
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,840
be measured directly. That assay has never been validated in disease patients, and no one has

359
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:28,880
ever published a paper showing that it's more accurate in terms of disease identification than

360
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,720
calculated LDL cholesterol. And yet people have paid good money for that lab test. There's no

361
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:44,320
question that the number of LDL particles is a more accurate index of risk than the LDL cholesterol.

362
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,600
The LDL-DL cholesterol is a cholesterol that's in the very low density lipoprotein particles,

363
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,520
the particles that come out of the liver. That cholesterol is atherogenic. There's a lot of

364
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,360
triglyceride in that particle. So the people who measure triglyceride say, well, the triglycerides

365
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,560
are high, that must be the problem. And there's no question that people with high triglycerides

366
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,840
are at increased risk of heart disease. But the people with the high triglycerides were at

367
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,600
increased risk of heart disease, have a higher number of LDL particles and VLDL particles.

368
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,080
It's the particle. And when you're measuring the triglyceride, you're just measuring a blob

369
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:33,600
of liquid in a bunch of particles, and you need to know the number of them. So it's an important

370
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,160
number in the sense of if you're a lipoprotein guy trying to figure things out, if it's extremely

371
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,520
high, it increases the risk of pancreatitis. But I haven't seen any solid evidence that

372
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,600
triglyceride itself is pro-atheregenic. What's atherogenic is the cholesterol inside the VLDL

373
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,600
particles. It's the number of those particles that get into the wall. Now there's a complicating

374
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:04,160
reality because in general, all I need to know is the APO-B. But there is a disorder called

375
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:13,440
Remnant, type 3 dyslipoproteinemia. And that's a very specific, highly atherogenic condition

376
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,360
that manifests with high triglycerides, high cholesterol, but get this, you know, low APO-B.

377
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,680
So when I measure my lipids in APO-B, I can recognize that. But if you don't measure the

378
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,880
APO-B, and this applies to most of the people who are listening to this podcast,

379
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
if they go to see their doctors, that condition can't be diagnosed.

380
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,840
A last set of clips will focus on why I think APO-B is a superior lipid metric

381
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,720
to LDL cholesterol or even non-HDL cholesterol when trying to predict risk.

382
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,320
Are you optimistic? I mean, is this just a question of time? I mean,

383
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,280
in 10 years, will kids in med school be learning about APO-B instead of LDL?

384
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm pessimistic. Europe, the 2019 guidelines were very pro-APO-B. The evidence from Mendelian

385
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,840
randomization, like the newer technologies, Mendelian randomization, they've just been

386
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,680
slam dunked for APO-B. Let's explain that to folks, because I want to talk about the causality

387
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,360
of this. And this might be the perfect way to actually explain the causality of APO-B

388
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,200
in the context of this tool. So can you explain to folks what a Mendelian randomization is?

389
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,680
Where people see this all the time in studies, but I don't think it's entirely clear for the

390
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,680
average person what it means. I'll try, okay? It's not my expertise, but I'll try. The conventional

391
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,960
ways of taking things apart with prospective observational studies like Framingham,

392
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,240
there's a limited amount of the certainty of your conclusions because of confounding you can't

393
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,800
deal with. You take measurements at age 20 and you follow someone for the next 30 years.

394
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Well, a lot of things change in the next 30 years that you don't have a handle on.

395
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:18,080
Your inferences are probable, but not causal. What Mendelian randomization allows you to do

396
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,720
is to come a lot closer to causality, because, for example, you can identify

397
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,440
groups of genes that are associated where changes in the gene are associated with a

398
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,520
little lower cholesterol or a little higher cholesterol. And when you lump together a bunch

399
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,600
of those different genes that can have different makeups, because you can change the makeup of a

400
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:50,880
gene pretty easily, you can see fairly substantial differences in cholesterol. So what you've got

401
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:59,760
is information on somebody that's fixed at birth. And you see, is that associated with a difference

402
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,560
in outcome? You've gotten rid of a lot of stuff in the middle. And what a number of Mendelian

403
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,400
randomizations have shown is that APO-B includes all the information in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol,

404
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,720
and even HDL cholesterol. It sums them, which in the sense of VLDL and LDL makes perfect sense.

405
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:28,720
So there are caveats in Mendelian randomization. You can't just push a button and say, give me the

406
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,280
answer. But George Davey Smith, really arguably one of the founders of Mendelian randomization,

407
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,000
or not arguably, he was. He's the author of a number of the Mendelian randomization saying,

408
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:52,320
APO-B incorporates and therefore beats triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. So that's a huge level of

409
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,800
information that isn't even mentioned in almost any of the guidelines.

410
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,640
Yeah. So let's make sure people understand everything you just said, because you said

411
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,200
a lot of things in there. When you prospectively follow a cohort, the way the Framingham cohort

412
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,680
was followed, or the Framingham offspring, or the Mesa cohort, or any of these cohorts have been

413
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,840
followed, you can take a bunch of people and you could measure their APO-B or their LDL-C or whatever

414
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,640
metric it is that you're trying to determine if it in fact has a causal relationship to the disease

415
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,040
of interest. You can follow them over decades and you would demonstrate, as has been demonstrated,

416
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:40,320
that the people with higher B, higher LDL-C, higher non-HDLC and lower HDLC all have a higher

417
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,720
risk of developing atherosclerosis over time. But it's hard to say that that's causal just based on

418
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,600
that information, because over the ensuing 20 years that you follow them, they are free to make other

419
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,080
choices that may impact those variables of interest and other variables. So the Mendelian

420
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:06,880
randomization attempts to get around that by saying, at the time of, I was going to say birth,

421
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,440
but really at the time of conception, we all get randomized to a set of genes. We get assigned a

422
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,920
set of genes. I guess they're not perfectly random because they come from our parents, but

423
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,480
for the purpose of not changing, they are indeed a random assignment that is fixed. If we can

424
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:34,080
identify which genes map to which phenotype and we can figure out the genes that map to the

425
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,160
phenotype of our interest, namely driving up or down a variable of interest such as APO-B,

426
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,720
then we don't really have to worry about the confounders that occur in between because the

427
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:54,000
genes can't change. Just to put a bow on that, basically now when you see a difference in outcome,

428
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:02,160
it's much more likely to be causally related to the phenotype of interest because the gene has

429
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,000
not changed that underlies it. Now, what are some of the ways that we can get tripped up with

430
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,560
Mendelian randomization? I mean, there's some pretty big ones. Yeah, before we get there,

431
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:19,840
HDL cholesterol was the rage, the total rage because the epidemiological evidence couldn't

432
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:27,440
be clear. In fact, it was four times more clear. My recollection was that Framingham demonstrated

433
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:34,720
low HDL-C was four times more predictive of cardiac events than high LDL-C. Am I remembering

434
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,320
that correctly? I'm not sure it's that multiple. Yeah, but it's multiples. It turns out, as we

435
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,200
know now, at least in the CTP inhibitors, that you can't manipulate HDL and change outcomes.

436
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,840
That's one of the elements of demonstrating an overall causal relationship. The Mendelian

437
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:01,200
randomization show HDL is not causal, whereas they show APO-B is. Cholesterol is too, by the way.

438
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,840
Those are two very important studies, Alan. I mean, and both of those have been in the last

439
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:16,160
10 years. Yeah. It's an incredibly technical advance in being able to examine questions

440
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,040
and look at numbers of people that would be unimaginable in conventional studies.

441
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,320
The Mendelian randomization, they're always talking hundreds of thousands of people

442
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,800
because they've got these huge data banks with genes. Those numbers get you around the confounding

443
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:40,480
of things. You have huge numbers, but it's like any methodology. No method is perfect.

444
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,440
This one can mislead you too, particularly when you've got a sequence of associated variables.

445
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,800
For example, people show using MR that triglycerides were, quote, causal or associated with

446
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,280
increased risk. But when you took into account that non-HDL cluster or the APO-B disappears.

447
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,360
So when you've got a linked metabolic chain, you've got to be careful that you've gone to the end of

448
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:14,800
it. You've got the real actor, not act one leading to, that you've got the real persona dramatist.

449
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,760
Which is why it's surprising that HDL didn't at least at the first order demonstrate causality,

450
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:29,120
because there's no doubt that phenotypically the high triglyceride low HDL phenotype

451
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,480
is so associated with metabolic syndrome that it makes up two of the five criteria.

452
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:43,840
That's an incomplete description. That's like you describing yourself as six feet tall,

453
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,240
I wish, and not giving your weight and letting me guess your BMI.

454
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:56,400
You cannot characterize any phenotype without the APO-B. It really drives me around the bend.

455
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,400
When people speak saying, I got somebody because I got their triglycerides in their HDL.

456
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,760
Well, I say, okay, what's their APO-B? How can you pretend you've evaluated the system when you

457
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,360
haven't counted the number of anthropogenic particles? Because they could be normal,

458
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,560
they could be high, or you can have a type three. They don't know, and it's not a phenotype.

459
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:30,320
There is no phenotype without putting an APO-B in there. They're lipoprotein particles.

460
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:37,040
They're disorders of lipoprotein particle metabolism. Of course, the triglycerides in

461
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,120
cholesterol are important, but my analogy, I didn't do a good analogy there, but it's so

462
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:54,080
fundamental that it drives me to distraction as to why you wouldn't want to know a core element of

463
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,720
knowledge, but it doesn't seem to bother many of my friends. You walked through the pathophysiology

464
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,280
of how the APO-B bearing particle wreaks havoc in the artery wall many, many years before we see

465
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,520
clinical events. You also mentioned that there are other factors that can amplify or exacerbate that.

466
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,760
I can't remember exactly how you said it, but that was the gist of it. Two of those things

467
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,760
that are widely accepted to exacerbate risk are smoking and hypertension. In fact,

468
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:31,280
smoking and hypertension probably carry a greater risk for atherosclerosis than APO-B,

469
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,600
or is that not the case? It all depends the way you think about it, because if you just say,

470
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,000
what's the risk somebody with hypertension faces, they have high risk, no question.

471
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,240
But then you say, what is hypertension? The last 30 or 40 years, there have been

472
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,360
almost an infinite number of basic science studies on hypertension. When you were in medical school

473
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,160
and even before that, when I was in medical school, we talked about pathophysiology of

474
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,440
hypertension. What strikes me is we don't talk about the pathophysiology of hypertension anymore,

475
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:16,080
but the basic science goes on in rats that's healthier than ever. There isn't anything I know

476
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,680
of that's come out of that basic science that's been clinically useful in the last 30 years.

477
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,320
The drugs we use, we use them because they work. So what is hypertension? It's a higher blood

478
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:35,760
pressure than we should have. And where is the disease that produces that higher blood pressure?

479
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,480
Is it resistance? We don't have a clue. We don't have a clue. And it strikes me it's the same thing

480
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,400
as much of the debate in lipids about APO-B or the drunk looking for the key under the light,

481
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,400
because this is where the light is, not where he lost it. Everybody who's anybody has the same

482
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,200
viewpoint. My bet is it's in the proximal aorta. My bet is that it isn't that complicated. We lose

483
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,040
elastance in the proximal aorta. And that's systolic hypertension. Thank you very much.

484
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,920
What could accelerate that process? What's the mainstream view that this is renal?

485
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,880
When I read hypertension, I get lost because I get page after page after page of peripheral

486
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:26,880
arteriolar tone and very complex metabolic studies and very sophisticated animal models.

487
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,480
There's some renal left. It's a miasma for me, an absolute miasma.

488
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,400
I hadn't heard about the proximal aorta. So say a bit more about that.

489
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,560
Well, I'd say this is me. The proximal aorta is elastic. And if you look at a flow curve,

490
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,880
a hydrostatic pressure curve, when we're young, it's rounded because as the left ventricle

491
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:55,920
ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, the aorta expands. So it absorbs some of that energy.

492
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
You know that wind kessel that they mentioned in school? That's not that big a deal, but

493
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:10,000
the energy is partially captured, partially regained, but the wall isn't battered. The wall

494
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,480
can give way. Me, personally, just in the middle of my brain, imagine that if those elastic fibers

495
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,400
start to go, then the wall stiff. So now when the left ventricle ejects blood, the pressure goes up

496
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,880
more rapidly and it falls more rapidly and diastole. And that's why you get systolic

497
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,440
hypertension with normal diastolic pressures. So my bet would be if I was not the age I am,

498
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,160
I would be looking at factors like cardiac output again, which used to be way back when,

499
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,880
or factors that alter the behavior of the proximal aorta as much as something that's,

500
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,320
to me, pathophysiologically, much more likely to be involved. So once I got hypertension, okay,

501
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,720
then I've got a driving force to push particles into the wall.

502
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,800
And so you think it's the actual increase in the pressure of the plasma?

503
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,120
And the response of the wall, I think there are responses to the wall, the wall thickens up,

504
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,760
it gets harder for particles to go through. Does it also damage the endothelium? Do you think that

505
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,280
plays a role? That's right. I don't understand endothelial dysfunction. It's more a language

506
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,560
thing to me than it is a reality. I know the endothelium is critically important. It functions

507
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:32,400
abnormally and that's endothelial dysfunction. How that fits into the overall thing, I don't know.

508
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,960
My bet is APOB particles are part of the process of inducing endothelial dysfunction,

509
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,680
but I don't know that clearly experimentally. So going back then to the question at the

510
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,640
top, does it make sense to even compare hypertension to APOB? They both seem to play a causal role.

511
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,720
Is one more causal than the other, or is that a silly question because they're not binary and

512
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,000
static? I think that's not the right question. I think our blood pressure goes up as we age.

513
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:10,400
I mean, hypertension involves so much of the population. It's not clear to me what the word

514
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:19,120
disease means. The prevalence as we age is so high that to me it's becoming almost a aging

515
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,480
process because we're lasting a lot longer than we were probably designed to go. So you have this

516
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,360
repetitive injury to the proximal aorta. It gets a little progressively less able to deal with it.

517
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,720
So at a time where 50, what percent? 60% have higher blood pressure. I mean, the figures are

518
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,880
staggering. Is it really that high? I'm not sure. Don't quote me on that, but it's high, high, high.

519
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,760
But doesn't APOB also rise with age? It does rise with age, but not that much. When we look at

520
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:57,920
people at age 35, we can pretty accurately categorize the group they belong to at age 35.

521
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,200
Not that they won't change somewhat. So if you're high at age 35, you've got about a 95% chance of

522
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:12,640
staying high. 5% will go out of the high zone. They won't go low, low. So if you're high at age 35,

523
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,760
I wouldn't bet anything's going to move you down. That's why I think it's such a good signal

524
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,160
for when we should start thinking about treating people. And if you're low,

525
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,480
some people go from low towards high, but the majority don't and we keep following them.

526
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:38,160
But if you're high, no, we've published a fair amount of this. If you're high, it's not 100%,

527
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,760
but it's about 90% that you're going to be high. Is there a gender difference? At least clinically,

528
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,920
I seem to see women as they go through menopause experience, dyslipidemia that men wouldn't

529
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,520
experience over that same decade or even five-year transition. I think there are changes and APOB

530
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:01,280
goes up with menopause. I'd like there to be more data. I think part of the reason it's held APOB

531
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,320
back is that people didn't measure it. So they were sort of, well, what I measured has to be

532
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,840
important because I can't answer your question. Hopefully more data will be coming. But I agree

533
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,720
with you. People can change in the menopause. So I'm not saying we don't keep looking at people,

534
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,040
but when you have somebody at age 35 to 40 who's high, the odds are high that they're going to stay

535
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,640
high. Are we doing a better job treating hypertension than dyslipidemia? I have no

536
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:35,600
idea. The incidence of coronary disease is going up in the last five years. And that's despite

537
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:43,680
statin therapy and that's the obesity, diabetes. So I think we've been too quick to congratulate

538
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,000
ourselves at how well we're doing. There are many reasons that treatment is not succeeding as well

539
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,600
as it should. And I think the complexity of the lipid phenotype of the lipid model

540
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,800
is part of the answer. It's easy for me. I get the APOB where I want it to go.

541
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,400
Yeah. I mean, an explanation for your observation would be if in the last five to 10 years,

542
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,080
the incidence of atherosclerosis or major adverse cardiac events is rising despite

543
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:17,520
the advances we have, you would argue or could argue that if we're measuring LDL-C

544
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:25,680
and that's our proxy for treatment, but as dyslipidemia is growing in the metabolic context,

545
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,920
meaning if you have more medicine and more insulin resistance and more type 2 diabetes,

546
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,480
we know that those phenotypes are associated with greater discordance between APOB and LDL-C,

547
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,960
suggesting that you have a greater and greater portion of the population that is being undiagnosed

548
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,120
or being underdiagnosed because you're treating their LDL-C and you believe that it's lower than

549
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,200
their risk actually is because their APOB is higher. I know you know what I just said. I hope

550
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,200
the listener understands what I just said. Yeah. What you just said was important.

551
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:04,000
It's another example, an unfortunate sad example. The trying to quantify lipoproteins based just on

552
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,840
lipids is not adequate. You're not capturing all the information that you should.

553
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:22,320
Let's go back to the macro point here around APOB, which is a greater coalescing around the

554
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:31,760
idea that APOB concentration matters. I think it's very well understood that two of the biggest risk

555
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,960
factors for cardiovascular disease are smoking and hypertension. I don't think there is any

556
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:43,200
ambiguity that cigarette smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular

557
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:49,040
disease. They both appear to do so through a mechanism that weakens the endothelium or

558
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:56,000
creates an injury to the endothelium. The question now becomes, as you put it, Tom,

559
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,000
how ironclad is the story that it's the APOB-bearing particle in the presence of

560
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,920
injured endothelium that is the Trojan horse that begins this destructive

561
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:18,000
trajectory of taking that cholesterol into the subendithelial space, becoming retained,

562
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,320
undergoing this chemical oxidation process, which then kicks off an inflammatory response

563
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:31,520
that paradoxically, as an attempt to repair the damage, results in what can be a fatal injury.

564
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,040
There are other hypotheses, for example. There are people who note, and we have, I mean, look,

565
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,840
I have a patient in our practice, Tom, you've weighed in on her case, walks around with a

566
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:48,640
total cholesterol of 300 and something, an LDL cholesterol of 220 milligrams per deciliter,

567
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:57,040
an APOB of 170 milligrams per deciliter. She's in her late 60s and her coronary artery calcium

568
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,640
score is zero. We have elected to not treat her with any lipid lowering therapy. In other words,

569
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:11,440
there are exceptions to this. How do we reconcile that? Well, it's the human body in medicine. As

570
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,840
you know, not all smokers are going to come down with lung cancer or chronic obstructive lung

571
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:22,480
disease. Why not? If that's such a horrible risk factor. I try to explain this, and I've certainly

572
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,240
seen cases like you say where, oh my God, if I was just going to say, give me your APOB or whatever

573
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,520
cholesterol metric, you're going on three drugs right now, you've got no choice. Maybe the old

574
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,600
days we approach people that way, but no more. I think you have to individualize your whatever risk

575
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:46,640
factors you discover that might wind up causing atherogenesis and then figure it out. Particle

576
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:53,200
number is certainly a major factor that might force it in, but not always. Endothelial function,

577
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,400
although you can certainly, if you review the history of this and how do you really determine

578
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,840
endothelial function, not everybody has serious endothelial dysfunction who winds up with that

579
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,520
through scratch. Particle number itself, and some people can just make the particles go in. I think

580
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,560
if we take most adults who's not going to have a little bit of endothelial dysfunction, so

581
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:21,440
I agree with you, it's a combination of something about atherogenic particles, be it their number,

582
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,600
endothelial dysfunction. But I'm talking more and more now when I discuss any type of lipoprotein,

583
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,240
I don't care which subgroup you want to talk about. I think we certainly have to know its

584
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,800
particle concentration, but I like to talk about particle quality. So what are the other attributes

585
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:45,920
of any lipoprotein that might contribute to its atherogenicity or in some perhaps not understood

586
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,840
make it relatively, it's not going to generate atherosclerosis. And there certainly have to be

587
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,720
things like that going on. So as we're getting smarter, we're looking at other components of

588
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,320
the lipoproteins that could be other proteins that are on them, that could be their complex

589
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:10,000
lipidome and trying to see, aha, can that help us discern whether in you a given particle

590
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,000
concentration is more worrisome than it is in the next person? So there's a lot going on. And also

591
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,520
from the gist of this conversation, listeners will know atherosclerosis, atherogenesis is a

592
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,560
multi-complex, multi-factorial disease. And that's why even when Peter and I, if we consult on a case

593
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:36,880
and we realize in this person, we have to beat up APOB and get their particle numbers to a more

594
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,880
physiologic range, we don't stop once we do that. We examine in great detail for other things that

595
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:48,800
might be injuring the endothelium or the arterial wall and see are any of those treatable or so.

596
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,040
So we're getting a little bit smarter on lipoproteins, but there certainly is more to it than

597
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:59,200
just particle number. Do we think that there's a limit to where the benefit of reduction

598
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,800
becomes diminishing or even J curves in the other direction? So we discussed it in the first episode

599
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:14,000
significantly. We did so again with Ron Kraus. It wouldn't be the worst idea in the world a couple

600
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,880
of years from now to sit down and do it again and reexamine the data. But again, I think the causal

601
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,840
relationship between APOB and atherosclerosis is as strong as virtually anything we see in medicine

602
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,120
for which you can't do the perfect experiment where you have to rely on natural experiments.

603
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,800
Nevertheless, maybe it's not entirely clear what the dose response looks like. So if you have

604
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,360
somebody whose APOB is 160 milligrams per deciliter, there's a risk reduction that comes to lowering

605
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:52,640
it from 160 to 100 and lowering it from 100 to 80 and lowering it from 80 to 60. What do we know

606
01:03:53,360 --> 01:04:01,840
about the risk reduction in lowering it, say from 60 to 40 to 20? And I ask both what we could infer

607
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,280
pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically. In other words, from the Mendelian randomization

608
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,920
versus the pharmacologic. Well, even using pharmacologic trials and Mendelian randomization,

609
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:20,400
the concept you're going to come across with is lower is better. And with the pharmacologic thing,

610
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,360
we're modulating things that either have clinical trial proof that if you lower them, it's good,

611
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,800
or the Mendelian randomization, looking at genes where that drug might be doing something,

612
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,920
it works. Now you do need a few APOB containing lipoproteins. They do traffic other lipids. They

613
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,720
traffic fat-soluble lipoproteins. But we must never confuse A-beta lipoproteinemia where nobody

614
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,080
either or that person can't make them, or hypo-beta lipoproteinemia where they make a few,

615
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,560
enough to traffic those other things that a lipoprotein might have to traffic.

616
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:02,640
But even the guidelines where they examine people looking at their baseline APOB or LDL cholesterol,

617
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,400
the first thing they suggest, at least in the higher risk people, is try and get a 50% reduction.

618
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,360
And that's where most of the bang for the buck is going to be. Now, if you still have options

619
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:19,920
that you can lower it further, yeah, the trials show, yeah, there is incremental reduction events,

620
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:27,760
but it's a much smaller absolute risk reduction and dropping it the 50% or so. So I don't know

621
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,600
if that answers your question. So most people don't have the type of levels where with modern

622
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:41,680
therapeutics, with modern lifestyle, we can more often than not attain physiologic concentrations.

623
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,880
And if I want to talk about APOB, that's probably under 50 milligrams per deciliter,

624
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,560
if we can get there. That's what the newborns have. That's when you go in clinical trials,

625
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:57,840
if you take it down that low, you see your most risk reduction. And so far, at least with

626
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:05,120
pharmacologic lowering of APOB with the currently FDA approved drugs, there is no signal of harm.

627
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:11,440
Yeah, again, it's funny because I was just about to say with the current crop of drugs,

628
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:20,560
specifically the PCSK9 inhibitors, we are routinely seeing patients who easily can get an APOB into

629
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:27,440
the 20 to 40 milligram per deciliter range. You and I actually sat down a couple of months ago and

630
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:36,480
did a calculation to estimate how much cholesterol is actually contained in the circulating lipoproteins

631
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,320
versus that which is in cell membranes. Do you remember doing this with me?

632
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:47,600
Not per se, but and we're developing equations, you're the master of that.

633
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,760
Well, it was one of these things, right? It was sort of like, look, when you look at a person's

634
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:59,280
plasma glucose level, you realize pretty quickly it represents a tiny fraction of total body glucose.

635
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:07,280
And similarly, there's such a concern about plasma cholesterol level, but given how essential

636
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,000
cholesterol is, it's understandable why people would be concerned that low cholesterol could

637
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,600
be problematic. But once you do the calculation and realize virtually all of the cholesterol in

638
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,800
the body is contained within the cell membrane or within the steroidal producing tissue,

639
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:31,680
the circulating amount is a very narrow window into the total amount of cholesterol and therefore

640
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:40,880
a reduction of say 60 milligrams per deciliter to 50 milligrams per deciliter of APOB or even

641
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:47,920
something more extreme, like a full 50% reduction of total cholesterol, 200 milligrams per deciliter

642
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,160
to 100 milligrams per deciliter, does not represent a significant reduction in total body cholesterol.

643
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,360
This is a very important point, right? Let me repeat it. You have a total body cholesterol

644
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:04,000
that you measure in the plasma that says, oh, it's 200 milligrams per deciliter.

645
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,840
That goes down to 100 milligrams per deciliter. Let's say the LDL fraction reduced from 150 to

646
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:16,000
75 or something. Someone might say, God, you just cut cholesterol in half. That can't be good for

647
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,520
you given the importance of cholesterol. But my point is, no, you simply cut the amount of

648
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,720
cholesterol being carried by the lipoproteins in the plasma in half. That doesn't capture the

649
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:32,160
majority of the cholesterol. Yes. Thanks for refreshing my memory, what you're talking about.

650
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,960
Now it's really pools of cholesterol throughout the body. I'm so glad you brought this up because

651
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,720
this is just not even understood, even in the lipidology community. We have a total body

652
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,080
cholesterol. There are basically three pools. There's your brain and nothing we're talking

653
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,480
about today has anything to do with brain cholesterol. It's a separate system. It doesn't

654
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,680
interact with the other cells in your body or certainly with the cholesterol in your plasma.

655
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:04,800
So if it's not in your brain, where is cholesterol in your body? Well, it's either in all your

656
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:11,840
peripheral cells, perhaps some more than others, or it's circulating in your plasma. If it's in

657
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:19,120
the plasma, where is it? There's an Etsiwin C amount bound to albumin. There's more bound within

658
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,560
all of the lipoproteins that are trafficking in your body, meaning your ApoB and your ApoA1

659
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:30,720
particles. But believe it or not, if I wanted to search down blood cholesterol for you,

660
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:36,160
I would suck out your red blood cells and extract cholesterol from them. Red blood cells carry far,

661
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:42,320
far more cholesterol than do all of your lipoproteins put together. And the other crucial

662
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,760
point you made subtly, and I hope everybody understood you, the amount of cholesterol within

663
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:53,840
your lipoproteins has no correlation with your cellular cholesterol or even your red blood cell

664
01:09:53,840 --> 01:10:02,320
cholesterol. So however you're modulating some LDL, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol metric,

665
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,760
that tells you nothing about what might you be doing to the cholesterol content of your cells.

666
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,240
So don't have a panic attack if you're making LDL cholesterol 30, because I can assure you

667
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:20,160
virtually every cell in your body, even if that's your plasma LDL cholesterol, has more than enough

668
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,520
cholesterol because it can de novo synthesize it, it can put it in its cell membranes or other

669
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,840
organelles that require cholesterol. If it's a storogenic tissue, it can produce a little more

670
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,960
or perhaps de-lipidate some life. So there's no cell that's being deprived of cholesterol

671
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,640
in the periphery when you are modulating lipids through lifestyle or drugs.

672
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:59,200
So on ASCBD, I've also become far more aggressive on the timing and magnitude of apob reduction.

673
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:08,560
So take a step back and ask what are the leading causes or modifiable causes of ASCBD? The big three

674
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:16,560
are pretty unambiguously smoking, hypertension, and hyperbeta lipoproteinemia, which is just a

675
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:24,560
really fancy word for saying too many lipoproteins that have apob on them. So that's LDL, IDL,

676
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:31,760
VLDL, LpA. By measuring apob, why I'm such a fan of measuring apob as opposed to just measuring

677
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:39,680
Lp, LDL particle number or LDL cholesterol number is we have one single number that captures

678
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,600
the total concentration of apob. And while that's pretty well associated with non-HDL cholesterol,

679
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,640
which is a far better surrogate than LDL cholesterol, it's still better. And that's

680
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,600
been demonstrated. And I think we even covered that in a previous podcast, where we went over

681
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,280
the discordance between non-HDL cholesterol and apob. So now the question becomes, well,

682
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
when should you start apob reduction and how much should you lower it? And I'll tell you,

683
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,720
I used to take a point of view that if a 40-year-old had an elevated apob,

684
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:21,120
let's just put some numbers to this, right? So the 20th percentile of apob is about 80 milligrams

685
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,160
per deciliter. I used to say that, let's say somebody was at the 50th percentile,

686
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:32,000
they're 40 years old, their calcium score is zero, and they were ambivalent about lipid lowering

687
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,400
therapy. And let's assume that they're not insulin resistant, and you've done all of the things that

688
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:42,160
you can do reasonably with nutrition. I wouldn't push that hard. I've now taken a very different

689
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,800
stand, which is I've basically taken the stand with others that I've taken with myself, which is,

690
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:55,760
the evidence is overwhelming that infantile levels of apob are not deleterious in any way.

691
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:01,120
Meaning an apob of 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter, which is the level that children

692
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,480
would have, poses not only no risk to children as evidenced by the fact that, I mean, that

693
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:13,520
doesn't require an explanation, but as evidenced by what we see in the literature on adults with

694
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,800
levels that have been pharmacologically reduced, tells me that we need to be lower. And the amount

695
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,840
of time it takes to see a benefit tells me we don't want to wait until there's an issue. In other

696
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:30,880
words, if the reason we begin therapy is because somebody has a positive calcium score, which again,

697
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,920
we covered this in great detail. So for people listening, we have a dedicated ASCVD AMA, which

698
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,400
goes into heavy detail for about 90 minutes on all this stuff where if this is of interest.

699
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,560
That's a great AMA that goes super deep on basically all of the reasons why I think my

700
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,920
point of view now is treat early and treat aggressively. And I will now also make a very

701
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,400
bold statement. Again, let's start with the thought experiment, right? If the thought experiment

702
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,600
for colon cancer was do a colonoscopy every day on a person's life, starting at the age of

703
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,040
30, would you eliminate colon cancer deaths? I think the answer is yes. And similarly, I would

704
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:22,080
say pharmacologically lower APO B to somewhere in the 20 to 30 milligram per deciliter range

705
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:28,720
for everybody in the population. While someone is in their 20s, can you eliminate ASCVD? And I think

706
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,920
the answer is probably yes. In other words, I think what you're basically going to do is

707
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:41,520
eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes. And that would need to be started in 20s? I think so,

708
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,560
yeah. Very early on. Yeah. So again, how do you take that thought experiment and turn it into

709
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,320
a practical implication? Because I don't think it's practical to take every 20 year old and

710
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:58,720
obliterate their APO B. Although it's clearly something we do in the subset of patients who

711
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:05,120
have significant genetic abnormalities, such as the cluster of genetic abnormalities that

712
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,840
coalesce around a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, we certainly do medicate

713
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:15,840
those patients usually as teenagers. So this is not some completely crazy idea. But I think

714
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,280
practically what it means is basically by the time you're in your late 30s or early 40s, if you have

715
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,480
any measure of APO B that's even north of the 20th percentile, that should be completely lowered.

716
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:35,200
So in some ways I would view an APO B ceiling of 60 as the limit. And that's probably at about

717
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,880
the fifth percentile. You'd sort of want everybody to be below the fifth percentile.

718
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,840
We hope you enjoyed this special episode of The Drive. This is one of the most talked about

719
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,040
topics, not only on previous podcasts, but also one that we write about frequently in our newsletter.

720
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,200
If you want to dive deeper, there's no shortage of content and we'll link to it all in the show

721
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,360
notes. However, we hope this provided you with a little more understanding of ASCVD, cholesterol,

722
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,920
and APO B. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in

723
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,720
diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to

724
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,080
bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

725
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,280
members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits

726
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,960
include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every

727
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,240
topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show

728
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:39,840
notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

729
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,680
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

730
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,200
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every

731
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,440
Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

732
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,720
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

733
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:06,240
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

734
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,880
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

735
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,520
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits,
