00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,240
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr. Vamsee Mutta. Vamsee is

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,320
a professor of systems biology at the Harvard Medical School. He has an appointment at the

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,600
Broad Institute, which is actually where we met to conduct this interview. And we talk a little bit

48
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,040
about what makes the Broad so special. He specializes in rare mitochondrial diseases,

49
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,240
as opposed to longevity per se, something that I love to talk about. But I think you'll see in the

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
interview why it's so interesting to talk to someone who specializes in rare orphan mitochondrial

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,480
diseases about longevity. His laboratory uses a blend of genomics, computational biology,

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,160
biochemical physiology, and systems biology to study mitochondrial function and dysfunction.

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,040
He received his bachelor's in mathematics and computer science at Stanford before going on

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,240
to Harvard as part of the joint MIT Harvard program in medical school. He stayed in Boston to

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,680
do his training in internal medicine, though as we discuss, he now focuses exclusively on research.

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,880
He's received more honors and awards than I could name here, but it's always worth mentioning it

57
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,880
when someone is a genius award recipient. So he won the MacArthur Foundation Award in 2004,

58
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,720
which obviously puts him in pretty rarefied earth. In this episode, we talk about a lot of things. We

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,800
start with, at least for me, one of the best discussions I've ever had on the mitochondria.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,200
And you might think at first that some of this recapitulates things that were discussed on

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,560
previous podcasts. You may recall we had a great discussion on the mitochondria with

62
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Navdeep Chandel, but we go a little bit deeper and we talk more about some of the evolutionary

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,320
pressure around the mitochondria. And even though at first you might think, well, gosh, this seems

64
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,400
awfully scientific. Where is the application? If you stick with it, you're going to see where it

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:59,000
comes and how understanding these rare orphan diseases that most of us have never heard of

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,080
can give us an insight into aging. We do eventually start to talk about metformin,

67
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,280
which I know many people ask about. And he provides a great insight into, or several great insights

68
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,800
into what metformin may or may not be doing. And again, for at least for me, this was like just

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,120
the master's class in mitochondrial biogenesis, electron transport chain, et cetera. Talk about

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,680
ways that we can target mitochondrial proteins and complexes to treat disease. But perhaps the single

71
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,640
most insightful and interesting thing that we talked about that completely blew my mind

72
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,720
was the role of hypoxia as a treatment. I want to repeat that again. The role of hypoxia,

73
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,160
oxygen deprivation as treatment. Now we're going to cover this in a way that I think is very

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,440
interesting. So I don't want to say any more about it, but I do want to add a disclaimer to this that

75
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,360
Vemsey and I spoke about after the podcast and I want to make sure it's here. So Vemsey emphasizes

76
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,320
that their published research to date on the beneficial effects of hypoxia in animal models

77
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,440
of mitochondrial disease is still in its early stages and it's restricted to animal studies.

78
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,200
It is not yet ready to be applied to humans. To extend these ideas to humans would be premature

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,640
and irresponsible since hypoxia can have life threatening implications. If and when the concept

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,360
is extended into humans, it will need to be done so in a clinical trial setting with the appropriate

81
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,880
ethical, regulatory and safety measures in place. So with that caveat and without further delay,

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,080
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Vemsey Mukher.

83
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,840
Vemsey, thank you so much for making time today.

84
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,280
You're absolutely welcome.

85
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah, yeah. Sight unseen too. I'm always impressed when people I don't know in advance agree to sit

86
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,280
down with me. I'm kind of honored humbled. So thank you very much.

87
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,600
Thank you for coming and meeting.

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Yeah, the Broad is quite an impressive place. Tell folks a little bit about where we are right now

89
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,640
and what makes this unique even within the hallowed halls of Boston Biomedical Research Institutes.

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,880
No, I think it's a really exciting place and I've had the pleasure of actually watching it

91
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,640
blossom from nothing. It's really the brainchild of somebody named Eric Lander who was one of the

92
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,320
leaders of the Human Genome Sequencing Project. And as that was being completed in draft form in

93
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,160
2001 and then in quote finished form in 2003, he saw the need to create some sort of an entity

94
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:33,240
that would take advantage of the power of genomics for improving biomedicine. So he created this

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,640
institute and it's unprecedented in a lot of ways. It's joint between Harvard and MIT. It involves

96
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,400
all of the hospitals here in Boston. And it's basically a incredible forum where people can

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,440
get together and basically pursue projects that they can't pursue on their own in their own

98
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,920
individual laboratories. There's a big computational theme here. There's a big theme on being systematic

99
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,040
in one's approach, not focused narrowly on the protein that they've studied in the past,

100
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,440
but being systematic and seeing where the data takes you. And there's a very pervasive theme

101
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,800
of collaboration as well. So Eric has always said that the Broad Institute is a bit of an experiment,

102
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,480
but now it's been about 15, 16 years. And I think without a doubt, it's been a wildly successful

103
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,120
experiment. Do most of you here at the Broad have an appointment elsewhere? Like I know you spend

104
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,520
much of your time at Mass General. Lots of people here spend, you know, they have an appointment at

105
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,640
MIT. Does everybody have another appointment outside of the Broad? Almost. So there's almost

106
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,200
two types of people that work at the Broad. There's some people that are actually formally employed by

107
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,560
the Broad Institute and there's others like myself that are employed elsewhere. In my case,

108
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,640
I work at Mass General Hospital and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. That's my primary

109
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,040
appointment. My paycheck comes from there. But then I spend a day a week over here working on

110
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,080
collaborative types of projects that I can't pursue easily in my own lab. So there's almost two types

111
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,960
of folks over here. I think one of the neat things about the Broad Institute is, you know, traditionally

112
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,640
there's this grad student postdoc assistant professor academic track, but how about for all

113
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,680
the other people that want to do research in a nonprofit academic setting but aren't interested

114
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,760
in applying for R01 grants or teaching? The Broad actually has an entire research scientist track as

115
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,560
well. And so you can be employed here as a research scientist doing science. And funded here. And funded

116
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,920
here. And I think that's a very, very different organizational model compared to any other academic

117
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,160
organization. Let's back up for a moment. You studied at Stanford where you did, were you a computer

118
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,040
science major? What was your major in undergrad? I was math and computer science. Okay, got it. Did you

119
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,480
know you wanted to get into biology and medicine? You know, when I was a kid, I'm an Indian American.

120
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,040
My father is a retired surgeon. As it turns out, my three older siblings would end up becoming

121
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,280
doctors also. So I like to joke that we had the medicine gene in our family. So growing up, I was

122
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,080
convinced I wanted to be a doctor of some sort. But then in high school, I fell in love with math.

123
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,000
I did the high school math competitions. I was pretty good at those. Did the high school

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,680
science fair competitions in math. Did well with those. And so I ended up going to Stanford with

125
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,440
the goal of being a math and computer science major. And that's what I was squarely focused on.

126
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,400
And then towards the end of college, when I was looking for a research project, my advisor told me

127
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,120
about the work of Sam Carlin. He's a statistician that was developing some of the underlying

128
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,040
methods for bimolecular sequence analysis. He's a fundamental

129
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,800
mathematician. And this is like early 90s. Early 90s. That's right. That's right. So I ended up

130
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,400
working on DNA sequence analysis as a college student writing code to try to analyze DNA and

131
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,040
protein sequences. And I fell in love with that. And then my advisor said, why don't you contemplate

132
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,880
a future career in medicine if for no other reason. Gung-de Medical School is a great way

133
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,760
of learning physiology. You know, I thought about it from a practical perspective. I applied

134
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,000
simultaneously to PhD programs in mathematical biology and also applied to MD-PhD programs.

135
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,880
And then I applied to this program joint between Harvard and MIT. I actually thought that it was

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,960
an MD-PhD program. This is all pre-internet. So I thought it was an MD-PhD program, but it wasn't.

137
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,440
It was a straight MD program, but it's a joint program between the two institutions.

138
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Yeah. They would set aside like a, I remember like 20 students for this. What was it called?

139
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,680
The H-HST. HST program. That's exactly right. That's right. So it's a part

140
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,360
of the HST program and it was kind of catered to students that had slightly quantitative

141
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,400
backgrounds, math, computer science types of backgrounds. It provided a bit of a more gentle

142
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,360
introduction to medical school. I could have used that program. My first year of medical school was

143
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,240
just unbearable. I mean, it was such a culture shock of that. I don't know if I told the story

144
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,680
on the podcast before. The worst exam I've ever done in my life from the point when I decided

145
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:04,040
to care about school was the first semester histology exam in medical school because I very

146
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,960
arrogantly and naively assumed that if I understood the concepts of histology, I didn't need to

147
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:18,120
memorize anything. So I took this very pure math approach, which was I could just derive everything

148
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,600
in my mind if I understood the fundamentals. And that got me a 53% on a final exam in histology.

149
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,120
Like I just sat there looking at this number thinking, how is this possible? Am I the stupidest

150
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,000
human being that has ever walked the face of it? It was really a wake up call that said, you know,

151
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,080
you're going to actually just have to start memorizing things around here.

152
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,960
It's a big culture shock. I think when I know you have a background in engineering and applied math,

153
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,240
so very similar to my background. And it made for a lot of unhappiness for me also that first semester

154
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,920
of medical school, at least you were in California. I was facing the Boston winter at the same time I

155
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,800
was facing histology. That's a good point. I did have that going for me. So when you finished med

156
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,760
school, you did a residency in internal medicine. You stayed in Boston, correct? That's right. That's

157
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,200
right. That's right. I've been here now for, it's hard to believe, but about 25 years during

158
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,960
residency, the Brigham is obviously certainly among the top three most academic medicine programs in

159
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,360
the country. I was talking to one of your colleagues yesterday and he made the point that

160
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,520
when he looked at sort of his class or the cohort of people that entered medicine at the Brigham,

161
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,160
you just fast forward 20 years and they're basically the leaders within each of the different

162
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,600
scientific fields. So I assume that was a pretty deliberate decision on your part to

163
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,360
really preserve sort of academic optionality. You know what? I think at almost every single one of

164
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,960
these junctures, exactly from college to medical school, medical school to residency, I think maybe

165
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,360
I'm just inherently a bit of an indecisive person, but I was unsure as to whether or not I wanted to

166
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,520
do a residency. By then I'd fallen in love with basic research. And the question was, was I going

167
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,440
to do a basic science postdoc or was I going to do a residency? And so just as I did at the previous

168
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,000
node, I decided to just apply for both. So I simultaneously applied for postdoc positions

169
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,240
and for residency programs. That was the era when you would fill out your residency match

170
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,880
list with the number two pencil. So I'd fill it out every day. A decent type on a Rogan number two

171
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,960
pencil. I love those things. So I'd fill it out and then I'd rip it up the next day. I'd fill it

172
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,440
out and rip it up the next day. And I joke that the only reason I did a residency is because the

173
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:44,360
due date was an even number. So that said, I want to put you on the spot and ask you a question that

174
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,040
I get asked all the time. And frankly, I don't know the answer to it. And I feel bad that I always

175
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,760
provide sort of nebulous answers, but I do get asked a lot by either college students who are

176
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,800
contemplating medicine or not, or medical students who are interested in research. And the question

177
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,520
is a variant of one, if you're at the college node, but you're very interested in medical research,

178
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,560
is there benefit to doing an MD? And then the second order question is, if you're in medical

179
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,040
school and you're going to finish and you know you want to do research, is there a benefit to

180
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,560
doing a residency? Now, I generally tell people, and if you disagree with me, I hope you say so

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,200
very loudly. I generally say if you're in college, but undecided about medical school or not,

182
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I would say don't do it. Pursue the PhD. If you are in medical school and presumably at least

183
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,840
somewhat interested in medicine still, do an internal medicine residency because there is

184
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,440
no substitute for doing that type of research and at least having the ability to understand

185
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,480
clinically why you're doing it. So again, do you disagree with that? And if so, how would you,

186
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,200
or how would you modify that? I also get asked this question quite a bit because I think there's

187
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,280
a group of people out there that love science are probably good at clinical medicine if they do it,

188
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,520
but they're also good at research if they do it. And maybe they're inherently a little bit

189
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,200
risk averse as well. So they're always trying to figure out what's the best path for me.

190
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,960
The advice that I had gotten when I was in college was that the reason to go to medical school,

191
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,680
if you're interested in research, is that it's one of the best curricula for understanding

192
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,640
physiology. How do all of the parts come together and operate? And trying to understand how an

193
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,360
entire living system operates, if you don't go through all of medical school, if you don't

194
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,520
learn anatomy, if you don't learn histology, if you don't learn cardiovascular physiology,

195
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,200
it's a bit tough. It's a good point you make, right? Which is in somewhere between 16 and 24

196
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,840
months, which is the preclinical part of medical school, it's almost impossible to get a more well

197
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,400
curated view of the human body because it's been optimized for that over 100 years.

198
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,440
That's exactly right.

199
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,680
More.

200
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,200
And it's a living system, right? I mean, you could study yeast, you could study Drosophila,

201
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,400
but the human is extraordinarily well investigated. And you're right, in about two years or so,

202
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,880
you have a very intense curriculum studying one living system, different aspects of it.

203
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,440
So from that perspective, I think it's a great education. It's a broad education

204
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,600
for biomedical research. At the other node, again, I spent a lot of time thinking about this. And

205
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,440
one of my advisors actually said, at least do an internship because then you'll be licensed. You

206
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,120
can prescribe medicines at that point. And there is something special about caring for patients.

207
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,760
There's something very special about going through the process of residency with your colleagues.

208
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,520
And again, you really get to see the human living system at some of its extremes. So I think it's a

209
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,680
great way of continuing to learn physiology and pharmacology as well. So I'm super grateful for

210
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,160
the path, of course, and of one experiment, but I'm really happy that I did medical school and

211
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm also super happy I did the clinical training as well because it completely shaped my research

212
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
focus as well.

213
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,280
Okay. No, that makes sense. I generally say the same thing, which is, I don't regret the path I

214
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
took, though I'm glad I didn't know in advance what it was going to look like because it would

215
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:20,360
have seemed too indirect, but nevertheless. So right now you spend virtually all of your time

216
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,720
doing research. Is that correct?

217
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,200
That's right.

218
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,040
When did you stop seeing patients?

219
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,240
It's been about five to six years or so.

220
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,280
Was that a tough decision?

221
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,760
It was tough because we went through this entire medical school and residency process with the

222
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,480
goal of actually seeing patients and caring for them. The truth is the number of patients I was

223
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,680
seeing was asymptoting as a function of time. Emotionally, it was very, very difficult to go to

224
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,960
zero. So even though I was seeing probably one patient a month or so, five years ago or so,

225
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,960
going to zero was actually the harder part. But at some point I had to just do the math and say

226
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,960
there's only a certain number of hours per day. I'm running a pretty big research group that's

227
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,000
focused on mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders. And the long-term goal is to impact

228
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,720
these patients. And so I'm going to let other people be the ones that care for these patients

229
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,560
at the front line. And I'm going to try to develop new diagnostics and drugs for these patients.

230
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,720
So let's start talking about the mitochondria. When did you come to the realization that that

231
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,800
was the area you wanted to focus on? And what is it about the mitochondria that especially drew you

232
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,360
in?

233
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,040
So as a first year medical student, I was a little bit unhappy here in Boston. It was cold.

234
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,240
There's a lot of memorization that first year, that first semester in particular. I wasn't sure

235
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,600
if I'd actually made the right decision in coming to medical school from a math background. And then

236
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,120
right in the middle of that first semester when we were taking our histology and pathology class,

237
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,000
we had a very, very brief lecture on myopathies, muscle diseases. And there's one slide that

238
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,560
basically indicated that there's a rare form of myopathies that are due to mutations in the

239
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,560
mitochondrial DNA. Now, truth be told, I don't think I'd appreciate it at that time that we had

240
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,720
our own mitochondria with their own genomes. And so that immediately fascinated me. You dig a little

241
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,520
bit deeper, you learn that these were once bacteria, they're kind of swimming around in our cell. So

242
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,960
that's kind of cool. You see an image of mitochondria in the muscle. It's just beautiful. And there's

243
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,240
just something that really captivated me. And I kind of got hooked on that organelle that first

244
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,000
semester of medical school. And I've told this story to other people, Peter, but what happened

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,320
was a few weeks later, my dad's cousin, who is at that time, a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard

246
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,520
Research, one of the research hospitals, she heard that I was unhappy. So she invited me over to her

247
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,280
house in Somerville for a Friday night dinner. So it started to snow. I took the red line all the way

248
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,560
to Somerville. It was a 20 minute walk to her house. By the time I had gotten in, my shoes were

249
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,520
soaked. I was freezing. She immediately looked at me and said, Oh my God, you look terrible. And so

250
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,520
she took my coat off. She tried to dry me up and she started cooking dinner. And then her boyfriend

251
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,160
appeared like an hour later. And now it's about eight o'clock or nine o'clock or so we had dinner

252
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,400
together. And then we found out that the tea had been shut down. And so not only was I an unhappy

253
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,600
first year medical student, but now I'm spending Friday night with my dad's cousin and her

254
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,440
boyfriend in Somerville. And so they create a makeshift bed for me in their living room. I'm

255
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,120
spending the night there at this point. And I look at the bookshelf and there's a textbook of

256
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,920
mitochondrial biology on the bookshelf. So just a few weeks earlier, I had this initial encounter

257
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,400
with the organelle. I saw this book, so I just took it off the shelf and I just started reading it.

258
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,280
I read about 100 pages that first night. I borrowed it and then I basically devoured that book over

259
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,240
the course of the next few weeks. And I just fell in love with the organelle at that point and

260
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,440
thought to myself that this is what I want to work on for the rest of my career.

261
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,440
That's an amazing story. And I think for people listening, they shouldn't be concerned that they

262
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,640
haven't had that eureka moment. I mean, I've heard a lot of amazing scientists talk about their

263
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,640
passion and not all of them, in fact, most of them don't have such a laser moment like that. Now,

264
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,720
of course, the stories of people that have those moments are even more vivid in my mind of that,

265
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,440
oh my God, I can't think of anything but this. So let's talk a little bit about the mitochondria.

266
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,960
You've already alluded to some of the really interesting features about it. So let's start

267
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,400
with the, well, gosh, which one's the most interesting? Let's just start with the lineage,

268
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,640
right? So how did these bacteria find their way into these eukaryotic cells?

269
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Yeah, this is, I think, one of the most fascinating aspects of the organelle. So this is a process

270
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,200
known as endosympiosis. So the current theory is that there is an organism probably resembling

271
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,880
a modern day gram-negative rod, something like a rickettsial species that merges.

272
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,280
Folks might not even know what that means. So gram-negative is just a staining that allows us

273
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,360
to identify a type of bacteria. So you've got this bacteria that is shaped like a rod, literally.

274
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,600
And how does it get its energy prior to this encounter? The thinking is that it had a full

275
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,200
electron transport chain and was probably capable of doing aerobic metabolism using things like

276
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,280
oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. And one of the theories proposes that that had

277
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,920
an electron transport chain that's not that different than modern-day mitochondria.

278
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:39,240
The hypothesis is that that somehow merged with something resembling modern-day archaea.

279
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,400
So there's three main domains of life. You have archaea, you have bacteria, and then you have

280
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:52,040
eukaryotes. And eukaryotes have nuclei. So the hypothesis is that there's an archaeal species,

281
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,080
there's a bacterial species, they form a union of some sort. And this is what gave rise to modern-day

282
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,920
eukaryotic cells maybe about one and a half billion years ago.

283
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,920
That's kind of remarkable. And is the idea, I mean, what kind of evolutionary pressure must have been

284
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,400
placed to create an entirely new species? It's also binary. It seems somewhat binary to me,

285
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,800
is it? In other words, when you look at the difference between, I don't know, say a chimpanzee

286
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:28,520
and an ape or an ape and a human, you can see lots of continuous evolution, you know, Neanderthal,

287
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,720
et cetera, et cetera. What you're describing sounds much more switched on, switched off. Is that the

288
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,880
case? Or were there lots of iterations that we can't even appreciate today in between the union

289
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,920
and the current paradigm? As far as we know, endosymbiosis of the mitochondrion only took place

290
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:56,120
once. Wow. So there are lots of eukaryotes, almost, not all, but almost all eukaryotes

291
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,840
have a mitochondrion. And if you look at the DNA of those mitochondria that still have a genome,

292
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,000
the phylogenetic analysis tells us that this was a monophyletic event. This took place only once.

293
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,160
Now that's not true for something like the chloroplast. That also arose through serial

294
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,240
endosymbiosis. And that likely took place at least two independent times in evolution. But for the

295
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,440
mitochondrion, it probably only took place once as far as we know. And the chloroplast, of course,

296
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,200
is to a plant effectively what the mitochondria is to an animal like us. That's exactly right.

297
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,240
So how many genes do we think that that gram-negative rod had?

298
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,840
Great question. Probably about a thousand to two thousand. And at the time, the species that it

299
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,440
merged with would have had how many for the best of our guessing? Probably also a few thousand.

300
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,920
So you had two things that had comparable numbers of genes merge, and yet today you or I would have

301
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:07,720
30,000, 20,000 genes inside the nucleus. And we'd have, is it 13 genes inside our mitochondria? 13

302
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,040
preserved genes. So in other words, to a first order approximation, the mitochondria lost all

303
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:21,080
of its genes. But a deeper dig says actually it somehow hung on to 13. Why do you think that was?

304
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,960
This is what we call reductive evolution. Modern day mitochondria actually represent a mosaic.

305
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,640
So you need about a thousand proteins total to make our mitochondria. And so some of those

306
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,600
are attributable to the original bacterial ancestor, and others are brand new innovations

307
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,840
that even that original bacteria did not have. But on the reductive side, approximately a thousand

308
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,320
genes from that original bacteria have either been lost altogether or have been transferred to the

309
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,800
nuclear genome so that that genome today is tiny. It's only about 16,000 bases, and it encodes 13

310
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,640
proteins. But that's only if you're looking at animals. There's a lot of different eukaryotes,

311
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,680
so there's a lot of mitochondrial diversity. So you and I still retain 13 proteins that are encoded

312
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,120
by our mitochondrial genomes. But if you look at malaria, it's also eukaryote. It has a

313
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,120
mitochondrion, but its genome only encodes three proteins today. So that's additional reductive

314
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,520
evolution. What about things like flies, yeast, are they also variable? Flies are also animals,

315
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,800
and so most animals you would put them in the category. Yeah, that's right. So they would have

316
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:41,000
about 13, sometimes 14 proteins. But if you look at something like Giardia, which causes a terrible

317
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,240
diarrheal illness, beaver fever, that's a eukaryote. It's actually lost its mitochondrial DNA

318
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,040
altogether. I know we talked about 13 proteins. Is it one-to-one mapping, or are there genes that

319
00:28:52,040 --> 00:29:01,240
are non-coding? Right, so the mitochondria genome encodes two riposomal RNAs, 22 tRNAs, and then 13

320
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,160
proteins. So obviously to have 13, we pretty much have a good sense of what the function of each of

321
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:14,120
these are. How many diseases that afflict humans result from genetic disorders there? Inherited

322
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:22,440
mutations that produce dysfunctional proteins. Right, there's about 250 different syndromes of

323
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,280
the mtDNA of the mitochondrial DNA. And by syndrome, I mean there's a particular mutation that's

324
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,520
associated with a particular clinical phenotype. But that's only if we're talking about the

325
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:41,400
mitochondrial disorders of the mtDNA. That's right. Is that a higher or lower frequency on a

326
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,480
probability basis, given the number of base pairs? Because you said something like only, what, 16,000

327
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,600
base pairs? It's relatively tiny. We have genes in our nuclear genome that are 10 times that size.

328
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,960
So from a probability basis that you could have 250 mutations in that 16,000 base pair

329
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,320
that would each lead to these distinct mitochondrial diseases. Is that more or

330
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,280
less robust from a DNA perspective than our nuclear DNA? I don't think we have a good

331
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:15,880
answer to that question. There's a little bit of an ascertainment bias in clinical medicine.

332
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,480
So when I was going through residency, probably when you're also going through your clinical

333
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,520
training, the answer to almost every single question about mitochondrial disease was maternal

334
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:33,960
inheritance. And that's because the nuclear genome was sequenced in draft format in 2001,

335
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,960
but the mitochondrial DNA was sequenced in 1981. So that was almost exactly 20 years earlier. And

336
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,600
it's small. And so as soon as you saw patients that had a particular clinical phenotype that

337
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,280
could be a mitochondrial disease, it was easy to sequence the mitochondrial DNA. So beginning in

338
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,720
1988, when two papers were published reporting the first mutations in the mitochondrial DNA,

339
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,800
it's been relatively straightforward to sequence it and associate mutations of mtDNA with the

340
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:10,200
disease phenotype. And this is why now there's about 250 of these mtDNA mutation clinical

341
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:18,360
phenotype mappings. The nuclear genome has been a little bit slower to follow since 2001. In

342
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,560
beginning even a little bit before the completion of the genome sequence, we've now as a community

343
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,960
been able to identify about 300 different genes in the nuclear genome that underlie mitochondrial

344
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,960
disorders. And of course, that's 300 different genes, but then there's different

345
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,920
allelic variants as well. So I think it's going to be a little while before we can

346
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,240
answer your question in a satisfactory way, but it's a really provocative question.

347
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,120
And one more number to sort of extract from that is, do we have a sense of how many genes in the

348
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,840
nuclear genome are required for mitochondrial function? So in other words, what's the denominator

349
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,360
nuclear wise?

350
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,800
That's actually one of the areas that we focused on heavily in our laboratory.

351
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,800
So beginning soon after the sequencing of the human genome, we knew that the human genome

352
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,960
encodes about 22,000 proteins. It's an important question is, which of those find their way to the

353
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,200
mitochondria? It's going to be more than 13. These are elaborate organelles. So we used a lot of

354
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,720
methods in the early 2000s, things like proteomics, GFP tagging, microscopy, computation. And we're

355
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,640
able to identify about 1100 proteins that are made by the nuclear genome that find their way into

356
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:38,360
the mitochondria. So those 1100 proteins have to work with those 13 proteins in space and time

357
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,040
to do all the amazing things that the organelle does.

358
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:49,800
How do they communicate? Do we know how expression of MTDNA is coordinated with nuclear DNA?

359
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,600
It's a really, really interesting question. So some of the mechanisms are known,

360
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,480
but a lot of mechanisms are not yet known. So when you exercise, for example,

361
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,360
if you're deconditioned, and if you do a combination of aerobic training and strength

362
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,280
training, you can actually increase the number of mitochondria. And there's an entire transcriptional

363
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,520
program that will turn on all those nuclear genes. But that same program will also turn on

364
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,880
the replication factors that will go into the organelle and cause the mitochondrial DNA to

365
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,520
replicate as well. So it's a really smart transcriptional program that says in response

366
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,120
to exercise, make more of the nuclear encoded components and make more of the mitochondrial

367
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,160
DNA and make more of the mitochondrial DNA and go to proteins.

368
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,920
So that increases mitochondrial density in a given cell. So you have a myocyte muscle cell.

369
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,360
Do we know what the actual signals are? They basically instruct the cell to make more DNA.

370
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,280
So what is the input from the exercise? You mentioned two types of exercise,

371
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,640
strength training and aerobic activity. Those have very different physiologic properties.

372
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,000
So what is it that at the physiologic level is leading to this nuclear level?

373
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,840
One of the important signals is something called AMP kinase, the change in the ATP to ADP ratio.

374
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,240
That's known to be one of the activators of this particular transcriptional program

375
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,600
that induces mitochondrial biogenesis.

376
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,120
So this would be a decrease in AMP activity?

377
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,560
An increase in AMP kinase.

378
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,600
An increase, okay.

379
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,600
So that is basically sensing something like the ATP to ADP ratio.

380
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,280
Ratio is going down, yeah.

381
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,920
So when we exercise, the ATP levels are usually pretty nicely defended.

382
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,840
But then what's happening is there's another reaction that's taking two ADP molecules,

383
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:46,200
making an ATP-liberating AMP, while ATP levels are defended, some of these ratios change,

384
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,560
and that can be sensed.

385
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,880
And that's one of the inputs into this program that says, let's make more mitochondria.

386
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,440
Now we'll come back to this far down the line, but just because you mentioned it,

387
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,640
one of the effects of a drug called metformin that everybody loves to ask about is it activates AMPK.

388
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,480
Does that imply that metformin administration by itself alters mitochondrial density?

389
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,800
So I think when we talk about exercise, I think AMP activation is generally regarded

390
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,840
as one of the important signals for mitochondrial biogenesis, but I don't think it is sufficient.

391
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,080
It's not sufficient. It's necessary though, potentially.

392
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,520
I think it is, but I would need to review some of the older literature to really confirm that.

393
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,680
So what do you think some of the other signals are?

394
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,320
I think some of the other signals are things like calcium, and clearly there's other signals.

395
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,840
There's a couple of disease states as well, where we see a massive proliferation of mitochondria.

396
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,280
They're not functioning properly, but there's a massive proliferation of malfunctioning

397
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,400
mitochondria. So we're trying to work at some of those signals as well.

398
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,520
So as of right now, it's a bit of an open question as to exactly how the number of

399
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,680
mitochondria is sensed and regulated, but we know some of the inputs.

400
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,480
Right. We know crudely what the inputs are, right? Exercise, as you mentioned,

401
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,040
what are some of the other things that even hormonally, for example, did nutrients play a role?

402
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,920
One of the studies that I was a part of about 10 to 15 years ago or so,

403
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,320
show that even things like androgens and testosterone can actually influence the

404
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:24,120
amount of mitochondria. Disuse is a great way of rapidly eliminating mitochondria.

405
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,800
And then in terms of nutrients, NED is an important signal as well. This transcriptional

406
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,840
regulator that I'm talking about, it's called PGC1 alpha, and upstream of it is something called

407
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,960
CERT1, which of course utilizes NED as a cofactor. So there's a couple of these inputs.

408
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,640
I'm having lunch with David Sinclair later today, so we'll be talking plenty about this.

409
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,080
Absolutely. Absolutely. So I think a couple of these

410
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,000
signals are beginning to emerge. We're not at that stage right now where in a pill we can put

411
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
seven of these things, give it to a patient, and boom, we can replace exercise. We're not there yet,

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,080
but it'd be remarkable if we understood the process well enough so that we could one day.

413
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,320
Yeah, there's been lots of claims of exercise in a pill. I remember the New York Times wrote about

414
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,600
something called iris, and God, they wrote about it in 2011, 2012, and then I saw it again recently.

415
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,400
It's funny, of course, you see these stories which you realize they're being written about in such a

416
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,840
crude way that you can infer nothing. So you go back and look at the paper and you realize

417
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,200
it's kind of a ridiculous claim at this point. What is the turnover of mitochondria in a cell?

418
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,640
So if you have, let's put some scale to things for folks. So I'm going to take, I'm going to biopsy one

419
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,120
cell from your quadricep, one muscle cell. How many mitochondria approximately would be in it,

420
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
assuming you're a relatively well-conditioned individual?

421
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,680
Talking about the number of mitochondria is a little bit ambiguous because they're not

422
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,000
quantal units. Mitochondria will constantly undergo fusion and fission. So at any given

423
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,240
state, you can have a different, quote, number of mitochondria. The mitochondrial DNA is a

424
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,440
quantal unit. So you can ask how many mitochondrial genomes are there per nuclear genome in a cell

425
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,360
type. Okay. So a fibroblast will have a few hundred, maybe a thousand copies of the mitochondrial

426
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,480
genome for each of its nuclear genome. That's right. But there's a lot of variation. The

427
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,080
highest would be what, like a cardiac myocyte or something or a neuron? The unfertilized egg.

428
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,760
Wow. It has half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA. See, I wouldn't have guessed that. I don't

429
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,360
know why. I could have come up with 10 guesses and that would not have been one of them.

430
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,160
It's remarkable. And dad's sperm probably has a few hundred at best.

431
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,480
And I would have guessed the sperm needed more because it's doing the motion, right? It has to

432
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,880
fight to get to the egg. Part of the reason is that the egg is so big relative to the size of

433
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,440
the sperm. So that's to a first order approximation, the explanatory variable. But the unfertilized egg

434
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,040
is sort of the Olympic gold champion when it comes to MTD molecules. It's the Michael Phelps of MTD.

435
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,160
That's right. And then red blood cells, of course, have no mitochondrial DNA.

436
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,920
Then what's the turnover look like, right? So if you have a cardiac myocyte

437
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,360
that presumably lasts for a long time, you're in an individual, like these cells are not turning

438
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:30,280
over quickly. Are they turning over new mitochondria constantly? How often is that mitochondrial DNA

439
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:37,000
churning over? I guess what I'm trying to get at is what's like the half-life of these sort of

440
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,400
non-discrete mitochondria. I think in most non-dividing tissues, the half-life is on the order

441
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,800
of a few days. Wow. So we are cranking out mitochondria. That's right. That's right.

442
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,520
There's differences between dividing cells versus non-dividing cells. When you have a dividing cell,

443
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,560
obviously, as a function of the eukaryotic cell cycle, you need to double the number of mitochondria.

444
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,960
And then you partition that into two. Then you double partition. So dividing cells have very

445
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,880
different mitochondrial turnover dynamics than non-dividing tissues like muscular neurons.

446
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,280
There's like a hundred other questions I want to ask, but I also don't want to get us back to the

447
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,160
beginning so that we can set the framework to ask some of these other questions. So you alluded to

448
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,680
something, right, which was, I believe, something that at least for me until very recently,

449
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,640
I didn't think was challenged or questioned, which was the origin of said mitochondria being maternal.

450
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,120
So presumably in the early 80s when we first, we, like I had anything to do with it,

451
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,480
when people far smarter than me sequenced mitochondrial DNA, given how few the number

452
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,400
of genes were, it was not difficult to realize, hey, this all seems to come from the maternal

453
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:05,160
side, not the paternal side. And as recently as several years ago, that was considered almost

454
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,200
an axiom. All the DNA in your mitochondria comes from your mother, not your father.

455
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,640
Has that been called into question lately? Have there been exceptions to that?

456
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,160
I think the textbook teaching is that the mitochondrial DNA is transmitted exclusively

457
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,160
maternally. And the reason for that is related to...

458
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,680
This comes back to the egg, I'm sure, right?

459
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,320
It gets back to the sexual dimorphism. The egg is huge. It has half a million copies of MTDNA.

460
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,960
That sperm is tiny. It only has a few hundred copies of MTDNA. So by sheer dilution,

461
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,080
it's very difficult for dad's MTDNA to get transmitted, right? It's outnumbered half a

462
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,960
million to a hundred. But on top of that, there's actually active mechanisms that will seek and

463
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,440
destroy dad's mitochondria. So the mitochondria coming from the sperm are coated with a protein

464
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,480
called ubiquitin. So after fertilization, those mitochondria are actually actively eliminated

465
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,920
by a surveillance program. So not only is it very difficult for dad's MTDNA to compete with a huge

466
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,520
number of MTDNA molecules from mom, but those that do make it inside are actively destroyed as well.

467
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:20,680
So mechanistically, these are the two reasons why MTDNA is passed on almost exclusively from

468
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,840
mom to child. Now with that said, about 15 years ago or so, there's a case report in the New

469
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:35,240
England Journal of Medicine that took a biopsy of a particular individual and they saw MTDNA molecules

470
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,520
with two different haplotypes. And then they looked at the haplotype of the father and they

471
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,720
concluded that this was a rare case of paternal transmission. So that paper from about 15 years

472
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,600
ago was sort of the lone exception to this rule that we accept as an axiom. And then about a year

473
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,320
ago or so in 2018, another paper emerged, again claiming that in a few families there is paternal

474
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:08,520
transmission of MTDNA. It's a rare event, but this is an active area of research. Rules are made to be

475
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,040
broken. And I think two things. Number one, I think other people will have to try to replicate

476
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,040
these results to make sure that even if they're rare, they're real and not some sort of a technical

477
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,080
artifact. And then number two, if they're not technical artifacts, I think there's an opportunity

478
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,040
to learn something very, very deep about the mechanisms of maternal transmission.

479
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,560
Right, because that would suggest based on the explanation for how this takes place,

480
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,120
it's hard to deny that the first one's going to continue to take place, which is just the stochastic

481
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:48,760
sampling. But you could certainly see scenarios under which the find and kill program malfunctions

482
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,160
and therefore you sneak in a little bit of the paternal DNA. That's right. And in fact,

483
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,240
in one of these papers that was just published in 2018, they speculated that perhaps there's a

484
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:07,240
mutation on the nuclear genome in that program so that it's possible for dad's MTDNA to get transmitted.

485
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,280
Well, that is interesting. But I think to the first order approximation, we can still assume

486
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,640
that mitochondrial DNA is maternal. Yes. So let's talk a little bit about sort of

487
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,120
mitochondria 101. So you're a first year medical student learning about the mitochondria. Here's

488
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,520
basically what you learn, right? You've got this inner membrane, this outer membrane.

489
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,520
I forget what the term is. Do they call it the powerhouse of the cell or something like that?

490
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,440
Yes. I think there's some sort of glib term that I know that people who study mitochondria,

491
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,760
like yourself and have deep Chandel who I've interviewed sort of bristle at the simplicity

492
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:47,000
of such a term. But the idea is all things being equal, a cell takes in glucose, free fatty acid,

493
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,040
substrate for energy. And let's start with the glucose because we'll spend more time talking

494
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,480
about glucose today through what I can't even remember, 10 steps we turn glucose into pyruvate

495
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:04,920
more or less. We then basically have a choice, a cell has a choice based on the availability of

496
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:13,240
oxygen and the rate at which ATP is being demanded. So if oxygen is scarce relative to ATP demand,

497
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,760
you can take a inefficient route, but at least you guarantee to get some ATP, which is you can turn

498
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,600
the pyruvate into lactate. And lactate itself is interesting and maybe we can talk about it,

499
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:31,640
but you generate some ATP. If the demand for ATP is not as great and there's sufficient cellular

500
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:39,000
oxygen, you can take that pyruvate and make acetyl-CoA and that acetyl-CoA then becomes

501
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,160
one of the substrates leading into this thing called the electron transport chain you alluded to.

502
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:50,680
Walk us through what happens in that latter scenario. I like to think of the mitochondria

503
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,680
as being the key place where there's energy transformations. So in order for a cell to work,

504
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,520
it needs energy, but in the same way that in order to live our lives, we need to have one type of

505
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,960
battery for our iPhone, a different type of a battery for our laptop, a different type of a

506
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:15,720
battery for our automobile. We need energy packaged in different ways. So this is sort of the charm of

507
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,360
the mitochondria. What it does is it's going to take fats and carbohydrates and proteins and it's

508
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,840
going to break it up almost like a Kuzunart. And as it's breaking it up, it's going to harness the

509
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:33,080
electrons and that's what's called an electromotive force. That's one type of energy. So you're

510
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,680
probably familiar with things like the NADH to NAD ratio. That's basically an electron carrier.

511
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:45,240
So that's one form of energy. In certain times of enzymes can be powered directly by NADH and

512
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:53,080
NADH. But then that can also be converted to a gradient, a voltage across the inner membrane,

513
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:59,720
a different type of an energy form and that energy form can be used to drive transport.

514
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:05,400
So let's explain what that means to people. So everybody knows what a battery looks like. Like

515
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,080
literally a Duracell battery that you stick into whatever, you know, your kid's toy. And that's

516
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,680
typically about 1.5 volts, right? A 9 volt battery gets its name because it has 9 volts,

517
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,120
but everyone recognizes it as the goofy square one. We take this, I think, for granted because

518
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,840
we sort of have these backgrounds in math or engineering and stuff, but I think for the average

519
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,320
person it's helpful to understand what voltage means and you just alluded to it, right? It's a

520
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:37,720
potential, it's a gradient that is created by disproportionate placement of electrons.

521
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,120
And it's only with that that you can generate power. So why does a battery die? Why is it that,

522
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:52,120
let's pretend I'm still using a Walkman. I put my two 1.5 volt AA batteries in my Walkman.

523
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,960
At some point it stops working. Why? At some point it's not going to be able to hold charge.

524
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,960
And so I'm probably more familiar with the mitochondrial battery than I am with the

525
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,320
Duracell battery. But when you have nicely functioning mitochondria, you can charge them

526
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,520
you can create a nice voltage that can be used for work. You can dissipate it, you can recharge it,

527
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,640
but at some point when it gets older, when the membrane is a little bit leakier, when it can't,

528
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,600
it'll stop holding charge. So it's that ability to keep a difference in charge across the membranes

529
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,280
that is the same reason your little 1.5 volt battery in your Walkman, I love that I'm saying

530
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,280
Walkman by the way, there's half the people listening, this won't actually know what that means.

531
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:42,040
Or the 9 volt battery in your smoke detector, or frankly the fancy, I don't even know how many

532
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,960
volts a Tesla battery is, it's like 12 volts I'm guessing or something like that in an electric

533
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,160
vehicle, whatever. But there's a reason you have to keep charging these, but at some point, even

534
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,320
when you charge them, they cease to work if it's a rechargeable. And you're basically saying, look,

535
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:00,600
think of a mitochondria as partially being a battery. That's right. That's only one form of

536
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,680
energy, right? So that's taking chemical to electric. That's exactly right. And so you can

537
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,440
have an electromotor force, you can have a proton motor force. And then you can dissipate that

538
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,480
battery to basically catalyze a formation of ATP, which most people know is the energy form that's

539
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,560
used to power muscle when you exercise. So the mitochondrion is doing all of these elaborate

540
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:30,040
energy transformations from electrical potentials to proton potentials to phosphorylation potentials,

541
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,880
and different enzymes and processes and machines in your cells will use one or the other.

542
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,320
This is so exciting. Like, I've tried to have this discussion with my daughter who's 10,

543
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:48,440
and she's not quite at the point where she sees why I think this is amazing. But she's almost at

544
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,720
that point where I guess you can look at a piece of food on the plate and explain why eating that

545
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,800
is essential, right? Like, where is the energy in that food? So maybe we'll use this as sort of

546
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:10,440
the example to go full cycle. So you are looking at a cheerio on your plate, right? Now that cheerio

547
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:17,240
is mostly carbohydrate, so we'll simplify this. And it's got glucose in it, it's probably got

548
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:24,840
more complex carbohydrates in it, but at a molecular level, it's a lot of carbons joined to hydrogens,

549
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,160
carbons joined to carbons, and carbons joined to oxygens, and oxygens joined to hydrogens. That's

550
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:37,560
probably most of the bonds, correct? So bonds contain energy. There's chemical energy there.

551
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:44,840
Which of those bonds would be the most energetic? Probably the carbon hydrogen in total number,

552
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,680
just given the ubiquity of it, right? A carbon hydrogen has more energy than a carbon carbon,

553
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,440
I'm guessing. I'm not too sure. I think that's the case. In the show notes, we'll list what the

554
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,800
potential energy is in each of those bonds. But nevertheless, you go through this process of

555
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,440
actually eating the thing, you put it in your mouth, you break it down. Mechanically, you've

556
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,280
broken it by the time it exits your stomach. But it's really once it gets absorbed out of the

557
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,200
bloodstream that you begin this chemical process of breaking those bonds, and then you get something

558
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,560
for free, right? When you break those bonds, that's when you're getting the energy to create

559
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:26,920
this electron gradient, which you then use at the end to basically do this one thing you alluded to,

560
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:33,880
which is phosphorylate the ATP. So that energy gradient allows you to then put a phosphate

561
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:42,200
back onto an ADP. That's the most obvious one from food. Now you talked about NAD and NADH. Can you

562
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,800
say a little bit more about what those are and how they fit into this, in particular in the

563
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:52,680
mitochondria? Again, the classical teaching is that NAD is an electron carrier. When you have two

564
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,560
electrons, it's going to be in what's called the NADH form. And if you don't have those two electrons,

565
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:04,360
it's in the oxidized form, which is the NAD form. That's another way of holding the energy that can

566
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:11,160
catalyze reactions. What we're learning over the last few years is that in addition to this role

567
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:17,480
as an electron carrier, the NAD itself can be used as a substrate for other reactions.

568
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,920
Outside of the mitochondria or inside? Outside of its role as an electron carrier.

569
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,720
Okay, and that biggest role for that is in these, we'll come, I guess we'll allude to it, but there

570
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,560
are these complexes in the mitochondria. But that's still as a redox carrier. So the electrons go from

571
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,920
the NADH or transferred to the electron transport chain, and that's basically a wire that's going

572
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:45,640
to conduct the electron until they hit oxygen and make water. That's a downhill process. And during

573
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,560
that downhill process, these protons are pumped across the inner membrane, generating about 150

574
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:59,320
millivolts. And that can then be used to do work, including catalyzing the conversion of ADP to ATP.

575
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,440
And that's what we call oxidative phosphorylation. Yep. But then talk about the other example that

576
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,520
you were using there. And this is a newer area of biomedicine. And actually, David Sinclair has

577
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,720
worked in this area quite a bit. But everything that I just told you relates to electrons coming

578
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:22,360
on and off of NAD. So when we talk about NADH to NAD ratio, that's sort of the redox potential.

579
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:29,960
But that NAD molecule, it can also participate as a substrate in certain chemical reactions.

580
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,400
So sirtuins use NAD. Exactly. Sirtuins, some of the DNA damage response pathways, the PARPs,

581
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:44,680
they'll actually use the NAD as a cofactor. So that's important because it's possible in certain

582
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,760
states. Like when you have a damaged cell, for example, if you have a cell with damaged DNA,

583
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,640
that NAD can decline very, very rapidly. It's an electron carrier. So you're actually losing the

584
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,160
ability to carry some of this charge now. This is interesting, right? Because observations are,

585
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:10,040
as we age, these NAD levels decline. Is that due to greater demand for it? Is it due to

586
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,440
reduction in production? And of course, the clinical question that everybody asks is,

587
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,400
is there benefit to replacing it? What's really interesting is there's a couple of different

588
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:25,320
signatures of the aging process. So if you biopsy muscle from individuals of varying ages,

589
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:33,080
you'll see a gradual decline in the NAD content. If you quantify the amount of mitochondria,

590
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,160
using any of the different metrics, you'll see a decline. If you look at things like VO2 max

591
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:46,040
and skeletal muscle as a function of age, you'll see a gradual decline. So there's this gradual

592
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:52,360
decline in NAD and in mitochondrial activity as a function of age. And I think the big question

593
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:58,280
in the field is, do you just have an old and sick tissue? So you have sick mitochondria,

594
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:05,160
or will targeting the mitochondria actually somehow alleviate age associated decline in

595
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:12,200
tissue function? This is such an interesting question. And something that probably until a

596
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,920
year ago, I don't think I spent enough time thinking about, which is, what does it mean to

597
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:25,000
age at the level of the mitochondria? And what are the implications of it? And perhaps most

598
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,040
importantly, what can be done to slow the rate of aging? Now, you study a problem at sort of

599
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:38,600
a different node, which is you are looking very specifically at diseases that people,

600
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,640
most people haven't actually heard of. And I don't want to say you're not interested in those

601
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,680
diseases per se, because you are, but they're basically a gateway for something else. So later

602
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,440
on in this podcast, I suspect we'll come back to more of this mitochondrial fitness, health,

603
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,880
inflammation, mitophagy. There are many other topics I want to explore with you,

604
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,840
but let's now having laid the groundwork, go back and talk about your work and what you're learning.

605
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,680
So give me an example of some of the diseases that you study in your lab.

606
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:15,480
We've historically placed a lot of emphasis on a very large collection of individually rare

607
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,080
inborn errors of mitochondrial metabolism. These are typically single gene disorders.

608
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,960
They can be due to recessive mutations in the nuclear genome, or they can be due to mutations

609
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,720
in the mitochondrial genome. But at the end of the day, there's a component of the mitochondria

610
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,800
that's defective at birth. And so what we just spoke about is the fact that as all of us age,

611
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,680
there's a gradual decline in the activity of mitochondria. The big question in the field is

612
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,040
whether that's cause or consequence. These other 300 rare monogenic disorders of mitochondria,

613
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,960
there's no doubt, there's no question. The gene did the randomization for you,

614
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,160
you know cause and effect. That's exactly right. The mitochondria is defective at birth. And now

615
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,840
we can actually evaluate what the consequences are. You said about 300. What is the phenotypic

616
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,760
spectrum? How many of these, for example, are fatal within the first year of life?

617
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:17,560
They tend to follow a bimodal distribution. The recessive mutations in the nuclear genome,

618
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:23,240
they tend to present early in infancy within the first few weeks or months of life. The mutations

619
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,360
in the mitochondrial genome, those tend to present a little bit later in life. Wow. So let's focus on

620
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,440
the latter group for a moment. I mean, unless you'd prefer to start with the former, which one do you

621
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:37,000
spend more time looking at? We spend a little bit more time on the nuclear genes. Okay, because they

622
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,880
present earlier and presumably they're more severe. That's right. Okay, so give me an example of what

623
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,880
some of those mutations are and what their phenotype is. One of the clinical syndromes that

624
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:52,120
we study is something called Lee syndrome. So there's about 80 different genes that can be

625
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:58,120
mutated to give rise to this clinical syndrome, which is basically a sub-acute degeneration of

626
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,720
a gray matter. It's a very rapid neurodegeneration. It's a terrible, terrible disease.

627
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,720
And what age are people when they start to experience this neurodegeneration?

628
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,840
So most of these kids are actually born developmentally. Okay. And then within the

629
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,400
first couple of months of life, there's some sort of a stressor. Sometimes it's some sort of an

630
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,480
infection. Sometimes it's dehydration that'll put them into a neuro metabolic crisis. And at that

631
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:29,320
point, if you look at their brain MRIs, you'll see lesions in the brainstem, the basal ganglia,

632
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:37,160
sometimes the spinal cord corresponding to regions of necrosis. Wow. So quickly fatal.

633
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,880
And what did you learn? I mean, you have one syndrome, but there are many paths that produce

634
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:48,520
it. What's the, are there common threads to the genetic insults that lead to this awful phenotype?

635
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,960
Great question. That's exactly what we're trying to figure out. So thanks to genetics,

636
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,040
we've not been able to, we as a community, I mean, have been able to map out genes,

637
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,160
the nuclear genome. Some of these are in the MT DNA, but at the end, we get this thing called Lee

638
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,960
syndrome. And we're trying to figure out what exactly isn't about the broken mitochondria that

639
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,840
gives rise to this phenotype. And honestly, we don't know what the full answer is right now,

640
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,080
but it's a very, very active area of research right now.

641
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,680
It might be naive, but just listening to you describe this, I can't help but think,

642
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:26,360
can we learn something about Alzheimer's disease or other forms of neurodegeneration, which I think

643
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:33,560
many people are starting to argue are basically neuronal energy crises. So there are lots of

644
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:39,720
insults, right? You can have an accumulation of toxin, you can have a insulin resistance,

645
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,240
frankly, you can have microvascular disease. All of these things are predisposing people

646
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,440
to neurodegeneration. And something that they could all have in common is depletion of energy

647
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:56,520
to the neuron, which would be perhaps the most sensitive cell to an energy reduction. I mean,

648
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,360
anybody can think about that for a moment. If you know somebody who's lost their ability to breathe

649
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,760
for a period of time, usually the thing we care about the most is their brain, because that's the

650
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:15,640
first thing that you suffer from when you have a hypoxic event. So is that based on Lee's Center,

651
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:22,040
is that the explanation for why you're potentially seeing it disproportionately in the brain

652
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:28,360
versus skeletal muscle? Is it just the sensitivity of the brain to energy withdrawal? Or do you think

653
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:34,760
there's something specific about the mitochondria in neurons? Mitochondrial disorders can actually

654
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:41,320
impact almost any organ system. And so Lee's syndrome represents one type of clinical manifestation

655
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,680
of mitochondrial disease, but there's another set of disorders that impact the skeletal muscle as well.

656
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:54,920
I think at this point, we don't know why mutations in one subunit of the electron transport chain

657
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:01,640
gives rise to brain disease. A mutation in the neighboring subunit of the same protein complex

658
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,440
that's equally evolutionarily conserved will give rise to muscle disease. Wow.

659
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,600
There's a mass of non-linearity over here that we simply don't understand right now.

660
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,800
So if there is one and only one silver lining in these awful diseases, it's that scientists will

661
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,960
have no shortage of questions to ask for decades to come. No, I think this is a super active area of

662
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:32,440
research right now, in part fueled by the link between mitochondrial decline and aging.

663
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:38,680
So that's such a complicated problem. You're trying to understand why a car breaks down after

664
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:47,320
being in service for 25 years. It's hard. Is it some fan belt break? Did the battery stop charging?

665
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,400
Did the tire deflate? It's kind of hard to know why an entire car breaks down after 25 years.

666
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:01,480
In these rare mitoid disorders, we have 300 different forms of that automobile that was

667
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:07,400
almost broken at birth, if that makes sense. We study them in part because these patients need

668
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,920
new treatments and therapies. And so that's enough of a motivation for us. But we also do expect that

669
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:18,440
a subset of them, by studying them, will inform what's happening in more common form of aging.

670
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,960
Your lab studies oxygen, but not necessarily in the way that most people commonly think about it.

671
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,680
Most people, when they think of oxygen and mitochondria, something that comes to mind

672
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,560
pretty quickly is ROS. Absolutely. I spoke with a friend of mine, Navdeep Chandel, and we spoke a

673
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,720
lot about ROS. And now I've had a great take on it, which was, look, we think of ROS typically only in

674
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:45,160
the negative. And they do lots of negative things. But they may also be a signaling molecule, and

675
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,720
therefore an essential thing. Talk to me about the lens through which your group looks at oxygen.

676
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,320
So remember a while ago, you asked a very, very astute question. You have these 80 different genes.

677
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,800
When they're mutated, they give rise to this thing called Lee syndrome, which is a different type of a

678
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:08,280
neurodegeneration. What does that pathology pathogenesis look like? The traditional dogma

679
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,000
for mitochondrial pathogenesis is that when the powerhouse of the cell is broken,

680
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,720
there's not enough ATP, and there's a power failure. That's the traditional dogma. And

681
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:24,440
without a doubt, there's truth to that in some instances. What we've discovered is that in

682
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:33,320
addition to producing ATP, mitochondria are also consumers of oxygen. Most of the oxygen that you

683
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:41,880
breathe, Peter, is being consumed by your mitochondria. When a patient has a birth defect

684
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,200
in the mitochondrion, in addition to not being able to produce sufficient ATP,

685
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:55,240
they also have excess oxygen as well. So oxygen delivery tends to be patent in these patients,

686
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:01,400
but the utilization ends up being poor. And oxygen, just asking for people to understand,

687
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,280
how does oxygen even get to the mitochondria? So we all understand that we're breathing air that

688
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,840
has oxygen, and let's even go one step further and just take it for granted that there's a

689
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,040
gradient in the lung that allows oxygen to get into hemoglobin to a red blood cell.

690
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,480
Now that you have a fully loaded red blood cell in an arterial that enters a capillary,

691
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,560
how many things have to happen for oxygen to get into the mitochondria specifically,

692
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:31,080
not just the cell? Oxygen is not particularly soluble in water or fluids, and so we have an

693
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,400
oxygen-carrying protein called hemoglobin that's found in our red blood cells. And so

694
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:41,000
in the lungs, all of the red blood cells in the hemoglobin get loaded with oxygen,

695
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,640
and now these red blood cells are delivered to peripheral tissues, and the oxygen gets extracted

696
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:54,040
from the fluid, and as the fluid gets depleted in oxygen, the hemoglobin will basically offload its

697
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:00,280
oxygen. And so there's certain tissues that become extremely, extremely hypoxic. So the oxygen will

698
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:07,240
get extracted by a tissue, largely by diffusion, and the mitochondria is basically consuming most

699
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,520
of this oxygen. So a cell that is sitting there doesn't require an active transporter to get

700
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,920
oxygen across its outer membrane, so it just diffuses across. That's right. When oxygen enters

701
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,720
the cytoplasm, how does it get over to the mitochondria? Depending on the cell type,

702
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,440
it either diffuses or... How does it know that the mitochondria is the place it needs to go?

703
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,640
Well, it's being consumed, so it's a little bit of a sink, basically.

704
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,040
So that's what I want to understand. There are lots of places oxygen could hang out,

705
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,320
so what is the force that is drawing it into the mitochondria? Is it simply utilization

706
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,960
that basically creates a vacuum? That's right. That's right. Now, in certain tissues like skeletal

707
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,000
muscle and heart, we have other oxygen carriers in the tissue, things like myoglobin are oxygen

708
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
carriers, so they're almost little buffers of oxygen that are in the tissue. Yeah, they're more

709
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,640
like loaders, right? That's right. I think of them as another storage for oxygen inside.

710
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,400
Yeah. That's right. But that still has to get off the myoglobin and get sucked into the mitochondria,

711
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,400
effectively, right? That's right. So it's another little storehouse, if you will. It's another

712
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,000
buffer of oxygen, so that when you're exercising, for example, you may not want to be oxygen limited,

713
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,360
so you have a little extra oxygen in your myoglobin. But basically, your mitochondria is

714
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:26,040
where most of your oxygen is being consumed, so it's a sink. And so that's the reason that we have

715
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:30,360
gradients inside of our cells. It's amazing. I've never really even thought about it this way, but

716
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,840
it's sort of interesting to think at how efficiently the body disposes of carbon dioxide,

717
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:44,040
because, as you alluded to earlier, the end of that downhill gradient is a final path of

718
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:52,920
electron acceptance, generating H2O and CO2, both of which we manage to largely off gas.

719
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:59,000
So somehow those things have to exit the mitochondria, weasel out of the cell, cross

720
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,480
the gradient and go back to, well, in the case of CO2, get back to the hemoglobin molecule and get

721
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,720
carried back. It's like there's a lot of things going on here. Well, so one of the things that

722
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,200
we're discovering by studying these rare diseases, and this happened because of a CRISPR screen that

723
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:17,480
we did a couple of years ago, but what we've now discovered is that one of the consequences

724
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:27,480
of mitochondrial dysfunction is excess unused oxygen. So in other words, if a mitochondria

725
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:35,960
is failing to do its job, you will be failing to utilize oxygen. Therefore, you would see an excess

726
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,560
accumulation of oxygen. That's right. And we believe this is our hypothesis now. It's that

727
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:47,480
some of that excess unused oxygen is what is contributing to the pathology that we see in

728
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,040
some of these rare diseases. It's a very, very different type of an idea. It's not

729
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:58,520
all about the ATP. It's about excess unused oxygen. And we're not necessarily invoking

730
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:04,600
reactive oxygen species. Yeah, I was just about to say, is it through free radicals or is it

731
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:12,120
actually oxygen to oxygen, no extra electron oxygen? This is dioxygen toxicity that we're

732
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,880
talking about. The way that I like to think about it is if you have an automobile that's outside and

733
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:25,720
it's rusting, it's rusting in part because the oxygen is directly oxidizing iron. You may produce

734
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:31,560
a radical, but that's not the phenomenon. So the car outside is not rusting because of too much

735
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:38,760
superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. It's direct oxidation of iron centers by oxygen. And so one

736
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:48,600
of our hypotheses is that enzymes are tuned to operate within a particular oxygen range. And when

737
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:55,800
the mitochondrion is not functioning properly, oxygen levels rise, that excess dioxygen can now

738
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:01,560
oxidize enzymes that will damage them as a consequence. So it's a very, very different way

739
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:08,040
of thinking about mitochondrial pathogenesis. Now, why doesn't the body correct for that and note

740
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,600
that while the oxygen in the mitochondria is not being utilized as quickly as my evolutionary

741
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,080
prediction would allow, but therefore we're going to, there's less gradient pressure. So I'm going

742
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:25,080
to off gas, I'm going to offload less oxygen to the cell with subsequent trips through. Like in

743
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,200
other words, you almost think this would have been corrected in a few milliseconds.

744
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,040
Well, I think at a healthy human, that's exactly right. We have pretty solid matching of oxygen

745
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:39,960
delivery and oxygen utilization, but we're talking about patients that have broken mitochondria.

746
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,320
So this is one of the things that we're actually trying to investigate. One of the ways that

747
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:50,280
Ron Haller at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center has proposed diagnosing patients

748
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,720
with mitochondrial disease is to put them on a treadmill, measure their oxygen extraction,

749
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,720
and patients with mitochondrial myopathies will often have high venous oxygen.

750
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,800
Let's explain that to people because we're going to talk about VO2 max and you've alluded to it. So

751
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,480
most people associate that test with sort of peak athletic performance, but let's talk about what it

752
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,320
looks like. If I came into your lab and you were doing this, you'd hook me up to a device, you'd

753
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,160
put me on a treadmill, you'd make me, you know, have to do some work to stress the system.

754
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,280
You'd plug my nose and put a little miserable device in my mouth, basically creating a seal

755
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:33,160
that would prevent me from being able to get oxygen or dispose of carbon dioxide in any place

756
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:38,840
other than the gas chamber that is attached to the tube going into my mouth. You'd put me at the,

757
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,680
you know, you'd ramp up the speed of the treadmill and you would be measuring essentially two things,

758
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,440
the amount of oxygen you're putting in and if it's room air, we sort of know what that is,

759
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:55,160
but more importantly, the concentration of oxygen coming out and that difference is what you're

760
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:00,360
talking about. It's that extraction. Now, what happens in a normal person when you do this?

761
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,560
So Peter, we actually don't do these types of studies in humans and so.

762
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,320
When one does this, yeah, what would normally happen is what would you be measuring as a normal

763
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:15,880
person works harder and harder in the difference between provided oxygen and returned oxygen?

764
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,960
So again, we don't do these types of studies, but in these types of physiological studies that

765
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,240
people like Ron Haller, other cardiologists will perform, they'll look at cardiac output

766
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,480
as well as the oxygen tensions on the arterial and venous signs. And so by looking at all of

767
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,560
these numbers, you can actually figure out quantitatively the number of O2 molecules

768
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,960
being delivered as well as those that are being extracted versus those that are being returned

769
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,120
to the venous system. So you sort of do a, you can do a mass balance on oxygen effectively.

770
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,440
That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And as it turns out in these patients with

771
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,760
inherited mitochondrial disease, for some reason, the cardiac output is high,

772
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:00,840
the extraction is low in a healthy individual. Usually the homeostasis is such that you're not

773
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,680
going to be delivering more oxygen than you really need. So that homeostasis is somehow broken in

774
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:12,040
these patients with. So that patient would actually have a very high lactate level as well,

775
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:18,120
because if they're able to produce the cardiac output, but they're not doing it with oxidative

776
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:23,480
phosphorylation, they're using their escape valve. So they're going to disproportionately

777
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:29,400
have high lactate levels relative to a healthy individual. That's right. So Ron Haller would

778
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:35,240
actually argue that a high lactate in combination with a high venous oxygen is suggestive of a

779
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:41,160
mitochondrial myopathy. There's a researcher at the University of Colorado who is looking into

780
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:47,400
this very phenomenon as an early indicator of type two diabetes. And it's really fascinating.

781
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,440
I'm going to be going out there to spend some time with them this summer. They've made the

782
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:57,240
observation that in the early stages of insulin resistance, the muscle, the skeletal muscle in

783
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:05,400
particular becomes inefficient at oxfoss. So you start to see even at baseline, even a person

784
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:12,280
sitting at rest, their lactate levels could be twice as high as that of a fit individual. And

785
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:19,080
of course, he came to this through the thinking that if you want to understand that disease of

786
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:24,360
the mitochondria, look at the exact opposite. Look at the fittest people in the world, look at the

787
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:30,440
endurance athletes and ask the question, what do their mitochondria do well? And then what becomes

788
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:35,640
the polar opposite of that in disease? Now, what you're describing is the most extreme example I've

789
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:41,240
ever heard of this, right? Absolutely. What you're describing is actually very consistent with a

790
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:48,360
series of papers that were published probably in 2003 and 2004, including by myself in collaboration

791
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,960
with Leaf Group and David Altshuler, Ron Kahn, who used to be the president of the Jocelyn,

792
01:13:53,960 --> 01:14:01,400
as well as Jerry Shulman from Yale, and Srikumar Nair at Mayo Clinic. All of us had sort of papers

793
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,520
at the same time. David Altshuler is here, right? David Altshuler used to be here. He's now at

794
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,440
Vertex, but he's one of the founders of the Broad Institute. But all of us had papers published at

795
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:19,160
about the same time that showed that if you take skeletal muscle from pre-diabetics, healthy

796
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:26,680
individuals that have a family history of diabetes, but are still healthy, they'll all have a reduced

797
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:33,480
number of mitochondria. The expression of those 1000 genes required for mitochondria, it's just a

798
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:38,520
little bit lower. If you look at any one gene, it's not significant, but if you look at the entire

799
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:46,600
pathway, the entire pathway is down, the VO2 max is down. So there's a series of papers back in 2003

800
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:55,720
and 2004 that led to the mitochondrial hypothesis for type 2 diabetes. The big question still to this

801
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:04,040
date, almost 15, 16 years later, is that actually causal for the diabetes, or is it just an early

802
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:11,160
epiphenomenon? There's something else, X, that lies upstream of the amount of mitochondria and

803
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:16,760
independently the predisposition to diabetes, or is that a part of the causal path? That's still

804
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:23,480
unanswered to this date. And there's nothing in a Mendelian randomization that can answer that question.

805
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:29,640
So as you probably know, these types of methods are only now becoming possible. So we're trying

806
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,440
to work on those types of projects right now. You need large numbers of heavily genotyped

807
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:41,080
individuals, you also need to have nice biomarkers or proxies for mitochondrial function. So those

808
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,160
are some of the types of things we're trying now. Because it comes up from time to time, do you

809
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,680
mind just explaining how Mendelian randomization works and why it's so powerful? Again, this is not

810
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:56,120
an area of my expertise, others are much more expert at it than I am. But the analogy that

811
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:01,720
they'll often use in describing a Mendelian randomization is a little bit like a drug trial.

812
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,760
So in a drug trial, what you'll do is you'll take individuals and you'll randomize them either to

813
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:12,440
a drug arm or a placebo arm, and then you'll look for an outcome. There's an intervention,

814
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,840
which is the assignment of a drug or the placebo, and then you can actually check to see whether

815
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:22,600
the outcome is correlated to that particular intervention. And if you see an effect, now that

816
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,640
effect is attributable to that intervention. Because the decision to give the intervention

817
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,760
versus the placebo was done randomly. If you didn't do it randomly, you can't make that assertion.

818
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,280
That's right. Now in a Mendelian randomization experiment, the idea is that there's a

819
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:44,440
randomization that took place at birth. And so if you look at something like LDL levels, for example,

820
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:52,760
an important question is, are LDL levels causal for heart attack? Or are they simply correlative

821
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:59,160
for heart attack? So thanks to genetics, we have a lot of genetic variants that can help explain

822
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:07,000
the population variation in LDL levels. Once you have a good solid genetic instrument,

823
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,440
now what we can do is we can take a very large number of individuals and we can actually draw

824
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:19,320
a bell curve for what their genetic LDL levels must look like. We haven't measured LDL in them,

825
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,680
but from the genetics, you can actually come up with a bell curve in the population. And now you

826
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:31,800
can say, let's take this tail, they've been randomized to a high genetic level of LDL versus

827
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,800
this tail, a low genetic level of LDL. Now let's see what the outcomes are. And based on the

828
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,640
statistics, based on the patterns of correlation, you can then make the inference that the LDL is

829
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:51,080
either causal for heart attack, or there's no evidence for causality. I am not an MR, Mendelian

830
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,840
randomization jock, but my recollection in reading some of the papers about this is the one place

831
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:03,240
that either as an investigator or a consumer of this science where you have to force yourself to

832
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:11,480
look closely is you can be fooled if the randomization of genes, meaning if the genes

833
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,280
that you're looking at can also control something else that is related to the disease that could

834
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,800
have a counterbalancing effect. Is that correct? That's one place where one has to be quite cautious.

835
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,840
I think there's multiple places where, I mean, as soon as you have feedback loops, you can get

836
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:34,200
phenomenon called reverse causation. Your genetic instrument also has to be really, really good.

837
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,720
So again, this is not my area of expertise. So it has to be pursued with care for sure. So there's

838
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,680
probably going to be a fair number of false positive results for all true positive results

839
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:51,000
from Mendelian randomization studies. Yeah, but it is interesting. I would love to see the MR when

840
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,320
it's done for this particular question. Because again, you know, the implications are significant,

841
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:03,000
both from the standpoint of preventing chronic disease or risk reduction in chronic disease.

842
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,480
But also as we try to approach the question the way that you phrased it a moment ago, which I

843
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:16,760
really liked, which is everybody kind of has the gestalt of that car that just sort of breaks down.

844
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:23,960
And sometimes it's attributable to a catastrophic failure. Sometimes you blow the head gasket in the

845
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,800
car and it's that it dies at that moment. And it just becomes economically not feasible to put a

846
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:36,120
new head gasket on. Other times it just gets harder and harder to start until it's just not

847
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:46,280
worth driving anymore. So taking this to humans, how important is mitochondrial health to that

848
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:53,960
process? In other words, does it become more often than not one of the drivers of this feeling,

849
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:01,880
this lack of robustness, this lack of stability within the organism? And it seems to me that it's

850
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:08,280
on the short list of candidates, right? I mean, when this process goes awry, you are interrupting

851
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:13,240
one of the more fundamental systems in human biology that affects almost every cell in the body,

852
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,680
right? Absolutely. I think it kind of cuts both ways because I think when other processes in the

853
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:25,720
cell fail, I think the mitochondrion is at risk for also failing. So it's a highly reactive

854
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:32,920
organelle as well, if that makes sense. It's going to be a tough question to fully answer. And this

855
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:38,040
is why we like these rare genetic disorders because they teach us about the pathology

856
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,960
pathogenesis of the organelle in a few defined modes. And the big question for our field is,

857
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:50,600
which of those rare diseases, which of those rare forms of pathogenesis bears any relevance to the

858
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:57,400
common form of wear and tear aging? So there may be a small subset of rare diseases where the fan

859
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:03,880
belt is broken at birth, right? But it may be the case that the fan belt, as it turns out, is so

860
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:10,280
resilient, you never have to change it. And it's rarely the cause of a car breaking down. But it

861
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:16,200
could be the case that it's actually the spark plug, right? It could be the case that there are

862
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:20,600
certain birth defects with a spark plug is actually not working at birth. And as it turns out,

863
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:27,400
with wear and tear aging, spark plugs have to be replaced. And so we have 300 different

864
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:34,920
forms of monogenic mitochondrial disease, right? You have 300 single point of failures to study.

865
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:41,640
And that gives you a beautiful picture of what it looks like. Some of these are going to bear no

866
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:47,000
relevance to the common form of aging. That's just going to be a fact. But the hope is that a

867
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,360
small number of these will bear some relevance to the common form of aging. And just to be clear,

868
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:58,200
we care about these diseases just because these are terrible diseases, and we need therapies for

869
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:04,120
them. And so that alone is motivation for our work in this area. But it's also our hope that studying

870
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,480
some of them will provide insights into the common form of aging as well.

871
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,320
You talked earlier about signatures of time. And another one of these signatures of time is

872
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:18,600
inflammation within muscle cells. There was a paper that came out about a year ago that used

873
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:26,760
Sting to basically block the ability of a cell to sense breakdown in mitochondrial DNA. Are you

874
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:32,600
familiar with this work? I'm a little bit familiar with the Sting pathway. My understanding, it's been

875
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:38,760
about a year since I read this, maybe a bit less, was that serially, if you study muscles as they

876
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,280
age, you see more and more inflammation. So the question is, what is drawing inflammatory cells

877
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:50,520
into muscle as we age? And the hypothesis was, going back to something you talked about earlier,

878
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:58,200
the DNA of mitochondria is bacterial in origin. And therefore, if you have a loose fragment of

879
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,000
nuclear DNA in the cell, it shouldn't be especially immunogenic. But if you have a loose

880
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,920
fragment of bacterial DNA in a cell, that should actually be quite immunogenic. Our immune systems

881
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:16,440
would think of that as foreign. So the hypothesis was, what if the increase in inflammation we see

882
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:23,000
is due to greater and greater mitochondrial damage that is leading to more and more exposure

883
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,320
of mitochondrial DNA? And I believe to test that, it used Sting. And remind me, I think Sting

884
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:34,440
actually blocks the ability of the cell to sense the mitochondrial DNA. Is that correct?

885
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,240
Not just mitochondrial DNA, but I think it's a general nucleic acid sensor. And so there could

886
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:43,560
be different sources. I think- It could block the sensing of DNA, period. I think ordinarily,

887
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:50,200
it's designed to sense the DNA of incoming viruses or incoming pathogens. But you could imagine that

888
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:56,520
if a mitochondria ruptures, that same DNA nucleic acids can also be sensed. And you're right,

889
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:02,360
because the mitochondria used to be a bacteria, a lot of the components inside of our mitochondria

890
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:08,520
resemble that of modern day bacteria, and can be very immunogenic. I don't know if you follow-

891
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,120
There's a study that came out of the Beth Israel Deaconess a few years ago on sterile crush injury.

892
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,640
And as a former surgeon, you'd probably appreciate it. But the observation was that when you had an

893
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:27,000
enclosed crush injury, so the skin has not been violated. There's a massive inflammatory response.

894
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,920
So this investigator was actually trying to figure out what the inflammatory nidus was,

895
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:36,360
did a lot of fractionation, and ultimately figured out that there was some mitochondrial

896
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:41,400
derived molecules. And I believe that they found that the mitochondrial DNA,

897
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:47,880
as well as something called formulated peptides, are highly inflammatory. So remember those 13

898
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,720
proteins that are made by the MT DNA, the translation of those 13 proteins resembles

899
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:59,320
the translation of bacterial proteins. And bacterial protein translation doesn't begin

900
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:05,800
with a methanol tyrene. It begins with a formal methanol tyrene. Remember this F-met peptides?

901
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,200
Yeah, this is my God, I feel like I'm back in medical school. Can you just for no other reason

902
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:15,480
than for me to remember that. Let's go through that. So your DNA makes your messenger RNA,

903
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,240
your messenger RNA then moves over to be translated and to actually have the amino

904
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:25,640
acids put in place to resemble the code that's being said. So talk about where the meth terminal

905
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:31,480
end shows up there. In you and I, in eukaryotes, protein translation begins with a methionine

906
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:38,360
residue. In bacteria, it's not a simple methionine, but it's a modified molecule. It's called formal

907
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:44,360
methionine. And first order approximation, it's almost a signature of a bacterial derived protein.

908
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:50,600
And we actually have receptors that are designed to detect formulated peptides. It's a sign of some

909
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:56,200
sort of an infection. As it turns out, our mitochondria have bacterial origins, as we have

910
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:03,560
discussed earlier. So these 13 proteins, they still begin with the formal methionine. Presumably,

911
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,640
they can get away with it under normal circumstances because they reside within the

912
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,600
mitochondria that's protected and shielded from the immune system. That's right. So in certain

913
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:17,880
injuries, this can actually escape and it can basically activate the same inflammatory pathways

914
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:23,160
that we have that are ordinarily designed to detect incoming pathogens. I can't wait to actually find

915
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:28,760
that paper. So who is the author on that? I forget his name, but he's from the Beth Israel Deaconess.

916
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:34,440
Okay, and it was like O2O3-ish. No, no, no, this was probably within the last five years ago or so.

917
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,320
Well, we'll find that paper and link to it. But basically that paper and the paper I was referring

918
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:45,320
to from about a year ago, which I think was in science, both point to a similar conclusion,

919
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:51,800
which is you can have a profound inflammatory response by simply damaging the mitochondria.

920
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:59,720
And both of them would point to consistent plausible explanations, which are the body confusing

921
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,400
the contents for bacterial contents. I think it's a very reasonable hypothesis.

922
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:13,880
Which then begs the question, if we believe that the aging inflammation phenotype is not beneficial,

923
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:20,600
how do we prevent mitochondrial breakdown as we age? I mean, this becomes one of the key

924
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:26,040
aging questions, right? If you believe that, and again, I don't know what the best analogy is, but

925
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:33,720
spark plug failure plays a role more often than not in the overall picture of decline,

926
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,400
the longer you can protect those things, preserve those things, the better.

927
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:45,560
Another way to evaluating the causality question is if we had a drug that could somehow rejuvenate

928
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,280
mitochondria, then you could ask the question, does directly intervening on this organelle

929
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,600
retard the aging process? And unfortunately, as of right now, we don't have that type of a

930
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:07,000
magic bullet, but exercise is one of the best ways of turning over bad mitochondria and inducing the

931
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,680
biogenesis of good mitochondria. But the challenge, of course, as exercise does lots of things.

932
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,800
Now that said, we always, this is one of the differences between, I think, being a scientist

933
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,360
and a doctor. When you're wearing your doctor hat, you just have to know what to do for that

934
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:31,720
patient in that moment. And it's a luxury to know how and why it works, right? So when we think about

935
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:38,920
the importance of exercise, I've always found that ironic that I probably classify or qualify as an

936
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:44,200
exercise addict, like in the true unhealthy sense of the word, you know, I probably meet all the

937
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:50,920
criteria of addiction and all of that stuff. But up until recently, I don't think I really appreciated

938
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:58,360
the value of exercise. I think it was honestly just something I did out of my neurotic pathology.

939
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:05,240
But I actually, I think if asked would have said that nutrition played a much greater role in health,

940
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:11,720
sleep played a much greater role in health. And that exercise, you know, I mean, it's great, but,

941
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,480
you know, if you, I'd rather you eat well than exercise a lot or something to that effect.

942
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:20,920
I'm certainly revisiting that. And of course, I also find it silly to do these sort of zero-sum

943
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,840
games, like it has to be one or the other, you know, presumably doing all of these things well

944
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:32,120
as the optimal strategy. But the deeper I look at exercise, and I'd love to know your framework

945
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:37,240
for this, because I'm still trying to create one. I'm putting exercise very loosely into three buckets,

946
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:44,760
strength training, very specific aerobic training. So this would be maximum mitochondrial output

947
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:51,640
with minimal generation of lactate. And then anaerobic training where you are basically demanding

948
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:57,160
ATP at such a rate that you are really running through that lactate production pathway. Do you

949
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:02,280
think that's a reasonable framework of buckets of exercise? Do you divide them even more granularly

950
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,960
as you think about it mechanistically? We're really not exercise physiologist. I don't think

951
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:13,000
I can comment. Just personally, do you think of it in a way like that? I think that's very reasonable.

952
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,600
You know, just in hearing you talk, I mean, again, we're not aging researchers, but

953
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,280
so I'll ask you a question. If that's okay, has anyone actually, you know, people have given

954
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:26,360
metformin to mice, they've given rapamyce into mice, but has anyone given mice

955
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:32,760
those three flavors of exercise to determine what the impact is on longevity?

956
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:39,400
Yeah, I believe those experiments have been done. And I believe all of them show benefit. I'd have

957
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:47,480
to go back and look at the literature in mice. In fact, I'm in the process of just starting to work

958
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:53,560
on that chapter in a book that I'm writing. The problem is I generally bias against heavy

959
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,600
mice literature, but you at least have the advantage of control. So the short answer is

960
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,400
definitely each of those as a medication, right? If you think of each of those as a pill,

961
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:10,440
each of those produce a longevity phenotype. Where it gets challenging, I think in humans is,

962
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:19,000
well, I think there are so many ways to die when you get old that, for example, accidental death

963
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:28,440
would rank in the top five causes of death for people over the age of 60. Now, the type of accident

964
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,320
can change around, but by the time you're in your eighth or ninth decade, falling becomes such a

965
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:42,120
significant cause of death due to the frailty of the individual that some of that exercise,

966
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:47,240
for example, strength training almost assuredly offers protection from that type of death.

967
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,200
So the question is, I think it's a little hard to tease out how much of that benefit is in the

968
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:59,720
cardiometabolic side versus otherwise. The other thing that's really challenging in studying humans

969
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:05,400
is we don't have really good prospective studies in anything that resembles a longevity phenotype.

970
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:11,240
So you are now stuck using something I think I recently described as the most

971
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:19,640
servile trash ever shat into civilization, which is epidemiologic questionnaires to try to impute

972
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:27,640
based on you telling me how you've exercised over the past 10 years, how that's going to predict

973
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:33,880
your longevity phenotype. And again, the problem there is the dose matters, the specificity, the

974
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:39,480
quantity, the quality, these things matter, and they're very difficult to tease out from these

975
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:47,000
retrospective views. So I think the evidence is very compelling that exercise matters,

976
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:53,960
and that's maybe less the question I'm interested in. I think what I'd love to gain insights into,

977
01:32:53,960 --> 01:33:02,600
and we may have to rely on non-human models, is just as we now can tailor a drug to do something

978
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:10,200
very specific, can we tailor our exercise to be as optimal as possible? So if you took an individual

979
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:15,000
who said, Peter, look, I'm willing to exercise five hours a week, or I'm willing to exercise

980
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,200
10 hours a week, but I'm not going to be a professional athlete, how do I take those five

981
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:26,600
hours a week, or 10 hours a week, or whatever it is, and make the best use of it to impact

982
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:32,440
all causes of mortality, meaning reduction of the risk of atherosclerotic disease,

983
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:38,840
cancer, neoplasm, neurodegenerative disease, and accidental death from strengthening the

984
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:44,280
exoskeleton. So that's clinically the question I'm most interested in as it pertains to exercise,

985
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:51,320
but I'm convinced that at the center of that question is understanding the role of exercise

986
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,840
in mitochondrial health. I think this is a very important piece of the puzzle, and certainly much

987
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:02,200
more important than I appreciated even two years ago. I think what you describe about these

988
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:11,400
age-appropriate or age-acknowledged declines in VO2 max, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial

989
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:16,840
efficiency, venous O2 concentration, I think there's something really important there.

990
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,920
And even if exercise is affecting something upstream that is affecting that, at least we

991
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,160
have a great proxy through which to measure. I think there's going to end up being a lot of

992
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:34,760
really interesting nonlinear dynamics of mitochondria as a function of age, as a function of exercise.

993
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,680
There's a few vignette cell shares. You probably know if you don't use your skeletal muscle,

994
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:45,560
you lose lean muscle mass, you lose your mitochondria very quickly. How quickly? You

995
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:53,080
have measurable defects in the VO2 max after 10 days of hospitalized bed rest, and to recover the

996
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,960
VO2 max that you lose in 10 days, it takes about six weeks or so. Oh my god, yeah, I knew it was

997
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,320
bad. I didn't know it was that bad. So there's quite a bit of hysteresis over here, right? Quite

998
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:08,280
a bit of hysteresis. So it's going to be complex and nonlinear. The programs that turn on mitochondria

999
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:12,440
during exercise, they're really elaborate. And the idea of actually replacing it in a pill

1000
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:19,560
may end up being kind of naive. I think that exercise does so many things simultaneously.

1001
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:25,640
It's like 17 different inputs into the system. And it may be the case that it's only if those 17

1002
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:32,120
inputs are provided with the right dynamics and the right off rates that you get properly

1003
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:38,520
functioning more mitochondria. In certain disease states, some of the muscle disorders that I study,

1004
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:45,160
the ragged red fiber that you may remember from your board exams, the ragged red fiber represents

1005
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:51,400
an accumulation of poorly functioning mitochondria. So I think that if you try to bottle up just two

1006
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:56,280
of these factors or three of these factors, we may be able to produce more malfunctioning

1007
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:02,440
mitochondria. But it could be the case that we've evolved to require 17 inputs provided at the right

1008
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,240
time and place in order to get proper mitobiogenesis. It's a really, really smart program, this

1009
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:14,280
PTC1 alpha program, because it simultaneously turns on mitochondrial biogenesis while also turning on

1010
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,400
some of the autophagy programs. And so you're actually turning over your bad mitochondria

1011
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,640
while you're turning on your good mitochondria simultaneously. And that's what happens with

1012
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:28,760
exercise. Well, you read my mind, and I don't know if you could read my little notes I'm taking over

1013
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:31,960
here, because as we're talking, I'm making little notes of things I want to ask you. And that's

1014
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:37,960
exactly kind of where I want it to go, which was, let's talk about what autophagy means in the

1015
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:43,880
context of mitochondria. So people who listen to this podcast know that I'm a big fan of fasting,

1016
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:49,880
periodic fasting, because even though we don't have great ways to measure autophagy clinically,

1017
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,360
I think we have pretty good evidence that periods of really strict fasting, meaning

1018
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:59,880
exclusively consuming water for some period of time, my hypothesis is three to seven days,

1019
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:06,760
produces meaningful autophagy. But how does exercise impact that based on what you've seen

1020
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:12,360
in the mitochondria? So I don't know too much about fasting, but when you do have proper exercise

1021
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:17,880
regimes, what we observe is that there are transcriptional programs with multiple inputs,

1022
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,440
some of which we discussed earlier, but those are probably not sufficient, that will basically

1023
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:29,000
turn on all 1000 of those proteins to produce more mitochondria. But that same program is also

1024
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,240
saying, Hey, let's turn over some of the previously produced mitochondria. So it's a very, very smart

1025
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,040
system. It's not going to just produce more good mitochondria in the presence of bad might is it

1026
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:45,320
actually cleanse the system as well. And remind me what you said. I know you already answered this,

1027
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,200
I apologize. When you look at cells that are not turning over quickly, so myocytes, neurons,

1028
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:55,160
what did you say was the approximate turnover of mitochondria? Probably a few days. A few days,

1029
01:37:55,160 --> 01:38:04,280
unbelievable. So it's just, this is an unbelievable amount of work to create the new and systematically

1030
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:09,400
and selectively discard and recycle the old. That's right. That's right. And the signals,

1031
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,480
given that you like exercise, I'll tell you one study that I thought was really provocative,

1032
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:18,920
and maybe you already know it, but it came from, I think, Michael Ristow and Ron Kahn,

1033
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:24,920
about 10 to 12 years ago in PNAS. Do you know this study? I don't. I don't think I do, but keep

1034
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:33,240
going. It was a human study. They, two by two matrix, they randomized humans either to exercise

1035
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:40,280
or no exercise and antioxidants or no antioxidants. Oh, yes. Okay. I know the study, but please keep

1036
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:46,600
going. No, this is great. So which of the four quadrants do you think is best? I know the answer,

1037
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,040
so I want you to, yeah, you keep going. Yeah. So most people would probably guess. Most people

1038
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:57,800
would say exercise with antioxidants must be the optimal health. Absolutely. And what this study

1039
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:03,080
showed that was a little bit counterintuitive is that antioxidants on top of exercise almost

1040
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:11,560
prevents or erases some of the beneficial effects of exercise. And the authors concluded that things

1041
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:17,960
like reactive oxygen species are probably playing an important signaling role as well. That helps in

1042
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:23,960
the adaptation. You need some of those sparks in order to turn on new programs that are net

1043
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:29,400
beneficial. So if you erase those sparks, yet you prevent the full benefit of exercise. So just

1044
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:34,040
another reason why the entire system is so complicated. I mean, I think investigating

1045
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:38,920
exercise, and again, we don't do that. That's not a core scientific focus of our laboratory, but

1046
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:45,320
so many diseases, ultimately, their risk is reduced by exercise. So studying it is,

1047
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:49,240
it should be a very important objective for all of us. It's so interesting because that's a,

1048
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:53,480
that is a great example. I'm glad you brought that up. And Nav and I, though we didn't talk about

1049
01:39:53,560 --> 01:40:02,520
that study, we talked a lot about this issue of blocking ROS and how if one has cancer, for

1050
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:06,600
example, the evidence is becoming pretty clear that the last thing you want to do in a cancer

1051
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,600
patient is give them an antioxidant as sort of anti sort of dogmatic as that would seem,

1052
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:16,840
because the ROS actually play an important role in selectively targeting a cancer cell versus a

1053
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:24,200
non-cancer cell. Listening to these discussions makes you almost wonder how in the world does any

1054
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:32,200
drug show up with a benefit in longevity. It's almost a miracle that rapamycin can so ubiquitously

1055
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:39,400
across so many species extend life. When, as you point out, most of the things that do the heavy

1056
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:47,960
lifting in longevity have 17 prongs that can't be replicated by a single molecule. I mean, it just,

1057
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,240
it seems impossible. The one that has me very interested right now, and again, I don't know

1058
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:58,760
how much you've studied this. My guess is even if you haven't, just your peripheral knowledge

1059
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:05,160
will exceed that of anybody's is metformin. So again, I think most people listening to this

1060
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:09,960
podcast know a lot about it. I had an interview with Nier Barzilay, who I'm also having lunch with

1061
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,040
today, and Nier's certainly one of the world's experts on this topic. So we had a great discussion

1062
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:20,040
of all of the benefits of metformin. Don't think it's really disputable how big those benefits are

1063
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:25,960
in people who have diabetes. I think that is becoming very clear. And then by extension in

1064
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:32,200
people who are insulin resistant. What I think is not entirely clear, and I think is the purpose of

1065
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:39,800
what Nier is hoping to study with Taim is if you took a non-diabetic, non-insulin resistant

1066
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:47,240
individual and gave them metformin, will you enhance their longevity phenotype? And the one area that

1067
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:54,520
I'm most interested in this question is what is the impact of metformin on the ability of exercise

1068
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:58,680
to improve the phenotype? And that's something that just on a personal level, I've been experimenting

1069
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:04,760
with a lot. So doing a lot of lactate testing on myself with and without metformin and using

1070
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:10,680
lactate as a proxy for mitochondrial function. So, you know, we were talking about this a little bit

1071
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:15,640
before, but just for the listeners of what I do is take a resting lactate level. I shouldn't be using

1072
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:21,960
any more ATP than I'm using at this moment. What is my level of lactate? Then on a bicycle that

1073
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:29,800
allows me to control the wattage to the nearest watt, basically move in five or 10 watt increments

1074
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:36,360
slowly, you know, spend 10 minutes at this wattage, go up by five for 10 minutes, go up by five for 10

1075
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:41,480
minutes and keep measuring lactate levels. And you generate a performance curve, an LPC, a lactate

1076
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:48,600
performance curve. And you do this with and without metformin, you see a difference. The question is,

1077
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:54,360
does that difference matter clinically? And is it possible that metformin is actually not helping

1078
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,560
in the context of exercise? Are you seeing that in the presence of metformin if you are exercising,

1079
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:05,080
you're producing less lactate? I'm seeing more lactate in the presence of metformin. Now, again,

1080
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:13,080
this is an N of one study on myself, but it makes sense that you could, I mean, that's a plausible.

1081
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,200
How are you measuring your lactate? Using blood in the finger.

1082
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,640
Yeah. We should do metabolomics on you. I mean, with our new instrumentation, we can measure not

1083
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:26,280
just lactate, but literally. Measure everything. Hundreds of metabolites. It gives a little bit

1084
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:31,720
more of a comprehensive snapshot of all of your metabolic pathways. Could we get an IRB to do that

1085
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:38,920
easily? Let's do it. I'm all in. So we could do it. We could do an on metformin, off metformin

1086
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:45,000
snapshot because, so here's my crude thinking on this is, if metformin is inhibiting complex one,

1087
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:54,040
it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility that the body might preferentially not shuttle

1088
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:58,280
pyruvate into the mitochondria. I mean, it's still doing so to a great extent,

1089
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:03,720
but if it's disproportionately now keeping pyruvate outside and turning it into lactate,

1090
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,840
that could drive up lactate levels. The thing that surprised me the most

1091
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:14,280
is how high my resting lactate levels seem to be. I mean, I remember before I started taking metformin,

1092
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:18,760
you would barely check a resting lactate level, but it was usually below one millimolar.

1093
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:24,680
Now my resting lactate level on metformin is typically between one and two millimolar. It's

1094
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:32,520
about 2x. And I'm doing this in as painful and, but hopefully valid a way as one can do it,

1095
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:37,880
which is I'm using two separate meters, checked in duplicate on the third drop of blood. Like I'm

1096
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:42,920
trying to be as systematic as possible. Anyone listening to this who wants to do this, I just

1097
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,880
want to warn you in advance before you get started. Lactate meters are upsettingly expensive

1098
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,560
and the strips are the racket. I mean, they'll sell you the device for 300 bucks and each strip

1099
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:59,720
costs you about $5. So every time I do one of these dumb tests, which I typically do about once a week,

1100
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:05,400
it's like dinner and a movie for five people. But it'd be amazing to see what a broader sequence of

1101
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,080
metabolomics looks like to understand is there something that's happening. And by the way,

1102
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:14,360
then the next question is do that in somebody who has diabetes and see if you see an improvement

1103
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:22,280
or a reduction in performance. You measured your fasting resting lactate before you started metformin.

1104
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:28,440
Do you know if it went up after you started metformin and then it went back down again or?

1105
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:33,000
Well, so that's an interesting question. So before I started taking metformin,

1106
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,640
I would do lactate testing, but I was interested in a different question. So it's not an apples to

1107
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:42,200
apples comparison. We always had a resting lactate just because you wanted to basically calibrate

1108
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,000
the machine and make sure your machine was working. But generally when we did what was

1109
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:53,240
called this LPC, the lactate performance curve, it was mostly geared towards identifying a different

1110
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:59,720
position on the curve, which is very crudely done. But you do a series of efforts at different

1111
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:04,760
power outputs or in a swimming pool at different speeds or on a track, different running velocities.

1112
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:09,720
And you'll notice that the curve is nonlinear. So it starts like this, I'm sort of drawing,

1113
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:15,160
it goes flat, and then it starts to shoot up very quickly towards a vertical asymptote.

1114
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:21,560
That can be approximated by two linear curves. And the intersection of that curve is generally

1115
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:27,880
a person's lactate threshold. And that's different. That's usually a higher number than two millimolar.

1116
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:32,760
Let's just say to make the math easy, that usually is in about the four millimolar range.

1117
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:38,760
And it's that point where that corresponds to on the x-axis, that output is generally about the

1118
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:45,640
fastest velocity or output a person can hold for a certain type of race that we're interested in

1119
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:52,840
studying. So I have infinite numbers of those data for myself back in the days long before I took

1120
01:46:52,840 --> 01:47:00,520
metformin. But it was undeniable how low my lactate level started. So I at least have that data point.

1121
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,840
I think that's really interesting. We published a paper in PNAS a couple of years ago where we

1122
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:09,880
placed either healthy individuals or patients with mitochondrial disease on a treadmill,

1123
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:16,520
did a 10 minute exercise test and then drew their blood at rest, peak exercise and post recovery,

1124
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:22,040
just to look at the metabolome response to exercise. So of course, we get lactate. And the

1125
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:26,280
mito patients, some of whom have complex one deficiency, not because of metformin,

1126
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:31,880
but because of a genetic deficiency, they begin with a high resting lactate. And there's a parallel

1127
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:38,520
rise in their lactate that parallels what happens to a healthy human. And it stays high parallel with

1128
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,680
the healthy individual post recovery. Do you remember offhand how high their resting

1129
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:50,600
lactates were relative to the non-insulted? It was single digit millimolar. It wasn't sky high.

1130
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,080
I want to say something like two, three, four millimolar, but we should look that up just to

1131
01:47:55,080 --> 01:48:00,520
confirm. But it'd be interesting to see, this is purely science now talking to you is whether we

1132
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:05,560
could repeat that exact same study, not with genetic complex one deficiency, but with

1133
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:11,160
induced form and right exactly. Yeah. You know, a lot of people ask me about metformin and aging.

1134
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:16,200
And again, we don't do aging, real aging research in our lab. We hope to be able to impact

1135
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,600
that through some of our work. And I'm hoping that my questions are like prompting you to

1136
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:25,160
celebrate your, you've got all these amazing tools to study it, right?

1137
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:31,320
Absolutely. It really is a space that really captures anyone's imagination. But if you ask

1138
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:39,240
me how I think metformin is working, I think it's probably related to the body's homeostatic response

1139
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:47,560
to complex one inhibition. So of course, metformin hits complex one. I think that's undeniable. It

1140
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:53,800
may have other targets, but without a doubt, it hits complex one. When complex one has been

1141
01:48:53,800 --> 01:49:00,280
blocked, the body senses it. And there's a feedback loop, there's a homeostatic response. And that's

1142
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:06,760
probably what is net protective or helpful. And it may be the case that throwing a wrench in a

1143
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:14,680
complex one, it turns on 15 of those 17 inputs that you need to sort of rejuvenate not just your

1144
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:19,080
mitochondria, but other parts of your cell as well. I think there's some really interesting

1145
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,400
experiments in worms. As you probably know, there's quite a bit of worm longevity work.

1146
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:29,560
And there's early studies by my MGH colleague, Gary Rovkin, as well as Cynthia Kenyon, who

1147
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:35,000
was at UCSF and is now at Calico. They did RNAI screens to basically look for

1148
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,640
genes, which when disrupted, would lead to a longevity phenotype. And one of the

1149
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:45,320
one of the gene sets that was most associated with a longevity phenotype

1150
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:52,040
was the mitochondrial electron transport chain. At the same time, one of the gene sets that was

1151
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:58,760
associated with a drastically reduced lifespan was the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

1152
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:03,400
You can ask the question, it was a different subset of genes. Obviously, there's about 90 genes

1153
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:08,280
total required for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. So the question is,

1154
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:15,960
why do loss of some of them lead to longevity? And why do loss of others lead to a shortened lifespan?

1155
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:23,160
One hypothesis is that it's just the strength of the allele. If you, some of those RNAIs really

1156
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,520
wiped out the electron transport chain probably led to early death of the worm. But if you just

1157
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:35,880
gently block the electron transport chain with the right RNAI alleles, perhaps mimicking what

1158
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:41,720
metformin does, you do get a longevity phenotype. So a hypothesis in the field, I'm not alone,

1159
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:46,040
but I think there's others in the field that think that maybe one of the ways that metformin works is

1160
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:51,480
sure, it does block the electron transport chain, but then it comes back and causes an entire

1161
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:56,440
adaptive or a homeostatic response that is not adaptive at the whole organism level.

1162
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,000
I'm not going to put you on the spot and ask you if you think people should take metformin.

1163
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:09,480
I think the broader question is, do you think, based on what you've seen in the ETC

1164
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:17,240
models, that it's quite possible that a drug like metformin can be beneficial to some and

1165
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:23,640
harmful to others? Oh, I think without a doubt, I mean, we know that metformin is useful for type

1166
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:29,640
two diabetes. So I think it's a fact that for a subset of the population, metformin is helpful

1167
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:35,880
and beneficial. You know, in a rare subset of cases, you can actually have fatal lactic

1168
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:41,560
acidosis from drugs related to metformin, things like FEN formin. Right, which is more potent.

1169
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:47,480
That's exactly right. That gets back to this idea of the potency or the allelic strength of inhibition

1170
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:53,080
of the electron transport chain. But if you took that acute toxicity aside, I mean, I think this

1171
01:51:53,160 --> 01:52:00,040
is really the question I've now become fixated on. If you take somebody who is already maximizing

1172
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:08,120
the benefits of exercise, nutrition, sleep, these things that I think the more we look at them, the

1173
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:14,680
more powerful they are. It's one thing to say the addition of metformin offers minimal benefit or

1174
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:20,040
incremental benefit. It would be another thing if you're more in the ROS category that you alluded

1175
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:25,720
to earlier. Is this actually undoing some of the benefit? That's why I actually think that the

1176
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:30,760
experiment that you and I just discussed a few minutes ago, trying to see what the cross-product

1177
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,080
of exercise and metformin look like, I think it could be totally fascinating. Is it going to look

1178
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:40,680
like the Ron Consteady from a decade ago where there is at least one experiment out there that

1179
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:45,480
suggests that, but again, I don't know how deep they look at this. So this is a very interesting

1180
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:51,320
idea. The only drawback of this idea means I have to keep coming back to Boston. But now we're

1181
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:57,320
entering the right time of year to do it. So that's fine. So changing gears from the role of hypoxia

1182
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,360
as a therapeutic. I mean, based on what you see in the mitochondria, how do you see that as a

1183
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:08,120
potential therapeutic option? This is something that we're really excited about on the preclinical

1184
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:14,440
level. And I really want to emphasize this Peter, because oxygen follows the Goldilocks principle.

1185
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:21,960
Too little is absolutely fatal, deadly. What we're discovering is that too much, in certain

1186
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:27,240
instances, genetic backgrounds can be damaging as well. And so all of our work to date has been

1187
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:33,320
focused in preclinical models. One of the things that we are discovering in these rare mitochondrial

1188
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:39,800
disorders is that a lot of the ATP levels are actually nicely defended by glycolysis.

1189
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:45,000
And so although the textbook dogma is that a lot of these disorders are disorders of

1190
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,240
energy deficiency, under resting conditions, ATP levels are okay. But what we're observing is high

1191
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:59,000
unused oxygen. And the important question is how can we now try to interdict and somehow try to

1192
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,160
reduce the delivery of oxygen. So in least in our mouse models, we're using hypoxia chambers,

1193
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:10,840
we actually dilute the air that the mice breathe with nitrogen. We use some of the devices that

1194
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:16,920
the sports industry has created, nitrogen generators, face masks, tents, we place the mice

1195
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:23,400
in those apparatus, dilute the air with nitrogen, and then we evaluate the impact. And at least in

1196
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:28,680
some, not all, some of our mouse models of mitoid disease, the benefits are striking.

1197
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:33,320
Let's explain again, just why this is so profound, right? So going back to the model you described

1198
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:40,840
earlier, in a subset of clinical scenarios where mitochondrial function, for lack of a better word,

1199
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:48,040
is impaired, you're seeing a much higher level of oxygen returned to the lungs, despite a high

1200
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:56,040
output of energy, imputing that their mitochondria simply aren't working. That high amount of oxygen

1201
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:02,040
itself can be problematic. So you're saying, well, rather than putting you in an environment where the

1202
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:07,800
ambient oxygen concentration is 21%, we're going to lower that. How much do you lower that too, by the way,

1203
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:13,320
in these tents with the mice? At sea level, we're typically breathing about 21% oxygen, we reduce it

1204
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:19,960
down to about 11%. How is that? I don't know much about my altitudes, but that strikes me as really

1205
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:25,080
low. Is that like the top of Mount Everest low? It's not Everest, it's probably base camp. So it's

1206
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:31,000
18,000 feet. Everest is what, 7% maybe? Exactly, exactly. So we're talking about certain parts of

1207
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,040
Bolivia, we're talking about Mont Blanc. Yeah, yeah. But my brother's been to base camp and he

1208
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:41,640
did something really funny, which is something only my brother would do. He typed out a series of

1209
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:48,600
questions for himself that at sea level, the answers to which are patently obvious, 10 questions,

1210
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:54,440
and at 10,000 feet and 15,000 feet, and then at base camp is 18. And then I think when he was there,

1211
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:58,120
they ended up not being able to cross the ice walls, but they could still get to like 21,000.

1212
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:03,160
And then again, at 21,000 feet, he would video himself answering these questions. And it was

1213
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,960
actually quite interesting, not just the huffing and puffing that invariably goes into it,

1214
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:12,760
but the length of time it took him to think of the answers, which when you consider the fact that he

1215
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,560
was answering the same questions and over and over again, it should have been the opposite. It

1216
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:19,800
should have been easier and easier and easier to come up with what year did such and such happen

1217
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:25,240
or whatever. That's no joke, right? I mean, that's still for many people quite a deficit. So how did

1218
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:30,440
they improve? Earlier in the conversation, we're talking about this disease called Lee syndrome.

1219
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:36,600
So we have a mouse model of Lee syndrome, it's actually due to a loss of one of the subunits of

1220
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:43,800
complex one. So it's a recessive loss of one of the nuclear subunits of a complex one. And this mouse

1221
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:50,920
is born looking okay, it's developmentally okay. But then right around day 3035, it starts looking

1222
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:57,240
sick. And by day 55, it'll basically fulfill our hospitals euthanasia criteria, it's lost body weight,

1223
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:03,720
it's become hypothermic, it's very, very sick. It has lesions on brain MRI. Is there anything in its

1224
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:09,400
periphery that looks lesioned? Or is all of the insult to the brain? This initial cause of death

1225
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:15,560
is probably brain driven. And if you look carefully, other tissues are affected as well. So that's what

1226
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:23,160
happens at 21% oxygen, there's a very stereotyped trajectory. These uniformly fatal at about day 55

1227
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:31,160
or day 60. If these mice are grown at 11%, instead of 21%, they now survive to about a median of one

1228
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:36,120
year. Oh my god, so you've, you've restored them to half their normal lifespan. That's right. And

1229
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:41,160
what's their function level? How do they interact? Are they do they act like normal mice up until

1230
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:46,600
then? When we were doing these experiments, a very talented former graduate student, she's now

1231
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:52,200
at UCSF and our lab manager over at MGH, they're doing these experiments. They actually thought

1232
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,680
that there was a genotyping error because the mice looked so good. We actually thought that

1233
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:00,440
we'd misgenotype them. And so they look they look great, they put on body weight, they put on body

1234
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:05,080
temperature. So the results are striking. But again, I want to emphasize that this is all an

1235
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:11,080
animal model still. If you're a parent who one day has a child born with this condition, to think

1236
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:17,240
that the answer could be your child instead of living a few months could live into their 40s or

1237
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:22,360
50s by moving to a part of the world, which would be the easiest way to accomplish this. I don't

1238
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:26,440
think it would make sense to live at sea level and wear an oxygen deprivation mask for your entire

1239
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:33,720
life. But if the answer is, guess what, you're going to go be a Sherpa. I mean, that's unbelievable to

1240
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:39,160
think of. I mean, that's, I would not have predicted that at all based on what we've discussed, that

1241
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:42,920
it could be that strong in effect. Well, what's interesting is in the past, people have actually

1242
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:50,680
proposed hyperbaric oxygen as a way of rejuvenating that's what I would have stupidly suggested also,

1243
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:55,320
which is, wait a minute, we got to try harder to get that oxygen in there. Let's go hyperbaric. So

1244
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:59,880
have you done that in the mice? And did the mice die even faster under hyperbaric conditions? So we

1245
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:04,040
didn't try hyperbaric because that's higher pressure, but we just tried hyperoxid. Okay.

1246
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:11,240
So we went up to 55%, which is what is often given in the operating room as an example,

1247
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:16,680
the mice will die within a few days of exposure to 55% oxygen. So there's something about how

1248
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:22,200
to what about hyperbaric at 21%. We haven't tried, we haven't tried that yet. But just hyperoxic

1249
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:28,920
at 55%. These mice will die within a few days of exposure. Peter, within a few days of us publishing

1250
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,040
that paper, we actually got phone calls from across a country of cases where patients that

1251
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:40,680
were on the outpatient had been placed in hyperbaric chambers, and then they actually ended up,

1252
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:47,320
in some cases dying within 24 hours, or going blind in a good eye within 24 hours. And so

1253
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:52,920
I think there's some anecdotes that suggest that super high oxygen levels on a broken

1254
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,400
electron transport chain can be very damaging in humans as well. Well, this is sort of interesting,

1255
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:02,920
right? Because on the cancer front, people have talked about hyperbaric oxygen being a very potent

1256
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:10,680
tool, because the mitochondria of cancer cells are going to be defective on balance relative to

1257
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,360
the non cancer cells. That's again, outside of your wheelhouse. But how do you think about

1258
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:19,800
hyperbarics in terms of a tool to selectively target cancer mitochondria? We're super excited

1259
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:24,760
about it. And in fact, we're really not a cancer biology lab, but there is a subset, a very, very

1260
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:29,080
rare subset of tumors where we're currently exploring that idea. I think others have thought

1261
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:36,200
about trying to starve cancers of their oxygen and glucose, our idea is the exact opposite,

1262
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:41,160
maybe in certain instances, you want to flood them with oxygen. Do you have a sense of which

1263
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:47,240
cancers in humans might be more or less susceptible to that pressure? We're looking into that now,

1264
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,640
but it's going to be a rare subset of cancers where there may be some mitochondrial mutations

1265
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:55,400
to begin with. So in other words, it might be less about the given histology and more. So,

1266
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,400
you know, it's funny, I talked with Keith Flaherty recently, and this is a great example of targeted

1267
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:04,680
therapy in cancer, right? Imagine you have your tumor, you get it sequenced and you realize,

1268
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:10,280
oh, look, you have a tumor whose mitochondria are especially weak. You are a great candidate

1269
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:15,240
for hyperbaric oxygen. Person B over here, the mitochondria in your cancer cell look perfectly

1270
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:19,560
fine. Hyperbaric oxygen, if anything is not going to do, at best, it's going to do nothing. At

1271
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,480
worst, it might actually harm your other cells. We've looked a little bit into this literature. We

1272
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:28,760
have an oncologist in our laboratory that's looking in this direction and hyperbaric oxygen

1273
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:34,360
has definitely been proposed as a cancer therapy in the past, but there have been mixed signals. And

1274
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:38,520
exactly as you're saying, it may be the case that if you know how to precisely target it, maybe you'll

1275
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:44,360
see a real signal. Anything else in your work have you thinking about cancer? This is a great example.

1276
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:48,120
Is there anything else that you think about with respect to what you've learned and how it pertains

1277
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:55,000
to cancer prevention or treatment? We had a series of projects about five, six years ago or so,

1278
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,600
where some of the guys in the laboratory were looking at sort of omics data sets from large

1279
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:07,160
numbers of cancers, just asking, what are the most consistently altered metabolic pathways in cancer?

1280
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:12,920
So there's about 1500 metabolic enzymes encoded by the human genome. Which one is the most up

1281
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:19,560
regulated or down regulated across all cancers? And that pan cancer analysis, it wasn't a

1282
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:25,160
mitochondria focused analysis to be clear, but it revealed a few mitochondrial enzymes in the

1283
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:31,160
folate pathway that are the most consistently upregulated enzymes across all cancers.

1284
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:37,560
So the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It does produce ATP, but it's also a

1285
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,920
biosynthetic machine as well. So there's a few pathways within the organelle that are designed

1286
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:50,360
to produce one carbon units for growth, folates, things like that. That pathway was highly, highly

1287
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:56,840
upregulated. It gave rise to the seductive idea that maybe mitochondria are not being used for

1288
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:03,480
energy in cancer, but rather as biosynthetic machines for cancer. So that was an idea that,

1289
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:09,400
we and others stumbled upon about five, six years ago or so, but it's not an active area of research

1290
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,960
in our lab. Well, it's interesting because it's very consistent with other hypotheses that the

1291
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:23,080
Warburg effect is less a deficit of the cancer cell due to defective mitochondria or inability

1292
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:29,240
to undergo oxfoss. And maybe the Warburg effect is the result of a cancer cell wanting to get a higher

1293
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:34,040
throughput of substrate to foster growth. Obviously, Matt Vanderheiden was the author on

1294
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:39,880
a paper that talked about that in several years ago, about 2009. I hadn't heard the folate story,

1295
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:47,800
so that's kind of yet another really interesting point. Single carbon biology is pretty interesting

1296
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:52,200
stuff. That's right. That's right. And several investigators like Joshua Benowitz, David

1297
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:56,840
Sabatini, our group. I had dinner with David last night. Great. Yeah, we actually were talking about

1298
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:00,680
single carbon metabolism and the challenges of it. I went to med school with Josh, by the way.

1299
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:05,880
Oh, wow. Yeah. Oh, wow. Okay. So actually, the three of us, about five, six years ago or so,

1300
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:11,880
we all had sort of independently stumbled upon this mitochondrial pathway as being dramatically

1301
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:18,200
upregulated. Josh with metabolomics, David with RNAI, us with computation. And I think to this

1302
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:23,320
date, there's a lot of data that supports the idea that this is upregulated in cancers. Now,

1303
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:28,280
whether targeting it is going to be beneficial, that's an open question still. But without a doubt,

1304
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:34,040
this is one of the pathways that is powerfully upregulated in cancer states. On the topic of

1305
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:38,920
cancer, and we've talked about these other chronic diseases, but it doesn't really appear that there

1306
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:43,720
is a chronic disease in which the mitochondria remain normal. If you look at cancer, if you look

1307
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:47,720
at Alzheimer's disease, if you look at atherosclerosis, and if you look at type 2 diabetes,

1308
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:53,080
all of these diseases have mitochondrial signatures that differ from what we would

1309
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:57,240
consider healthy. Well, it gets back to the opening parts of the discussion where we said that if you

1310
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:03,160
take any age of tissue, it's going to be associated with dysfunctional mitochondria. And if you take

1311
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:08,680
diabetic muscle, if you take Alzheimer's brain, Parkinson's brain, you're going to see dysfunctional

1312
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:14,600
mitochondria. And this is why it gets back to, is it cause or effect? Or is it going to be some

1313
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:20,680
complex nonlinear combination of cause and effect? And this is where using that systems biology

1314
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:26,760
approach or trying to gain insights from these rare diseases may inform a subset, but not all of

1315
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:33,880
these. I actually think that for Parkinson's, the causal hypothesis is pretty compelling out of all

1316
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:39,960
of these disorders. Say more about that, because I don't know anything about Parkinson's that I

1317
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:46,360
didn't learn in medical school, which if I recall is more to do with dopamine secretion out of a part

1318
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:52,040
of the brain that the substantia nigra, is that it? Where you basically lose that. Those neurons.

1319
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:56,040
Yeah. And so the patients that maybe start out with genetically fewer of those, because there's

1320
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:01,720
a distribution of how many you get, maybe the ones most susceptible. I never thought of that as

1321
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:06,440
a problem that shows up in the mitochondria. So expand on that. Again, we have two classes of

1322
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:11,240
disorders, right? We have sort of common complex diseases and we have monogenic diseases. And the

1323
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:19,880
big question is, does the pathology we see in the rare monogenic forms bear any relevance, right,

1324
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:24,360
to the common forms of disease? It's funny. I mean, the way we're talking about it, your hands are

1325
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:28,680
showing it in a way that I think is, is representative, right? You had your one hand out over here and

1326
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:33,560
you said, look, these are the very simple monogenic diseases. Most people have never heard of them.

1327
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:38,360
They're typically quite brutal, but they kill relatively few people. On the other hand, you have,

1328
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:44,200
there's a divide, right? That's right. And it's quite discontinuous, isn't it? Well, also on this

1329
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:50,680
side, the prevalence of these monogenic mitochondrial disorders is about one in 4,000. But then as you

1330
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:55,400
cross the continuum- The prevalence is one. One in one. Yeah, exactly. And then you have these other

1331
02:06:55,400 --> 02:07:01,800
disorders like type two diabetes and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's that it's not one in one, but it's

1332
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:06,760
also not one in 4,000. So you're saying Parkinson's may be the closest example that you can think of

1333
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:12,280
that's spanning these two worlds? I think so. Okay, I want to hear more about this. Well, I think

1334
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:18,120
there's a couple of reasons. One is if you take the common form of Parkinson's disease and if you

1335
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:23,160
take some of the post-mortem material, the biopsy that, or if you take post-mortem material and you

1336
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:28,920
look, you let you see mitochondrial lesions, you'll see an increase in the mutation burden

1337
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:35,400
in the mitochondrial genome, you'll see complex one deficiency. Already we're seeing some of the

1338
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:39,880
molecular features of mitochondrial dysfunction, but perhaps even more compelling is that there

1339
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:47,640
are some toxin forms of Parkinson's. Certain types of herbicides and insecticides are actually toxic

1340
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:52,280
to complex one. So you're saying there are people who have Parkinson's, and I apologize for my

1341
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:57,240
ignorance on this, where they don't actually have a dopamine deficiency in the brain, but they have

1342
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:03,000
a Parkinson's-like phenotype purely from an insult to their mitochondria from, say, a toxin?

1343
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:08,360
Right, so in these instances what we think has happened is that because of an environmental

1344
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:14,280
pesticide or insecticide, the mitochondria has been poisoned in some of these dopaminergic

1345
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:18,440
neurons and those neurons actually die. So there is a dopamine loss ultimately. I see, I see, okay.

1346
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:25,160
But the root cause is the toxin. The mitochondria, okay. That's right, that's right. So that's toxin

1347
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:30,760
evidence where we know that a direct toxin to the mitochondria in humans can give rise to a

1348
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:39,000
Parkinsonian-like disease. In mouse models, if you give a high dose of rhododenone, it's a complex

1349
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,640
one poison. Okay. And this actually gets back to metformin. Exactly. So if you infuse into a mouse

1350
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:50,920
rhododenone, which is a very potent. More potent than fenformin. Yes, right. And there's some

1351
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:56,840
potential off-target effects as well. Like micromolar or millimolar potency? Micromolar potency.

1352
02:08:56,840 --> 02:09:02,360
It may hit other things like microtubules as well, but it definitely hits complex one of the electron

1353
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:11,480
transport chain. That's been used as a model of Parkinson's disease in rats and in mice. And so

1354
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:16,440
I think between the toxin evidence, the fact that sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease can be

1355
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:22,200
associated with complex one deficiency or mitochondrial mutations, I think helps to support

1356
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:29,720
the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction can play maybe in the causal path for Parkinson's disease.

1357
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:36,280
Are you optimistic that we are going to be able to target mitochondrial proteins

1358
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:45,400
as therapies? I mean, the more I listen to this, the less optimistic I am truthfully, just because of

1359
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:52,760
the exceptions being exceptions and not rules. I'm actually pretty wildly optimistic. Okay,

1360
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:57,880
that's great because I'm coming away like discouraged. Like there are too many moving pieces

1361
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:04,040
to be able to use a single molecule. So are you thinking of stacking molecules or tell me where

1362
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:09,400
your optimism comes from? Well, it comes from the fact that five years ago in some of these

1363
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:15,400
mouse models or cellular models, we had zero ways of alleviating mitochondrial disease in a dish or

1364
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:21,240
in a mouse. Now we have in our laboratory, we can use again in a preclinical way, we can use

1365
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:28,200
hypoxia and it actually helps to restore cellular function and longevity and health span in mouse

1366
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,000
models of my to disease. We're using other approaches that are evolutionarily inspired.

1367
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:38,520
We call these protein prostheses where we take proteins from other organisms from other

1368
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:44,120
kingdoms of life, we transplant them into human cells with mitochondrial disease, and we can

1369
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:51,080
effectively rescue the cells. And so how do you how do you transfect all the cells? Are you just

1370
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:55,320
saying that you can just you're just you're doing this ex vivo? This is all ex vivo right now, right?

1371
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:59,800
But still, it's a proof of concept that's very powerful. I mean, nowadays we have nucleic acid

1372
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:04,440
therapeutics, gene therapeutics, protein therapeutics. So give me an example of one of the protein

1373
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:09,320
prosthetics. Getting back to the earlier part of the conversation, we spoke about the fact that

1374
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:15,880
the electron transport chain was probably one of the earliest features of the early eukaryotes,

1375
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:21,320
probably resembling the electron transport chain of bacteria that can do oxidative phosphorylation.

1376
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:27,640
But then during reductive evolution, certain organisms lost parts of their electron transport

1377
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:33,400
chain. Now there are certain organisms that have lost their entire electron transport chain. And we

1378
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:38,200
think that one of the ways that they're able to survive is that they gained a new protein

1379
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:42,520
that basically complements part of the activity of the electron transport chain.

1380
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:47,800
So we've identified some of those proteins. If we place those proteins in a human cell,

1381
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:53,320
you can poison the mitochondria any of five different ways. The cell will still proliferate

1382
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:59,400
because it has that protein that evolutionarily, we believe, allowed that organism to lose its

1383
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:04,280
etc to begin with. Does that make sense? Yeah, it just seems too good to be true.

1384
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:10,120
Well, this is why we call it a prosthesis. It's not 100% fix of the solution. What it does is

1385
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:15,800
it probably corrects part of the redox imbalance in the electron transport chain, but not the full

1386
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:23,400
proton pumping capabilities. Yeah, so play this forward. You now could argue another treatment

1387
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:30,680
for type 2 diabetes is in addition to making the changes we're going to make, right? Because I still

1388
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:36,680
believe deep down that you can cure type 2 diabetes with corrective exercise and nutrition

1389
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:42,200
and sleep. I think if you get those three things fully optimized, type 2 diabetes goes away with

1390
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:46,360
the exception of the late stage cases where the pancreas no longer works. But what if you could

1391
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:51,640
add another layer to that, which is, oh, by the way, here's some mitochondrial prostheses.

1392
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:55,400
That's exactly right. It's not going to fix all of the functions in electron transport.

1393
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:59,160
But it can become additive to other things, right? That's right. That's right. That's one of

1394
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:03,400
the ideas that we're exploring right now. Can we actually in the context of things like fatty

1395
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:09,320
liver and diabetes, can we use some of these mitochondrial protein prostheses to either

1396
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:15,080
augment or bypass some of the broken functions of mitochondria to restore function?

1397
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,920
I don't know if you've ever thought of this because the idea just popped into my head when

1398
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:25,720
you said mitochondrial protein prostheses. Have you ever thought just in sort of random sci-fi

1399
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,320
like thinking of the opposite, which is performance enhancing prostheses for

1400
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:34,440
mitochondria? I mean, if you think about the efforts that athletes can go to to enhance

1401
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:40,600
aerobic performance, the most obvious of these, of course, is blood doping and use of EPO,

1402
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:47,640
which simply deliver more oxygen to the system. But in 30 years, will people be talking about

1403
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:53,080
genetic cheating where mitochondrial performance and function has been enhanced?

1404
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:59,320
Well, it's funny because the sports industry is so often, I mean, the sort of underground illicit

1405
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:04,600
sports world of doping often is so ahead of the medical world. It's actually pretty amazing.

1406
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,560
Yeah, it really is.

1407
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:11,080
I mean, one of the compounds, it's like EPO, it's called FG4592. It's a small molecule that

1408
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:16,200
blocks one of the prolyl hydroxylases. This tricks the system into thinking that it's hypoxic and you

1409
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:23,320
end up producing more EPO. That drug was in clinical trials. And before the drug was even approved,

1410
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:30,520
it was being used by cyclists, which is already amazing. But what's also even more amazing is that

1411
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:37,240
the anti-doping agency knew to look for drugs that were not yet even approved by the FDA in some of

1412
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:42,920
these athletes. And so it's like this red queen where everyone has to stay ahead of everybody else.

1413
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:49,640
It's an arms race. Do you think like theoretically there are ways to enhance performance through,

1414
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:55,320
again, I'm not a huge advocate on genetic engineering. I still think there's so much sci-fi

1415
02:14:55,320 --> 02:15:00,440
and the limitations of actually getting a virus that could be taken up your victim's way. But

1416
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:05,880
putting that aside for a moment, could you engineer a better mitochondria? Could one,

1417
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:09,880
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot, but could one engineer an even better mitochondria?

1418
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:15,160
How much waste is in the system? It's funny, I haven't, if I ever did this exercise, it's so

1419
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:20,440
long ago that I don't recall. But from an engineering perspective, how much room for improvement is there?

1420
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,720
I think it's going to take a while before things like that are possible. And I gather from this

1421
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:32,680
conversation that you, like me, like automobiles. And so if you have an engine, the way to enhance

1422
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:39,240
it is to turbo charge it. But turbo charging it is not taking one spark plug out and replacing it

1423
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:43,160
with another spark plug. No, it's changing the way air flows through it and is recycled.

1424
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:48,680
So you have like 17 different things. You have a turbo charger, you put it on top, but there's

1425
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:54,040
like 17 other things that you have to alter so that the entire system connects up. You have

1426
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:59,480
impedance matching, you have airflow matching, so that in the end you have a better performing

1427
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:05,480
automobile. I think something analogous applies to mitochondria. It's not going to be just one

1428
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:10,200
thing that you can turn on. If you want to try to, the system is already pretty optimized, right?

1429
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:14,840
And so if you just change one thing, it's probably not going to, you can break it.

1430
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:18,520
Yeah, you can break it with one thing, but it's hard to enhance with one thing.

1431
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:24,840
That's actually a great way to just think about biology in general. It's pretty easy to break it

1432
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:32,680
at a single point. Cyanide, I think the most extreme example, right? Detrototoxin, so easy

1433
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:38,040
to kill and break at a single molecule, which comes back to a point I made earlier.

1434
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:42,440
It's mind boggling when something like rapamycin works.

1435
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:46,840
Right. Again, I don't, I mean, you had dinner with David last night, so he's clearly one of

1436
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:52,120
the world's authorities on rapamycin and its function, but at least if we go to metformin,

1437
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:58,920
the only way that I can conceive that it could have this total body impact is if it's doing

1438
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:04,840
something that then causes the entire system to respond. Even when we talk about statins,

1439
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:10,360
every medical student in the country knows that statins are life saving. Every single

1440
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:15,720
medical student in the country knows that statins hit HMG-CoA reductase. But why is it life saving?

1441
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:21,320
Is that enough? Right. Is there other things that it's doing that are also important beyond

1442
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:27,800
the reduction of LDL? The way that statins work, my understanding is that sure, statins directly

1443
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:32,760
target HMG-CoA reductase, but then what ends up happening is because you're not producing so

1444
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:38,600
much sterols, you turn on an entire SREBP transcriptional program.

1445
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:43,160
And you bring more receptors to the surface of the liver. That's right. More of the statin

1446
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:47,240
efficacy is due to the LDL clearance than the reduction of cholesterol synthesis.

1447
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:51,560
That's exactly right. But there may even be benefits beyond that is my point. In some argue,

1448
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:57,480
there are actually a whole camp of LDL denialists who can't deny the efficacy of the drug,

1449
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:04,040
and so the hypothesis is, well, all of the statin benefit doesn't come through the LDL reduction

1450
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:08,280
through the mechanism you described. The unintended consequence is the wrong way of saying it,

1451
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:13,320
but the non-obvious consequence, but it could be some of the anti-inflammatory benefits that come

1452
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:18,920
from it or the endothelial protective benefits. But the point is that there's an entire response

1453
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:26,200
to hitting HMG-CoA reductase, and a consequence of that program is that you have more sterile

1454
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:30,840
production. So in the end, the amount of cholesterol that you're producing is kind of

1455
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:35,400
balanced, right? You've inhibited it, but you've turned on more of the enzymes, so it's comparable,

1456
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:41,000
but you've turned on these other 17 switches as well at the same time, one of which is the LDL

1457
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,800
receptor, which helps to clear LDL levels. There may be other things as well that are turned on

1458
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:52,520
that are net beneficial. So I think physiological systems are so complicated, trying to identify all

1459
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:57,560
17 of those things and turning them on at the same time in general, I think is going to be hard

1460
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:02,440
even in the next 30 years, but it may be the case that some of the interventions are, you know,

1461
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:06,920
what people refer to. Do you think of this as when you, like, let's look at the three examples you've

1462
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:14,280
just used. Estatin, metformin, and rapamycin. None of those are, I mean, they're synthesized today,

1463
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:19,800
but they are all derivatives of naturally occurring compounds. I'm sitting here as you're

1464
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:27,080
telling this story, trying to think of examples of purely synthesized de novo molecules that have

1465
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:31,640
such benefit, and I'm, there may be examples, but it seems less obvious. Do you think it's a

1466
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:38,440
coincidence that some of the most potent agents that we have in medicine, which by definition,

1467
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:44,600
it seems, are the ones that have to do multi-pronged inputs tend to come from naturally

1468
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:48,920
occurring substances? Does that just speak to our co-evolution with these things?

1469
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:54,680
No, absolutely. I think there's been this arms race, right? The bacteria are fighting these fungi,

1470
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:59,000
and the fungi are fighting these plants, and so there's all sorts of small molecules that are

1471
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:06,280
designed to throw a wrenches into other mitochondria or translational programs or nutrient sensing

1472
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:14,280
programs. So natural products are remarkable chemistries, and they've evolved over hundreds

1473
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:21,160
of millions of years to target physiological systems, and so I'm a huge fan of natural products

1474
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:27,480
and the biology that they expose. This is so interesting. We'll close with a question that's

1475
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:33,560
admittedly kind of a tough question, so I apologize for putting you on the spot, and no qualms if you

1476
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:39,320
can't come up with a good or great answer, but when you think about the world you want to explore

1477
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:44,440
here with the questions that you want to ask. So much of what happens even at the level that

1478
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:50,280
you're at is still constrained by resources. Have you ever had the thought experiment or the sort

1479
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:55,560
of fantasy of what if you were in a totally resource unconstrained world? So you never had

1480
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:59,880
to apply for another grant. In fact, you were given some lump sum of money that was beyond what you

1481
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:04,760
could imagine, and even just from an IRB standpoint, there was nothing that stood in your way of doing

1482
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:10,200
kind of something that was still ethical, but maybe today would be logistically too challenging.

1483
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,320
Do you have a sense of what questions you would want to probe, but specifically what experiment

1484
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:21,240
or set of experiments you would do in this dream state? It's a tough question. It sounds like you're

1485
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:29,960
basically asking me not to be limited by anything except my own imagination, and I think so often in

1486
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:37,400
biomedical research that is what limits us, but it's a great question Peter. One experiment that

1487
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:42,840
would be kind of a fun experiment to try is really motivated by our recent work on oxygen.

1488
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:50,120
So what we've observed is that at least in preclinical models when you have severe

1489
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:58,120
mitochondrial decline, breathing thinner air appears to be beneficial. Now how about in

1490
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:04,200
the common form of aging when there's a subtle decline in mitochondrial activity?

1491
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:12,360
Is there excess unused oxygen and will breathing thinner air be beneficial?

1492
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:20,200
And given that I'm not resource limited, I mean wouldn't it be cool if we could construct a Ritz-Carlton

1493
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:29,560
hotel or condominium at 16,000 feet. That's extremely comfortable and perhaps another Ritz-Carlton

1494
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:37,720
that looks identical at the plains, and we could take a very large cohort, not five, not 10, but

1495
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:44,120
thousands of people that live at either the plains or at the high altitude for many, many months,

1496
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:51,640
and we try to evaluate whether there are any biomarkers of aging age-associated disorders

1497
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:58,680
that actually improve under thin air. Maybe they become worse under thin air, but it would be

1498
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:04,440
something like a crossover experiment that would allow us to test the idea that thin air may be

1499
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:12,040
beneficial for chronic diseases. I love that idea. That is elegant because one, you could do that. You

1500
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:16,600
answer the question, right, which is in a resource unconstrained world, like that's tens of millions

1501
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:20,200
of dollars would allow you to do that. Call it, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars could do

1502
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:26,440
that longitudinally, and your intervention is elegant in that it is, it's going to touch lots

1503
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:33,000
of things. That's interesting. So 16,000 feet. So following up on that, have you done or contemplated

1504
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:40,200
doing the less beautiful version of that in mice where, or I'm sort of disdainful of mice,

1505
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:46,920
but maybe rats or something that's less inbred where you have models of type 2 diabetes,

1506
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:50,760
but they're genetically born with normal mitochondria. Has that experiment been done?

1507
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:56,680
We're doing those types of experiments now in, of course, our focus is on some of these rare

1508
02:23:56,680 --> 02:24:00,840
genetic mitochondrial diseases, but we're going into some of these other conditions,

1509
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:05,800
more common conditions that are also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. So those are

1510
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:11,160
currently ongoing. When we get back to that dream experiment, what is interesting, Peter, is

1511
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:15,720
experiments like that have actually taken place in humans and they can be

1512
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:17,000
They're natural experiments.

1513
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:21,800
And one of the experiments, there's this one paper from the early 1970s

1514
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:29,400
that was published by the Indian Army. It was the Indian Army reporting on the health outcomes of

1515
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:36,520
a huge number of their troops who India has historically had border disputes with China.

1516
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:43,320
I think it was in the 1960s, India deployed more than 100,000 troops on the Indochina border.

1517
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:50,360
And don't quote me on the numbers, but about 25,000 of these people were at extremely high

1518
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:56,360
altitude and another 100,000 or so were at the plains. They were there for about five to seven

1519
02:24:56,360 --> 02:25:02,520
years or so. And of course, the food that they ate, the temperature, the activity, all of these

1520
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:07,000
were different between low and high altitudes. But one of the variables that was different was

1521
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:13,160
oxygen. And after, I think it was seven years, the Indian Army actually wrote this paper. It's only

1522
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:20,440
been cited a few, like maybe 20 times or so. They reported the long term health consequences. And

1523
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:27,480
what they showed is that death from things like infections were much higher acutely upon going to

1524
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:35,000
high altitude. But if you look at chronic diseases like incidence of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular

1525
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:42,920
disease, they were much reduced in the high altitude arm. Even after they returned to the plains? I

1526
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:47,080
think for only as long as they stayed at the only only as long as they stayed in the altitude. I

1527
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:52,840
don't think they had long term follow up actually. But it's this type of data that actually makes me

1528
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:59,480
wonder whether what we're observing in some of these rare forms of mitral dysfunction and the

1529
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:06,200
interaction of mitochondrial oxygen, perhaps some of it could bear relevance to more common conditions

1530
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:12,600
as well. Super interesting. That can keep going on, but I've been generous with your time, especially

1531
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:17,320
to a total stranger. This is really helpful. I want to thank you for the work you're doing. And

1532
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:22,120
I want to thank you for taking the time to explain it to me and to a few people listening.

1533
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,880
Thank you so much. This has been a lot of fun for me.
