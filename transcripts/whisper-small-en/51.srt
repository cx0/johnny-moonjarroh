00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,720
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,320
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest today is Professor

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,680
Robert Sapolsky. And many of you may recognize that name because Robert has written some incredible

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,320
books, probably the one that you would recognize the most is Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, A Guide

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,840
to Stress, Stress-related Diseases and Coping. But he's also the author of A Primates Memoir,

49
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,800
which grew out of work that he spent in his early years in Africa. And he spent nearly 30 years in

50
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Africa, four months at a time, The Trouble with Testosterone and other Essays on the Biology of

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,720
the Human Predicament. And his most recent book, Behave, The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst.

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,000
This is a book that Robert spent nearly four years researching and writing. And the book is almost 800

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,080
pages long. This is a treatise on the topic of human biology and behavior. Robert is a professor

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,640
of biological sciences at Stanford, where he's been, I believe, since he completed his PhD and

55
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,520
his postdoc, which he did back on the East Coast. He spent a lot of time in Kenya right after

56
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,240
college. He went to Kenya, then Uganda, where he studied for the next 30 years, the behavior of

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,680
baboons and other primates. He is a MacArthur Fellow. In 1987, he was awarded the fellowship,

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,760
which many of you may recognize by its other name, the Genius Grant. He is very

59
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,560
modest and soft spoken about this and really doesn't like to be reminded of that. But Robert

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,840
is a really impressive guy. Today is actually the first time we really met in person. I had seen him

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,160
speak about a year and a half ago. And after the talk, you know, introduced myself and we spoke

62
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,200
very briefly. But I remember during his talk thinking to myself, this is the first time I'm

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
really being convinced at the true pathology of stress. I think I had certainly appreciated the

64
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,000
benefits of meditation before when it came to being less miserable. But I think it was really

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,960
Robert's work. And in particular, that presentation on that day that got me to really start to think

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,480
about the molecular and physiologic harm of hypercorticillemia. So we talk a great deal about

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,720
that in this discussion. But we also talk about things that go far outside of that we talk about

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,520
the role of depression, we talk about the impact of stress on the developing brain, and also in the

69
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,920
brain later in life, and even some of the areas where the relationship between stress and disease

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,760
is not as well understood. And that clearly came across in our discussion of cancer. Overall,

71
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,840
I found this discussion riveting, and I could have continued this discussion for many hours

72
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,760
longer. On a personal level, I was also, you know, really kind of touched by the way he spoke about

73
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,040
this sort of change in heart he had around the relentless ambition and pursuit and how over the

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,320
past few years, he's really reevaluated that. And that comes across at the end when we sort of get

75
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,560
into more of a philosophical discussion about what one would do different given what he knows today.

76
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,360
It was an honor to spend so much time with Robert today discussing this. And I appreciated the

77
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,320
confidence he had in basically sight unseen, sitting down with a stranger to have this

78
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,320
discussion. So I hope you'll enjoy this discussion with Robert half as much as I do.

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,560
Robert, thank you so much for making the time to meet with me today on a lovely,

80
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,360
rainy San Francisco afternoon. Sure. Glad to be indoors here. As I was saying earlier,

81
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,680
we had met once before really briefly, so briefly that you would not remember it. And of course,

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,440
only I would. Summer of 17, I believe you were giving a talk in Sun Valley and I was there.

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,760
And you gave a talk on stress. Now it was to a lay audience. So you didn't really get to go

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,640
into the depth. And I remember sitting in the audience thinking, Oh, you know, a lot of what

85
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,080
he's saying is really starting to make sense to me. And I can't wait to get a little deeper into

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,680
this stuff. Because truthfully, and I'm just going to open with sort of my mea culpa, you've always

87
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,800
heard people say stress kills. And I got to be honest with you. I always thought that was sort

88
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,560
of nonsense. I was like, come on, what do you mean stress kills? Stress is good. It builds resilience,

89
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,080
what is the mechanism by which stress, quote unquote, kills? But of course, once you start to

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,000
understand the endocrine system, and of course, training as a surgeon and not an endocrinologist,

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,280
I sort of missed out on that. You start to see it. And in that talk, you admittedly at a sort of

92
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,480
high level for the audience really walked through the danger of hypercordicillemia. And so in many

93
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,040
ways, I guess, you know, a year and a half ago was really when I became a fan of your work, and then

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,520
kind of said, you know what, there is something to this. So anyway, with that, I appreciate you taking

95
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,840
this time. Sure. And just to sort of back off a bit from that, I actually don't think stress kills

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,800
you outright very often. But it sure makes other things that kill you more effective at doing it.

97
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Maybe it's semantic, but you're right. Stress can amplify and accelerate the diseases of aging.

98
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,960
You grew up in New York, right? If I recall, you grew up in Brooklyn or in?

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,600
Brooklyn.

100
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,680
I remember reading that after college, you actually went straight off to Kenya first, is that right?

101
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Yeah.

102
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
What prompted that?

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Well, I was one of those, I've sort of spent my career oscillating between being a lab neuroscientist,

104
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,480
studying the effects of cortisol on the brain, punchline to decades of work is,

105
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,440
you don't want to have a whole lot of it marinating inside your head.

106
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,480
But also for more than 30 years, I've alternated spending my summers studying a population of wild

107
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,160
baboons in a national park in East Africa. And it's the same animals I go back to each year.

108
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,240
These are animals like in dart and nest the ties, get blood, do whole workups on them.

109
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,640
And essentially asking among them, what does your social rank have to do with patterns of stress

110
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,320
related disease? What does your personality, what does your patterns of social affiliation?

111
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,560
So it's been sort of a counterbalance to the lab where, you know, we've been sticking artificial

112
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,120
genes into neurons and fairly reductive stuff like that. So I was actually about eight years old when

113
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,520
I decided I wanted to be a primatologist. So I was kind of planning on that for a long time and

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,240
lucked out. I spent all of college brown nosing the right person who shipped me off to a field

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,920
site right after graduation. And I wound up sort of inheriting that site. And those have been my

116
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,360
baboons ever since. Did you spend the whole time in Kenya? I remember reading that you also were in

117
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,240
Uganda and obviously they're, I think if my geography is correct, they're neighbors. So

118
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,240
that's a pretty easy switch. Where do the actual baboons, like what is their scope of their

119
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,280
residence? How broadly? Oh, they're spread actually all over Africa. They're one of the

120
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,120
most ubiquitous primates for a lot of the same reasons that we are, which is they'll eat anything.

121
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,920
They're carnivores, but they're also herbivores. They're omnivores. They scavenge dead stuff. They eat

122
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,600
insects. They'll eat most anything so they can fill a lot of niches. So they're scattered

123
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,520
everywhere. But my main work over the years has been this one troop in the Serengeti in

124
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Southwest Kenya. You know, for about 25 years I camped under the same tree. So it's really,

125
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,440
has been a continuity with the same population of animals. What is their natural predator besides

126
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,240
man? Leopards, lions, hyenas. Nonetheless, if you were a male baboon, the most likely thing to kill

127
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,320
you violently is another male. Another male. Yeah, exactly. Sort of like humans. Yes, indeed. Did you

128
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:36,200
say it's every summer or every other summer? Well, it was initially for about 25 straight summers and

129
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,320
then parenthood and all those complications came in. So wound up being every other summer and then

130
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,240
our kids were old enough to go with us one summer. But unfortunately the fieldwork ended about eight

131
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,320
years ago. So why is that? My Kenyan field assistant of 30 years, we started together when

132
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,280
we were 20. He died of AIDS, political issues there, some game park issues that made it harder

133
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,840
and harder to sort of get research done and kind of that middle-aged realization that I could find

134
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,960
some new game park or new country or something and start all over. But it was kind of time to pack

135
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,960
it in instead. So after you did your PhD, which he did it in New York, right? Yeah, Rockefeller

136
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,560
University. Did you come straight out to Stanford for a postdoc or? Postdoc at the Salk Institute

137
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:35,000
down in San Diego, spent a couple of years there. If people are sort of familiar with the hypothalamic

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,600
hormone that runs the stress response or hormone CRH, CRF, corticotropin releasing hormone. I went

139
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,760
and post-talked with this guy, Wiley Vale, who had discovered it in like two years before. So

140
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,960
that was a pretty exciting time to be there. So spent a couple of years there.

141
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,760
Stanford hired me and I've been there for 31 years since. That's kind of amazing. I keep coming

142
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,760
back to people at Stanford that would have been there when I was there in medical school, but

143
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,240
if it wasn't in the medical school, like you just weren't paying as close attention. And I honestly

144
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,680
don't recall if you ever gave us a lecture in med school. Do you remember giving lectures in

145
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,920
med school 20 plus years ago? I did. Almost certainly the students were paying as little

146
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,280
attention as I was. So that's true. I was about to say it certainly seems like something we should

147
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,160
have been learning in medical school. And yet I feel ashamed to say, I don't know if I recall it.

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,680
It was not much of an emphasis and was sort of snuck in embarrassingly.

149
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,040
Like a lunchtime seminar or something. Yeah, exactly. So that. Thrive them with free food.

150
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,760
Yes. And even still only about five people would stay past the cookies.

151
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,680
That's a much bigger issue we can come to. So you wrote a book,

152
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,360
gosh, how many years ago was Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcer? Is that 20 years ago?

153
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,960
Let's see. First edition was 94. It's gone through three editions now. Most recent one was 2004. So

154
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,560
at some point I got to do another one. As we talk about that, and you've written a book more

155
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,000
recently that I want to talk about as well. Let's back up and explain something you touched on a

156
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,040
second ago, which is sort of the physiology of a stress response. So walk us through the

157
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,720
relationship between the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the adrenal glands.

158
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,400
So when we're under stress levels of 11D different hormones change in our body, most of them are

159
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,520
relatively minor players. The two workhorses overwhelmingly, first one famously adrenaline,

160
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,400
British term epinephrine, sort of North American term output from the sympathetic nervous system.

161
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,480
It's on the scene in your bloodstream within one, two seconds or so after all hell breaks loose.

162
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,040
And I just want to explain what sympathetic means to the listener. We've had this discussion before.

163
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,240
It's not to say it's a nervous system that is kind. It just means it's one of the two branches

164
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,360
of these so-called autonomic or immediate, not under your conscious control, right?

165
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,720
So the fight or flight. Exactly. And the other half being parasympathetic, sympathetic fight

166
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,520
or flight or hell breaking loose alarms going off parasympathetic, calm vegetative function.

167
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,520
So not only do you turn on the sympathetic during stress, you very emphatically turn off

168
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,920
the parasympathetic second main workhorse, which it's already been alluded to the steroid hormone

169
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,400
class of hormones called glucocorticoids, human version, cortisol, also known as hydrocortisone,

170
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,480
rat version, corticosterone, synthetic versions, prednisone, dexamethasone and such.

171
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,000
These come out of the adrenal glands. Your brain notes something stressful is happening within

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,200
two seconds. Your hypothalamus is secreting that CRH, which within about 10 seconds is getting your

173
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,520
pituitary to release a hormone called ACTH, which within about 30 seconds has gotten to your

174
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,600
adrenals and you are slowly starting the glucocorticoid component of your stress response.

175
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,760
And in lots of ways, the adrenaline, the sympathetic response, the glucocorticoid response,

176
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,600
they work on hand in hand, they synergize. You want a metaphor adrenaline in two seconds is

177
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,200
handing guns out of the gun locker to whatever is going to defend you. Leucocorticoids are

178
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,480
building the aircraft carriers that a year from now are going to be essential. It does some of the

179
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,440
slower components of the stress response, stretching out over minutes to hours.

180
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,000
Because I was just about to ask you, and I think your question basically answers it, was why would

181
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,080
we have evolved these two separate systems? One can only speculate on such things, but it's basically

182
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,000
that certainly norepinephrine, epinephrine, they stick around for such a short period of time. I

183
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,160
mean, we don't even measure these things clinically. I can't poke your arm and measure your

184
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,680
norepinephrine or epinephrine level. The best I can do is collect its metabolites in your urine

185
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,600
for evidence that it's been around. So I guess we have this hormone or pair of hormones that

186
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,080
are on the scene in seconds, gone in seconds and really deal with the, I guess from an evolutionary

187
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,520
perspective, when the tiger is there, this is what gets you to jump into the tree. Is it doing much

188
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,840
beyond that? And is there some evidence of chronic low levels of those hormones, which come out of a

189
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,960
totally different part of the adrenal gland? I mean, that's the other thing that's sort of interesting

190
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,360
is you have two separate pieces, the cortex, the medulla, that secrete these hormones separately.

191
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,280
And embryologically, they're two very different tissues. They start off separately. It could have

192
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,560
just as randomly wound up that your adrenaline comes from your big toe and glucorticoids from

193
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:48,040
your thumbs. Why they wound up being in the same organ is in fact, somewhat just I think serendipitous.

194
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,560
Probably because you're more likely to have your toes and fingers lopped off and we wouldn't want

195
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,880
to have an incidental adrenal ectomy happening. You're right. That's certainly why they didn't

196
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,360
wind up out there in the extremities. What about in lower species? Is one of these considered more

197
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,680
primitive? Is the epinephrine arm something that began earlier and the cortisol arm more recent?

198
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,000
Yep. Nonetheless, the cortisol arm is just ancient. When you get stressed and you're secreting

199
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,360
glucorticoids, it's basically the exact same class of molecules as if you were a fish or bird or

200
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,640
reptile. Nonetheless, it's a very ancient wiring and that's part of what winds up getting us in

201
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,960
trouble. It's a system that's been serving vertebrates, doing a lot of help for them for

202
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,640
an awful long time. It's been a very recent modification to instead secrete them in response

203
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,840
to thinking about taxes. This basic dichotomy between the very human domains where we activate

204
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:52,440
the stress response and the more typical domains of animals. If you and I were sitting here 10,000

205
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,280
years ago, I can think of lots of things that we would want an adrenaline response for. The

206
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,160
tiger jumps out of the thing, whatever. What are some of the things that would result in that

207
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,880
cortisol response? Because you described it as building the aircraft carrier. Well, gosh,

208
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,440
if the tiger's there, either I'm dead or I'm not, but I don't need a stress response a day from now

209
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,280
or the next day. What is it that cortisol was doing 10,000 years ago that was serving our

210
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,760
interests? I want to certainly talk about what it's not doing today. When you look at what it

211
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,040
does, it actually makes perfect sense as long as you're being stressed like a normal mammal,

212
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,920
running for your life, running after a meal where if you don't catch something,

213
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:39,080
you're going to be dead by tomorrow, a short term physical crisis. The first five seconds of doing

214
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,040
that, which epinephrine is critical for, that's great. If we're heading into a couple of minutes

215
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,520
of evading a predator, being vigilant, thinking there might be, if you were getting into the realm

216
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,440
of a couple of minutes worth of a stress response, cortisol related glucorticoid hormones are

217
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,760
absolutely essential. So the glucose that's coming rushing out of your liver,

218
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,200
pretty important in that situation. Exactly. So it takes you about one second to decide you're

219
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,440
going to use your thigh muscles and run like mad. You need energy for them. And the main thing

220
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:21,560
glucorticoids are doing in the metabolic realm is glucocorticoids. They're increasing glucose

221
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,360
levels in your bloodstream. They're going to storage sites throughout your body, your liver,

222
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,280
your muscle and breaking stuff. What they do is they go to the bank, they empty out your savings

223
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,800
accounts and turn it into cash, glucose in the bloodstream to hand to whichever muscles are going

224
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,080
to save your neck. What they also do makes perfect sense whether you were running for your life or

225
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,280
running for a meal, which is they increase cardiovascular tone. In epinephrine is doing

226
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,040
the first five seconds of it by 30 seconds in glucocorticoids, you're bolstering it as well.

227
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,000
And it's that same logic. You're running like crazy. You want to deliver that glucose to your

228
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,440
thigh muscles as quickly as possible. You increase your heart rate, you increase your breathing rate,

229
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,840
your blood pressure, you alter your vasculature. So you're preferentially shunting to the exercising

230
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,880
muscle. So that makes perfect sense. Also, it turns out some of the most interesting stuff

231
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,840
glucocorticoids do in those circumstances is basically run a triage program. They shut down

232
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,920
everything that's not essential, not essential to surviving the next five minutes of this massive

233
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,040
physical challenge. So digestion would be a measure. Exactly. You got better things to do

234
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,840
than digest breakfast when you're trying to avoid being somebody's lunch, and you're sure not going

235
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,600
to get any metabolic benefits of digestion during this five minutes. It's slow, expensive,

236
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,440
the energy you're getting, you're getting from your liver, you're getting from your fat cells.

237
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,640
It shuts down growth. Obvious logic there, you know, grow antlers tomorrow if you're still

238
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,560
around to a bother right now, shuts off reproduction. Same logic there. It shuts off

239
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,480
all the long-term building projects and just focuses your energies on what's immediately there.

240
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,440
And this makes perfect sense if you are running for your life, running after a meal, and all you

241
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,440
need to do is look at a couple of diseases where people don't turn on the endocrine stress response.

242
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,760
Addison's disease, Schi-Dryger's syndrome, whatever. These are not diseases where somebody

243
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,480
who now is more at risk for adult onset diabetes eight months from now. These are diseases where

244
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,280
somebody goes running after their commuter bus and they drop dead from hypoglycemic shock.

245
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,800
JFK had this. Didn't JFK have Addison's? He had Addison's and that greatly constrained

246
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,960
the famed pictures of all those Kennedys playing touch football out and, you know,

247
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,760
Martha's Vineyard or stuff were mostly for the benefit of the photographers.

248
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,440
How did he survive World War II? Because he had done some pretty heroic things in that war.

249
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,040
Although I've seen, it's hard to tell if it's snarky revisionism as to how much that was public

250
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,320
relations stuff afterward sort of orchestrated. But just to get through basic training even

251
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,800
strikes me as an accomplishment because most people, I guess, who don't have a medical background

252
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:23,560
wouldn't appreciate this, but the tan that seemed to be eternally on JFK is the result of the

253
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,000
Addison's disease because the hormone you alluded to earlier that is released by the pituitary,

254
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,240
ACTH, in someone who's not making cortisol is going to be very, very high. And ACTH stimulates

255
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,480
the pigment producing cells in the skin. And that's what would give someone with Addison's

256
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,600
disease darker skin. The fascinating thing with Kennedy is if it were this situation now,

257
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,000
presumably his doctors would be on the air somewhere 24 seven. There's remarkably little

258
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,080
known about when his onset was, what the course of it was, how severe it was. So it's not quite clear.

259
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,400
But what little is known is it had a hell of an impact on his functioning. You really do need a

260
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,600
hormone if you like glucorticoids, if you were going to be physically activated in a moment of

261
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,400
crisis. This is sort of the amazing thing with hormones like insulin and cortisol. I'm always

262
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,560
impressed by how tight the U shape is on those curves. Thyroid hormone would be another example,

263
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,160
certainly less so with something like testosterone. You have just a much wider range that you can

264
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,160
function in. And the benefit is largely monotonically increasing. Sometimes if my patients

265
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,760
will tolerate me going on and on about this, I love to draw the pictures of which of these hormones

266
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,760
can you, you know, but to me, cortisol probably, if you thought of it as a drug, it has the

267
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,800
narrowest therapeutic index to your point. Too much of it will kill you eventually and make you

268
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,400
miserable as hell on the way. And too little of it will kill you quite quickly.

269
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,080
And what's most interesting about it is, okay, so there's an optimal level among other ways of

270
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,400
translating that. That means we don't hate stress. We hate the wrong amount of stress. When it's the

271
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,320
right amount, we love it. We pay money to be stressed, to get on a roller coaster, to go to

272
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,560
a scary movie. When it's the right amount, when it's the optimal amount, we call it stimulation.

273
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,440
Okay, so exactly as you say, it's a narrow range. So that's a tough biological problem.

274
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Understanding a hormonal system that's pretty damn essential and where an awful lot of the

275
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,600
time you're walking on a knife edge where either side is bad news, too much or too little. But when

276
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,000
it comes to glucorticoids and what counts as good stress and stimulation, there's the added factor

277
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,480
that there's incredible individual variation as to what counts as the optimal level in between.

278
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,720
And one person's like hair-raising Audubon Society walk one Saturday morning looking for birds,

279
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,360
while the other person goes and signs up to be a mercenary in Yemen because that's when they feel

280
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,280
alive and awake and all of that. Not only that it's a narrow range, but we differ so much as to

281
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,640
what each person's optimum is. Now I want to make sure I understand that point, Robert. And this is

282
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:23,240
probably overly simplistic, so feel free to correct this. One of it would be the external

283
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,120
scenario that is being perceived. And I can see definitely how two people can have vastly

284
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,480
different views on that. I mean, it's the reason someone can voluntarily go and be a Navy SEAL

285
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,800
and someone can say, I feel much better not doing that, right? There's clearly a different appetite

286
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:48,440
and or capacity for distress. Is that what you're referring to or are you also referring to

287
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:55,720
you and I could be sitting here and have different levels of physiologic benefit and harm at the same

288
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,400
level of cortisol? Both. I see. Absolutely. So I mean, the former, I think most people would

289
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,560
acknowledge the latter is pretty new, right? I mean, I shouldn't say pretty new. That's not intuitive

290
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,720
to me. Because there's centuries of endocrinology saying what's the most important thing about

291
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,240
hormones? How much of the stuff there is in your bloodstream? What the levels are? And if you and I

292
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,600
are sitting here with the same circulating levels of whatever centuries of dogma was, that will

293
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,000
translate into the same biological effects. And then I don't know, sort of endocrine revolution

294
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,480
of 70s, 80s or so. Turns out how loud someone is yelling at you counts what the hormone levels are,

295
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,600
how sensitively you can hear them. The levels of your receptors in target cells turn out to be

296
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,240
essential as well. And there's all sorts of endocrine domains where in fact, screwy receptor

297
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,680
levels are much more consequential and impactful than are screwy levels of the hormone itself.

298
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:03,720
And individual differences in levels of receptors, what version you have, how well it works, how

299
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,280
avidly it holds on to the hormone, what it is then coupled with afterward downstream inside

300
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:17,000
the cell. That whole world turns out to be as central to understanding individual differences

301
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,720
as are the levels of hormones themselves. And as sensitive to all those things ranging from genes

302
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,280
to prenatal environment to early development to psychological factors and so on. So yeah,

303
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,040
that's a huge piece of the story now. When I hear you say it like that, Robert, it seems pretty

304
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,000
obvious because we would talk about insulin in exactly that way. You could have two people with

305
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,160
the exact same level of insulin, completely different physiologic response because of insulin

306
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,080
sensitivity. When insulin hits its receptor, it leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and that's

307
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,640
what leads to the glute four transporter coming up to the surface. And different people with the same

308
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,720
insulin can do that totally differently and different people will have a different insulin

309
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,960
response to the same food, to the same meal. That's the reason we do glucose tolerance tests.

310
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,520
So you could basically say someone is cortisol sensitive and cortisol resistant to make the

311
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,280
analogy to insulin. At the end product end, absolutely. If you're an obsessive with cortisol

312
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,600
stuff in the eighties, there was briefly this deep puzzle in that it turned out New World monkeys,

313
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,800
monkeys in South America, marmosets, tamarins or whatever. When you compare them to traditional

314
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,320
old world monkeys, the Asian and the African ones, it turns out they have like an order of magnitude

315
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,880
higher glucocorticoid levels. Oh my God, that's crazy. What's that about? All sorts of theorizing

316
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,440
about how for some reason it's more stressful to be a new world primate than an old world,

317
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,320
which didn't make a whole lot of sense. And then there was this issue of these animals should have

318
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,480
been falling out of trees from their Cushing's disease. And finally somebody found an explanation.

319
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, somewhere back when there was a mutation in the gene for the glucocorticoid receptor

320
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,520
in New World primates and it has roughly one-tenth the sensitivity. So the system just

321
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,680
equilibrated out at a different set point, but that's such a great example of just natural

322
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:20,920
variation, not only in how loudly you speak hormone, but how effectively your cells listen to

323
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,080
hormone. Do you have a sense in the human population today? I mean a log-full difference

324
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,800
like you just described sounds extreme, but do you have a sense of what the variability is in

325
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:39,160
humans today? Is it a two-fold, three-fold delta on the receptor side? Gut feeling and reflecting

326
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,360
the fact that my world, the brain, you don't get to measure receptor levels anywhere near as easily

327
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,200
as in a white blood cell, well under an order of magnitude. We just acknowledged or you just pointed

328
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,040
out that when a zebra sees a lion, everything that happens as far as the fast and what I would call

329
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,040
the acute and the subacute stress response is perfectly evolutionarily sound and completely in

330
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,960
the best interest of that zebra. We could also come up with countless examples of 10,000 years ago

331
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,960
or even today when the same thing is true in humans. When did that transition occur in our species

332
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,720
to where you started to see either something in the civilization or a society that was unhealthy?

333
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,080
So today I could point to a thousand examples, social media, you name it. I mean it's an infinite

334
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,960
number. When did that start to crop up? What does your research suggest is the arrival of that?

335
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:44,040
I think it predated us being humans and instead is a feature of smart social mammals because you

336
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:50,440
see indices of stress-related stuff, baboons, that's what I've spent my whole career on,

337
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,960
and other non-human primates, cetaceans, elephants and such. Okay, so why study baboons if you're

338
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,600
trying to understand human stress? And it turns out they perfectly illustrate the point you just

339
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,560
brought up. If you're a baboon living in the Serengeti in East Africa, your life is pretty good.

340
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:16,440
It's a fantastic ecosystem. Baboons, they live in these big troops, 50 to 100 animals or so,

341
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,520
so they really don't have to worry about lions very often. The infant mortality rate is lower

342
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,400
than among the neighboring Maasai tribes people and probably most importantly, unless it's a once

343
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,600
a generation drought, if you're just a baboon going about your everyday business, it takes you

344
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,560
about three hours a day to get your day's calories and that has a critical implication, which is if

345
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,600
you only need to spend three hours of sunlight each day getting enough food to get by, you've got

346
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:53,560
nine hours of free time every day to devote to being miserable to some other baboon.

347
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,080
And that's the key thing. They are well off enough in our westernized sense

348
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,200
that they can sit around and generate psychological stress for each other. Overwhelmingly, if you're

349
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,480
a baboon in the Serengeti and you're miserable, it's because another baboon has worked very hard

350
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,720
to bring that state about. They're wonderful models for westernized disease in that very few

351
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:26,440
of us get hypertensive because, you know, tigers are chasing us. Instead, it's psychosocial stuff

352
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,280
that we invent and that we can wallow in for hours every day. And that's exactly what baboons

353
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:39,000
do. They're great models for westernized stress. Do we have evidence? I'm sure it exists, but

354
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,920
in the humans, I would just be willing to bet that if you and I were subjected to the same

355
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:51,720
external stressor, I would probably internalize it more than you. That's my guess. So if we were

356
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,520
both baboons and there was a third baboon tormenting us, is it safe to say that you could be the baboon

357
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,560
that would roll with it more than me? Individual differences like that, absolutely. My guess is

358
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,040
both of us would respond to it by saying, I'm just going to get a longer and longer CV and then

359
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,400
he's going to regret it someday pushing me around. They'll be sorry when they see how many degrees I

360
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,640
have. But yeah, individual differences. One of the things that I focused on, you know, I spent my

361
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,200
first 10 years deciding rank and status, social status, everything. If you're a baboon and you

362
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,840
got a choice in the matter, you want to be high ranking because on the average, you have lower

363
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,160
glucorticoid levels, your resting blood pressure is lower, all sorts of stuff works better.

364
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,920
But what took me some growing up out there to do was to realize that yeah, social rank is important.

365
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,640
Far more important is the contextual meaning of your rank. Is that the same as your perception

366
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,480
of your rank or is there there's more to it, right? Well, it's what the rank means in your particular

367
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,560
troop. You can be a low ranking guy in one of two different troops and one troop simply because of

368
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,400
its culture and that's a perfectly scientific word to use for another species these days.

369
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,280
In one troop, being low ranking could be a whole lot crappier than in another troop in terms of

370
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,960
how often somebody in a bad mood displays his aggression on you in terms of how often somebody

371
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,560
actually grooms you and off in terms of how often you get to finish a meal before somebody steals

372
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,080
it from you kind of thing. So the same exact rank means different things in different sort of

373
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:39,240
baboon cultures. So I'll take an extreme example. In a prison, there's a clear hierarchy starting

374
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,680
with the warden, the guards, the inmates and of course within the inmates there's a hierarchy.

375
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,720
Presumably I'm making this up but certainly the pedophiles would be at the bottom of that list and

376
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,600
a violent criminal would probably be at the top of that list. So within that hierarchy, there's

377
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:01,320
probably a manner in which you would be perceived as a function of that unique environment which is

378
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,360
so artificial in its own way but that wouldn't necessarily be the same outside.

379
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:13,240
Absolutely and one of the most interesting things about us, us humans, when we talk about

380
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,960
across all sorts of primates being low ranking in general is bad for your health or what about

381
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,800
humans, we don't have ranking in the same system that sort of other primates do in a strict linear

382
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,520
kind of way but the other thing about us is we belong to multiple hierarchies at once and we can

383
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,320
have very different ranks in them. So for example, family, work, sports team, hobby. Exactly. You've

384
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,640
got some guy who's the mail room clerk in this giant corporation and you could not possibly be

385
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,680
lower status but he's the captain of the company softball team this year and you better bet when

386
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,200
you ask him what's important in his life, nine to five Monday to Friday is just a stupid way to

387
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,880
pay the rent and what really matters is when the weekend comes around, you have somebody with a

388
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:11,720
horrible low status job who's the deacon of their church. We belong to multiple hierarchies and we

389
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,720
are very good psychologically at deciding that whichever hierarchy we're highest in, that's the

390
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,600
one we define ourselves by. Let's take another extreme example which is you take people who are

391
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,560
very successful in what they do, you know, whatever they're the most famous hedge fund manager or

392
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,520
an entrepreneur that started some great company, you would argue, well they seem to be pretty good

393
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,160
on the food chain but yet many of them would say or you could measure objectively their

394
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,560
hypercordicillemia is problematic. So it seems like there's even more than just that ranking,

395
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,840
right? Isn't there something else? Because they're at the top, if they were baboons,

396
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,440
they're the alpha but they're still grossly stressed out. In other words, thank God we're

397
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,760
more subtle than baboons but it turns out baboons were even more subtle than just rank.

398
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:08,840
They have personality and you can be a high ranking baboon and personality differences and

399
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,880
again this is as scientific a word as this culture. If you're a high ranking baboon and your worst

400
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,360
rival sneezing 100 yards away is seen as a major provocation, you're going to have much higher

401
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,400
glucorticoid levels than if you're a highest ranking baboon for whom that's no big deal.

402
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,400
And in fact often you may have higher glucorticoid cortisol levels than if you're number 10 or number

403
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,720
20 in the hierarchy. There's lots of psychological filter stuff and I spent a ton of time studying

404
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:47,000
that. Baboons differ as to how readily they see things as being provocative or not, threatening or

405
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,920
not. You're sitting there and again your worst rival shows up and takes a nap 100 yards away.

406
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,040
There can be two baboons of the same rank and one of them keeps doing exactly what he's doing

407
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,720
and the other one is interrupted from whatever nice social thing is happening. He's agitated and

408
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,960
he's vigilant. He's got to look at the guy and lunge towards him a couple of times before going

409
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,560
back. If your worst rival taking a nap is as disruptive as the guy threatening you in your

410
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,320
face, you average about twice the cortisol levels in your bloodstream after controlling for rank

411
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,560
as a guy who can tell the difference between the big thing and the little thing.

412
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,600
Maybe this is too deep a question and the answer isn't known but what is it that actually

413
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:41,080
transmits that information through the filter of your personality into the physiology that's very

414
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:47,240
well understood? So I understand the bookends, right? I understand how the visual cortex takes

415
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,400
the guy who's your enemy sleeping over there and transmits that to your cortex and then I understand

416
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:00,200
how the sympathetic chain kicks off the response. Is there a link in between those? The processing

417
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,120
link? Here's one of those filters. You take people and you're flashing up faces at them,

418
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,360
stick them in a brain scanner and you're looking at how jumpy their amygdala is. Their amygdala

419
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,640
central to fear, anxiety, aggression and such and what you see is tremendous individual differences

420
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,120
and you show somebody a face with kind of a neutral expression. Does this person look happy,

421
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,680
sad, angry, threatening, whatever and lots of variability and you look at the people who tend

422
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,320
to view neutral expressions as threatening. In other words, they see threats that most other people

423
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,960
don't. What does that correlate with? A bigger amygdala. Physically larger amygdala. A physically

424
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,880
larger amygdala. Amygdala with a higher metabolic rate and amygdala that is more

425
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,400
electrophysiologically reactive and stuff. Let's back up for a moment. I mean, tell people in case

426
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,000
they don't know where the amygdala sits, what part of the brain it evolved from and why it's sort of

427
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,720
referred to as this reptilian brain. I think everybody's heard of the amygdala, but I think

428
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,320
you could explain this in a more interesting and accurate way. Okay. Amygdala is like one of the

429
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:20,280
anchors of what's called the limbic system in the brain. Limbic system, it's the part of the brain

430
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,360
that's all about emotion. Not surprisingly, mammals have a whole lot more limbic development

431
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:34,200
than fish do. Fisher are not famous for their emotional lives. Limbic system is arousal,

432
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:41,720
fear, anger, lust, love, maternal, pair bonding, mother infant bonding, all of that. And it's a

433
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,360
whole series of structures. Not surprisingly, ancient in mammals. Not surprisingly, highly

434
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:55,080
complex interconnected. Not surprisingly, sitting underneath the cortex. The cortex that more

435
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,840
recently evolved part of the brain that does your taxes, all of that. Limbic system underneath there,

436
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,400
all this subterranean emotion stuff. An amygdala is one of the key limbic structures and it's involved

437
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,680
in fear. It's involved in anxiety. It's involved in aggression. You learn to be afraid of something

438
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:21,000
or somebody that didn't used to scare you. And your amygdala does the exact same sort of cellular

439
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,120
basis of learning that goes on in other parts of your brain. When you learn somebody's middle name

440
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,520
and actually remember it, your amygdala learns to be afraid of new things. And when you manage to

441
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:39,400
stop being afraid of something, when you stop being afraid of thems, because it turns out, oh,

442
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,560
they're actually more similar to you than you thought. It's your amygdala that becomes less

443
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:52,040
reactive to stimuli like that. So your amygdala is absolutely central to some of our worst human

444
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,600
moments. It's so interesting because it's sandwiched between, you can think of the human

445
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,360
brain as having sort of a very grossly three parts, right? This brainstem, this midbrain,

446
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,000
which the amygdala, you could argue is the mare. And then the cortex that you describe,

447
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,680
it's not an oversimplification, I think, to say that as the complexity of the organism evolved,

448
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,480
so too did that hierarchy, right? I mean, the brainstem basically handles everything we don't

449
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,280
have to think about ever, breathing and all of those autonomic and sympathetic parasympathetic

450
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,000
functions. And then you layer on this midbrain that does everything that you said, which is

451
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,880
still kind of happening beneath consciousness. And then of course, there's where most of us live in

452
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,520
our cortex where we're, or where we think we live, which is we're thinking these thoughts, but

453
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,080
it seems we're maybe not as aware of how influenced the cortex is by what lies beneath it.

454
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:50,920
Exactly. Which is incredibly important. If you think of this kind of ancient reptilian brainstem

455
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,320
part of the brain, what does it do? It keeps track. It makes you breathe every now and then

456
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,880
without having to think about a boring sort of stuff. Then on top is the emotional limbic system.

457
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,120
Then on top is that cerebral thinking cognitive cortex thing. It's very easy to come up with a

458
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:13,160
conceptualization that what's fancy about humans is, for example, you're a lizard. And the only

459
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,600
thing that's going to change the functioning of that ancient brainstem stuff is if you're bleeding,

460
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,200
if you're too hot, if you're too cold, just like boring physiological states. Once you layer a

461
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:31,000
mammalian emotional limbic system on top, suddenly you can do something no lizard or on earth can do.

462
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,320
You're sitting there and you're some wildebeest and some other scary wildebeest shows up and is

463
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,800
peeking on some tree in your territory and nothing regulatory has changed in your body,

464
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:51,400
but your heart starts beating faster. Aha! Your emotional brain can alter sort of the basic

465
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,320
regulatory stuff down in the basement. Now you go one step higher and you layer a cortex on top of

466
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,480
it and now you could do amazing stuff. You sit there and you think about the fact that your

467
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,360
heart's going to stop beating someday and you start breathing faster and your brainstem,

468
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,960
the more ancient stuff has altered as a result. And you've just done something not only that no

469
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,560
reptile can do, you've just done something that no warthog can do, which is think about something

470
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:31,480
that's scary or arousing or remember the time that you would and suddenly something changes down below

471
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:41,080
there. So there's this easy picture of sort of top-down complexity once you get to us and where

472
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,680
the cortex can regulate your emotional brain and that regulatory brain at the bottom, your emotional

473
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,040
limbic brain can regulate what's far more interesting or underappreciated is exactly

474
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:59,560
what you bring up, which is those lower levels can influence what's going on up above. One example of

475
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:06,120
this is like this classic great study in sort of physiological psychology, social psych. You take

476
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,360
people and I think in this study they would take male volunteers, heterosexual male volunteers,

477
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,280
and of course they were no doubt college freshmen taking psych 101. And they had these guys walk

478
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:27,240
across this really scary suspended bridge and the deal was that either halfway across the bridge

479
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,160
you were met by from the other side a researcher who happened to be an attractive female.

480
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,560
And she would ask the volunteer some questions, what do you think of this bridge or how is it

481
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,600
walking across this or whatever. The other half of the time you would not encounter this person

482
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,240
until you were safely out at the other end. Then they would ask you to evaluate the attractiveness

483
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,560
of the person. Same person. That same person. You're either seeing her in the middle of the bridge or

484
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,080
exactly saying, Hey, remember while you were doing that you there was this, you know,

485
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,960
do you want to rate her attractiveness? Was she friendly? Did she seem smart? And what you would

486
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,640
see is guys in the middle of the bridge with their hearts racing because they're terrified

487
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,480
would do some misinterpretation. Why is my heart beating so much faster than if I was standing

488
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,280
safely so they would rate her more attractively in the middle of the bridge. Exactly. And then

489
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,600
is the ceiling of detail is now you do the same experiment and you give the person a beta blocker

490
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,440
so that they don't have the accelerate and they don't rate the person as attractive.

491
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,080
Is it the same with the beta blocker? You would treat you.

492
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,080
You do nothing to their ratings of them as how smart they seem, how kind they seem, whatever.

493
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:47,640
It's just this. Okay. If my heart's racing, it must be because so that's a great example.

494
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:55,960
Boring reptilian regulatory stuff down there is helping influence what you think your emotions

495
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,920
are. That reminds me of that 1995 ish movie Speed with Keanu Reeves and I'm blanking our name.

496
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,760
That's right. Senator Bullock. Where at the end of that movie, there's some cheesy line about how

497
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,120
relationships that start under this much distress, you know, it's dangerous. But, but of course,

498
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,480
the other read on that now is yeah, if you're on a bus that's about to blow up,

499
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,240
like I think you're going to think the chair is attractive, right? Potentially.

500
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,960
Wow. I haven't thought of that movie in years. Thanks.

501
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,880
Sorry. You can go home and I'm sure Netflix will stream that for you.

502
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,520
Right. So I read something you wrote. I can't remember where it might have been in another

503
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,920
interview that, and I didn't know this, and this is a great example of why I just love doing this

504
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,360
podcast because there's never an exception to how much I'm learning. It's like drinking from

505
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,560
a fire hose. And you'd think I would have remembered this from medical school. The neuron

506
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:58,120
of a human and the neuron of some other organism, when you look at it at the single cell level,

507
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,840
can't really differentiate it. If I showed you two microscope slides and here's a human and here's a

508
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,840
fish. So what is it about? And this is maybe getting us a little off topic, but I also think

509
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,440
it feeds into this broader issue of like the stew and the alchemy of how this stuff is put

510
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,200
together. But if we all have the same neurons, what is it? Is it the number of our neurons? Like

511
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:27,400
what is it that enables us to have all of this additional torture? Yeah, it's incredibly

512
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,280
interesting because I mean, there's, there's three and a half people on earth who have spent their

513
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,960
entire careers being able to tell the difference between like a tree shrew neuron and a human

514
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,200
neuron and could recognize it in their sleep. But yeah, for the most part, we are not humans

515
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,320
because we have invented brain areas that you don't find in other mammals or because we've

516
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:55,000
invented neurotransmitters that you don't find in other vertebrates or types of neurons. There's a

517
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,040
couple of types of neurons that people used to think were specific to humans. And it turns out

518
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,400
you find them in elephants and whales also, and that's plenty interesting, but it's the same

519
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,760
enzymes. It's the same gene regulation. It's the same, you know, we're sharing 98% of our DNA with

520
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,680
a chimp or a bonobo. So you say where do humanists come from? I think it's exactly the issue you talk

521
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,240
about. We have the same signal transduction pathways and neurons as you see in a fruit fly.

522
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,720
And what's the key difference? Isn't that a bit humbling? Yes, it is. When we just think we're

523
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,960
that special. And it's the where you can take one of their genes or one of our genes and stick it in

524
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,200
the other one and it functions just fine. Or you could take it from a single cell organism,

525
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,560
some genes related to program cell death, you can do that. So what's the big difference for

526
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:54,360
every neuron that a fruit fly has? We have 100 million. And sort of the sound bite that I think

527
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:03,480
summarizes all of that is with enough quantity, you invent quality. And this is this whole world

528
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:10,520
of emergent properties of complex systems. You take one ant and you put it on a table and nothing

529
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,720
that it does makes a huge amount of sense. And you put 10 ants there and pretty much the same thing.

530
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,760
And you put on, I don't know, a thousand and maybe they start making a trail or something.

531
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,880
And you put 10,000 and they build a colony and they farm mushrooms and they take aphids as slaves

532
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,600
and they could keep the temperature in the colony plus or minus two degrees and they have

533
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:39,320
specialization of labor. And no ant has any more rules than he had when he was watering around

534
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:47,240
on the table by himself. And you put enough of them together and complex adaptive stuff emerges

535
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,760
out of the very simple rules that each of those components has for dealing with another component.

536
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,840
It almost defies entropy, doesn't it? Like why does that happen? It's amazing that it does that.

537
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,960
And that's what our brains are. We've got more ants that are coming together in our heads than

538
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,000
does a fruit fly. And you get more complex emergent stuff happening. It blows my mind. So let's go

539
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,040
back to some of this stuff. Maybe about a year ago I read something that really frightened me

540
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,840
because the implications were so significant. If a mother is under great stress, there was this

541
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:30,920
critical window in which her child could see something in her eyes that would communicate

542
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,200
that stress to her. Or maybe it wasn't in her eyes, might have been just through her entire face,

543
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:42,680
but it would imprint epigenetically into the child and alter many features about them as they would

544
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,360
age. For example, their propensity to be depressed. I remember reading this in a lay press thing,

545
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,720
so I don't even think it got into the description of epigenetics, but that was the only assumption

546
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,440
I could make was that this must be modulated through that mechanism. Do you see evidence of

547
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:03,320
this in animals? Absolutely. And it's one of the trendiest topics around being like

548
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:10,760
hooray, science finally recognizes childhood matters. What your childhood is like has a lot

549
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,640
to do with what sort of adult you're going to wind up being. What do you know? And like lots

550
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:22,040
of childhood adversity versus childhood security and very different trajectories. And what's been

551
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:28,920
the huge mechanistic challenge for the field is understanding. So what is it about being in a

552
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,360
scary neighborhood or an unstable home or having a parent read to you or what is it about this whole

553
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,480
world of developmental individual differences? What are the nuts and bolts changes that occurs

554
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:48,760
in a kid so that as an adult, they are now 30 fold more likely than the next person for this or that

555
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:56,520
to happen to them. And this whole trendy field of epigenetics, which is early experience doesn't

556
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:04,360
change your genes, doesn't change your DNA sequence with some like circus trick exceptions. You've

557
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,760
pretty much got your DNA sequence forever. What epigenetics is, is early experience changing the

558
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:18,040
regulation of your genes, how easily you turn certain genes on, how easily you turn others off

559
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,800
in different parts of your body, different parts of your brain and so on. And that's exactly the

560
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:31,480
sort of domain where you see the sort of stuff that you outlined. So that, for example, if you're

561
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:38,280
a fetal rat and you, that rat have made a terrible decision. You've picked the wrong room

562
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,240
to be developing in and you happen to be inside a mother who's highly stressed.

563
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:50,280
She's secreting a lot of rat glucocorticoids, which get into the circulation through the placenta

564
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,760
and to the fetal circulation into the kid's brain. And one of the things that it does is it causes an

565
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,160
epigenetic change in the amygdala. So is that rat going to be born with a larger amygdala or is the

566
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,960
phenotype more complicated than just size? It's size and a bunch of other things. As an adult,

567
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,720
it's going to have a bigger amygdala and it's going to be more excitable and it's going to be

568
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,840
more prone towards interpreting a neutral situation as a threatening one. That's virtually

569
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:26,040
the definition of rat anxiety disorder, seeing menace that other people don't. And you see much

570
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:32,360
the same evidence in humans by now. Early experience. Forget early experience. What kind

571
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:38,680
of kindergarten teacher you had. This is fetal early experience. And this is exactly a domain

572
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,800
where you get potentially the lifelong epigenetic effect. Okay. So that turns out to have a hell of

573
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:54,360
an implication. That's just the most exciting subfield around there by now. Okay. So you were

574
00:55:54,360 --> 00:56:02,120
fetus and got exposed to lots of moms glucocorticoid levels. And as a result, as an adult, you've gotten

575
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:08,680
a large amygdala and you see threat all over the place that other rats don't. And among other things,

576
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:16,200
you secrete elevated levels of glucocorticoids because the world is full of menace that only

577
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:25,160
you were seeing. So you get pregnant and during your pregnancy, as a result, your fetus is exposed

578
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:32,360
to elevated glucocorticoid levels. And to be clear, it's not because you have altered the germline

579
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,200
genome. It's that you have changed the expression of the gene which has altered the phenotype. And

580
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,280
now that phenotype is being passed generation to generation through parallel expression.

581
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,320
Exactly. Something termed non genetic transmission of traits, non Mendelian. And people have now shown

582
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:57,080
some of those traits. You see that ripple. It gets smaller each generation, but it's there half a

583
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:03,320
dozen generations later. And the exact equivalent of some of these have been found in humans. In other

584
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:11,000
words, individual differences are arising not only from experience, but from the multi-generational

585
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,720
transmission of some of the consequences of experience, which is just mind boggling that

586
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,400
that can work that way. Let's go back a little bit to why this is problematic. So at the outset,

587
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,440
we alluded to this idea that it's a misnomer to say stress kills. I'd love to hear if you have

588
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,680
a particular definition of stress. I probably butcher this stuff, but I sort of think of stress

589
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:38,840
as the external thing. And I think about it as it's anything that is sort of emotionally or

590
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:43,400
physically either chronically or acutely distressing. I mean, that's sort of a dumb

591
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,080
definition because it contains the word stress, but I think people understand distress a little

592
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:55,560
more than they understand stress. But of course, it's your response to that physiologic response,

593
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,920
right? So we can quantify this stuff in terms of what hormones are happening in the body and how

594
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,920
the hormones are moving the body. It's your response to that that probably has a greater

595
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:13,320
impact on your health. So let's go through three things. Help me understand how hypercorticillemia

596
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:21,000
and or its accompanying features will impact the brain, especially, well, through any timeline you

597
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,400
want. I'm obviously interested in the aging brain, but I can't imagine this also doesn't

598
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,840
impact the developing brain. This is basically what I've spent my whole professional career

599
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,040
thinking about. And historically, the first place where people sort of realized something

600
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:42,840
scary was happening was a brain region called the hippocampus. Hippocampus is all about learning and

601
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:49,240
memory. You want to have a hippocampus. It's the main brain region that's damaged in Alzheimer's

602
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,320
disease, and it's vulnerable in lots of other ways. Turns out it's extremely sensitive to

603
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:01,320
glucorticoids translated more reductively. It's got extremely high levels of receptors for

604
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:06,440
glucorticoids by the standards of the rest of the brain. And what's the evolutionary basis for that?

605
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,960
Is that to have a feedback loop? There's two reasons. One is to have a feedback loop, but the

606
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:19,320
other is, okay, so the hippocampus remembers stuff for you. You don't remember everything.

607
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,280
You don't remember where you were on 9-10 as opposed to 9-11 kind of thing. Your memory

608
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,520
processes has to come with a filter saying, is this one important? So you're saying the cortisol

609
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,560
amplifies memory consolidation and that you use this to consolidate stressful memories as a way

610
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,200
of learning. Exactly. Along with epinephrine and norepinephrine indirectly, they have some of the

611
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,840
same effects. So cortisol crosses the blood-brain barrier with no difficulty? Exactly. I assume

612
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,080
epi and norepinephrine do the same? They have to work more indirectly, heavily through the

613
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,640
vagal nerve because they don't get them as readily, but some of it is also norepinephrine being

614
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,840
released within the brain during stress. So it has some of its own memory enhancing effects.

615
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:08,120
Again, a great example of evolution has got this awesome system set up, and it only gets out of

616
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,400
whack when the stimulus becomes too much. You do want that imprint, but you don't want that

617
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,160
happening full-time. Or stated another way, this is the reason why you don't get much out of a class

618
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:25,960
if you're semi-comatose and you had two hours of sleep last night. If you're like three-quarter,

619
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,920
your glucocorticoid levels are low, you're not consolidating stuff. If you are out of your mind

620
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,560
terrified because there's a lion sitting next to you, you're not going to absorb much either

621
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,640
inverse you optimal range, all of that. So it turns out the optimal amount of glucocorticoids,

622
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,480
something that is moderately stressful, in other words, something stimulating,

623
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:55,640
does great stuff to your hippocampus. It increases blood delivery there, glucose, oxygen, it makes the

624
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:01,720
synapses, the connections between neurons more excitable in the hippocampus, does great stuff,

625
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,240
a little bit of arousal, alertness is a good thing for learning and memory. Now instead,

626
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,760
transition to you are stressed 24-7 ever since you were like 10 years old kind of thing,

627
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,440
and you're in the range where glucocorticoids do exactly the opposite. They decrease oxygen and

628
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:27,320
glucose delivery to the hippocampus. They make neurons less excitable, they disconnect synapses,

629
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,400
they cause the processes and neurons to shrivel, they block the birth of new neurons there,

630
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,440
they make other insults more damaging to neurons in the hippocampus. What you have there,

631
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,200
that's the world in which if you were stressed out of your mind, memory doesn't work so hot.

632
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:51,000
And what we're increasingly realizing is if you're exposed to excessive glucorticoid levels like on

633
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,360
the scale of years to decades, you're going to make this part of the brain get older faster.

634
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,240
Which speaks to something that I know you're quite passionate about, which is

635
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:11,240
the differences in how socioeconomic status can affect generational changes in this manner.

636
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,280
Because you use the example of a 10-year-old. Well, I did my residency in Baltimore. Let me

637
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,760
tell you a 10-year-old in inner city Baltimore who's in the wrong house versus a 10-year-old

638
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,760
in Palo Alto who's in quote unquote the right house. And look, that's not to say that you could

639
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,720
have a 10-year-old in Baltimore that's got a great environment and 10-year-old in Palo Alto

640
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,920
that's dealing with a whole bunch of other different issues, which especially in the era

641
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:36,200
of social media. But all things considered, probabilistically that 10-year-old in Baltimore

642
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,440
is going to have a much harder time given what you just said.

643
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,120
Or I don't know stated the other way. I have a friend who's a cardiologist who splits his time

644
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:53,240
between a hospital in Oakland and a private practice in San Francisco. Some of the time what

645
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,360
he's doing is dealing with 80-year-olds who are considering getting a pacemaker because the ski

646
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,440
season is coming and they were wondering if they're going to be in shape and time for that.

647
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:10,760
And then back in Oakland, he's dealing with 50-year-old elderly men who are having heart disease.

648
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:18,680
Yeah. Socioeconomic disparities are, I won't get on my soapbox now. When you look at the source of

649
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:25,880
variability in health among humans on this planet, socioeconomic differences, differences in absolute

650
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,800
levels, differences in degrees of inequality within cultures and within communities and so on,

651
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:40,520
there's an enormous predictor of health. You want to look at the most medically impacted,

652
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:47,240
low ranking primates you could find on earth. Look at poor humans, because when humans invented

653
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:54,520
socioeconomic status and the capacity to be poor, they invented a way to subordinate the have-nots

654
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,320
like no chimp on earth could ever dream of doing. As you've alluded to, there's something else to it.

655
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:04,760
Recently I interviewed an amazing physician named Tom Kattena who practices in the Nuba Mountains in

656
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,240
the south of Sudan. So he's the only physician to take care of one million people who, as you know,

657
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:17,800
are being killed by their own government. Bashir is indiscriminately killing these people.

658
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,920
So my discussion with Tom was one of the most riveting discussions I've ever had with a human

659
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,000
being. It just happened to be in front of a microphone. But one of the things that just as

660
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,440
an afterthought we were discussing that surprised me is we were going through all of the different

661
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,600
things that people die of there. They don't have vaccines. You've got measles outbreaks that are

662
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,640
killing people left, right in the center and the trauma, like the shrapnel blowing people apart.

663
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,320
Not surprisingly, they're just not getting the same chronic diseases. And the cancers they get

664
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,280
are not the cancers we get and they're not getting heart disease and they're almost unheard of to get

665
01:04:52,280 --> 01:05:00,280
type 2 diabetes. But what really surprised me is there was no suicide. And I found that as the

666
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,480
single most interesting thing I guess I learned from Tom, which was we would look at their life

667
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:13,080
and think that is an abysmal existence that I couldn't tolerate for one second. And yet I would

668
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:19,400
have to guess that their level of cortisol might be lower than ours, even though they're in a much

669
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:24,520
worse environment. So whether it's that sense of community that they have or the shared purpose,

670
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,080
there's something about it. So in other words, my point is even in the presence of such great

671
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,680
poverty, it seems that there's ways that this can be overcome, whether it's through there's no

672
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,320
comparison to anybody else, because another point he made was most of the folks there don't even

673
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,320
know they're in Africa. Like they don't necessarily know that Africa is the continent in which their

674
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,000
country resides. So is the bigger issue there you think that there's no disparity? So even though

675
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,640
that's complete poverty, there's no real perceived disparity, or do you think it's the sense of

676
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:59,320
community? Like what would you hypothesize explains that health, that mental health?

677
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:05,800
All the above. There's a whole world of people who study happiness, along with more traditional

678
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:11,400
public health people who study things like longevity. You look at the quarter poorest

679
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:18,120
places on earth, and indeed people there don't live very long and are miserable.

680
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,440
But once you get past sort of the subsistence level, there's not a great relationship between

681
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:33,240
the wealth of a country GDP per capita, anything, and levels of happiness or life expectancy.

682
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,000
And you look at the fact that the US has a shorter life expectancy than Cuba and Lebanon and

683
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,840
Costa Rica. And it's like the shame of this country kind of thing. Once you get past mere

684
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:51,560
subsistence level, income is not a great predictor of any of this stuff. And that's instead where you

685
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:59,480
get into worlds of social capital and social support. And when you look at the whole literature

686
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,840
and you look basically at every westernized country on earth, and it's now seen as they become

687
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:10,920
westernized, and what you see is the health socioeconomic gradient. The poorer you are,

688
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,920
the worse your health on the average. The more of a whole array of diseases you get, not all of

689
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:23,800
them, but a huge number, the more impactful they are. And when you look in the west, the United

690
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:28,200
States is the poster child for that. We've got the steepest curve in any country on earth.

691
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:34,360
In the westernized world, the least steep ones are you bet, of course, the Scandinavian countries

692
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:42,040
ever reliable, sort of utopias. And then you begin to unpack why this relationship occurs. And like

693
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:48,040
some incredibly smart people have spent their careers looking at it. The most obvious one is,

694
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:55,480
if you're not healthy, it's very hard to pull off being the CEO of a company. Poor health precedes

695
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:01,640
and gives rise to poor socioeconomic status. Okay, that's plausible. That turns out to explain a tiny

696
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:08,760
percent to the variability. And you could look at the status socioeconomic status of the home in

697
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,840
which a child is raised. And that's a predictor of their likelihood of diabetes half a century later.

698
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:20,840
So absolutely, the socioeconomic status comes first in explaining the vast percentage of the

699
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:27,400
variability. Okay, so next thing, maybe it's just that, well, everybody's kind of equally healthy.

700
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:33,480
It's just that the really poor people are very unhealthy. We have a step function. No, you start

701
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:40,360
with Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates and every step down there and statistically, the lower you go down,

702
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,680
every rung of the way, the poorer you are. The poor you are with respect to health. I'm sorry,

703
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:50,120
the poor your health. Yes, yes, thanks. So now you unpack that. And what's the most obvious

704
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:55,400
explanation? And this is what people call a neo materialist explanation, which is obvious to poor

705
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:00,520
you are. You don't have health care access. You don't have health insurance, you can't go to the

706
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:06,200
doctor as readily your care is more lousy. That's obviously that explains everything that explains

707
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,000
virtually none of the variability in the data. Because you see the gradient nonetheless in

708
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,720
countries with socialized medicine, universal health care, you see it for diseases where it

709
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:25,560
doesn't matter how often you get health care access, juvenile diabetes, so it shows an SES

710
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:33,160
gradient kind of thing. So it's not health care access. You then look cross culturally and you see

711
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,920
wildly different income levels and wildly different levels of health care access. And you see very

712
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:45,320
similar lifespans across these countries and very similar gradients. So what people spent like the

713
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:52,200
last 30 years doing is having this huge shift towards it's got so little to do with the material

714
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,720
aspects of wealth or poverty, it's got to do with the psychological aspects, it's got to do with the

715
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:05,400
stress. First key finding, somebody at UCSF named Nancy Adler, who's done wonderful research,

716
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,640
showing, okay, your socio economic status, your wealth, your objective measure of wealth,

717
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:19,800
is indeed a predictor of your health. Turns out, at least as good of a predictor is your

718
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,440
subjective socio economic status. On the level when you look at people around you, how are you

719
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:32,120
doing compared to other people? Where would you place yourself on this 10 step ladder in terms of

720
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,480
what's your absolute SES? What's your subjective one? And by asking it that way, you're asking the

721
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:42,120
person to consider the community that's most pertinent to them. Who's the comparison group?

722
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:48,760
My next door neighbors, Warren Buffett, in between whatever. When you think of other people, how are

723
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:55,160
you doing compared to them? And it turns out your subjective SES is at least as good of a predictor

724
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:00,680
of your health as is your objective. In other words, if you took someone's income, which is quite

725
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:08,040
objective, it would offer no more prediction than asking that person in the Nuba Mountains,

726
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,720
where do you rack up in this tribe? And it's sort of like, you know, sort of top two thirds.

727
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:20,840
Yeah, exactly. Or another way of stating that is you look in some bloated corporation,

728
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:25,960
and there's some guy who's the assistant manager of the mail room, and that's an incredibly

729
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,640
status-filled position for that guy. And there's some other guy who's number two in the company,

730
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,600
who was just passed over to be number one. And the only pertinent thing in his mind is not the

731
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:42,600
99,000 employees that he's higher ranking in, that there's still somebody ahead of me. And you can

732
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:50,040
see the same thing in baboons. In other words, it's not being poor, it's feeling poor. The next

733
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,720
critical piece in the story is work from this guy, Richard Wilkinson in the UK, who shows

734
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:02,200
what's the best, most like effective way to make somebody feel poor, independent of their absolute

735
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:09,560
levels of income, surround them by inequality, surround them by reminders of all the people who

736
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:15,400
are doing better than them. I mean, this is where social media, it's the amplifier to all amplifiers

737
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,880
of this, right? You can't go 10 minutes if you're on it without looking at somebody who's obviously

738
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,400
better looking, obviously smarter, obviously richer, obviously having more fun. I think this

739
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,840
has been pretty well documented, right? Lifestyle or the rich and famous, or you could be driving

740
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:38,520
down a freeway and somebody passes you, and I don't know what counts as a high status car these

741
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:46,840
days that cost a fortune, but they come speeding past you and you can feel crappy and diminished

742
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:54,200
and like a less successful human, and you never even saw that person's face. This is unheard of

743
01:12:54,200 --> 01:13:00,280
in the history of humans or primates of being able to feel socially subordinated, and you don't even

744
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:06,120
interact with the person. Oh, there's people out there with, you know, at least if the next door

745
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:13,160
neighbor has more camels than you, that's a very like tangible, real thing in terms of like likelihood

746
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:20,520
of surviving that extract. Income inequality explains the mediating effect between objective

747
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:27,000
socioeconomic status, subjective socioeconomic status, and health outcome. What I'm hearing you

748
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,960
also say, though, that's a more subtle spin on this is it's not necessarily global income inequality,

749
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:40,040
it's local income inequality that is much bigger. But what technology has allowed us to do is explain

750
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,200
what counts as local. That's right. That's exactly right. It's expanded what local means. You can sit there and

751
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:50,200
watch, I don't know, Lifestyles or the Rich and Famous. And back when you would never have gotten

752
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:57,080
into like the Petty or Phyfton's Castle or whatever. And now you can see all the crap they have that

753
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:04,440
you're never going to get and feel less loved as a result. It's so interesting to hear you talk about

754
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,560
this. This is a topic that I think anybody listening to this is well aware of, especially if you're a

755
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:14,440
parent, because you also have to think about this through a developmental lens, which is

756
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,840
at least when you and I grew up, I didn't grow up with a lot, but you really had no idea what was

757
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:26,600
different, right? Like you simply, everybody was the same. I mean, everybody's parents bought used

758
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,680
cars instead of new cars and everybody had more or less the same sort of, you know, clothing that

759
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:40,040
wasn't exactly the best and whatever. So at least you could argue, well, were we at least spared some

760
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:47,080
of this difficulty during a critical window of development? And what happens now to a 10 year old

761
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:53,400
that's got a smartphone and is subjected to this? Because I remember that funny show Lifestyles or

762
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:58,840
the Rich and Famous, I can still sort of hear the goofy cheesy theme song. I think I even probably

763
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:04,120
watched it once or twice as a kid, but it's a lot easier when that's the one exposure you have to

764
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,080
extreme wealth or disparity and either you can watch it for one hour or not. But it's quite a

765
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:14,520
different thing if not to pick on the Kardashians. I'm just, but if you're inundated with, oh my god,

766
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,960
look at how awesome the Kardashians are and what they're doing and how great their life is and

767
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:27,800
multiply that by three log orders. Do we have any data that suggest that we are at a critical

768
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:34,040
juncture? Because I was having this discussion with a friend yesterday, which is, is there evidence

769
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:43,320
of any greater transition in technology in both a positive and negative way than this generation to

770
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:52,200
the last? Is this truly the greatest step forward? I would assume so, but the things we worry about,

771
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:59,960
people have been worrying about for centuries. Oh my, kids, they don't go outside, they don't play,

772
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,120
they don't have like meaningful relationships because they spend all their time talking on

773
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:09,720
the telephone. They spend all their time listening to their transistor radio. So maybe we're blowing

774
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,880
this up. Maybe this is just this generation's version. I mean, I guess the one difference is

775
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,960
when you're talking on the telephone, when you're listening to the transistor radio, I don't know if

776
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:27,480
it creates that global to local phenomenon quite as easily or as quickly or with less resistance

777
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:33,320
as we see. Maybe you're right. Maybe this has always been one generation's struggle with the last.

778
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:41,320
But what you get is an amplifier now, because if you're an insecure, socially isolated,

779
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:50,280
peri-adolescent kid who's vulnerable in all sorts of ways, and no matter what decade or century it

780
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:55,160
was, you're the last one picked for the game. You're the one who's least popular or whatever,

781
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:01,880
and that has all its corrosive effects. Now, if you really set your mind to it and you're that kid,

782
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:10,680
you could spend 24-7 just wallowing, toxically, in evidence of a gazillion other people who are

783
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:17,640
better looking than you and more popular and invited to parties. It amplifies further.

784
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,240
And the technology does absolutely that. What I think it does is it makes the vulnerable

785
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:30,360
more damaged than in the past. I think it's safe to say these amplifiers aren't going anywhere.

786
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:38,120
So rather than wallow in their harm, I guess the more relevant question is, what do we do?

787
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:44,040
If you're a parent today or not a parent today, and you're thinking about this through the lens

788
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:52,120
of yourself versus your kids, whatever, what are the steps that one can take to become less

789
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:57,960
susceptible to these forces that seem to drive this? Because I want to step back for a moment.

790
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,760
When I think about these areas that we've talked about before about the impact of nutrition and

791
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:10,920
sleep and exercise and stress or distress to make it more the term I use, when I think about

792
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:16,200
this personally, the one I most worry about is the last one. I think I've got a pretty good handle

793
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:22,040
on nutrition and it's in many ways easier to control. I feel like I'm more in control of what

794
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,760
I eat and when I make bad choices, I'm usually doing them consciously like I've decided I'm going

795
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,360
to eat this pizza versus I can't help myself I'm going to eat this pizza. Similarly with exercise,

796
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,200
and again I'm not saying this for anybody else, but this is just my personal thing.

797
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:41,400
And even with sleep, once you commit to it, which is not something I did until probably seven or

798
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:47,160
eight years ago that I sort of committed to, wow this really matters and to forego this thing,

799
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:53,400
bad idea, it's this last one that really drives me crazy, which of course doesn't help matters

800
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,680
because the fact that it drives you crazy makes it worse. But I'll give you an example,

801
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:04,200
as a general rule, outside of the immediate postprandial period of a high glucose meal,

802
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:11,320
far and away my highest blood glucose is always in the morning. Now I wear a 24-hour glucose meter,

803
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:16,840
so I'm kind of a weird guy. For almost four years I've been wearing a glucose monitor all the time.

804
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:24,200
So it measures my glucose 24-7 at one minute increments and out of say 365 days in the year,

805
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:31,240
I'm easily wearing it 330 days of the year. So I've got a lot of data and without a question,

806
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:39,400
when you look at a 24-hour period, if you stripped away the x-axis of time, I could easily identify

807
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:46,040
mourning for you without exception. I'll give you an example, this is not something I'd plan to do.

808
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:51,800
I had breakfast yesterday, yesterday being Sunday, really early because I woke up with my kids made

809
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,280
breakfast. I normally don't eat breakfast, but I did. So I had a breakfast 730 in the morning,

810
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:03,400
did a workout, had to catch a flight, didn't have time to eat after, had a very, very busy day,

811
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:10,840
didn't eat a single thing, got to the hotel around 1030 or 11, didn't want to eat, so didn't.

812
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,880
Got up this morning, it's been almost 24 hours since a meal and I looked at my glucose meter

813
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,960
and it was like said 110, 110 milligrams per deciliter. I was like, there's no way that's right.

814
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:28,360
Calibrated it, sure enough it was 110. Now there is no earthly reason I should have had a glucose

815
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:34,920
of 110 milligrams per deciliter, 24 hours after my last meal, which by the way was bacon and eggs.

816
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:41,560
It's not like I was eating pancakes, right? Well, I promise you if I could spot check my cortisol,

817
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,840
it was high. And here's the thing, before I went to bed, my glucose was quite low.

818
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,280
You know, my glucose was probably 80 when I went to bed and it slowly rose. And sure enough,

819
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,280
as my day wore on today, the glucose went lower, lower, lower, lower, lower,

820
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:02,440
it was about 78 before you walked in here. I'm not alone by the way, so I've seen this a lot

821
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:07,000
clinically with patients. Once you start putting these 24 hour glucose sensors on people, which

822
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,240
a lot of my patients are now doing, you get this insight into this horrible thing that's happening

823
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,120
when we think we're sleeping and nothing else is going on, but we're ruminating or God knows what else.

824
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:25,560
And fits perfectly with morning wakening is when you get your highest glucorticoid levels,

825
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,880
which is probably one of the main driving forces on the increased blood glucose. And when you think

826
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:37,080
about it from a circadian standpoint, what's the most challenging thing you have to do each day in

827
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:43,400
the absence of any major tumult? Get up, start functioning, all of that. It just seems like it's

828
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:48,760
disproportionate. Certainly the dawn effect has been well described. It's more amplified in people

829
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:53,800
with type two diabetes, which is another interesting point, right? Which is why is it that someone who

830
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,760
already has glucose dysregulation would have an even higher cortisol response in the morning?

831
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:05,720
And yet you'll see, you know, enormous fluctuations in glucose. I guess my point here is this seems

832
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:11,480
like a harder problem to fix. And certainly meditation is by far the best tool I have ever

833
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:17,160
found to even approximate getting this under control. But it's still hard because it's not

834
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:22,760
like you have a pill. If your blood pressure is high, well, I think it's probably best to fix it

835
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,560
in any way possible. But we also have really great drugs that fix high blood pressure that can at

836
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:33,240
least mask these things. We don't have a pill to fix hypercorticillemia. It's one of the most

837
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:40,440
complicated endocrine situations. And yet as you've described eloquently, it's also so innately

838
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:47,160
wired into us. And we have this miserable midbrain that's just killing us. First of all, I'd love to

839
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:52,120
hear your thoughts on meditation, but then also other things that given how much time you've spent

840
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,680
thinking about this problem, I'd love to know how you would suggest someone who doesn't have quite

841
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:02,040
the Zen mindset that I can tell you do. What should someone else be thinking? Right off the bat,

842
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,480
I'm delighted to see that I have a persona of a Zen person. I'm actually like one of the most

843
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:13,240
type-A stressed people you're ever going to run across. I've spent 40 years professionally

844
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:22,360
studying how bad the outcome is going to be of all of these bad lifestyle aspects without having

845
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:28,520
anything insightful to say about how to actually fix it or prevent it. And I certainly have learned

846
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,880
personally absolutely nothing from my lifetime of work. I'm like incredibly stressed. I'm mostly

847
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,720
good at telling you what's going to happen if you don't get stuff under control rather than how to

848
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:45,160
get things under control. When I look at the stress management literature, I don't do it very often

849
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:54,360
because I tend to get sort of agitated at that point, but broadly it works. It works as in you can

850
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,840
lower blood pressure, you can lower cholesterol levels, you can lower subjective sense of health,

851
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:05,320
objective measures as well with all sorts of interventions. What you see when you look at

852
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:12,600
the literature closely, first off is you can't do your stress management on the weekends kind of

853
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:17,560
thing. It needs to be a regular sort of thing. You can't do it while you're on hold on the phone for

854
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:24,360
30 seconds. You need to set time out for it. The benefits of aerobic exercise, I don't know what

855
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:29,080
the magic number is these days, but 20 or 30 minute blocks is a minimum to start getting the

856
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:35,320
cardiovascular benefits. So it's got to be something like you stop things to do.

857
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,200
So that's important. Let's double click on that. What you're basically saying is,

858
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,200
because I think you're understating how much you know about this topic. Obviously,

859
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:47,880
it's something you know a lot about as seriously as we would take nutrition. And if you think about

860
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,640
how many hours a week do you put into eating? I mean, even if you're shoveling food down your

861
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,960
throat, it still takes quite a bit of time. If you're going to exercise to the levels that have

862
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,480
demonstrated benefit, we're talking about hours a week, not minutes a week. If you're going to

863
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,440
make the difference between getting by on sleep versus getting restorative sleep, I'm not talking

864
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,040
about the absolute amount of sleep. I'm just talking about the delta between those two.

865
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:16,840
Think about how many hours that is. In fact, for the average American, that would work out to be

866
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,880
about an extra seven to eight hours a week of sleep. And what you're basically saying is,

867
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:27,320
if you want to combat this hypercordous selebia dude, guess what? It ain't a 20 minute a week

868
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:35,160
thing. And in some ways that taps into one of the 80-20 rules of sort of mental health professionals.

869
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,960
Okay, so you have this crazy stressful lifestyle and there's just a bazillion things you can't say

870
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:48,760
no to and you're just going 24-7. And if you've gotten to the point of saying, this is crazy,

871
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:53,560
this is not a quality life. I want to live a healthy, quality old age. Well, I got to get

872
01:25:53,560 --> 01:26:01,400
this stuff under control. I'm going to start doing something stress managementy. And if you've gotten

873
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:06,120
to the point where in this lifestyle where there's a billion things you can't say no to each day,

874
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,640
you're saying no to them enough that nonetheless 20 minutes every single day you are doing this,

875
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:17,640
it almost doesn't matter what intervention you're doing. You're 80% of the way there already

876
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,160
if you're managing to do that. And that's very similar to this sort of amazing classic finding.

877
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,720
You get people who are clinically depressed and finally, finally, finally, they're going to do

878
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:34,120
something about it and merely making a first appointment. Even before you've seen the person,

879
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:41,000
people feel significantly better because you are finally saying, I matter enough to do something

880
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,040
about this or I'm activated enough or I'm optimistic enough to actually go. You're halfway

881
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:53,560
there at that point merely by doing something on a near daily basis. So just on that logic,

882
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,760
even though I don't know that this has been done, you would argue that 10 minutes of deliberate

883
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,720
mindful practice of meditation daily would probably be better than one hour once a week.

884
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:12,360
Absolutely. In part because if nothing else, if you do it daily seven times a week, you were sitting

885
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:19,080
in the aftermath of having done that versus only one time a week and an awful lot of what's most

886
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:24,840
interesting about physiology and its impact on mental health, things like that is what's happening

887
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:32,440
in the recovery period after something like that. In the same way, one awful hour long stressor a

888
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:38,680
week versus punctuated episodes of it throughout the week without question, the latter is worse

889
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:44,360
because you've now got umpteen different times that you have to recover from having turned on

890
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,920
the stress response. And that's where a lot of the damage occurs. I learned something about

891
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,160
myself that's going to sound so stupid because it's so obvious. Although I don't think it's true

892
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:59,720
for everybody, email is a huge stress to me. To be blunt, I hate it. That would be the kindest thing

893
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:07,240
I could say about email. I really a few months ago hit a true nadir in my response and I'm like

894
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:12,680
looking at these glucose levels going up and I'm looking at these morning glucose levels. So even

895
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,320
though my overall glucose levels still look great, I mean this trend was upsetting to me. I'm watching

896
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:22,680
my resting heart rate in the morning go up. Over the course of four months it had gone up like

897
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:28,440
six beats per minute and if anything I was in better shape exercising more regularly.

898
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:34,760
I made this observation one day which is how many times in a day do I stop to look at email,

899
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,720
even if it's just to check one or two? And the answer was like 50.

900
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:45,080
And every time I do it to your point, even if it's very brief, the after effect is not that brief. So

901
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,840
I could look at an email and see two stressful things but it might sit with me for 20 minutes.

902
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,960
So I tried this experiment which is I'm going to just check email twice a day,

903
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:07,320
two 30-minute blocks of email and I would say within two weeks I just really felt better.

904
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:12,360
It seems to me like we just have to figure out ways to figure out what those

905
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,360
triggers are for us individually. There's probably some people for whom email doesn't trigger them

906
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:24,600
at all. For me Twitter doesn't trigger anything because A, I have a very narrow window that I

907
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,080
pay attention to and it doesn't involve things that are aggravating like politics or religion

908
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,960
or whatever. It just sort of I'm only really following science. So anytime I look at Twitter

909
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,640
I'm actually learning something kind of new but I'm sure there are many people listening to this

910
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,720
who would say oh my god, if I spend an hour on Twitter my blood pressure could be through the

911
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,360
roof. So it's like everyone's got to kind of pick their thing. You said you're type A which obviously

912
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,720
you are. I mean you know what I didn't say at the outset when we started speaking but you've won

913
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:54,840
one of the most prestigious awards imaginable which is the MacArthur award and you won that

914
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,560
about 30 years ago, right? That's impressive. They don't give that award out lightly so that's the one

915
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:04,440
that's referred to as the Genius Award and I know you're probably like your skin is crawling when I

916
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:10,360
say that. My point being is you're an incredibly accomplished successful guy. It's not surprising

917
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:15,080
you would describe yourself as a type A. What have you learned about yourself over the past

918
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:20,600
30 years or even longer going back to your first days in Kenya about what those triggers are for

919
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:26,680
you and what you can do to lower your cortisol levels? Not surprisingly if you hang out with

920
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:34,200
people who are field biologists of any sort and again I've only been a part-time annual one over

921
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:41,080
the decades but nonetheless still think of myself as a field biologist. We're kind of a solitary

922
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:48,360
tribe. I mean during my peak periods of doing field work I'm spending three, four months a year alone

923
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:55,800
living in a tent where 12 hours a day I wouldn't say a word to another person. Temperamentally this

924
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:01,480
is kind of who I've been for a long time and there was always this ironic thing because I was sitting

925
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:09,560
there studying these baboons because I'm interested in primate social behavior and there's big sort

926
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:14,840
of epiphany I had in my work that okay your social rank as a baboon has something to do with your

927
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:20,680
health but much more importantly is your patterns of socialization and social networks and how often

928
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:26,200
do you groom and how often does somebody groom you and how often do you sit in contact with

929
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:31,000
another baboon or playing with an infant and then I finish the day's work and go back to my tent.

930
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:37,000
So there was something ironic that I was like studying the health benefits of sociality,

931
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,600
living alone in a tent, a large part of the year. Your wife is a scientist too isn't she? She was,

932
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:48,200
she kind of decided she was sick of it and she now directs a musical theater program which is

933
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:55,000
much more fulfilling for her but at one point my wife came along. Yeah yeah that's what I was going

934
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:02,760
to ask. And eventually family and you know kind of realizing oh I've missed out on an awful lot

935
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:10,440
of what are really like the wonderful worth living for moments in life out of the sociality stuff

936
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:18,680
and that is a refuge and a sanctuary from the world's madness and I could not have predicted

937
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:23,800
as a 20 year old who had been planning to be a field biologist for a dozen years at that point

938
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:31,720
I could not have predicted sort of how much of my equilibrium at this point turns out to be due to

939
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:39,240
interacting with the right two or three other primates like being in love with them and stuff.

940
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:45,480
That one was kind of a revelation for me. I am not the social being that I would have guessed I would

941
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:52,360
have been back when. Which is interesting because having this discussion with you today I can sense

942
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:58,760
much more of your introversion than the first time we met when you were giving an unbelievably

943
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,960
charismatic animated talk and I don't know how many of us were there maybe a hundred people and

944
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,200
which is so interesting right because you would I think anybody sitting in the audience would look

945
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,680
at this and say oh that's that's the life of the party but it's interesting that we can compartmentalize

946
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,880
and separate those things right I mean you couldn't get up there and you can do what you need to do

947
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:20,520
and you're at your happiest I'm guessing in the way you described it versus in the aftermath of

948
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:25,480
that talk when a hundred people run up to you to ask you four questions each. Not to get too

949
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:31,160
self-reflective or something but I'm a fairly introverted person who does better with scripts

950
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:40,360
and giving a lecture is a pretty structured script and having sort of an academic persona

951
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:45,560
or whatever is another version of it as well. What year did you become a full professor at Stanford?

952
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:53,400
It was 33 or something early 90s. I mean you live in San Francisco so you're not making that commute

953
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:59,480
every day I hope. Nope but I did for about a quarter century. Yeah that'll that'll hurt the

954
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:04,840
cortisol levels won't it? I used the commuter train caltrain here. So you could read and

955
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:10,120
I loved it I loved this was much of it was before cell phones. So you'd pick it up at fourth and king

956
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:14,040
and you'd just go yeah I used to make that ride all the I used to have a girlfriend that lived in

957
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:19,640
San Francisco and I loved that train ride and then you get off on your bike at fourth and king

958
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:24,920
and you could go anywhere in the city. Exactly I wrote half my book writing was on the train there.

959
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:31,160
It's pretty weird when you realize that like one of your valid social communities or the conductors

960
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:37,800
on caltrains or as you're watching them grow up on you and things like that but yeah no that was

961
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:45,320
I was a big fan of train commuting. So speaking about books let's talk about your more recent

962
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:53,320
book. It's about human behavior which you know I mean I can see based on this discussion now how

963
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:59,240
your interest would shift to that. What was the impetus for that research? Well title is behave

964
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:05,160
the biology of humans that are best and worst and sort of as we were talking about before I closed

965
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:12,680
my lab four years ago and stopped active research to sit for four years and write this book and it's

966
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:21,080
basically trying to make sense of the biology of what is for me the most puzzling thing about us

967
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:28,920
as a behaving species which is we are simultaneously the most miserably violent species on earth

968
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:37,400
and the most altruistic and cooperative and empathic and any given human is capable

969
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:45,400
depending on the setting of incredible gyrations as to whether they are being wonderful or awful

970
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:51,320
or in between or behaviors where whether that counts as good or bad is incredibly dependent

971
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,360
on what culture they happen to be doing it in. Just trying to make sense of the biology I mean

972
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:03,400
totally boring biology as to like how your brain makes you do something like pull a trigger like

973
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:10,040
which muscle groups have been told like that's that's like studying cockroach neurobiology.

974
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:15,640
What's totally interesting is the fact that we're a species we're sometimes pulling a trigger can be

975
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:20,600
one of the most awful things a human can do and sometimes it could be one of the most wondrous

976
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:28,040
ones if you're suicidally drawing fire from innocent people and you're sacrificing yourself

977
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:34,040
or in one setting you put your hand on somebody else's and that could be a moment of incredible

978
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:39,880
compassion or in another moment you do the exact same thing with your primate muscles and that's

979
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:47,160
the first step of betraying a loved one of just making sense of this contextual stuff about human

980
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:54,120
behavior which is hugely complicated and the song and dance that I go through in nearly 800

981
01:36:54,120 --> 01:37:00,680
agonizing pages in the book is you're going to understand nothing about that if you've concluded

982
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:08,040
aha we now know this is the part of the brain that explains everything or this is the neurotransmitter

983
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:15,080
or the hormone or the gene or the child instead to make sense of human behavior you got to factor

984
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:21,320
in what your neurons did one second ago but you got to factor in the environmental triggers of that

985
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:26,440
30 seconds ago and you've got to factor in what your hormone levels were like this morning

986
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:31,800
and what neuroplasticity you've done over the last two seasons and what your adolescence was

987
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:37,720
like in your childhood and your fetal life and your genes and amazingly what sort of culture

988
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:43,240
were your ancestors inventing centuries ago because that influenced the way you were raised

989
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:49,960
within minutes of birth and what things you value and what things your amygdala does or doesn't

990
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,200
respond to and all the thing of that what sort of ecosystems produce different types of cultures and

991
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:03,640
then finally evolution and why we're in some ways like chimps and in some ways like bonobos

992
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:08,520
but we're not chimps we're not bonobos we've solved our own special evolutionary like you've

993
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,400
got to understand this stuff it's everything from one second before to a hundred million years before

994
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:19,400
and all these levels interact and it's complicated as hell. When people ask the question which I'm

995
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,720
sure you've heard this a hundred times and you hear people asking all the time are we innately

996
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:30,040
good or bad that question doesn't really permit the level of nuance you're describing the answer

997
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:38,520
is yes. Yes exactly and what's most startling about us is most of us have the capacity to do

998
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:44,200
something that we would be stunned and sickened that we were capable of doing it and most of us

999
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:49,480
are capable of in some circumstance of doing something that is so damn heroic and most of

1000
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:54,760
us spending most of our time doing things that instead are ambiguous and multi-layered and full

1001
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:01,400
of ulterior motives and what's really going on there and you look at the worst of us and the best

1002
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:07,320
of us and there's not a whole lot of really reliable predictors beforehand. And how much of

1003
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:13,640
this like you know you wrote a little bit about PMS so when I think about PMS I think about it

1004
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:19,240
purely through the lens of the endocrine system right I think of it purely through the lens of

1005
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:27,160
when a woman is in her luteal phase that progesterone level has to rise for the placenta

1006
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:32,200
and then of course virtually every time it's a false alarm you don't need it you shed that

1007
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:38,120
lining and that progesterone level comes crashing down and it's this crashing down a progesterone

1008
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:44,440
that has always interested me why two women could experience the same we can measure progesterone

1009
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:50,280
levels throughout the cycle and we could know that at day 22 two women could have the exact

1010
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:54,440
same progesterone and on the first day of their menses they could have the same progesterone so

1011
01:39:54,440 --> 01:40:00,120
you know they had the same peak to valley and yet two women can experience that in two totally

1012
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:05,640
different ways now I've thought about that through the lens of progesterone receptors and you know

1013
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:10,440
the way we sort of talked about the cortisol stuff is there something else to that that you layer on

1014
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:17,720
top of that that is even more subtle about those differences yeah tons of this sort of additional

1015
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:22,760
insights here's one example that comes completely out of left field and this was actually my my

1016
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:30,440
wife's thesis research on baboons so your female baboon and you're coming up on your period

1017
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:36,520
and we could frame it as you just did here's two two females who are both about to have their

1018
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,000
period and they have the same exact progesterone levels and as soon as they start menstruating

1019
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:48,040
progesterone drops in the exact same way and one of them is a totally irritable awful like

1020
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:53,480
jerk to all the other females around her for three days afterward and the other one is not

1021
01:40:53,480 --> 01:41:00,040
the other one withdraws and becomes socially isolated okay what's the difference it sure can't

1022
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:03,960
be progesterone levels and it's probably not going to be progesterone receptor levels it's

1023
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:10,520
one of them's high ranking she could afford to be a jerk to everybody else and get away with it

1024
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:17,080
the other one's low ranking oh it's not just your hormone levels it's what sort of position in your

1025
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:24,760
society you have even if you're a baboon or now you look at humans and depending on what sort of

1026
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:30,600
culture you're in are you in an individualist culture or a collectivist one individualist

1027
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:37,160
the united states poster child of individualist thinking collectivist 99 of the research has been

1028
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:46,120
done on east asian cultures and how you somaticize your mood shifts and your physical shifts during

1029
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:52,600
your period differs in collectivist versus individualist cultures how irritable you become

1030
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:59,160
not because there's a difference in how much of negative affect you're feeling during the time

1031
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,960
are you in a culture where it's culturally acceptable to bitch and moan to all your best

1032
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,600
friends when you're not feeling well or are you in a culture where when you're feeling lousy what

1033
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:14,600
you're supposed to do is reach out affiliatively and reify your like social values and how much of

1034
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:21,800
that do you think is also genetic so for example i mean even though i'm not a gynecologist and

1035
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:29,800
therefore don't see a lot of this i see enough to realize that women will often say my sister and my

1036
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:35,160
mother either go through or went through the same feelings and of course as you described there are

1037
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:40,520
so many different variants the stereotypical one is the you know the sort of the nasty phenotype

1038
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:46,760
but actually the one that i think might be more prevalent is the sadder phenotype the more

1039
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:52,440
emotionally distraught just emotionally labile but in a non-aggressive way that's probably the

1040
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:57,880
phenotype i see more easier to cry or something like that so how much of that do you think is

1041
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:04,600
heritable in the way that eye color or some other aspect of body habitus or even depression is quite

1042
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:12,120
heritable versus the ecosystem you're in purely environmental well the answer is you really can't

1043
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:16,920
choose one of the other blah blah but if you could only manipulate one which would be the first one

1044
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:25,320
and i'm definitely of the school of genes get overrated in terms of their impact and you know

1045
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:31,400
a gene affecting your eye color it's okay to use words like determine and it's probably not even

1046
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:38,520
100 accurate but when you get to genetic influences on all the interesting stuff and behavior and our

1047
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:45,560
internal lives and all of that yeah genes are important but overwhelmingly these are genes

1048
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:54,280
that modify vulnerability vulnerability to certain types of environments okay so for example

1049
01:43:54,920 --> 01:44:03,240
you bring up depression and catastrophic pandemic of that and you know there's a whole shopping list

1050
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:08,360
by now of genes that have been implicated and probably the single most important one it's called

1051
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:15,960
the gene for the serotonin transporter serotonin ssris prozac although the serotonin was just like

1052
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,280
we're right in the middle of what we understand about the neurochemistry of depression and it

1053
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:26,120
turns out the serotonin transporter gene comes in a few different flavors a few different genetic

1054
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:35,480
variants and a ton of basic research rats monkeys etc suggested that if you had one particular variant

1055
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:43,000
you were more at risk for major depression okay so this classic work this guy a duke off shalom

1056
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,320
kasbe who's sort of a god in the field goes out and he follows like 17 000 people from birth up

1057
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:55,160
to age 25 or so he's got genetic information on them and he's able to ask this critical question

1058
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:01,240
okay if you have the quote bad version of this gene by age 25 are you more likely to have the

1059
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:05,560
history of clinical depression and what's the prevalence of the gene approximately depends on

1060
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:11,240
the population in his population his was a mixed one but westernized western urine populations

1061
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:17,800
i think it's got about a 20 percent incidence so the question then is of those 20 percent how many

1062
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,760
go on to get depressed of the 80 percent how many go on to get depressed the answer is very likely

1063
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:27,960
going to be it's not a one-to-one mapping it might be an increase in risk by some factor

1064
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:34,840
and what they saw was overall there was no increase in risk having the bad variant however

1065
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:42,280
if it was coupled with a lot of childhood stress you had about a 20-fold increase in the risk

1066
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,120
so just to be clear on aggregate there was no difference the hazard ratio is one

1067
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:54,680
for with gene versus without because of a ton of variability but if you wanted to amplify it take

1068
01:45:54,680 --> 01:46:00,680
that gene and expose it to childhood stress or trauma and you almost assure depression you get a

1069
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:06,760
massive boost in predictability look at people without the scariant vulnerability variant and

1070
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:11,880
look at the same severity of childhood stressors and loss and you got a moderate increase in

1071
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:19,560
incidence of depression these folks massive order of magnitude multiples of that more increase there

1072
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:27,000
what that tells you is this is a gene whose variants alter how readily you deal with

1073
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:34,360
experiential kicks in the asses growing up and it turns out these different variants are regulated

1074
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:39,720
in different ways by glucocorticoids aha so there's a stress angle all of that the same way

1075
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:43,080
there's another gene to the people who are interested in the genetics of aggression

1076
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:50,200
this gene monoamine oxidase and it comes in variants and it's and there's a class of drugs

1077
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:56,600
that targets these yeah perceptors yeah again a ton of basic research had suggested oh there's a

1078
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:01,720
scary variant of it which if you have it you are good at more being more predisposed towards

1079
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:08,120
violence and in fact the same group working with the same population massive data set winds up

1080
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:15,000
showing just having that variant doesn't get you a higher risk of antisocial violent behavior by

1081
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:24,200
age 25 if and only if it was coupled with abuse childhood abuse growing up oh if you didn't have

1082
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:29,880
the scary variant childhood abuse a little bit of increased risk have this variant with the abuse

1083
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:35,800
and it was virtually the same figure as with the serotonin transporter gene huge boost in very

1084
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:42,200
over and over the genes that are interesting when it comes to this stuff these are all genes about

1085
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:49,960
vulnerability and potentialities and tendencies that are emerging only in certain environments

1086
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:56,200
and not in others their factors are inseparable it makes me think of the apo-e genotype which is

1087
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:03,320
linked to alzheimer's disease and there we see that there is a difference about 25 percent of

1088
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:09,240
the population carries at least one copy of that gene and they represent about two-thirds of the

1089
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:16,600
cases of alzheimer's disease it's not a deterministic gene but it does increase risk now of course you

1090
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:24,360
could argue that maybe in a decade or more we will be able to say something very similar about apo-e

1091
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:31,720
which is it's not remotely deterministic it only gets turned on when x y and z happen before

1092
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:37,400
this period of time or in absolute and of course we don't know what those things are right now

1093
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:44,360
at least in the examples you gave you could say well trauma or childhood you know some event in

1094
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:48,840
childhood was was the trigger and if you're seeing a 20-fold difference it's pretty clear

1095
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:54,440
that you found the trigger nonetheless there's still variability to explain after that but yeah

1096
01:48:54,440 --> 01:49:01,000
it's pathetically that counts as virtually state of the art for understanding the modifying factors

1097
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:08,360
and it's it's going to be that way i mean anytime you do these like gewass massive fishing expeditions

1098
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:17,400
and you come out with 300 genes are implicated in a trait that's as boring as height 300 genes

1099
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,880
which you put together all of your knowledge of the variation of them in any given individual and

1100
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:28,440
you have like four percent predictability of their height you know christ if you're talking about genes

1101
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:36,120
for propensity towards feeling poignancy or genes for like anything that's interesting yeah

1102
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:41,800
this is not a chance even if you just limit yourself to diseases you know of the 20 000

1103
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:48,760
genes in our body you can really only point to about a hundred that are directly this mutation

1104
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:55,800
means this disease and they're all pretty esoteric right it's all like inborn errors of metabolism

1105
01:49:55,800 --> 01:50:00,680
and certain things like that but when you start to talk about the complex diseases like alzheimer's

1106
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:06,920
disease even as predictive as the apo-e4 is it's not even close to being enough to understand it

1107
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:11,320
and and i think yeah it's funny when you talk about it through that lens you realize the importance

1108
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:15,080
of environment which is you know the risk of stating the obvious you said something a while ago

1109
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:20,520
that i made a note of because i wanted to come back to it you talked about the effective glucocorticoids

1110
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:26,200
on the hippocampus and not only how harmful it was for memory consolidation but overall

1111
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:32,680
cognitive impairment and listening to you talk about that was exactly the way matthew walker

1112
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:39,000
at berkeley speaks about sleep deprivation and its impact on the hippocampus which then makes me

1113
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,080
wonder i assume it's been well studied that you know when people are sleep deprived we see greater

1114
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,000
elevations of cortisol do you have a sense of what the evolutionary basis of that is because

1115
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,800
it seems counterintuitive you would think even evolution would want that to be in the opposite

1116
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:58,680
direction i mean the only explanation i can come up with is if you're sleep deprived you're assuming

1117
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:03,000
that there's a reason for it that's good and therefore you want that of course not with any

1118
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,240
the fact that higher cortisol will then i think that's probably the best sort of piece of teleology

1119
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:15,640
for that yeah if you're like a basic mammal which means either you are emphatically diurnal or

1120
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:21,880
emphatically nocturnal and if instead you are wide awake eight hours into what should be the

1121
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:27,960
twelve this does not happen by chance the odds are you have something stressful going on i think

1122
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:37,320
that's the logic of it turns out the stress sleep sleep quality cortisol cluster of interactions

1123
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:43,400
even more subtle incredibly cool study this was a science paper some years back

1124
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:51,720
that okay so as we talked about the circadian peak of glucorticoids are around the time you wake up

1125
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:58,120
what's interesting is about an hour before you wake up levels begin to rise telling you something

1126
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:04,760
a subtle point which is a lot of glucorticoid actions are not for dealing with a stressor

1127
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:11,400
that has already commenced but can be preparatory so the preparatory stressor is having to actually

1128
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:17,080
get up and get out of bed and start functioning addressed in an hour before people wake spontaneously

1129
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:22,120
glucorticoid levels are elevating now in the study what you do is you take a whole bunch of

1130
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:27,320
volunteers who are sleeping and you see the preparatory rise all of that and you tell them

1131
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:31,480
tonight we're doing something different i'm going to wake you up at four in the morning

1132
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:38,920
and what you see is around three o'clock glucorticoid levels start rising okay now you do something even

1133
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:44,760
more interesting you say okay tonight i'm not going to tell you when but i'm going to wake you

1134
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,480
up at some point during the night and that's the end of your night's sleep and the person is about

1135
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:56,440
90 minutes into their sleep stage and all of that and cortisol rises and stays high for the rest of

1136
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:02,040
the night you get one sleep cycle and then the adrenal gland says that's it i'm on ready alert

1137
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:09,000
yeah exactly so not only is it bad not to get enough sleep not only is it bad if the insufficient

1138
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,600
sleep is fragmented but the worst is if it's fragmented unpredictably and that's like every

1139
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:22,840
medical resident in history it's the first thought i had actually when you said that which was

1140
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:28,280
every night of call you have this pager and you're in this call room and you just want so desperately

1141
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:34,040
to sleep for an hour two hours three hours i remember as my residency went on the the degree

1142
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:39,560
of sleep deprivation got greater and greater that the steps i had to take to ensure i wouldn't sleep

1143
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:43,000
through a page got greater and greater and i'm not making this up i've nothing i've ever told

1144
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,400
the story before it's so ridiculous i used to use this really heavy paper tape and tape the pager to

1145
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:56,520
my head my forehead at full volume because you would get both the sound to your ear and then

1146
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,680
you'd get the transmission you know through the bone but imagine laying in bed with tape wrapped

1147
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:09,160
around your head holding a pager on your forehead in anticipation of what's coming not knowing when

1148
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:14,360
it's coming it could be in five minutes or it could be in two hours you know you're going to wake up

1149
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:21,160
yeah i'm i'm guessing that wasn't great sleep it's like wildly destructive and what do you know

1150
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:28,280
it turns out if you have elevated glucorticoid levels while you're asleep you have less delta

1151
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:34,040
sleep time which is the restorative stuff you make less adenosine stores in your brain during

1152
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:39,560
so even if you manage to go to sleep if it's under the i could be asleep for two hours now

1153
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:45,960
or 30 seconds the sleep quality is going to be horrible this interplay becomes more pronounced

1154
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,840
what about cancer what role do you think stress plays in cancer and do you think it's mostly

1155
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:56,040
mediated through the immune system i mean cortisol can be quite damaging yeah all right

1156
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:04,840
hugely hugely controversial subject there is a common perception that stress can play a very

1157
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:11,800
substantial role in the onset of cancer in coming out of remission and rates of tumor growth and such

1158
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,640
sufficiently so that there's been all sorts of studies where you ask cancer patients what do

1159
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:21,640
you think is the cause of your cancer and stress is invariably way up there the actual evidence for

1160
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:29,800
a role of stress in causing cancer bringing it out of remission accelerating tumor growth

1161
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:37,240
is very very minimal there's been a remarkably small number of good prospective studies of humans

1162
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:43,320
that have really truly ruled out all the confounding factors when you look at the animal studies what

1163
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:50,040
they typically involve is you experimentally induce a tumor you inject transformed cells you

1164
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:56,200
give a carcinogen some such thing my lab back when did some of that work under those circumstances

1165
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:01,800
you can accelerate the growth of a tumor but those are circumstances of cancer acquisition

1166
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:06,280
that are virtually irrelevant to human cancer and the other question is can you do it without

1167
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:11,240
perturbing other things so for example if you go ahead and stick the tumor into the mouse

1168
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:17,640
and apply a stress to it it seems that that by definition will alter some other parameter

1169
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:22,760
what it eats how much it sleeps the quality of its sleep so it becomes difficult to disentangle

1170
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,840
cortisol i mean i guess the only thing i can think of is what does the experiment look like

1171
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,720
where you take the mouse that experimentally has the tumor and you just start injecting more

1172
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:36,360
glucocorticoid so in other words you don't actually increase the stress level you just

1173
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:41,640
increase the readout state of stress you accelerate the tumor growth we did one study

1174
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:48,040
showing that as soon as cells become transformed they up regulate the glute four glucose transporter

1175
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:54,200
and that's the one that's further up regulated by glucocorticoids and target cells so you're just

1176
01:56:54,200 --> 01:57:01,160
shoveling energy over those cells yeah which preferentially consume glucose anyway just given

1177
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:05,640
the number of them followed by the warburg effect so to me even though that's very mechanistic and

1178
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:11,240
artificial that that strikes me as pretty reasonable evidence that cortisol can play a

1179
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:16,040
role in cancer i mean i guess it's going to be much more difficult to disentangle that in the

1180
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:24,120
real world yep and again these are types of cancers where this was virally induced transformation of

1181
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:30,600
cells that are then transplanted very artificial systems that turn out not to be terribly applicable

1182
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:38,840
to puma cancers and what you wind up seeing then okay yes glucocorticoids can be potently

1183
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:44,520
immunosuppressive usually by the time you have a tumor growing that's long past the point where

1184
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:51,320
it's an immunological problem it's now can you keep the tumor from growing a whole bunch of

1185
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:57,400
capillaries that will feed it can you keep it from stealing all sorts of energy can you keep it from

1186
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:04,680
turning off cell death programs it's no longer in the immune realm so it seems that there'd be

1187
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:10,280
hard to make the case that acute bouts of stress can really have any impact because you know yes

1188
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:15,240
sure you can acutely disrupt the immune system and maybe get sick right that you know i could

1189
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,560
explain why you might get a cold under a period of great stress but not necessarily cancer

1190
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:26,920
and what that means is that should be a massive massive take-home message for anyone who's

1191
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:34,440
predisposed towards thinking ooh stress caused my cancer too bad i didn't have better priorities in

1192
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:39,400
life now i know whose fault it is that sort of thing and it should certainly make you damn

1193
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:46,760
cautious if there's some highly credentialed quack out there who is selling a stress management will

1194
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:52,440
stop your tumor will make it disappear entirely and you watch your wallet at that point all that

1195
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:58,920
being said there's been some wonderful work and a lot of this was pioneered by a stanford colleague

1196
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:06,920
of mine david speagle who showed that things like supportive group therapy among cancer patients

1197
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:11,720
enhances survival so what do you think is the mechanism of that okay this was when he first

1198
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:16,200
published this in the late 80s this was front page news i remember this i mean i don't remember when

1199
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:20,360
it was published but i remember learning about it in medical school massive finding and one is

1200
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:27,880
immediately tempted to at least as a biology type like me to come up with a biological explanation

1201
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:33,320
along the lines of what you proposed okay supportive group therapy you're less stressed

1202
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:38,680
so you don't secrete as many glucorticoids and therefore you're not having those adverse effects

1203
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:42,920
of it on your immune systems you're better able to fight the tumor you live longer trellis and lower

1204
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:47,400
glucose levels and lower glucose and lower insulin and lower ig if you could you could come up with a

1205
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:53,560
complete biological and in general those studies have shown that pathway does not occur speagle and

1206
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:59,320
i did some of those studies things so what's actually going on something which if you're a

1207
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:06,680
nuts and bolts reductive bio type person is terribly disappointing but is so interesting

1208
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:13,880
and important people when they have supportive cancer therapy with other people going through

1209
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:20,280
the same hell they become more compliant when they're medical regimes they're more likely to

1210
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:25,560
go the extra round of chemo because everybody else is cheering them on saying i didn't want to do it

1211
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:31,880
either and they're more likely to take the meds that make them nauseous as hell have you eaten

1212
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:37,640
today me neither we're going to eat right after we're done with the group have you taken your meds

1213
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:43,480
you're going to take them right now people become more compliant and that was very hard to demonstrate

1214
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:50,840
because what cancer patient ever wants to admit to a researcher actually i skip about a third of my meds

1215
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:57,880
because they make me feel so damn sick they're saving your life would it's in some ways a dark

1216
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:05,480
dirty secret in cancer therapeutics how much people diverge from their optimal treatment regime

1217
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:10,360
because the treatment regimes are sheer utter hell when you're surrounded by people who are

1218
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:15,720
going through the same thing and understand you're more likely to be compliant i think that

1219
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:22,280
winds up explaining an awful lot of that effect so when you look at cancer atherosclerosis and

1220
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:29,880
neurodegenerative disease it seems to me that the direct lines of evidence for the damage of

1221
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:36,280
hypercorticillemia and the accelerated stress response are probably most demonstrated in

1222
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:41,400
cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis vis-a-vis several mechanisms not the least of which is

1223
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:47,480
hypertension both macro and microvasculature but also through endothelial disruption adhesion of

1224
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:53,720
cells and sludging and yeah it's the best understood realm cancer is probably the weakest realm

1225
02:01:54,280 --> 02:02:00,040
i would expect that it's playing a role in dementia but again this probably gets to the

1226
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:06,600
layer of susceptibility right there's probably in isolation maybe this wouldn't play a role but

1227
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:12,840
in combination with other factors it would and it seems that for example we know that

1228
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:18,680
cortisol inhibits melatonin secretion so even if you take two people who have the same amount of

1229
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:24,280
blue light reduction which should therefore stimulate melatonin the one with hypercorticillemia

1230
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:28,760
is going to and we actually measure this right we can measure overnight urinary cortisol and

1231
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:34,920
overnight urinary melatonin you can see this association quite strongly well melatonin it's a

1232
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:42,120
pro-neurogenic molecule so having less of that is less restorative to the brain even beyond its

1233
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:47,560
important role which is sort of removing the brakes on being awake so what other lines of

1234
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:52,360
evidence do you see beyond what you've already described at the developmental stage now later

1235
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:58,600
in life basically everything we talked about with the hippocampus applies in the adult brain as well

1236
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:04,600
and it's the first place we tend to see changes and it was the first area researched first evidence

1237
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:09,240
for stress damaging the hippocampus and hippocampal dependent memory type stuff

1238
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:18,040
late 70s i mean that was really the first domain and superb studies from a number of groups and

1239
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:23,560
i had my two cents and that would return also showing you could accelerate aspects of hippocampal

1240
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:29,720
aging with lots of stress lots of glucorticoids extensive neuron loss extensive memory problem

1241
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:36,440
extensive reactive gileosis etc etc next big outpost that people began to appreciate

1242
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,840
in adult brains was derivative of what we talked about before which was the amygdala i was just

1243
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:46,600
about to say is there a direct correlation i guess between amygdala size and dementia

1244
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:52,920
what you see instead is that the syndrome where it's most demonstrated is ptsd

1245
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:59,720
you see expansion of the amygdala and you see atrophy of the hippocampus and glucocorticoids

1246
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:05,480
probably play the driving role in both so in the amygdala like the hippocampal story is stress and

1247
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:10,840
glucocorticoids screw it up neurons don't work as well networks don't work as well the overall size

1248
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:17,880
decreases you had atrophy in the amygdala it's the exact opposite story neurons work better than

1249
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:24,760
they should neurons become more excitable form denser networks the amygdala gets bigger what's

1250
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:30,040
that about the problem with chronic stress is your memory goes down the tubes hippocampus isn't

1251
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:34,920
working as well as usual the problem with chronic stress and the amygdala is it works better than

1252
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:41,400
it's supposed to and this is the link between stress and anxiety disorders stress and fear

1253
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:47,560
stress and all of that next sort of outpost that people started looking at was the dopamine system

1254
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:54,280
in the brain and dopamine neurotransmitter most famously associated with reward pleasure

1255
02:04:54,280 --> 02:05:00,360
cocaine works on the dopamine system a much more accurate subtle picture of it is dopamine is

1256
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:06,600
actually more about the anticipation of pleasure than it is about pleasure itself and about goal

1257
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:12,600
directed behavior you're willing to do in anticipation of reward but then a whole literature

1258
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:18,120
showing what distress and glucocorticoids do there they mess with the dopamine system it's

1259
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:24,840
less clean of a story than amygdala or hippocampus but in ways that predispose towards the two big

1260
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:31,960
psychiatric diseases of screwed up dopamine systems number one addiction more vulnerability

1261
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:38,600
to addiction harder to get off of addictive substances number two depression depression is

1262
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:44,200
a disease of on a certain level dopamine depletion it's a disease of inability to feel

1263
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:50,760
pleasure and hedonia and that's the neurochemistry of the link between chronic stress and why that

1264
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:58,040
increases the likelihood of the first three four episodes of major depression what for me is the

1265
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:04,600
most exciting area is one where if i was starting over you know forget the hippocampus who cares

1266
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:10,280
about like how many digits you could remember backwards or whatever the most interesting domain

1267
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:18,520
is turning out to be what stress and glucocorticoids do to the frontal cortex judgment impulse control

1268
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:27,080
executive function long-term planning strategizing and it turns out virtually every bad thing

1269
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:32,040
cellularly that stress and glucocorticoids do in the hippocampus they're turning out to do in the

1270
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:39,560
frontal cortex as well and what does that begin to explain this entire world of why it is during

1271
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:46,440
moments of extreme emotional arousal especially aversive ones why we make terrible terrible

1272
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:52,840
decisions that seem brilliant at the time and you spend the rest of your life regretting it because

1273
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:59,240
impulse control your amygdala overpowers your frontal cortex at those times your amygdala has

1274
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:04,680
a lot more talking to your motor systems than your frontal cortex does it's the reason why

1275
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:12,360
judgments and impulse control become terrible when we're frazzled it's also looking like as

1276
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:18,040
a side story with that it's one of the reasons why when we're very stressed it's hard for the

1277
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:25,720
frontal cortex to do one of its harder jobs which is to take the view of the world from somebody

1278
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:34,520
else's perspective empathy empathy exactly some research on animal models of empathy and this was

1279
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:39,080
worked with this guy at McGill named Jeffrey Mogul and where I collaborated with him

1280
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:45,320
showing in both rats and humans you're a lesson pathic towards strangers when they're in pain

1281
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:50,520
and if you block glucocorticoid release you don't get that effect anymore

1282
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:59,000
glucocorticoids the stressfulness of dealing with scary novel humans or scary novel mice

1283
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:07,080
if you're a rodent glucocorticoids narrow your window as to who counts as an us and whose pain

1284
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:12,440
registers and things of that sort so for me you know it's incredibly interesting if you're stressed

1285
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:19,480
and suddenly your SAT scores plummet the fact that stress makes people crappier to each other

1286
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:25,560
and less empathic and more parochial and more xenophobic and more impulsive with the worst of

1287
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:30,920
our impulses that's the stuff that really interests me these days everything you just said

1288
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:36,840
robert is almost a call to action in criminal justice reform and i've done a podcast on this

1289
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:41,960
topic where you know i was very fortunate to go into a maximum security prison with a program

1290
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:47,320
that is really there to do incredible rehabilitative work led by this woman named katherine hoke

1291
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:52,920
it's a humbling experience there's a game that we played about halfway through the day called step

1292
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:58,440
to the line this is a game that's used to basically identify the vast difference between those of us

1293
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:05,000
who are volunteers like in other words the role of luck in our lives versus the gentleman who two

1294
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,960
thirds of these men are never going to get out of prison one man had even spent more than half his

1295
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:15,880
life in solitary confinement his total life so it starts with these questions of step to the line if

1296
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:20,840
you grew up in a home that had two parents and you know of the volunteers you know 60 step to the

1297
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:25,720
line of the inmates five step to the line right step to the line if you grew up in a home where

1298
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:31,800
there were more than four books you can imagine the disparity step to the line if you saw someone

1299
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:37,240
die with your own eyes before this age step i mean and it's it's a very emotional thing to go

1300
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:44,280
through because as this game is unfolding you're just you're feeling more and more fortunate on

1301
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:50,920
the one hand because you realize if not for the the grace of this luck and at the same time the

1302
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:56,760
empathy you have for these men who have done the most heinous things grows and you start to realize

1303
02:09:57,480 --> 02:10:03,640
boy there's a fine line between those of us on the inside those of us on the outside

1304
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:09,240
because everything you said really resonated when i was thinking about some of the stories the men

1305
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:14,040
told us about the decisions that they made and there's this one part of the exercise that's

1306
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:20,120
incredibly emotional where you're partnered with one one guy so it's it's one volunteer one inmate

1307
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:24,680
and you were each telling the other person the greatest regret of your life the biggest

1308
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:32,040
mistake you've made and hearing some of these stories it's not to justify anything that's been

1309
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:38,520
done and it's not to say that there shouldn't be consequences for it but a lot of these things that

1310
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:48,440
people have wound up in prison for are really impulsive horrible decisions as opposed to decades

1311
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:54,600
of sinister planning it's one thing to look at what you know like hitler did it's hard to argue

1312
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,160
that anything that he did that was bad was impulsive it's quite another thing when you look at someone

1313
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:05,240
in a gang related incident where you know this guy gets shot and you're going to shoot this guy

1314
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:11,560
back or this guy's about to shoot you and you shoot him i mean and yet that type of drug related

1315
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:18,360
violence is disproportionately represented in certainly in the u.s penal system and then to

1316
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:24,760
build on what you said it's not clear that the environment in there is reducing cortisol levels

1317
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:30,600
to the level that would enable rehabilitation which is really the thesis of and a lot of people

1318
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:35,560
i'm sure listening to this are thinking why would you feel empathy for these folks that are in there

1319
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:40,840
and why should society care about them but the reality of it is if they're going to get out you

1320
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:46,440
should care that says nothing of maybe the higher level that you should care which is the injustice

1321
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:52,040
of it but even if you took a purely selfish view a non-trivial number of these men and women are

1322
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:57,640
going to get out so wouldn't you rather they get out and function better and yet it's really

1323
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:01,640
tragic to see this and i i know two people actually very well who spent a great deal of

1324
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:07,000
time in prison one of whom i interviewed on this podcast his name is cori mccarthy and it really

1325
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,560
strikes me as the exception and not the rule that people are able to emerge from that environment

1326
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:21,560
and go on to be successful outside it's a system that is so so broken any study the last century

1327
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:28,680
and a half's worth of neurobiology and genetics and child development and all of that

1328
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:37,240
and the notion that we are free agents of our action is so destructively misplaced i'm sure

1329
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:42,280
you're familiar with the work of sam harris sam has been one of the most interesting forces in

1330
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:48,360
my life at getting me to really even question this notion of free will and once you realize that

1331
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:54,360
free will may not even be yours it takes luck to a new level it's something i spent a lot of time

1332
02:12:54,360 --> 02:13:01,480
thinking about now what advice would you offer somebody who is interested in the neurobiology

1333
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:09,320
of stress or behavior and who wants to be able to look back when they're your age and be as you

1334
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:13,080
know maybe accomplished as the wrong word i don't want i know you you sort of bristle at that but

1335
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:17,480
to have made as many contributions as you've made i mean what in retrospect was sort of the secret

1336
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,560
to being able to pursue your bliss and be as successful as you've been and and look frankly to

1337
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:25,560
be where you are and to still have the passion that you have for what you're doing which to me

1338
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:30,520
is really the marker of success it's that you're sitting here saying there's this other problem and

1339
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:35,400
i you know like i could spend you know the next 20 years just thinking about that how do you think

1340
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:43,880
about how you've done that just damn luck every bit of neurosis every bit of affective instability

1341
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:50,280
i've got every childhood trauma i've got tucked away i've titrated in just the right way that

1342
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:57,960
i've turned it into more productivity and incredibly lucky in that regard in my capacity to

1343
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:05,880
sublimate emotion into intellectual pursuit into really really really wanting to understand

1344
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:13,640
something into i've just been very lucky on that regard i've gotten just the right levels of all

1345
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:22,440
sorts of like tumult and that have synergized most productively in other words just huge amounts of

1346
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:35,000
luck huge amounts of luck and at least now coming later in life an increasing capacity to more

1347
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:42,520
carefully try to analyze what cost each type of ambition comes with hmm say more about that oh i

1348
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:49,720
don't know this had much to do with my closing my lab four years ago a big booming lab with lots

1349
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:55,160
of people and all sorts of labs around the world we were going to kick the asses of by getting the

1350
02:14:55,160 --> 02:15:04,040
answer to this or that and you know if if you're raised in the right sort of rarefied ambitious

1351
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:11,800
world of biomedical research at age 25 you've got a list down to the floor of the diseases you're

1352
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:16,840
going to vanquish and the the problems you're going to solve and all of that and you know

1353
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:20,760
getting to that point in life where you're realizing it's not going to happen is that what

1354
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:28,440
actually happened four years ago was it that much of a cerebral realization or was it combined with

1355
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:32,920
other factors you know you've described obviously having this network of people around you who matter

1356
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:37,880
the most and i mean was part of it just thinking i haven't spent enough time with them at the expense

1357
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:44,600
of this or was it the this problem is enormous and when you know a thousand years from now whether

1358
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:50,120
i worked this much harder or this much less it won't have altered the trajectory of x-ray like

1359
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:58,280
i mean how much of it is all of these holy above family growing up real fast as they tend to do

1360
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:05,000
realizing your best work was decades behind you realizing there's this book you want to write

1361
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:11,400
where the only way you can do it is to just sit for really long stretches kenyon field work having

1362
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:18,920
collapsed a few years before body feeling older limits to how many 80 hours of work a week you can

1363
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:25,080
do all of them converging what i mean such a cliche question what advice would you give the

1364
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:32,520
the 25 year old robert as he was just finishing that phd at rockefeller be less ambitious

1365
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,480
well i think on that note which by the way i think is some of the greatest advice one could

1366
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:44,760
ever get and receive and those of us who are still on the climbing ambition curve should do

1367
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:49,480
everything to listen to it i want to i want to thank you so much for taking the time to sit down

1368
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:53,560
with me and more importantly i think for just all of the work you've done and you're continuing to do

1369
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:56,760
thank you so much no thanks for having me on this has been

1370
