00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,480
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Rick Johnson. Rick is a professor of medicine in the

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,560
Department of Nephrology at the University of Colorado, where he's been since 2008. He's

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,240
basically spent the last 17 years being a division chief across three very prestigious medical

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,200
schools. He's unbelievably prolific as an author. He has well over 700 approaching 800 publications,

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,120
seemingly every week in JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine, Science, et cetera. He's

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,520
lectured across 40 countries, authored two books, one of which we discuss in great detail in this

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,800
podcast called The Fat Switch, which he wrote about seven or eight years ago. He's been funded

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,840
extensively by NIH and in fact has received the most prestigious grants that NIH has to offer.

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,680
His primary focus in research has been on the mechanisms causing kidney disease, but it was

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,400
doing this that he became really interested in obesity, diabetes, heart disease. What connected

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,640
me to Rick, I guess about seven years ago now, maybe a bit longer, was his work on fructose

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,640
and fructose metabolism. That's really what we talk a lot about in this podcast. We start by

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
talking about high blood pressure, the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, which is

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,920
something that is incredibly controversial. I actually learned a lot in this podcast. I'm

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,640
really glad we had this discussion because I thought I had this thing figured out in it. I

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,880
clearly don't. We talk about one of the most interesting bifurcations in evolution with

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,400
respect to an enzyme that allowed us to use fructose in a certain way that was obviously

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
advantageous millions of years ago today, not so much. We talk a lot about uric acid,

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,520
which you've probably heard me talk about on other podcasts. This will then be the master's

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,960
class in it. We talk about artificial sweeteners and we touch on some of the most promising ideas

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,280
around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of metabolic disease,

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,880
especially in response to sugar. This episode gets a little bit deep on some of the biochem.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,560
We're going to have obviously the show notes will as usual provide a great background analyst

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,480
of references. I hope you enjoy my discussion with Dr. Rick Johnson.

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:03,800
Hey, Rick. Thanks so much for opening up your office today and making time.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,680
It's great. I'm very happy to have you here. I've wanted to sit down with you for about a year in

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,280
this format because I guess we've probably known each other for maybe about six years now. Every

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,440
discussion has been one of those discussions where at the end of the discussion, I think,

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,360
man, how am I ever going to remember all of this stuff? How will I be able to synthesize this to

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,600
translate it into what I'm doing? I've said this many times before, but that is the whole reason

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,680
that I started a podcast was I just found myself every week having a discussion with someone,

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,080
usually scientists, where I thought, this is something that's got to be shared. You would

41
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,040
certainly be one of the three or four people indirectly that was a real catalyst for the

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
podcast because of the frequency with which we would either have these dinner discussions or

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
discussions over the phone. Anyway, for that, I want to thank you and hopefully the listeners do

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,800
as well. In the introduction, I've set this up a little bit as to why this is such an important

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,160
discussion. Because there's so much to talk about, I just want to jump right into the meat of things.

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,720
It would be not an exaggeration to say you were one of the world's experts on fructose. I guess

47
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,480
I would just start with the why. Where did that interest come from? You've obviously been doing

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,440
this for a long time and that passion has been sustained. So what brought you to this point?

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,080
Well, I'm a kidney doctor. So normally we wouldn't be studying sugar. So it was kind of a circuitous

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,520
way that I got there. I was very interested in the cause of high blood pressure and had been

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,680
known for a long time that high blood pressure is linked with kidney. And in fact, the going theory

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,720
is for years was that the kidney in high blood pressure has a defect in its ability to excrete

53
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,360
salt. And so that you end up retaining salt and that leads to elevated blood pressure. And when

54
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,920
we were studying trying to understand how the kidney handles salt in high blood pressure and

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,680
so forth, we were trying to understand potential pathways. And we stumbled on the fact that

56
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,680
hyperuricemia or elevated uric acid could be a very significant risk factor for high blood

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,840
pressure. And when we started studying uric acid, we realized that when you raised uric acid in

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,120
animals, they developed high blood pressure. From there, we started to try to understand what made

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,360
the uric acid go up. And we knew from the literature that sugar and particularly fructose

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,880
raised uric acid. So we started studying fructose and pretty soon we were so excited about what we

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,000
were finding that we just kind of changed our research direction to focus more on how fructose

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,520
has all of its metabolic effects. Well, there's a lot to unpack there. So let me kind of go back

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,360
to bits of it. You sort of gloss over the fact that the conventional approach to high blood

64
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,400
pressure is that sodium is the culprit. And isn't it still safe to say that most advice around

65
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,680
reducing blood pressure comes down to reducing sodium intake? Well, we've actually been studying

66
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,200
this pretty extensively. There's a lot of pearls I can teach you, or I can talk about related to

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,920
salt. And when I was in training, I was taught that you restrict a certain amount of salt, you

68
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,520
should be on a low salt diet as a mechanism to prevent high blood pressure. It was always about

69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,240
the amount of salt. In fact, we were teaching that for a long time that if you want to have a low

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,760
blood pressure, you should restrict your salt intake. Or if you want to try to treat your high

71
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,120
blood pressure, you should restrict your salt intake. What's happened in the last couple decades

72
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,360
has been the increasing knowledge that it isn't really the salt amount that makes a difference,

73
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:53,320
but the salt concentration. So when you eat salt, like if you eat a salty soup, the salt concentration

74
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:01,200
goes up in your blood first. And it translates into a thing called osmolality. And so your serum

75
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,680
osmolality goes up. So osmolality is sort of like the ionic pressure build up in a fluid? Is that a way

76
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,280
to... It's sort of like the number of molecules in a set of volume. So literally, when you eat salt,

77
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,000
if it's really salty, let's say you have a serum sodium concentration of 140 millimoles per liter,

78
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,080
if you eat a really salty soup, your serum sodium may go up to 142 or 143. What looks like pretty

79
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,040
insignificant, but that actually is what triggers a rise in blood pressure. And so we've actually

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,200
done the study where we took people and gave them soup with or without salt. And when they

81
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,720
drink the salty soup, their serum sodium goes up and their blood pressure shoots up.

82
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
How much would a person's blood pressure go up if their sodium went from 140 to 142?

83
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,720
It's about six millimeters. Okay. So they'd go from 120 to 126. Yeah. And that happens

84
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,200
acutely. And how long did it take to resolve? Maybe a couple hours. So if we give, and we did

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,320
this study, we published it last year, if you give salty soup with water so that the serum sodium

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,840
doesn't go up, they got the same amount of salt, guess what? The blood pressure doesn't go up.

87
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,680
And the serum sodium, does it so not go up or does go up? Right, right. It does not go up. So if you

88
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,560
block the serum sodium from going up. So basically the closer you can bring the total

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,720
accumulated concentration of what you ingest down, the more likely you are to prevent this

90
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,080
transient rise in serum osmolality and blood pressure. Yeah. Well, it turns out that serum

91
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,520
osmolality has a real major role, not only in blood pressure, but also in obesity. And we're

92
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,840
going to talk about that in a second. But when you take a high salt diet and your serum sodium

93
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,080
goes up, it triggers a rise in blood pressure and it's working through the brain and actually

94
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,320
through the liver and other sites too. Pause for a moment. Tell the listeners why it would be

95
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,680
better to have a blood pressure of 120 over 80 than 140 over a hundred. Well, there's a pretty

96
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,160
good epidemiologic data that shows that when your blood pressure is high, that you have an increased

97
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,440
risk for heart failure and stroke. Those are the two major ones, but it also increases the risk

98
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,760
for heart attacks and heart disease in general. Interestingly, there's a very significant

99
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,200
inflection point. And what I mean by that is when the blood pressure gets around 160 to 180, right

100
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,920
in that range, the risk for stroke goes significantly up and the risk for mortality goes up. And that's

101
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,160
because our body tries to auto regulate to blood pressure. So when the blood pressure goes up,

102
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,560
for example, the kidney, the arterioles will constrict to reduce the pressure load to the

103
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,880
kidney. But when it gets to about 170, it will overcome that restriction and the blood pressure

104
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,760
will injure the kidney. Likewise, the brain kind of responds to flow more. So it tries to maintain

105
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,840
blood flow. But if the pressure gets high, it tries to protect itself from the high pressure

106
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:11,880
by constricting. But when the pressure is like 170, the risk, it can't constrict enough. And you

107
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,720
don't want it to constrict that much because it has to maintain flow. And so the pressure ends up

108
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,760
increases to the brain and increases the risk for stroke. Now, current guidelines seem even more

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,840
aggressive. We would manage class one hypertension. We would consider something in the mid 130s to be

110
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,320
treatable. Yeah. So let me get there. So originally, when the studies came out, it was very,

111
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,760
very clear that if your blood pressure was like 170 or higher, that you had a dramatic increased

112
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,800
risk for stroke. And that's because it would pass the auto regulatory point. But then what happened

113
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,640
was epidemiologic studies showed that even a blood pressure of like 140 over 90 conferred increased

114
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,280
risk. It just was much less than the 170. So at 170, it just takes off, it's almost the line goes

115
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,720
up vertically. But between 140 and 160, there is still a stepwise increased risk, but it's just

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,880
kind of a more gradual risk. In fact, for things like a stroke, you can start showing an increased

117
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,240
risk from 120 over 80 to 140 over 90, leading people to view 120 over 80 as kind of the optimal

118
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,800
blood pressure. As you get older, if the blood pressure is really low, you lose your auto

119
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,360
regulation for low blood pressure. And so it increases the risk for kidney disease and

120
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,240
problems as well. So you don't want to be extreme on either end, especially as you get older.

121
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,400
This whole thing's kind of such a, it's a real clinical mystery in some ways still, because

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,720
in medical school, we learn about this term called essential hypertension, which is kind of a

123
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,840
wastebasket term for hypertension or high blood pressure for which we don't have an obvious cause.

124
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,600
The problem is, and so having sort of that wastebasket term would be okay if it accounted for the

125
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,080
minority of cases, but then you get to the clinic and you realize everybody walking around with high

126
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,400
blood pressure basically is getting labeled as having quote unquote essential hypertension.

127
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,520
So it really is this epidemic without a clear description. Now we're going to come to a lot

128
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,360
of reasons that, I mean, I think you have arguably one of the most compelling cases for what is at

129
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,760
the root of essential hypertension. But for people listening to this, for doctors listening to this,

130
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,720
who treat hypertension, I feel like we just haven't made much progress in the 20 years since

131
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,280
I've been out of medical school. There have been some real breakthroughs in the understanding of

132
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,600
primary hypertension just in the last five, 10 years. And there's two major aspects I can talk

133
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:44,120
about. The first one is that it does appear that salt really is important. And one of the key

134
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:54,760
discoveries was that the kidneys are often normally handle salt fine, but they develop or acquire a

135
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,240
change in the kidneys that lead them to hold on to sodium. And the mechanism has been identified

136
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,360
just in the last few years. It's due to the fact that there's an inflammatory inflammation that

137
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,160
occurs in the kidney. And that inflammation, which is driven by T cells and macrophages,

138
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,200
causes a constriction of the blood vessels that leads to low grade ischemia in the kidney. And

139
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:30,200
that ischemia can translate into increased sodium absorption, which then leads to high serum sodium

140
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,960
and the effects. Is there a correlation between serum, sodium and blood pressure across normal

141
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,920
physiologic ranges of say 135 to 145 milliquivalents per liter? Yeah, I believe so. I'm not sure I can

142
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,840
quote the paper, but yes, I think that's true. So what you're saying is in people with high

143
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,440
blood pressure that's otherwise viewed as quote unquote essential, there's an inflammatory response

144
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,480
mediated by both T cells and macrophages that injures the kidney ischemically, meaning it for

145
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,280
the listener that results in reduced blood flow and tissue damage due to reduced blood flow and

146
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,840
reduced oxygen. And it's that injury that then leads to aberrant retention of sodium. So there's

147
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,040
actually been really a lot of studies looking at the mechanism of the inflammation. And originally

148
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,400
it looked like it was people thought it might be a reactive response of the kidney. So we think that

149
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,760
there may be external stimuli that initially cause a decrease in blood flow to the kidney,

150
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,160
like a sympathetic nervous system response. You can do it transiently by giving medicines or

151
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,000
drugs that can cause a constriction of blood vessels. When you do that, you get a transient

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,280
reduction of blood flow to the kidney that induces an inflammatory response that then causes

153
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,800
persistent reduction in blood flow. And what we've learned in the last few years, and I'm an author

154
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,200
in one of these studies, is that this inflammatory reaction can actually be an autoimmune reaction.

155
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,800
And we've even identified certain proteins that there's an autoimmune response to, and one is a

156
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,400
heat shock protein. You can actually create high blood pressure in animals by inducing

157
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,480
an immune response to this. And you can block the immune response and block the high blood pressure.

158
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,400
And now there's even data showing that in humans that there's evidence for an autoimmune response

159
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,240
to heat shock proteins in people with essential hypertension. Which is not to say heat shock

160
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,280
proteins are necessarily bad because so many of the benefits we get out of sauna or exercise

161
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,360
may be transmitted through these. But you're saying in a subset of people where the heat shock

162
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,880
protein itself becomes the nidus for inflammation via an autoimmune mechanism.

163
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah. So heat shock proteins are great, just as you say. They do all these really good things.

164
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,200
But what happens is they're involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins and they're

165
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,080
helping keep a clean system. But what happens is when you trigger injury to the kidney, for example,

166
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:04,040
these heat shock proteins get produced to help fix problems. But the immune system can sometimes get

167
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,200
confused and make an immune response that actually is against the heat shock proteins. And when that

168
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,640
happens, you can develop high blood pressure in the animal and there's some evidence for it in humans.

169
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,240
Anyway, so that's one of the big breakthroughs has been the discovery that inflammation in the

170
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,760
kidney can be a mechanism for triggering persistent elevations in blood pressure and

171
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,280
probably has a big role in the cause of primary hypertension.

172
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,240
Before you go on, Rick, how prevalent do you think that particular mechanism is that you just

173
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,040
elucidated?

174
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,080
Oh, it's very major. In fact, we've even looked at genetic polymorphisms that link with the

175
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,960
development of primary hypertension and most of them are involved with the immune response. And

176
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,680
it looks like this is a major pathway.

177
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,880
This creates a bit of a quandary for someone who's trying to rid themselves of hypertension,

178
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,160
because wouldn't the implication of this be that exercise or things like exercise that induce heat

179
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,000
shock proteins may paradoxically increase their hypertension?

180
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,600
I don't think so. So hypertension is kind of a complicated pathway. So there's several different

181
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,640
aspects, but exercise is extremely good for improving mitochondrial function, improving the

182
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,680
ability for your blood vessels to dilate. It improves kidney function. The benefits of exercise

183
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,480
are so much greater and releasing heat shock proteins that really occurs with very, I don't

184
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,880
know if just general exercise would have a big effect on heat shock proteins.

185
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,960
So you're saying basically the net effective exercise is still going to far outweigh.

186
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,200
Yes, absolutely. But I'd like to get back to the link between salt and sugar, if I could.

187
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Okay, because there is this data, as I say, that salt, when it increases the serum sodium,

188
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,760
is what drives the acute blood pressure response. And when the kidneys have trouble getting rid of

189
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,400
salt, it's easier to get that effect with a salt load. But even with a normal person, you can,

190
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,480
with normal blood pressure, you can raise their blood pressure transiently by giving them salt,

191
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,760
and you can block it by giving water. Interestingly, in the process of developing

192
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,600
high blood pressure, there's the initiators. And then there's the things that make it persistent,

193
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,200
and the inflammation in the kidney is involved in the persistence. But what is involved in the

194
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:37,880
initiation turns out that sugar has a major role. And what we discovered is that when you give a

195
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,880
high salt diet to animals, that the high salt increases the serum sodium. And the serum sodium,

196
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:53,560
when it goes up, it activates an enzyme that converts glucose, which is in our blood and in

197
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:02,680
our tissues, to fructose. And that conversion to fructose is driven by a high salt diet. And it's

198
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,880
driven by an increase in serum osmolality or increase in serum sodium. Once the fructose is

199
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,080
made in the body, so this is not fructose coming from the diet, this is made in the body,

200
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:23,240
the fructose gets metabolized and raises blood pressure. And when we gave high salt to

201
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,400
animals, they developed an increase in blood pressure. And they also were making fructose.

202
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,560
And when we block the metabolism of fructose, we actually block the rise in blood pressure,

203
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,120
as well as the hypertrophy of the heart. So let's pause for a moment. I've had Rob Lustig on the

204
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,240
podcast before, so anyone who's listened to that will be familiar with what fructose is, what glucose

205
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,560
is, what sugar is, all of these things. But can we spend one minute just defining these things for

206
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,480
people who haven't listened to that podcast? Sure. So there's different types of sugar. And

207
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,520
the main one that we call blood sugar is glucose. And this is the primary sugar that our body uses

208
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,960
to make energy. It's the main sugar that's used to make energy and it can be stored

209
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:18,200
in the tissues as glycogen. And when it's too high, we call it diabetes. When the blood glucose

210
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,640
is too low, it's hypoglycemia. And so glucose is like the principal energy fuel, the carbohydrate

211
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,600
fuel that we use. And as you said, we store lots of it in our muscles. Once it gets in the muscles,

212
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,960
it can't get out. And we store maybe a quarter to a third of it in our liver. And that's mostly

213
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,640
there to buffer the blood supply, in particular the brain. What does glucose taste like? A pure

214
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,400
drink of glucose. People like it, animals like it, but it isn't as sweet as classic sugar. But it is

215
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,960
often very much like by animals, humans like it. You can buy these dextrose pops and stuff like

216
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,800
that. Dextrose is another word for glucose. And also the kidneys store glycogen and produce glucose

217
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:11,560
too. The second type of sugar is fructose. And the best way to think of fructose is it is a fuel

218
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:18,920
first off it's present in fruit, but it turns out to be the sugar that is involved in energy storage

219
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,720
rather than energy production. And so when you eat glucose, you use that to produce energy, but when

220
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,440
you eat fructose, it will actually trigger changes in the body that will favor the storage of energy.

221
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,400
And this is the sugar that animals use to store energy. So and you store it in the way of fat,

222
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,640
in the way of glycogen and all those kinds of anything that will facilitate storing energy

223
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,440
is done by fructose. And fructose and glucose, if you were looking at pictures of them in a

224
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,120
biochemistry book, look pretty similar. They're both ringed carbon structures. They both have six

225
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,920
carbons. One of them has a five ring versus a six ring. But you know, it's sort of interesting to

226
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,360
think that molecules that look almost identical with the exception of a couple of bonds different

227
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,440
can have quite different properties. Now, fructose tastes a lot sweeter as well.

228
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes. And so fructose is like in honey and in fruits. And then that's right. So it tastes a

229
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,280
lot sweeter. And the other thing is if you mix the fructose and glucose together, you can get what's

230
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,960
called high fructose corn syrup. And if they're bound together, you get table sugar. So table

231
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,600
sugar or sucrose is one molecule of glucose and fructose bond together. And that occurs in nature

232
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,040
and sugar cane and beets and things like that. Yes. And maple syrup and things like that.

233
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,240
Right. So just to clarify for everybody, when we get a little comfortable with this terminology,

234
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,440
throw the word sugar around quite liberally, but it's always important for people to think when we

235
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,840
talk about sugar, we could be talking about blood sugar, glucose. We could be talking about

236
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,320
fructose by itself. Oftentimes when we talk about sugar in diets, we're talking about added sugars,

237
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,920
such as the sucrose and high fructose corn syrup you just alluded to. I want to go back to what

238
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,320
you just said about the ability of fructose to store something. But if you don't mind, can we

239
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,320
do it through the lens of a beautiful story that you've written about in the past about a mutation

240
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,440
that basically allowed that to happen? This thing that took place about 12 to 15 million years ago?

241
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:32,920
Sure. So fructose again is a, it's in fruit and many, many animals use fructose as a means,

242
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:40,760
as their primary nutrient or, and also as a way to help store fat. And for example, animals before

243
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,440
they hibernate will often eat a lot of ripe fruit and the ripe fruit gives them the sugar that allows

244
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,240
them to store fat. And orangutans will eat huge amounts of fruit at one setting to try to increase

245
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:00,280
their body fat. And we don't get fat from eating fruit, but that's because we eat tart fruit that

246
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,760
has less sugar content and we tend to only eat a few fruit. Whereas if we actually drink fruit juice,

247
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,440
that large amounts of fruit juice can actually increase fat. So anyway, so fruit is a nutrient

248
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,080
that is used by animals to help store fat. So if you go back about 20 million years ago,

249
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,600
the very first fossil apes show up in the world and they show up in West Africa. And the original

250
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,360
one was called Proconsul. They were living about 22 million years ago and they were, these apes were

251
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,880
big breakthrough in evolution because the prior, the monkeys were, had already been around, but

252
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,920
these were bigger creatures. The apes were, they had bigger brain size. They were tailless,

253
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,840
but they did live in the trees and they lived in tropical rainforest and woodland rainforest.

254
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,840
And they would eat primarily fruit and they were quite successful. And by about 18 million years

255
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,960
ago, there were almost at least 10 to 20 species of ape that were living in this area of Africa.

256
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,440
There was a change in climate. There was some global cooling and the Antarctic started building

257
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,200
up ice and the Arctic started building up ice and sea levels fell. And when the sea levels fell,

258
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,320
land bridges developed that connected Africa, which had been separated from the other continents.

259
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,200
These land bridges opened up so that there was now a way to get out of Africa and to Europe and Asia.

260
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,840
And many, many species migrated across those land bridges about 17 million years ago.

261
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,600
And some of them were the apes. And we see the first apes fossils in places like Pasalar,

262
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Turkey, and different places of Europe right around 16 million years ago. At that time,

263
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,160
there were still a forest that were fruiting trees, woodlands, there was fruit all year round.

264
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,280
And so the animals, when they moved into Europe, they didn't have to change their habits at all.

265
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,600
They were able to continue to eat fruit pretty much all year round. But unfortunately,

266
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,760
they continue to get cooler. And by 12 million years ago, the apes started to starve in Europe.

267
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,280
And you can tell that from the fossils because they actually have these

268
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,880
like tree rings on their teeth, developing teeth get this enamel. The enamel doesn't

269
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,560
lay down correctly. And they get these like tree rings that show intermittent starvation,

270
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,480
they would get a ring every time they would go through a period and the starvation was seasonal.

271
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,160
So it was during the cooler months when suddenly the fruit was not available. And the primary

272
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,680
reason was there was a loss of the fig tree. And the fig is a cool fruit that can fruit all year

273
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,320
round because the wasp that fertilizes the fruit does so at its own discretion. So the fruit will

274
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,520
have a fig tree kind of can occur all year round. So when the fig tree died, suddenly there weren't

275
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,520
too many, because of the global cooling, or perhaps it was the wasp, but the fig trees disappeared.

276
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:16,040
And suddenly these apes did not have enough food to survive during the cooler months, and they

277
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:23,960
started to starve. And by six to eight million years ago, the last ape became extinct in Europe.

278
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,000
But Africa, although there was global cooling there too, it wasn't as cold. And the fruit trees

279
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,080
survived all year round, the forest just retracted. So the apes there were able to maintain their

280
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,360
normal habits. Well, there was a lot of evidence that there was a lot of evolutionary change

281
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,760
occurring in our ancestors during this Miocene period, and this period of time when there was

282
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:57,160
the global cooling. And one of them was a mutation in uric acid metabolism. And as I mentioned,

283
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,680
sugar, and particularly fructose, when it's metabolized, generates uric acid. Glucose when

284
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:11,880
it's metabolized does not, but fructose when it's metabolized makes uric acid. And this mutation

285
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:19,000
led to a much stronger uric acid response to fruit, because this mutation was of an enzyme that

286
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,080
degrades the uric acid. And when you block that, and you eat fruit, your uric acid levels go up

287
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,760
much more. And this mutation basically allowed these apes to maintain a very prominent uric

288
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,920
acid response. Our group has shown that the way fructose stimulates fat, as well as its other

289
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,680
properties like insulin resistance and raising blood pressure, that those abilities are driven

290
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,240
in part by the uric acid. So when this mutation occurred, for the same amount of fruit, they were

291
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,520
able to store more fat. And so it was like a survival mechanism for this mutation. When it

292
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,440
showed up, it allowed apes that had very little access to fruit to suddenly maintain more fat

293
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,760
stores, and so they could live longer and survive those winters. And we were able to show with Peter

294
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:20,040
Andrews at the Natural History Museum in London, who studies these apes that this might account for

295
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,640
a very interesting finding. And the finding is that although we thought the apes became extinct

296
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,000
in Europe, and they certainly did become extinct in Europe, the fossil record shows that it was a

297
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,040
European ape that made it back to Africa, and also to Asia, to become our ancestors, as well as the

298
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,800
ancestors of the great apes that live in Africa and in Southeast Asia, like the orangutan, that

299
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:54,040
they all came from a common ancestor that was in Europe, and that went back to Africa. And we know

300
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:01,800
from the genetics that that ape carried the uricase mutation. And so this mutation probably

301
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:09,160
occurred at a critical time that provided survival for those apes in Europe to be able to get out of

302
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,320
there and make it back to these other regions. But it was now equipped with this mutation that made it

303
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:24,200
sensitive to sugar. And so humans are much more sensitive to sugar than most animals, and it's

304
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,280
because of this mutation. And in fact, we actually resurrected the extinct uricase and proved this

305
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,320
using the extinct uricase that showing that when you put it into human cells,

306
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,400
that it suddenly made us less sensitive to fructose. So the phenotype there, I mean,

307
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,880
I guess just to recap that story, which I find so fascinating, by the way, you guys wrote a story

308
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,400
about this in Scientific American many years ago, right? I know there was a paper that came out as

309
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,120
well. But I mean, that sort of the layperson version in science was really great. So basically,

310
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,480
these apes go from Africa up to Europe, it gets too cold, we sort of think they die out, but the

311
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,040
evidence emerges actually a sub sub subset of them developed the mutation in uricase, that gave them

312
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,920
a superpower, which was now they could be much more efficient at turning fructose into fat.

313
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,680
They had this little byproduct, which is they would also make a boatload of uric acid along

314
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,440
the way. But they actually came back to Africa and ultimately seeded the rest of the species. And

315
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,440
ultimately, that's why we as humans are among the very rare animals that have uric acid levels that

316
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,960
are quite high relative to cats and dogs, for example. Yes, that's exactly correct. So when we

317
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,920
were in medical school, Rick, we learned a lot about uric acid through the lens of a disease

318
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,880
called gout. And it didn't get a lot of airtime in school, maybe it gets more today. But at the

319
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,280
time, it was basically gout is a disease of civilization, it's from eating too much meat.

320
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,120
And there's no real problem with it, except for the nuisance of your toe hurts, because uric acid

321
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,160
crystallizes, it gets inside joints, it seems to favor the first joint of the great toe. And it's

322
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,600
a very painful inflammatory condition. And it's what happened to sort of the wealthy people of the

323
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,920
last few hundred years as they started getting and acquiring too much meat and protein. And that

324
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,720
was sort of the story. What you're describing is a little bit more nuanced. So tell us more about

325
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,760
uric acid. Yeah, so the big problem with having too much uric acid is gout, just as you say. And all

326
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,600
the animals that have the uric case mutation are prone to gout. But humans in particular are very

327
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,720
prone to gout. And it's because of our diet. So we do eat diets that are high in meat and purines that

328
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,880
increase our risk for gout. Can you tell folks what purines are specifically, since it always

329
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,160
shows up in this terminology? Sure. So we have proteins, we have fat, we have carbohydrates,

330
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:53,240
but we also have things like RNA and DNA and what we call nucleic acids. So these are the kind of

331
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:00,360
acids that are in the nucleus and that are also in the cell that help drive gene formation and

332
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,280
protein, you know, our genetic material and also help dictate the production of proteins. And so

333
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:13,640
DNA and RNA are made up of nucleic acids. And when they're broken down, they're made up of purines.

334
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,920
And then uric acid is appearing in it. It's basically the ultimate breakdown product

335
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:25,640
of DNA and RNA. So the reason protein consumption versus fat or carbohydrate would lead to this is

336
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,960
because if you're eating protein, you're eating the DNA and RNA that presumably were still in

337
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:37,160
that tissue. Yes. So the way you get gout from protein is from the DNA and RNA in the protein.

338
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,880
And so, and that relates to some extent to the how dense the nuclei are. And so like if you have

339
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:53,640
a very cellular thing like anchovies and these small fish that have lots of DNA and RNA,

340
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,600
if you have that, they will develop. You can get gout from that much easier than from other types

341
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:10,840
of meat. And so beer, for example, has brewers yeast and that is filled with RNA. And so that's

342
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,760
why beer can precipitate gout. Now I follow uric acid levels very closely in all of my patients

343
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,320
and myself. And there is an unmistakable difference between men and women, at least in my small

344
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,880
sample size of patients, where men on average have higher uric acid levels than women. Is that

345
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,640
true across the general population? Yes. Even in boys, they'll start to have a higher uric acid

346
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,280
than girls. However, after the menopause, uric acid levels go up in women. And that's because

347
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,320
estrogen helps excrete uric acid. So it's not, I had sort of, I guess, incorrectly assumed it was

348
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,840
that just unbalanced men consumed more protein than women. I think that also plays a role. I

349
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,000
think that's right. But it sounds like this estrogen explanation makes more sense if it

350
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,640
can also explain the observation of menopause. Yes. Going back, gout is also increased by sugar.

351
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:13,480
And even Sir William Osler, the famous physician from the 1890s in his book Principles and Practice

352
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:21,320
of Medicine, pointed out way back in the 1890s that sugar was a major risk factor for gout,

353
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,880
as well as very sweet fruits, he wrote. Anyone who's had gout usually will know that real

354
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,200
significant sweets can also precipitate gout. And the reason is because of the fructose content.

355
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,680
And when the fructose is metabolized, it generates uric acid. When people were developing gout in the

356
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:48,680
1800s, it was linked to the wealthier groups in England, for example, they were eating a lot of,

357
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,520
as you say, rich foods that included proteins and so forth. But one of the things they were eating

358
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,360
a lot of, they were drinking a lot of alcohol, to which they added sugar. I actually did write a

359
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,360
paper where we reviewed how much sugar was put in drinks, alcoholic drinks back in the 17,

360
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:13,480
the 1800s. And it was much more than today. They loved sugar. They put it in many of their drinks.

361
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,800
And in fact, I even have a picture of an old pub outside the Tower of London called the Sugar Loaf.

362
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,240
They talk about the old drinks that were served like hypocrites and some of these drinks and

363
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,080
sack and sugar was a name for a drink that they had. I mean, they added a lot of sugar to their

364
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:39,960
drinks. And so part of the rise in gout back in the 1800s and 17, 1600s relates to not only just

365
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,800
the alcohol and the rich foods, but also to the sugar they were adding. So you were sort of the

366
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,480
person who brought onto my radar that there are other things besides gout that one needs to be

367
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,000
concerned about when it comes to uric acid. And one of them is blood pressure. So how did that

368
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,280
understanding come about? So originally we were studying what causes high blood pressure. And

369
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,440
there was a lot of epidemiologic studies that linked uric acid with high blood pressure. And

370
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,080
as I mentioned, we also knew that there was subtle changes going on in the kidney associated with

371
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,760
high blood pressure. And people with gout often have low grade kidney disease. So I said, aha,

372
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,560
maybe uric acid could have a role in causing kidney disease through causing high blood pressure

373
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,920
through its ability to cause kidney disease. And so we took animals and we gave it this uric case

374
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,800
inhibitor to raise the uric acid of an animal. And by gosh, they developed high blood pressure.

375
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,360
And then we could lower the blood pressure by lowering the uric acid. And when we looked,

376
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,880
we were thinking it was might be like crystals of uric acid in the kidney.

377
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,960
But that was my thought is the crystals would cause the inflammation in the kidney. And that

378
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,480
was my thought too. We looked at the kidney, there weren't any crystals there. So then we realized

379
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,720
it was an effect of soluble uric acid. So we started putting soluble uric acid on cells and

380
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,280
so forth. And we saw that it had all these biologic effects. And we always thought uric

381
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,000
acid was kind of like a dead end product of something or even might be a good thing because

382
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,920
some people said it was an antioxidant, but it was causing pro-inflammatory effects. So then

383
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:29,880
we said, aha, fructose sugar raises uric acid. Maybe sugar could have a role in blood pressure.

384
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,680
What year is it that you're having that thought, Rick?

385
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,960
2002. We gave some animals fructose and they developed high blood pressure. And we gave them

386
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,680
alopurinol, which is a drug to lower uric acid. And it made their blood pressure go back to normal.

387
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,440
And it was like this big discovery. But what was totally exciting was these animals also developed

388
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,760
insulin resistance. They also develop elevated triglycerides in their blood. They had other

389
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,840
fatty liver. And when we lowered the uric acid, we showed benefits on all of those parameters.

390
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,000
How does alopurinol work? What's the mechanism by which it lowers uric acid?

391
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,160
It blocks uric acid formation. So uric acid is generated from other purines. And when we

392
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:28,200
blocked that, we blocked a lot of the effects of sugar to cause metabolic syndrome. And so when we

393
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,200
first did it, we said, ah, there's got to be something wrong here. So we repeated it and we did

394
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:39,560
it different ways and didn't matter. It looked like uric acid had a role in how sugar worked.

395
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,240
So as we studied this, we started realizing that the process by which uric acid is generated is

396
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,520
important in how sugar causes disease. No one believed us initially. I have to tell you that

397
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,720
everybody said, ah, yeah, sugar causes gout. But the idea that sugar raises uric acid that causes

398
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,720
gout, but the idea that sugar raises uric acid and that is involved in the obesity and the insulin

399
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,880
resistance, we don't believe it. What's happened since then is we've learned that the metabolism

400
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:22,600
of fructose is extremely different from the metabolism of glucose. The two look alike,

401
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:30,120
but when fructose is metabolized, there's this process that causes the energy in the cell to

402
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:36,040
fall before it goes up. So normally when you eat a calorie, when you eat any kind of nutrient,

403
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:44,520
we use it to make energy. That's what we do. But when you eat fructose, the energy in the cell

404
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,600
falls before it goes up. It's the only nutrient that lowers energy in the cell.

405
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,840
See more about what you mean by that. So are we talking about a cell in the liver, for example?

406
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,880
Yes. I'm talking about the cells that metabolize the fructose.

407
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,720
Okay. So we'll contrast it with glucose. So if glucose enters a cell,

408
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:09,240
it gets turned into pyruvate and ultimately ATP is made. So you're saying total energy goes up

409
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,640
as a result of metabolizing that glucose. So whenever you metabolize any kind of calorie,

410
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,760
any kind of food, you eat food, you're going to metabolize it to make energy. That's what we do.

411
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,640
We try to break down the food and we use it to make energy. That energy is called ATP and ATP

412
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,680
is the currency in our body that we use to make us run, walk, think, talk, everything.

413
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:43,960
So this ATP is pretty critical. But to make ATP, you have to spend a little of it to make it. So

414
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:54,520
the process of breaking down and metabolizing food or glucose or fructose requires spending a little

415
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,240
bit of ATP before you make it. Well, what happens is when you metabolize glucose, you do spend some

416
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:09,960
ATP, but the body has a system whereby feeds back to stop the process before any significant

417
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:17,160
ATP depletion occurs. So for example, there's an enzyme called phosphofructokinase that's used in

418
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:25,720
glucose metabolism. If ATP levels fall, that enzyme gets turned off to stop glucose metabolism

419
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,720
to allow ATP levels to come back up. But when fructose is metabolized, the enzyme that metabolizes

420
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:41,320
fructose is called fructose kinase. And when that metabolizes fructose, it consumes ATP in an

421
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:49,880
unregulated way. So if the cell sees a lot of fructose, the ATP levels can plummet by 40 or 50%

422
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:58,280
in the cell. And that signals a huge number of effects throughout the body. It's like a May Day

423
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,880
signal. It says, we're under attack, we're running out of energy. And so it switches the animal into

424
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,280
a condition in which they're trying to preserve their energy. So they reduce their metabolism,

425
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,920
they reduce their expenditure, they're resting the energy expenditure. They shut the energy

426
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:25,000
that they're eating, the calories they're eating into fat and glycogen as opposed to making more

427
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,400
ATP, they're trying to protect the body by putting you into a system where you try to store fuel.

428
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:38,920
It triggers hunger and thirst that makes you want to eat more. So you eat more to restore the energy,

429
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,200
but at expense that you're shunting much of it into fat and into fuel storage. So fructose turns

430
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,680
out to be used by animals as a mechanism to store fat. Normally, animals will regulate their weight

431
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,800
beautifully. They just maintain their weight normally. If you take an animal and you put a

432
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,920
tube down its throat and give it extra food to make it gain weight, if you take the tube out,

433
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,640
the animal will go right back to its normal weight. If you starve an animal, and so it's below its

434
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,680
normal weight, and then you let it just eat, it will eat back to its regular weight. But when it

435
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,720
wants to gain fat, it will do so usually through a mechanism that involves fructose. So what they do

436
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,120
is they, like a hibernating animal, will start eating a lot of fruit in the fall to increase

437
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:34,600
its weight and increase, induces insulin resistance. It gets hungry. It drops its metabolism so that

438
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,600
most of the energy it eats goes into fat. And the same thing with a long distance migrating bird,

439
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:48,200
they'll start eating fruit to get the fruit dose. And so this is a very common pattern. And it's

440
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,480
driven by that ATP depletion. And this is distinct, or in parallel, of course, to this uricase

441
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:03,080
mutation. So can you separate these two phenomenon? In other words, if you can restore uricase to the

442
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:10,840
non-mutated version, do you still have this problem around the ATP depletion? Yeah. So the ATP depletion

443
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:18,920
triggers a series of reactions. And what happens, what the key one is, not only does ATP decrease in

444
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:26,120
the cell, but intracellular phosphate also falls. And that activates an enzyme called AMP deaminase

445
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,960
that converts the broken down product of ATP, which is AMP, and it converts it to uric acid.

446
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,040
And that process has multiple steps. And we know that that whole pathway is involved in the

447
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:47,880
generation and stimulation of fat, insulin resistance, fatty liver, elevations in blood

448
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:57,480
pressure, a variety of effects. And that pathway is what seems to be critical for inducing obesity

449
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,960
from sugar. Let's go through that again, because that, what you sort of talked about at the very

450
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,200
end is effectively the thesis of your book, The Fat Switch. You explained what ATP is, adenosine

451
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,840
triphosphate. And the T of course stands for tri, there are three phosphates. It's the liberation

452
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:20,040
of a phosphate that is the production of energy. So when you need to breathe, you need to move,

453
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:28,600
when you need to do anything, you have to turn ATP into ADP. So the chemical reaction is adenosine

454
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:35,560
triphosphate becomes adenosine diphosphate, one phosphate escapes, and that's what gives us the

455
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:44,520
energy. Now that can happen again. ADP can lose one of its two remaining phosphates and become AMP,

456
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,320
adenosine monophosphate. What you said after is the really critical, critical piece of this,

457
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:59,160
which is when you have a molecule of adenosine monophosphate, it stands at a proverbial fork

458
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:08,040
in the road. It can either go down a path that is driven by something called AMPK or AMP kinase,

459
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:16,760
or it can go down the pathway of AMPD. Now let's go back to this point, because again,

460
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:24,520
it seems everything comes down to that choice. What happens if AMP goes down the AMPK pathway

461
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:32,200
versus the AMPD pathway? Yeah, so if it goes down the AMPK pathway, it actually is burning energy,

462
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,000
it's burning fat, it does a lot of really positive things. If it goes down the AMPD pathway, it goes

463
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,400
down a fat storage pathway. So it's their exact kind of opposites. AMPD, if you stimulate it,

464
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,720
it will cause insulin resistance and eventually diabetes. Whereas if you stimulate AMPK, you can

465
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:58,600
actually use that like metformin to actually treat diabetes. So that fork is critical. And what drives

466
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:05,480
that switch is the fall in intracellular phosphate. And the reason that phosphate falls is because

467
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,080
it's taken up in the fructose one phosphate, or it's taken up by fructose. So the fructose gets

468
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:17,960
phosphorylated by the ATP, and it becomes fructose one phosphate that sequesters phosphate. And there

469
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,040
is this process where both ATP levels fall and intracellular phosphate falls, and that triggers

470
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:31,720
this AMPD pathway. And if we interrupt the AMPD pathway, we can block a lot of the metabolic effects.

471
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,160
Do other animals also have this phenomenon? Oh yeah, no, we can show this, we actually showed

472
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,360
it in hibernating squirrels. So when a squirrel wants to gain weight, it will activate the pathway

473
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,920
for AMPD. When it's hibernating and burning the fat, it activates the AMPK pathway. I got it. So

474
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:58,920
even though humans and our most close descendants in primates have the uricase mutation, this

475
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,880
ability to toggle between AMPK and AMPD is unique to any species that has the potential to gain

476
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,520
weight and wants to use it to their advantage. Oh, absolutely. Part of the pathway through which

477
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,880
AMPD is working involves the generation of uric acid. So we know that the uric acid,

478
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:22,200
when it's going up inside the cell, is doing all kinds of biological effects, and the AMPD is

479
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,960
driving that. There may be other things besides the uric acid. So the hummingbird or the squirrel

480
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,720
can still store fat. They just don't get the bump in uric acid that comes with it because they don't

481
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,960
have the uricase mutation. Well, actually the hummingbird does have the uricase mutation.

482
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,120
Oh, really? Yeah. I don't know my evolution well enough. So birds have the uricase. Birds bifurcated

483
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,960
off after it. Yeah. Reptiles have the uricase mutation. Even dinosaurs had the uricase mutation.

484
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,520
Sue, the dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus rex actually had gout. I mean, that's got to be why Tyrannosaurus

485
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,480
rex was so ornery because if you think of the size of the T-Rex great toe, I mean, that would

486
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,200
be infuriating to every bronchosaurus out there. Yeah, I think so. He's eating too many of the

487
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,640
bronchosaurae. Sorry to get back into the minutiae of this, but it's important. You still have to

488
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,240
phosphorylate glucose during its metabolism. Why is it that the phosphorylation of glucose during

489
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,360
its metabolism to pyruvate doesn't result in a strong enough drop in intracellular phosphate

490
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:25,160
to cause the same problem? Because the reaction stops. Whenever the phosphate and ATP levels

491
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,360
start dropping a little bit. You have that auto regulatory thing with the... There's an auto

492
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,120
regulatory thing with it. The enzyme stops functioning. It's inhibited and then that

493
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:40,840
allows the ATP levels to stay normal. So here's a really cool follow-up of this and that is that

494
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:49,160
sugar is much more likely to cause obesity if you drink it rather than if you eat it. And the reason

495
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:56,760
for that is that when you drink a drink that has fructose in it, we tend to drink a lot in a short

496
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,280
period of time. So if you have a soft drink, you can drink... Not only does it have a lot of sugar,

497
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:10,680
but we tend to drink it fast. And so the concentration of fructose turns out to be

498
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,880
high when it gets to the liver and it's the concentration that triggers this reaction. So

499
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,600
if the concentration of fructose is really low, the ATP depletion may not be significant to drive

500
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,520
dramatic metabolic effects. But if the concentration of fructose is really high,

501
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:34,760
then you're going to get a big metabolic effect. So eating like a candy bar where it's coming with

502
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,160
lots of fat, lots of glucose, lots of all sorts of things, lots of protein. If it's like a Snickers

503
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,280
bar and it's got nuts or whatever, even if it's the same amount of fructose, even if you're talking

504
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:52,280
about 25 grams of fructose versus 25 grams of fructose, you would drink very quickly. You're

505
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:58,120
saying equal amounts of fructose can produce a different effect if both the speed and the

506
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,800
concentration with which they arrive at the liver are different. Yeah, it's the amount,

507
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,440
it's the speed, and it's ultimately how rapidly it's absorbed. So if you drink something,

508
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,800
if you take a lot of fructose, like, I mean, candy is very concentrated fructose. I mean,

509
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,480
if you eat that, for example, on an empty stomach, that will be absorbed faster than if you eat it

510
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,920
with oatmeal or something, you know, where there's fiber and so forth. And so the speed of absorption

511
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,680
and the makes a difference. So for example, if I was working for a high fructose corn syrup company,

512
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,320
and I wanted to prove that a soft drink wasn't bad, I could do a study where I would give the

513
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:45,880
soft drinks to people, but I would give it over, you're only allowed to make a tiny sip every 10

514
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:53,480
minutes. So it takes you three hours to drink a soft drink. In that case, the amount, even though

515
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:59,000
you're drinking a lot, the concentration may never be enough. You never let the phosphate depletion

516
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,960
get significant enough in magnitude that it really triggers AMPD. Yes, that's it. You know,

517
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,920
it's really interesting. I think of all the sugar, the pro sugar studies I've read that are funded

518
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,880
by the sugar industry. I don't think I've ever dug into the methodology to look at factors like that

519
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,920
specifically. Well, the other issue is like if you just take a single dose of fructose,

520
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:29,160
most of the metabolic effects are best seen like in the first four hours following the ingestion.

521
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,880
So the triglycerides go up and the uric acid goes up and the blood pressure goes up.

522
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,880
But if you just do a single dose study, if you then look the following morning,

523
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,480
or the effects have now kind of come back down, then you can't really show it. And a lot of these

524
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,160
studies, they design it that way. So they say, aha, fructose doesn't raise uric acid, but we

525
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:58,040
measured it after fasting overnight. But the surge in uric acid occurred earlier. So that's the

526
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:04,200
one common trick. So all these things you're talking about with fructose seem to fit almost

527
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:12,680
directly into the five characteristics of metabolic syndrome, which are elevated glucose.

528
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:18,360
So that insulin resistance would be manifested as an elevated glucose, elevated blood pressure,

529
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:26,360
elevated waste circumference, storage of fat, elevated triglycerides, what you just said.

530
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:33,000
And the only one we didn't address is low HDL cholesterol, which is the fifth finding.

531
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,080
Now, of course, three out of those five are sufficient to put you in the category, but

532
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,000
fructose does all five. What is the mechanism by... So you've already described the mechanism by

533
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,760
which it does three of them. We alluded loosely to how it raises triglycerides, but I'd like to

534
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,440
talk about that more. And then of course, I'd like to hear how it lowers HDL cholesterol.

535
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:59,640
Okay. So the uric acid generated by fructose has a very pronounced effect to stimulate oxidative

536
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:06,840
stress in the mitochondria. And fructose also generates lactate big time. And the lactate also

537
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:14,840
has effects on mitochondria, as you learned from Dr. Sam Melan's talk. And in addition, fructose

538
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:22,840
preferentially decreases mitochondrial function and stimulates glycolysis. And so all those things

539
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,040
cause... You get this big oxidative stress to the mitochondria. And there's an enzyme in the

540
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:34,040
mitochondria that drives fat oxidation called enylchoahydratease. I mean, sorry to...

541
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,800
Throw it out there. This is what we're hearing.

542
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:35,800


543
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,320
No, no, no. We're here to talk about it.

544
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:43,560
But basically, the oxidative stress inhibits that. So fatty acid oxidation goes down. So you block

545
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:50,120
fat burning. And then in addition, you block an enzyme called econotase with oxidative stress

546
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,880
to the mitochondria. And that increases citrate, which drives fat generation. And so you end up

547
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,360
with fatty liver that's driven by both increased fat synthesis and a block in fat burning. The

548
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:09,080
mitochondrial oxidative stress also is very much linked with the development of insulin resistance.

549
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,600
And then uric acid is also the generated uric acid. It's also causing oxidative stress to the

550
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,480
islets, to the pancreatic islets as well.

551
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Uric acid is actually harmful to the islet cells of the pancreas?

552
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:29,080
In fact, if you give sugar, we did a study where we gave sugar to animals where we actually

553
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,840
restricted the amount of calories. The rats were getting... They were on a diet, basically.

554
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,560
They were on a diet...

555
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,640
They were on a high sugar, low calorie diet.

556
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,960
Right. And then we had as a control,

557
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,880
rats that got the same number of calories, but they weren't getting the sugar.

558
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,960
Right. So just a low calorie, low sugar diet.

559
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:53,160
Yeah. And when we gave the high sugar, low calorie diet, all the animals developed fatty liver,

560
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,920
hypertension, insulin resistance.

561
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,440
Did they actually gain weight?

562
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:05,640
No. No. This is a trick. Weight gain really requires increased calories, really to show it.

563
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,840
You know, long-term, maybe just decreasing metabolism will do it.

564
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,120
But this is interesting. You're saying both animals lost weight. Did they lose about the

565
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,760
same amount of weight?

566
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,560
No. They maintained their weight. Even though they were eating 90% of what they normally eat,

567
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,840
they were able to maintain.

568
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,120
So both groups slowed their metabolism enough to maintain weight at a 10% reduction of calories.

569
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,320
So in the outside, they looked the same, but the high sugar group still developed fatty liver.

570
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,720
Severe. And they all became diabetic.

571
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,760
Do you recall in that study, Rick, what the actual percentage of their macros that came from fructose?

572
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,080
20%.

573
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,920
Right. So the critic will say, well, that's highly unnatural. Although in reality, it's not that

574
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,640
unnatural. There are lots of people, unfortunately, walking around getting 20% of their energy input

575
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,600
from that. So it's not physiologically completely out of whack, but as a proof of concept,

576
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,080
these animals got diabetes without gaining weight. They got fatty liver disease without

577
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,200
gaining weight. They were, by definition, insulin resistant.

578
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:03,640
Right. And when we measured their insulin levels, they first became insulin resistant with high

579
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,600
serum insulin levels, which is what we see.

580
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,480
Early diabetes, basically.

581
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,680
Early to type 2 diabetes. But over time, the serum insulin levels started to fall.

582
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,840
So they almost develop a type 1 diabetes.

583
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,280
Well, just like humans do. And what we saw is that the islets used to be the phrase was called

584
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:26,440
islet exhaustion because longstanding type 2 diabetes, we see the same thing, but it's

585
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,840
actually low grade inflammation in the islets. And we could show that there was low grade

586
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:37,240
inflammation and it was associated with big time upregulation of urate transport proteins

587
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:44,120
on the islet. And when we took isolated islets and we put uric acid on them and induced oxidative

588
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:50,040
stress and over time caused a drop in insulin level. So what we think is going on is that

589
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:57,160
sugar causes diabetes through this pathway that we've been talking about. And it involves

590
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,760
initially insulin resistance, but over time it will cause islet cell dysfunction as well.

591
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,880
And this has been confirmed by other groups now.

592
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,600
That sort of comes to the triglyceride story, right? If you have a net accumulation of fat

593
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:15,800
in the liver, you're going to have to export some of that in the form of VLDL, a very low

594
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,920
density lipoprotein. So that would drive up the serum triglyceride. What's driving down the HDL

595
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,640
cholesterol?

596
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,800
You know, I haven't studied that personally. I don't really know, but I did see that there

597
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:31,640
are reports that fructose can lower HDL, like in animals and stuff, but I don't really know

598
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,360
the mechanism.

599
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:38,440
When you sort of pause for a moment, Rick, do you ever worry that talking about fructose this way

600
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,440
just seems, I don't know what the word is. I don't think it's necessarily being too much of

601
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:50,760
a reductionist, but it almost seems too simple that this one molecule could simultaneously have

602
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,240
probably allowed our species to survive during this very cold spell six to 12 million years ago.

603
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:04,520
And obviously evolution wasn't thinking 12 million years into the future that we'd be flush with

604
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:11,640
fructose. And yet here we are today. One could interpret what you're saying to mean if you

605
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:17,800
simply had no fructose in your diet, most of the bad things we think about metabolically would go

606
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,480
away. Is that a fair assessment?

607
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:24,840
Yeah, I think that's true. So let me give you another one where we've really learned a lot.

608
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:30,920
I don't know if you are aware of the relationship with cancer, but what we've learned is that

609
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,520
fructose was an incredible survival nutrient in the setting of near starvation.

610
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,200
So as I mentioned, what we're learning is all these animals use fructose. They either get it

611
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:49,160
from their diet or they make it in their body, and they use that to help them survive. And we can

612
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:55,720
talk about it, but it involves not just storing energy, but they use fructose to store water.

613
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,880
And we can talk about that. And they use it to become insulin resistant. Insulin resistance is

614
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,960
a survival mechanism whereby increasing blood glucose and preventing glucose from taking up

615
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,440
in the skeletal muscle, it preserves it for the brain, which is what you want to do if you don't

616
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,480
have enough food around, you want to be able to think so you can escape predators and so forth.

617
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:23,400
So it was a survival tool to increase energy. And it actually also protected animals from a

618
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:31,400
low oxygen state. So by switching, by reducing mitochondrial function and stimulating this thing

619
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,960
called glycolysis, it allowed the animal to survive with a lower oxygen state. And so we know,

620
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:44,280
for example, that the naked mole rat, which lives in burrows, very low oxygen burrows,

621
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:51,080
they make fructose to survive when they're in those burrows. So suddenly the fructose goes up

622
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,840
in their blood and they use it to survive the low oxygen tension there because they switch from

623
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:04,280
mitochondrial metabolism to glycolysis. But why can't they just rely more on glucose for which

624
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:11,000
we have such an abundant apparatus to store it at large amounts? Is there an energetic reason for

625
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,360
fructose? A lot of the fructose is converted to glucose and to lactate, which can be converted

626
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:22,040
to glucose, and then it's driven through this glycolysis pathway. So it turns out, though,

627
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,800
that what happens is when you metabolize glucose, a lot of it will go through mitochondrial metabolism.

628
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:34,920
And so if we can inhibit mitochondrial metabolism, which uses oxygen, we can live off glycolysis,

629
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,920
which doesn't require oxygen. So what happens is in a low oxygen state, like the naked mole rat,

630
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:48,520
will use fructose to survive. But cancers... But wait, I'm still confused about this, Rick, because

631
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:53,080
wouldn't that fructose, but they're not storing that fructose as fat then, because that would be

632
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,760
the worst fuel they could have around in a low oxygen environment, right? Well, so fructose is

633
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:06,280
increasing glycogen and lipid, but it's also reducing mitochondrial use. When you're eating

634
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:13,080
fructose, you actually are not burning the fat. You are storing the fat. And then so what it's

635
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:19,880
doing is it's putting you into a glycolytic state. So animals use it to store fat, and then they

636
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:26,520
fast, and then they burn the fat. So they hibernate, or they go flying long distances,

637
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,320
where they have no food, and then they switch. And then the fat that they've stored suddenly

638
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:37,400
becomes their survival. But during the time that they're in a low oxygen state, they want to have

639
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:44,200
fructose on board, because the fructose is helping them to survive low oxygen by switching their

640
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:51,240
metabolism. But unfortunately, like cancers also live in a low oxygen state. And so these cancers

641
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:58,520
love fructose as their fuel, because it helps support them surviving in a low oxygen state.

642
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:05,640
So recently, it's been shown that many cancers, colon, liver, kidney, breast, brain,

643
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:13,160
all these cancer cells, intestinal, they all tend to like fructose as their preferential fuel.

644
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,880
There was just a paper in Science a few weeks ago, and if you block that fructose pathway,

645
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,200
the cancers don't do as well. And when you say block it, do you mean block

646
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:28,120
fructokinase? Yes. Which pathway specifically? Fructokinase. So if you take intestinal colon cancer,

647
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:34,200
you put high fructose corn syrup on it, they love it, they grow, they metastasize. And if you block

648
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:39,720
fructokinase and block fructose metabolism, you can block a lot of the growth of those cancers.

649
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,840
Do you have a sense of how much you're blocking it? It's pretty remarkable. It's like 50% or more.

650
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,960
And we know it's the fructose, not the glucose, presumably because we don't impair glucose

651
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,360
metabolism at all in that experiment. That's correct. And also they were able to show that

652
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,920
this was driven by that shift from a mitochondrial-based metabolism to a glycolytic metabolism.

653
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,520
And what happens to lactate levels in that setting? Oh, very high.

654
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,080
Meaning the more fructose they have, the higher the lactate level?

655
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:13,960
Yes. Again, very counterintuitive, because aren't we sort of taught that the liver is the only organ

656
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,480
that can really process fructose and that it all sort of accumulates there? And I mean, conventional

657
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,200
thinking is that fructose really doesn't have much of an interaction outside of the liver

658
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,960
unless converted to glucose, correct? That was said by a lot of people, but the findings show that

659
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:38,360
about 20% of fructose is used by the intestine, maybe 40% by the liver. And at least 10 to 20%

660
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,880
can escape into the circulation. And of course, if the larger the dose, the more that will pass.

661
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:51,880
And the kidneys are big target. There's fructokinase in the brain. There's fructokinase in the islets.

662
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:57,400
There's fructokinase in the adipose tissue. Does the muscle have fructokinase?

663
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,720
There's some thought that fructokinase may be in the muscle. It's got to be very low,

664
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,960
but there's some thought that fructose is being metabolized in the scallop muscle.

665
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:12,200
And one of the things that's interesting is there was a paper in Nature that showed that the heart

666
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:18,120
normally doesn't have fructokinase, but when you have a heart attack, the low oxygen state there

667
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:25,160
induces the fructokinase and there's probably production, endogenous production of fructose.

668
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,360
And it seems to be involved in cardiac remodeling. So it's probably involved in more things than we

669
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:37,960
think of. And certainly it's in the brain. Which means that in theory, the brain could actually use

670
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:44,200
free molecules of fructose to make ATP in addition to the mainstay of its energy metabolism, which is

671
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,400
glucose driven and lactate. I think we're now seeing lactate. There's actually some evidence

672
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,840
that first off, we know that fructokinase is in the brain. We know the brain can make fructose

673
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:01,640
and there's increasing evidence that insulin resistances can occur just in the brain and

674
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,000
maybe a forerunner for the development of Alzheimer's. And there are actually reports

675
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,320
that AMPD aminase is high in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. And it raises the possibility

676
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:18,120
that local fructose metabolism could be involved in disorders like that. Are there any people with

677
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:23,240
naturally occurring mutations in fructokinase that render it less capable? Yeah. So there are people

678
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:29,080
with a condition called the essential fructosuria where they are born without active fructokinase

679
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:34,280
and they live normally. No one's ever been reported to have type two diabetes or obesity. So these

680
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:40,200
people, if I'm understanding you correctly, are genetically immune to the harm of sugar. Yes. And

681
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:45,160
they pee out all the fructos. Yes. Okay. So that seems to be an interesting topic.

682
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,120
This must be very rare. I've never even heard of it. It's a rare condition. They actually don't pee

683
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:55,320
out all the fructos. Some fructos can be metabolized by an enzyme called hexokinase,

684
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:02,760
which is normally metabolized as glucose, but fructos is preferentially metabolized by fructokinase.

685
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,040
So these people have very sweet urine going back to Osler had he tasted their urine, he would have

686
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,680
confused them potentially with an even sweeter version than the people would ultimately type two

687
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,760
diabetes. That's how they were discovered because they would have reducing sugars, which was fructos

688
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,960
in their urine that was picked up with the old tests they used to use for diabetes, but then

689
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,440
they didn't have diabetes when they tested them. And these people could literally just consume

690
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,120
all the sugar they wanted and their uric acid is not going to go up. Their blood pressure is not

691
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,880
going to go up. Their trigs don't go up. They don't gain weight. They don't become insulin resistant.

692
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,400
That's right. So is there any benefit to having fructokinase if you're not hibernating or in a

693
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:47,960
world where famine is potentially coming your way? It's really a survival enzyme that was meant to

694
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:54,520
help in situations where there was food shortage. If you live in the Western world and you just have

695
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:01,560
to go down to the grocery store, no, I think living without fructokinase would probably solve a lot of

696
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,720
the world's health problems. I mean, and there are fructokinase inhibitors that are being developed.

697
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:13,080
Pfizer has one that's now in a finished a phase two trial. It was quite successful at treating

698
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:19,480
fatty liver. And so now they're taking that drug to phase three. Wow. That's a potential blockbuster

699
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:25,160
actually. Of course, it begs an interesting question, which is how will that drug be treated?

700
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,880
Will it be only used as a way to treat an active condition such as fatty liver, in which case it's

701
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:36,600
going to have a smaller on label market versus what will likely happen, which is people who just

702
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,280
want to be able to have more sugar without the consequences of it would take it. Correct. Yeah.

703
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,840
Although it's probably priced to avoid that. I'm guessing. Anyway, yeah, there's a lot of

704
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,320
interest in fructokinase inhibitors. There's other big farmer that are working on it now.

705
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,720
And so we'll have to see if it turns out to be as powerful as we think it might be. So the work that

706
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:00,280
we've just discussed is sort of been, you've been at this since 2002, basically specifically with

707
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:06,680
respect to this. Let's go back to allopurinol and uric acid in your clinical practice, because you're

708
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:14,680
still, you've spent 17 years as the division head of nephrology across three world-class medical

709
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,320
centers, most currently the university of Colorado. And yet I was surprised to learn over dinner the

710
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,000
other day that you still have a very pretty heavy clinical practice. You still actually take care of

711
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,200
patients in the inpatient ward and you probably spend a quarter of your time in clinic. So how do

712
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:35,880
you put some of this stuff into practice? Do you liberally use allopurinol even for patients who

713
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,360
have high uric acid but have not developed gout yet? I do. So our data strongly suggests that

714
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:49,000
lowering uric acid could be beneficial. So what I do is the following. So it turns out that allopurinol

715
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,840
is not totally safe. There's some people who can develop reactions to allopurinol drug reactions.

716
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:01,720
Especially Asians, about three to four percent of people who are Asian can develop an allergic

717
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:08,120
reaction to allopurinol where they can get rashes and it can be pretty severe. And it's about two

718
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:14,120
percent in African Americans and it's about 0.5 percent in Caucasians. You can test for it. There's

719
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:19,960
a test called the HLA B58 test. But the point of the matter is that no drug is fully safe. Every

720
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:27,400
drug has side effects. So ideally you'd want to really be certain that your drug's going to provide

721
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:33,560
the benefit that you want and you have to consider the risk versus benefits. Now although in animals

722
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:39,400
allopurinol is totally protective or protects a lot against sugar induced metabolic syndrome,

723
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:45,320
the data in humans is suggestive. So there's been for example four pilot studies showing an improvement

724
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:51,560
in insulin resistance with lower anuric acid in humans. All four are positive. There's a lot of

725
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:58,200
trials in kidney disease showing that lower anuric acid may benefit kidney disease. There's data on

726
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:04,040
blood pressure. We had a paper in the JAMA showing that lower anuric acid could improve blood pressure

727
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:10,280
control in adolescence with hyperuricemia. So there's a lot of supporting data. There are some

728
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:17,080
negative studies too but the overall weight is now in favor of lowering uric acid to benefit.

729
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:23,560
What would the target be? So what I do is when I see a patient in clinic I measure the uric acid

730
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:31,400
and currently we know that the risks start to go up when the serum uric acid is over 5.5.

731
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,200
So once the serum uric acid is over 5.5 they really start to have increased risk for

732
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,880
prediabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, kidney disease, etc. And what's interesting is

733
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,800
most labs like my lab for example doesn't even flag it until it hits about 6.5 as a sort of

734
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,240
intermediate risk and it's really not until about 7.5 that it says well this is high risk but of

735
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,880
course that's only through the lens of gout I assume. Yes that's right. So if a uric acid comes

736
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:04,840
back really high like 9 or 10 I have no doubt that that based on everything I've done I have no doubt

737
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,160
that that's not good. Not only does it increase the risk for gout but it increases the risk for

738
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,600
kidney disease and all these things and I talk to the patient about the pros and cons of treatment.

739
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,000
I talk about the rash. I tell them to stop the drug if they get a rash and then call me. But I

740
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,760
always start alipurinol when the uric acid is like eight or higher and certainly when it's nine or

741
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:34,600
higher. When it's between 5.5 and eight I'll talk to them about the pros and cons but we don't have

742
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:40,040
full proof yet. But I tend to do it especially with patients with kidney disease where the data

743
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,400
is probably the strongest to start treating. I'll even do it with uric acid of six and a half for

744
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,840
example with chronic kidney disease. But anyway it's worthwhile discussing it with the patient.

745
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,320
But outside of the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome which you've alluded to, what are the

746
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:01,480
other potential risks of alipurinol? That's by far the big one. Some people will get just a mild rash

747
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:07,720
without true Stevens-Johnson syndrome. There are rare cases where liver function tests may be

748
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:14,360
elevated but it seems to be rare. If you start at a huge dose right away it can increase xanthine

749
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:21,400
levels in the urine. Theoretically there could be risk for xanthine stones but I've never seen it.

750
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:27,320
So it's really the risk of Stevens-Johnson. And do you have to use alipurinol or can you use

751
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:33,640
euloric or other drugs that also lower uric acid? Well the xanthine oxidase inhibitors are

752
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:40,200
the best because the way uric acid works to cause cardiovascular disease and kidney disease and all

753
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,560
these things appear to be through its actions inside the cell as we said works on mitochondria

754
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:52,920
and it does all these things. It's not it's work outside the cell so gout is really an extracellular

755
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:58,680
deposition but when you're thinking about uric acid and its biologic effects that's an

756
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:05,640
intracellular action. So xanthine oxidase makes uric acid inside the cell so one of the best ways

757
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,720
to reduce intracellular uric acid is to give us xanthine oxidase inhibitor like alipurinol or

758
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:17,880
fiboxestat. Now fiboxestat I think it's probably just as good as alipurinol but there was a big

759
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,960
clinical trial that was published in the New England Journal that showed that alipurinol

760
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:27,960
was associated with less cardiovascular risk than fiboxestat. There seemed to be an increased

761
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:33,720
cardiovascular events in the fiboxestat group. Meaning less of a reduction or more events.

762
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,640
Well see the problem was there was no placebo group. Oh yeah that's a disaster. Yeah that's

763
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,760
a disaster. This is the Vioxx problem with naproxen. Yeah I mean so the problem is

764
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,920
alipurinol is less than fiboxestat but there's no placebo group. Theoretically the placebo group

765
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,080
would be higher than both of them. Yeah it could be higher than both of them and there's actually

766
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:58,680
evidence that that's probably true but because of the CARES study the way it was designed we don't

767
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:05,560
know. So the FDA is worried about giving fiboxestat to people with cardiovascular problems because

768
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:11,720
they would prefer you to give alipurinol but the trouble is it's not necessarily that fiboxestat

769
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,920
is bad it's just that it's not as good as alipurinol. And it's like a hundred thousand times more

770
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:22,280
expensive too. Although it's I think becoming generic now so we may see a change in that.

771
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,920
I believe it when I see it and of course the way you trust the generics but that's a whole separate

772
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,520
issue. Exactly. So what about sodium restriction going back to how we started the discussion?

773
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,440
I'll tell you a story from I may have even told this on the podcast once before but in medical

774
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,480
school I remember when we were doing renal physiology we had a great nephrology professor

775
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,640
who was teaching something and I think he was quite ahead of his time because this was

776
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:51,480
more than 20 years ago and he was not sort of part of this salt is bad bandwagon even though

777
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:56,520
he was a nephrologist. And I won't do it because I won't do it justice but in a beautiful southern

778
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:02,840
accent he made the point that if you lined up all of the nephrons in the world all the functional

779
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,320
units of the kidneys in the world from dumbest to smartest and then all of the nephrologists

780
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,360
in the world from dumbest to smartest and you took that dumbest nephron and put it next to the

781
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:18,840
smartest nephrologist it's still smarter. His point being of course like the kidney is a brilliant

782
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:26,840
organ that is exceptional at auto regulation of everything from flow to osmolarity to

783
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:33,000
anion cation exchange. Again his point being he didn't buy this argument that salt is the problem.

784
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,840
You're saying something much more nuanced and I want to kind of go back to it because I think

785
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,880
there are important clinical implications of it. You're saying no no salt does play a role

786
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:48,440
but it's dose timing bolus concentration that matters. It can also be amplified

787
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:56,200
or mitigated by the state of inflammation. So how do you then translate that information to your

788
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:00,520
patients acknowledging that they're a very select group of people by definition they have kidney

789
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,400
disease or they wouldn't be seeing you. So it's the combination of salt and water. So if you don't

790
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,280
drink any water as you eat salt you're going to raise your serum sodium you're going to get

791
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:15,400
thirsty and as soon as you're thirsty you've triggered that in itself is a sign that you're

792
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:22,280
already making fructose from the salt. So when you eat salt you're making fructose in your body

793
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:28,760
and the fructose is then driving a lot of effects. Now we know that high salt diets are associated

794
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,720
with obesity not just high blood pressure they're associated with the development of diabetes.

795
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:40,200
There's many studies now but high salt looks like it works by producing fructose. So if you drink

796
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,200
water with salt the danger of the salt is much less. If you drink water and then eat your pretzel

797
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,200
you would be safer than if you ate your pretzel and then drink the water

798
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:57,560
because what triggers it is the rise in salt. And so when you see someone in the clinic what we try

799
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:03,480
to do is to tell them to drink a lot of water and to reduce their salt but it isn't the amount of

800
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:08,840
salt it's the balance of salt and water. Now that can be sometimes challenging for patients in a

801
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,040
kidney clinic because that would be one population in which you do have to be mindful of volume.

802
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:19,320
Right but most patients who chronic kidney disease they will excrete water normally or just

803
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:25,560
minimally abnormal and so there's actually clinical trials looking at the evidence that water may slow

804
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:31,480
the progression of kidney disease. It might be working in part by blocking the effects of salt

805
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:38,280
and so forth on the kidney and we experimentally can show that giving water can slow kidney disease

806
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,640
progression. So drinking water turns out to be good. Here's another thing it turns out that many

807
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:50,920
animals use fructose to make fat as a means for making water. So when you make fat although there's

808
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,760
no water stored in the fat when they burn the fat they make water. So whales don't drink salt water

809
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:02,120
they are fat because when they break down the fat they're making the water we call it metabolic

810
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:09,800
water. So it turns out that fructose drives fat production and in part to preserve water not just

811
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:17,720
energy. So animals will use that fat to provide an energy source but also to provide water. So it

812
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:23,720
turns out that if you take an animal on fructose and you give it a lot of water you can suppress

813
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:30,760
some of the obesity. You can suppress some of the effects of metabolic syndrome and so the old

814
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,680
wives tale that drinking six glasses of water a day is good to help keep you skinny is true. It

815
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:43,160
turns out that water suppresses some of the effects of fructose. And does it need to be water? Could

816
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,520
it be tea or coffee or something that's equally the osmolarity of water is what serum is about 280?

817
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:54,200
Yep. Okay so anything with the zero osmolarity is good enough? Yes. Technically a diet soda should

818
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:58,120
have a zero osmolarity as well right? Yeah diet soda would work actually. For the record you and

819
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,160
I are sitting here drinking just plain water. Right and diet sugars have their own issues.

820
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,880
We'll come back to that in a few seconds because that's interesting. So Rick you sort of you toss

821
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:13,000
these little nuggets out there like they're nothing but they sound I mean again just based on the sort

822
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,600
of breadth of research you've put into this it almost just seems too good to be true and so profound

823
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,600
yet you sort of throw it out there like an after the fact. Well look as long as you drink enough

824
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:29,240
water and don't eat fructose and god forbid don't drink fructose manage your uric acid levels etc etc

825
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:34,920
so you make it seem like a lot of problems could go away from these things. How would you shape

826
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,080
that advice for someone with normal kidney disease? Pardon me with normal kidneys. Would

827
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:43,480
you basically just say the same thing or can you be less restrictive with sodium for example?

828
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,840
If we could reduce our fructose intake I think it would have a huge huge effect but the problem

829
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,920
that most people face is that sugar and high fructose corn syrup are in almost everything.

830
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:02,440
So if you go to the supermarket like 70 percent of processed foods have sugar in it and packaged

831
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,800
foods actually 70 percent of packaged foods have sugar or high fructose corn syrup in it so it's

832
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:14,920
very hard to avoid it and here's another problem our bodies can make fructose. So our bodies as I

833
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:20,600
mentioned we can make fructose from a high salt diet we can make fructose if we get dehydrated

834
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:26,040
we can make fructose high uric acid stimulates fructose production. And we're making the fructose

835
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:31,320
out of glucose in all of these situations? Yes high glycemic diets normally if you take an animal

836
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:38,440
and you give it starch they will not really get fat but we all know that french fries which don't

837
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:44,600
have sugar in it they don't have fructose they are fattening but you've got potatoes which raise your

838
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:50,440
glucose and what we showed is that if you just give glucose to an animal the high glucose as it

839
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:55,640
hits the liver induces this enzyme to convert glucose to fructose. Which enzyme is that that

840
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:01,640
converts glucose into fructose? Aldose reductase so when we took mice and we gave them glucose

841
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:08,680
and we were thinking we might not see much because we were believing that fructose is the culprit but

842
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:14,120
over time these animals got really fat they got insulin resistant everything. But you had to

843
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,920
over feed them glucose. We put the glucose in their drinking water so they were drinking a

844
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,080
lot of glucose but they would eat less chow so we gave them chow and glucose in their drinking water

845
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:29,720
and their chow had it was normal chow it wasn't the high fat high sugar chow no just regular

846
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:35,560
chow and these animals started getting really really fat and when we looked at the portal vein

847
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,120
which goes into the liver the glucose levels were high and when we looked in the liver

848
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,680
we found that this enzyme was activated it's also activated in diabetics for example because of the

849
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:53,240
high glucose in the blood and when that enzyme got activated it started to make fructose so even

850
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:59,080
though these animals were eating no fructose they were producing fructose in their liver and then

851
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:05,880
when we blocked their fructose metabolism they're eating the same amount of glucose no change

852
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:12,360
exactly the suddenly they're not getting as fat they have no fatty liver they're not insulin

853
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:19,000
resistant. But this suggests Rick that a diet in excess carbohydrate even if it's not high in

854
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,920
sugar could lead to fatty liver disease. Yes yeah absolutely if you have that enzyme induced

855
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:31,960
but let's say that you are a young person when you're young this enzyme is really not present

856
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:37,960
in the liver once you're eating sugar though if you eat a lot of sugar it will induce that enzyme.

857
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:43,720
For how long? I don't fully know but let's say that you eat a lot of sugar and you get obese

858
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:48,520
so sugar itself it looks like the induction of this enzyme probably would be reversible

859
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:54,600
within a few weeks but once your uric acid goes up that will keep it elevated. So that's another

860
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,600
reason potentially to use allopurinol if necessary in addition to fructose restriction to keep uric

861
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:08,840
acid low is to prevent or mitigate the induction of this enzyme. Oh yeah right so it turns out that

862
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:15,320
if you give a starch or potatoes to a skinny person who does not have all those reductase induced

863
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,560
they can eat the potatoes they want. In Ireland back in the 1700s where potato was basically

864
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:26,520
the main thing they were eating there wasn't a lot of obesity but you wait until you eat sugar

865
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:33,000
and then develop the metabolic syndrome now you stop eating sugar but you continue to eat carbs

866
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,320
and the carbs are going to continue to activate through the same pathway. So a low carb diet

867
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:45,960
is really great because it's necessary if you're overweight or fasting but that's basically

868
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:51,880
reducing carbs too but a low carb diet when you're overweight is removing the high glycemic carbs

869
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:58,520
that are also driving the disease but it's through fructose. So it seems that fructose reduction

870
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:04,360
obviously comes with its own benefits do you have a sense of how much fructose can be produced in a

871
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:11,320
fructose free intake environment just from glucose is it a meaningful amount? Well we did our study

872
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:17,400
by putting glucose in the drinking water they're getting a lot of glucose we haven't done the study

873
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:23,240
is the one that you're talking about trying to figure out what the range is. I do think that if

874
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:28,600
you just give high glucose alone you probably have to give a lot but if you've already triggered

875
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,480
the production of this enzyme aldose reductase you probably don't have to give a lot. What about fat

876
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:39,320
what if you did that same experiment with rats or mice which would be hard because to eat pure fat

877
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,040
is difficult but if there was a way that somehow you could make it palatable enough that they could

878
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:49,320
you could overfeed them to the same extent using fat and protein. Let's say they're getting a normal

879
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:54,360
amount of glucose but the overfeed was coming through the fat would that induce any of these

880
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:00,920
properties? In other words is part of this due to an absolute sense of total energy being too high

881
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:06,360
or is this really about a particular carbohydrate? It's definitely about a particular carbohydrate

882
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:10,920
because we've actually done what's called pair feeding where you control how much they eat and

883
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:15,640
you can have your control group. This fructose effect will still as I mentioned cause fatty

884
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,320
liver. Explain what pair feeding is for people because it's a clever little tool done in this

885
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:26,760
type of research. So the way fructose works is it works by making you eat more and that's how you

886
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:33,640
gain weight but even when you control so that you don't eat more fructose will not cause weight gain

887
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,280
but it will cause fatty liver insulin resistance and diabetes and so forth and the way we can show

888
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:44,920
that is by pair feeding. In pair feeding we give each animal eats the same amount of food so if you

889
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:50,920
give one animal sugar which normally makes it want to eat more because it causes this thing called

890
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:55,960
leptin resistance where they want to eat more but if we don't give them any more food we only give

891
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:01,560
them the same amount as the control then there will be no difference in weight but there will be

892
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:08,200
differences in fatty liver metabolic syndrome and so forth. The sugar industry has used this to

893
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,920
their advantage so what they say is okay we're going to look at clinical trials where we've given

894
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:18,760
sugar and we're going to see if sugar causes weight gain but it's only fair to do that if we have it

895
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:25,000
controlled where we control the energy intake to be equal among groups. So they have a control group

896
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,040
where they've restricted there's a caloric restriction on both sides so you have a high

897
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:36,200
sugar and a non-high sugar group but it's not where you get to the people get to eat as much as they

898
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,520
want. Basically is this problem of not having ad libitum feeding so it's sort of like what the sugar

899
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:47,000
industry is saying is look a calorie is a calorie if I give you a hundred calories of sugar and

900
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,440
completely control what you can eat in response to that and compare you to another person who's

901
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:56,760
eating the same number of calories you're really not going to gain weight. Now the problem with that

902
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:02,680
experiment is it's not the real world in the real world you don't have a clamp on your response.

903
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:08,520
Exactly and so when you give sugar to animals they become leptin resistant over time and they

904
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,720
lose their ability to control their appetite so then they eat more and so then their weight goes

905
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:19,160
up but the fructose is also doing stuff where even if you control for the weight gain they still get

906
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:23,160
the fatty liver and stuff which the controls don't. Now a second ago you sort of alluded to

907
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,320
artificial sweeteners so comparing I mean I'm sure you get this question asked all the time

908
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:32,920
by your patients which is I just really love Coca-Cola is having a diet coke it must be

909
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,800
significantly better right I mean there's no fructose in it there's no glucose in it

910
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:43,000
so is there a downside to it? Yeah I think there are downsides but first let me just say the positive

911
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:51,880
side we have taste buds that sense sweet and so when we eat sugar the taste buds are activated

912
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:59,880
and it stimulates this dopamine response in the brain that tells us that we like this sugar. If

913
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,880
you actually knock out the sweet taste buds or just knock out the tastes in general animals will

914
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:12,120
still like sugar they will still eat sugar a lot of sugar. How hard is that to do experimentally

915
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:18,760
to knock out the sweet tasting capacity? It's been done and we actually have also done it where we

916
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:27,000
knock out all taste. Can you do it to me? No it's like a genetic knockout but anyway these animals

917
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,200
will still like sugar but they won't like artificial sugar so the artificial sugar is really driven by

918
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:38,360
the sweet taste but what makes animal like real sugar it's through its metabolism. I mean it is

919
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:44,200
true if you knock out taste they will tend to eat a little bit less sugar but they actually still

920
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:48,040
develop metabolic syndrome. That's super interesting so you're saying part of our

921
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:54,760
affinity for sugar is not just in our taste buds and in our brain but also in our periphery where

922
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,640
the metabolism takes place and the elegant way you demonstrate that is you give something of equal

923
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:06,200
sweetness concentration that's non-nutritive and you completely reduce the appetite for it even

924
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:10,280
though it might have the same central effect it doesn't have the peripheral effect. Probably the

925
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:17,400
sweet taste bud developed to try to encourage us to eat these foods that at the time were survival

926
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:25,240
foods but the food itself the sugar itself stimulates dopamine and other effects independently

927
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:33,320
of the sweet taste whereas an artificial sugar just is activating the sweet taste. Now if you give

928
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:40,840
a mouse or a rat artificial sugar they don't gain weight but if you give them regular sugar they do

929
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:48,920
so there is some evidence that artificial sugars are better than sugar and if a person says to me

930
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:56,200
oh doc I'm afraid to drink this diet coke because it's got chemicals in it I want to drink regular

931
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:03,400
coke because of that that's an error. Regular coke is more dangerous than a diet coke. However

932
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:11,160
there is truth that things like aspartame and sucralose we don't know fully the safety of these.

933
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:17,720
Aspartame when last I checked had been studied more by the FDA than any other molecule ingested

934
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:23,560
by humans. It's hard to make the case that at the small doses that people would consume them.

935
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:28,600
I'm talking about someone who has a serving of this stuff a day. I don't know I've always found

936
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,480
that argument that well we don't know the full safety profile of these things to be as like what

937
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:37,720
else do we need on this one. I think aspartame is kind of gross truthfully like I don't really like

938
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:42,360
it that much but I just think it's definitely the lesser of two evils isn't it. It's definitely the

939
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:47,960
lesser of two evils that part's for sure but we don't fully know the safety of some of these like

940
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:52,760
saccharin for example has been associated with little bladder tumors in mice my recollections

941
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:58,200
that aspartame can generate small tiny concentrations of formaldehyde. I think it really comes down to

942
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,800
dose. Yes I think it is. I think those studies were really based on rats or rodents consuming

943
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:09,560
doses that simply couldn't be replicated by humans. That's probably true. Nevertheless water is good.

944
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:15,560
Yeah that's generally been my take to people as well is look all things equal by certainly consume

945
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,960
water, tea, things like that but yeah there's this lesser of two evils approach but this point you

946
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,360
made this is completely news to me and very interesting because certainly much of the

947
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:29,400
neurobiology today would suggest that the response we have to sugar is mostly centrally mediated.

948
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,440
The quote-unquote addictive because everyone loves to talk about functional MRI and what happens in

949
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:39,400
your brain when you're eating sugar and all of these other things but I guess I haven't seen

950
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:45,480
this side by side but presumably the fMRI would light up the same for non-nutritive versus like

951
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:51,400
aspartame and sugar correct? Yeah. So let's talk about another taste which is umami. I remember we

952
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,160
were having sushi one night when we discussed this. What is umami? What is that taste? So umami is the

953
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:03,080
savory taste. And this is different from salt isn't it? So there's five taste buds. So there's salt,

954
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:09,400
there's sweet and as I mentioned both of these taste buds seem to drive a weight gain. Sugar is

955
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:15,640
by far the fastest. It takes only two months in a laboratory animal and salt takes four months,

956
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:22,120
five months. So high salt generates fructose but it's a much slower process than just eating sugar.

957
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:27,160
Then you have umami which is the savory taste and then you have bitter and sour and the bitter and

958
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:33,400
sour probably developed to help you avoid eating certain foods. So coffee is an example of bitter

959
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:39,160
like a coffee bean or something like a ground? I think so. Yeah okay. Anyway so umami is driven by

960
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:47,880
glutamate but it's markedly enhanced by purines like IMP and even uric acid. So it turns out that

961
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:55,800
umami is sort of a taste receptor for uric acid type foods. Foods that raise uric acid. Now is

962
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:03,080
MSG the purest form of umami that we would eat? Yes. MSG is the primary stimulant and people put

963
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:10,920
it in foods to encourage food intake. Now there's some link of umami with obesity in epidemiologic

964
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:18,280
studies and there are situations where you can give umami type foods and especially if you can

965
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:26,920
do it in a liquid form you can induce obesity. So umami may not be as safe as we think it is. So it's

966
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:34,760
got a lot of good things written about it in the literature. Don't most people view MSG as evil?

967
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,320
Yeah I think MSG is viewed as evil. But that seems to be largely unfounded based on my view

968
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,400
of the literature. I can't really find evidence that umami is harmful. There's this Chinese

969
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:49,160
restaurant syndrome where people get a warm and a headaches and it's thought to be due to excess of

970
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:56,440
MSG. But foods that are umami rich are often foods that we love. I mean shrimp has umami,

971
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:03,880
Caesar salad, the parmesan and things like that have umami. And so in general people like umami

972
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:11,400
foods and it's certainly in the websites it is often promoted. But if the umami foods have a

973
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:17,560
lot of purines which enhance the umami flavor it actually may raise uric acid and kind of bypass

974
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:24,280
the sugar pathway. And we think that that may turn out to be somewhat of a risk factor too.

975
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:29,560
So do you add this to the list of things that you caution people about? We've already got the

976
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:36,920
pair your salt with water idea, the restrict fructose and please god don't ever drink it.

977
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:45,160
Do you then add the MSG containing high umami foods to that playbook for ways to reduce metabolic

978
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:51,720
disease? I think so. Yeah I think that foods like shrimps and things like that if you eat a lot of

979
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:58,760
them they probably activate this pathway too. We're still trying to learn more about it but it looks

980
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:06,360
like it could be a contributor. I think it's if you rank it number one is is sugar and then

981
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:12,440
everything else is less. High glycemic carbs can be converted to sugar. What I usually say is

982
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:21,240
the big four are bread, potatoes, chips, and rice. Those four are the foods that you should

983
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:25,480
reduce a little bit. Wait chips as in like chips potato chips? Yeah potato chips. So you're giving

984
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:31,240
potatoes two votes out of four. Yeah well our corn chips are you know the kind of things that

985
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:38,440
people put out on their table before you eat dinner. And they coat it with salt which isn't

986
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:45,080
good. Anyway so high glycemic carbs I think really salty foods drink water. I mean that's

987
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:53,400
really important. And umami so for example what makes beer so much more dangerous than other

988
01:37:53,400 --> 01:38:00,840
alcohols for inducing obesity is because beer has all this yeast in it, brewer's yeast, which

989
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,720
basically is activating umami pathways and it's one of the reasons we like beer. This is that

990
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:12,440
cellular density issue you spoke about. Exactly and so a beer raises uric acid more and there

991
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:17,640
really is this beer belly syndrome and if you look at people who drink a lot of beer it isn't just

992
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:23,400
they get abdominal obesity. They get fatty liver, they get high blood pressure, their triglycerides

993
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:30,920
go up. They basically have metabolic syndrome. Alcohol especially beer can also mimic sugar

994
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:36,280
and it's probably because of the umami component coupled with the alcohol. Those two. This is the

995
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:41,080
part that can sometimes drive a person insane when they're trying to think about all of these

996
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:47,240
things is it's very difficult to provide clear advice to people because there's so many caveats

997
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:52,920
that are required because the dose makes the poison, the speed of delivery, what it's combined

998
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,000
with all of these things. I'm using that as a preface to ask a question that I'm sure you get

999
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,080
asked a lot which is really a dose question around fructose. So let's ask it in two questions.

1000
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:07,880
If a person is going to drink something in the form of fructose, whether it be fruit juice or

1001
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:13,080
soda or sports drinks, which are from a fructose standpoint all basically the same, is there a

1002
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:18,280
dose of fructose above which you think it really makes no sense under any circumstance or below

1003
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:23,240
which you think once in a while is not the end of the world? I mean personally I would not drink

1004
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:27,960
any liquids that have sugar in it or a fructose or high fructose corn syrup. That's fine. So we're

1005
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,280
going to draw a hard line there. Hard line. Okay now what about eating fructose in the form of

1006
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,280
fruit? Because remember there's some big ass fruits out there. Like you look at a Fuji apple,

1007
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:41,880
which is my favorite apple. I mean I like these monster Fuji apples so like half the size of my

1008
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:46,680
head or maybe a third the size of my head. That's got to have 30 grams of fructose in it. I don't

1009
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:51,880
think it has that much. Oh really? I really don't. Most apples and that would be a big one,

1010
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:56,440
maybe 10 grams at most I would think. No way. You think more? Well think about it. These are

1011
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:00,600
the really big ones. Yeah yeah I'm not talking about a little Macintosh, I'm talking about a

1012
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,960
huge apple and they're so sweet too. So you may be right then. Let's talk about natural fruit.

1013
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:12,040
So we've actually done trials in patients with a low fructose diet with or without natural fruit

1014
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:17,400
supplements and generally speaking natural fruit supplements do not seem to block the benefits of

1015
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:22,200
a low fructose diet. Sorry what does that mean? You mean that if you took a patient and restrict

1016
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:27,080
all fructose except fruit? That's correct. They tend to do okay? They did just as well as the

1017
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:31,320
low fructose alone. And can you quantify how much fruit? Because here's the problem when you're

1018
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,400
talking to someone like me Rick, I don't do anything in moderation. So we have these bowls

1019
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:40,760
in my kitchen, they're called manly bowls, which by definition a manly bowl is a bowl that you can

1020
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,240
wear on your head like a hat. It will come over your head and when I consume fruit I consume it

1021
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:51,000
in that bowl. Yeah I would be careful. So no manly bowls. Yeah so the data suggests that a single

1022
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,360
fruit, maybe not the giant fruit, okay I don't know the last time I had a single fruit. Yeah but a

1023
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:01,240
single fruit has like some fruits like kiwi and lime and lemon have almost no fructose

1024
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:07,080
and they're totally safe and other fruits. Pineapple and stuff. You have a fair amount of

1025
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:13,000
sugar. Berries for example, blueberries have so many good things in it. You can eat a big bowl of

1026
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,720
blueberries no problem. Raspberry, strawberries, they're all other berries in general are very

1027
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:23,160
good. Grapes, they have a fair amount of sugar. You eat a bowl of grapes, you're going to probably

1028
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:27,080
raise your uric acid and trigger the activation of this pathway. You eat a bowl of grapes, you

1029
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:31,000
might as well be eating raisins based on what my blood glucose meter tells me. Exactly. It's a

1030
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:39,400
disaster. Yeah what I would recommend is to try to not eat too many fruit at one time. So for example

1031
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,280
there was a lady named Nott's, Cheryl Nott's I believe is her name and she's an anthropologist

1032
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:50,360
and she was studying orangutans and there's a time when the massing season where all these fruit trees

1033
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:56,680
bloom and then fruit at the same time and then these orangutans go in there and they won't eat

1034
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:02,680
one fruit. They'll eat 100 fruit at one time. I'm descendants of those orangutans. Me too.

1035
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:09,800
So anyway when they what she did is she would go up and collect the urine off the trees and show

1036
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,360
that by measuring things like ketones and so forth she could show that when they're eating the fruit

1037
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:20,360
they were actually impairing fat oxidation and they were storing energy and their weights go way up.

1038
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:24,840
And it's because they ate so many fruit. If you eat one fruit you're not going to do that but if

1039
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,600
you eat a huge amount of fruit and get all that fructose it will start to overwhelm the good things

1040
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:37,400
in fruit but there's so many good things in fruit. There's vitamin c, there's epicatechin and flavonols

1041
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:43,000
and potassium and all these things that help fight the effects of fructose. So we generally for

1042
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,160
patients that have a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease we tend to restrict them to 10 grams a day

1043
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:54,600
of fructose only in the form of whole fruit. Do you think that's overly stringent or is that reasonable?

1044
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:59,640
I think that's wonderful if they can do it. Yeah it basically comes down to you can have a bowl of

1045
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:05,880
berries. No bananas, no apples, none of the high fructose fruits or even large fruits. How do you

1046
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:10,200
handle this with your kids? You have two kids. They're not that young anymore but they were young

1047
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:16,120
during the time in which you were learning all of this stuff. How did you balance the knowledge that

1048
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:21,720
you have? It sucks when your dad knows more about sugar than almost any human on the planet and you're

1049
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:27,560
a kid and we're wired to want sugar. How did you balance the sane delivery of this knowledge to your

1050
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:33,800
family? So first of all things like birthdays and stuff, I let them have birthday cake but we try to

1051
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:40,040
make sugar-free Splenda type cakes at home. So if we make cookies or cakes at home we try to use

1052
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:45,160
Splenda. Now they're still high carb and there can be chocolate in it occasionally you know so they

1053
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:50,440
do get some exposure to sugar. We don't give them fruit juice and we don't give them soft. They are

1054
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:56,280
not allowed regular soft drinks but they can have a diet soft drink. I have a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old.

1055
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:03,480
What we try to do is not to be so restrictive that it's disruptive but we try to be encouraging

1056
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:11,080
them to understand that sugar is playing a big role in obesity and diabetes and that it's unhealthy

1057
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:15,720
to eat a lot. What age do you think kids start to... I think that makes sense which is to me it's

1058
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:20,520
much more important that you would explain to your kids why you might be putting these rules in place

1059
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,680
as opposed to just come down as an authoritarian sort of this is the way it's going to be. At what

1060
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:30,520
age did your kids start to understand that dad wasn't just being a pain but there's a real reason

1061
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:36,440
that he's in the short run asking us to make a sacrifice. Also I've been involved in local school

1062
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:40,920
programs and there's a foundation called Living Closer Foundation that I've worked with where

1063
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:46,920
we've gone into schools and tried to teach children elementary schools to learn from fourth

1064
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:52,200
through sixth grade. We try to teach them how to look at labels on foods to understand the amount

1065
01:44:52,200 --> 01:45:00,360
of sugar. We do a game where we have someone come up with a cup of tea and add a spoonful of sugar

1066
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:05,720
to it and the person likes it and then we say okay now we're going to make it like a soft drink and

1067
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,840
we put in like eight teaspoons of sugar and it's like you can't drink it but that's the equivalent

1068
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:16,600
of what is in a soft drink of the same volume. By the way do you think the carbonation masks some

1069
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:20,520
of that sugar because when you put it that way which is a great way to do it I've never thought

1070
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:26,360
of that experiment. It's almost grotesque. It is. It's a great way to teach kids about sugar. But do

1071
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:30,840
you think the carbonation makes it a little easier to consume such a high amount of sugar in a soft

1072
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:35,560
drink? I suspect so. I haven't tested it but I suspect that's true. Or the phosphoric acid like

1073
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:41,080
there's something else in there that makes it more palatable. Yeah maybe it's the carbonation

1074
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:46,280
probably is. What about dried fruit? Is that a no-no? You know it was so disappointing when I realized

1075
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:51,400
that dried fruit was the fructose of fruits without the good things in it. So when you make

1076
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:59,640
dried fruit a lot of the good things and natural fruits are lost. It's like pure fructose. It's

1077
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,160
disappointing because I love dried fruit but I realize it's not the best food for you. Now if

1078
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:10,440
you're out hiking the mountains and you're spending a lot of energy maybe it's good. Yeah exactly

1079
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:14,840
that's the thing I've always got to kick out of. Two things have amused me to no end. One is trail

1080
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,560
mix the other are sports drinks. Trail mix probably makes sense when you're mountaineering.

1081
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:24,520
Sports drinks might make sense when you're a professional athlete but paradoxically most

1082
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:29,480
trail mix is consumed off the trail and most sports drinks are not consumed by athletes

1083
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:35,560
actively playing sports. So again the dose makes the poison context matters. Absolutely true. Well

1084
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:41,240
Rick this has been awesome. I want to be mindful of your time and I know that this is a non-clinical

1085
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,160
day for you which means every minute we're talking you're not in your lab and I want you

1086
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:49,960
to get back to the lab. So I want to thank you very much again not just for this discussion today

1087
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:55,960
which for me is super interesting and I think the listeners will agree but much more importantly for

1088
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:01,480
the work you've done you've taken a very different approach to quote unquote the war on sugar. You're

1089
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:07,560
less involved on the policy side of this and the sort of advocacy side of this but I think what your

1090
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:15,560
work has done is created the strongest scientific foundation to the harm of fructose and you've done

1091
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:21,480
it in a largely and I say this in a complementary way but in a largely unceremonious way which is

1092
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:25,320
you've sort of had your head down and a lot of people don't know who you are so I hope that more

1093
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:30,840
people become familiar with your work because your I mean your CV is comical in terms of like

1094
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:36,040
it's like every week you seem to publish something in either journal of medicine. The paper we talked

1095
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,920
about yesterday which we can't talk about today because it's not yet we're not there yet. I look

1096
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,800
forward to seeing that paper in science hopefully in the next six months but that's an unbelievable

1097
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:51,080
tour de force that almost requires us coming back to have a talk about it. Well thank you very much

1098
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,680
those are very kind words. Thank you Rick. Really enjoyable and thank you. Thank you for listening
