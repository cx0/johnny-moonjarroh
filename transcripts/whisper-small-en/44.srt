00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,760
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Jeremy Shapp, one of the

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,880
preeminent journalists at ESPN and a wonderful guy. We spend a lot of time in this episode talking

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,520
about sports, obviously. Jeremy has done a lot of amazing work and he's written the book,

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,800
Cinderella Man, which is an incredible story of James J. Braddock, who many of you probably have

49
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,640
not heard of, but I think by the end of this episode, you'll understand why the story is so

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,240
beautiful. We also talk a lot about his most recent project, which is directing a 30 for 30 special

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,320
called 42 to 1, which is the story of the Buster Douglas upset of Mike Tyson. We get into a lot of

52
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,280
things that go beyond sports or at least are associated with sports, such as why these things

53
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,840
matter to us, what they teach us about life, and the challenges that he faced following in his

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,120
father's enormous footsteps and ultimately coping with his father's early death as a result of a

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,320
medical error. This episode could have gone on for a really long time, but we kind of had a time limit

56
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,720
on it and we had to draw it to a close earlier than either one of us would have liked. But with

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,320
that said, I think you'll really enjoy my conversation with Jeremy Shapp. Hey Jeremy, thanks for coming,

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,720
man. It's my pleasure, Peter. Thank you for having me. First trip on the second subway, huh? I guess

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,440
it's been a couple of years now. I mean, they've been building it since 1929, but it was nice to,

60
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,240
you know, I went out of my way to get a chance to see the 72nd street station. It was pretty

61
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,160
impressive. Not having been in New York that long, I don't appreciate the morass of like nonsense. Oh,

62
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,000
you know, by the year 2400, it should extend a little bit farther downtown, I would expect.

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,520
Apparently it's going all the way to Tribeca. Yeah, and then there's the LIRR, you know,

64
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,440
extension to Grand Central and, you know, the city is always improving just sometimes very slowly.

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,160
So there's so many things I want to talk about on the sports front, but I also realize that maybe

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,240
not everybody wants to hear all of this stuff, but I want to start with something in boxing,

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,280
because you and I have something in common, which is we are both completely obsessed with the history

68
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,320
of boxing. And we were talking about over dinner a few months ago. I don't think I know anything

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,520
that has happened in boxing from about the year 1996 forward. If you asked me to rattle off one

70
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,320
champion in one division that year probably coincides with the beginning of some new

71
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,480
professional endeavor or, you know, once you start building a family and your career and all that,

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,560
it's harder to be as obsessive about these things. And boxing itself has, let's face it,

73
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,280
lost a lot of its luster over the last several decades. I'm certainly not as up on the sport as

74
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,000
I was when I was covering it for ESPN on a regular basis. I was a ringside reporter for some time.

75
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,160
I wrote a book about boxing history, but that didn't have anything to do with the contemporary

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,520
sport. My assignment for about 10 years was being like the Mike Tyson reporter from 1995,

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,280
when he got out of prison until 2005, when he retired, that constituted a lot of the work

78
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,080
that I did. His last fight was against Kevin McBride. Kevin McBride, the Clonus Colossus.

79
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,480
Unforgettable, Clonus Colossus in Washington, DC. And I guess I sort of am exaggerating a little

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,040
bit. I still followed it enough. I mean, I would watch-

81
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
If you remember Kevin McBride.

82
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Yeah. The fact that I can remember the Kevin McBride fight tells you I was still somewhat

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,400
paying attention, but I had an almost ridiculous obsession going back to about Jack Johnson.

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,880
Okay.

85
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,680
So from Johnson to Dempsey to Lewis to Marciano to Ali-

86
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
All heavyweights.

87
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Yeah. And of course, you know, Robinson Armstrong, like, it's hard to put in words how much I

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,240
obsessed over that stuff. Like I knew every detail of every one of their fights at one point.

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,720
That goes way beyond me. I mean, I had-

90
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
But you wrote about Braddock, which I'd love to just-

91
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah. I mean, I immersed myself in the 30s. And the book that I wrote about Braddock and Bear,

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,640
it really was also kind of a primer on the first 50 years of the heavyweight division as well,

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,640
because those stories for me, like you, are just so fascinating. These guys were such big stars,

94
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,880
and so many of them were outsized personalities. And there was nothing else in sports that even

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,480
approached the significance of the heavyweight championship of the world. That was it. I mean,

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,600
you know, the middleweight champion of the world- Remember, there were only eight divisions and-

97
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,360
And one champion per division.

98
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,960
One champion per division, and there's something mythic about it. And it always fascinated me. And

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,480
I grew up in the 1970s. I was born in 1969. I grew up in the 1970s, obviously, in the sports

100
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,520
business. There was a lot of interesting stuff going on, epic stuff going on in the heavyweight

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,160
division. My father was very much Dick Shappe, very much a part of that. And I remember, you know,

102
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,160
being six, seven years old, I still have it, this encyclopedia boxing champions just sitting there,

103
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,280
memorizing it. Whether it was about Stanley Ketchill, the great middleweight, or it was about

104
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,680
the great heavyweights from the guys you named Dempsey and Johnson and Sullivan, there was

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,240
something that always attracted me to those stories as well.

106
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,080
So you chose to dive into a really interesting story that is, I think, honestly, without your

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,240
work would be a footnote, right? So most people wouldn't even know who James J. Braddock is,

108
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,960
were it not for the movie Cinderella Man starring Russell Crowe, which of course was based entirely

109
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,240
on your book. Well, it pains me to disabuse you of that misimpression, but I feel obligated to do so.

110
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,800
The movie was actually in the works before the book. Oh, I didn't know that. And I just assumed

111
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,560
that many people I wish the movie was in the works before the book. Yes, I'm taking all that

112
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,840
back. Take all of it back. Russell Crowe would have made everybody know. There had not been a

113
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,520
book written about since ever really a Big Mac's bear book and not since the 30s that anyone

114
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,880
written a book about Braddock. And I decided to make it kind of a dual biography as they are on

115
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,840
this collision course towards this heavyweight showdown in 1935. And so let's give people a

116
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,760
little bit of a sense of that because for me, I've always, like I looked at all of those

117
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,440
heavyweights to me, the entire lineage from Sullivan to Johnson to Lewis, et cetera. I mean,

118
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,120
every one of those guys seemed like a god. They didn't seem like they were mortal. They just,

119
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,800
there was nothing about them that seemed normal. Bear was like, first of all, like probably the

120
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,280
most good looking guy I've ever seen in my life. Very handsome guy. It's hard to imagine a more

121
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,720
handsome, beautiful, stunning human being. And his career gets off to kind of a weird start

122
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,360
when he kills this guy with Frankie Campbell. He kills Frankie Campbell in the ring. And it has

123
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,640
been about 15 years since I wrote the book. But if I recall correctly, Frankie died in a fight.

124
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,880
A couple of days later. Yeah. A couple of days later, it was in San Francisco. Frank, it was 1930

125
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,400
and Bear was from the Bay Area. I think Frankie was from the Bay Area as well. He happened to be

126
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,720
the older brother of Dolph Camilli, who would end up being an excellent first baseman in the major

127
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,600
leagues, the MVP of the National League in I think 1941 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. And there's

128
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,280
an inquest. I mean, there is a criminal investigation because of the way in which Campbell

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,000
was battered in the ring and then died. Yeah. Of course, all of the stuff I know about these

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,040
things are from watching old documentaries and reading about it. But I read that Bear was never

131
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,360
the same since after that fight. First of all, apparently he was just devastated by the fact that

132
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,760
Campbell died. And I mean, I remember reading something that his son wrote many years later

133
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,480
that said, look, my dad was he was a showman. I mean, he was not in this to hurt people. He

134
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,920
sort of took that as his job. But to have this guy die at your hands was he was never quite the same.

135
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,440
By all accounts, it really did shake him. And it affected the way that he approached life. It

136
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,880
affected the way that he approached his opponents in the ring. A few years later, he would be blamed

137
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,720
for the death of another heavyweight Ernie Schaff. Yeah. Although that one's a bit

138
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,840
controversial because I believe there was an autopsy done that suggested he actually had

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,840
meningitis and he hadn't recovered from sort of a chronic meningitis at the time that he actually

140
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,360
died because he died in the ring at the hands of another fighter whose name I'm blanking on.

141
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,880
That's right. You know, and it's been a while. I think it was Carneira.

142
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh, you're right. It was primo carneira. You're right. It was primo carneira. It was at Madison

143
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,400
Square Garden. Although carneira ends up administering the blows in the fight in which

144
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,160
Schaff dies. But it was a very gentle blow. It was almost a jab that killed him. People said

145
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,440
it was the beating he took at the hands of bear that had made it possible for that. So all of this

146
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,840
is to basically say when Max bear finally beats primo carneira, which he does in ridiculous

147
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,400
fashion, I think there was 10 knockdowns. It's a laughable, laughable fight. Yeah. Bear looks

148
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,400
invincible and he'd already beaten Schmeling, correct? He'd already beaten Schmeling. Yeah.

149
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,600
And there was no way that he was going to give Schmeling a rematch given what was going on

150
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,640
politically. Again, it's been a while Peter, but my recollection is nobody was interested in giving

151
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,680
Max Schmeling a rematch against bear just because he wasn't really, he was considered washed up,

152
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,880
finished. I mean, when he beats Joe Louis in 1936, he's considered washed up and finished. He wasn't

153
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,440
even part of the discussion. Yeah. So they decided to take a tune up fight basically with this guy who

154
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,440
can't possibly win, right? Well, what happens? Jim Braddock has been out of the fight game.

155
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,280
He's hurt. He had been a light heavyweight contender in the late 1920s. He'd lost his one

156
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,920
shot to Tommy Lachran, who was a great light heavyweight. And at that point, Braddock's

157
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,360
entire personal situation really falls apart and his professional situation, not his personal,

158
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,920
really his professional situation. He breaks his hand. He can't fight anymore. He can't make any

159
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,840
money. The depression hits. He is working on the docks across the Hudson River from Manhattan.

160
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:52,920
He's desperate. He goes on relief, which at that time, in Braddock's mind, in the minds of a lot

161
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,360
of people, that was a kind of humiliation, taking government assistance, especially a guy like Braddock,

162
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,240
who had been so successful. He'd fought for the light heavyweight championship, which was a big,

163
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,800
big deal in 1929 in a way that it's not now. And everybody thinks he's through. He's finished.

164
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,840
He's done. Totally kaput. But the interesting thing is by doing the work on the docks, because

165
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,480
he doesn't have the money for bus fare or cab fare to get from his home to the docks, he's walking

166
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,360
every day 20 miles ridiculous. He's working as a stevedore, you know, hauling giant bales and stuff

167
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,160
like that, even with a broken hand, he builds up this strength, especially in his left hand, he

168
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,240
never had a left hand before the right hand is broken. So he's building strength. All of these

169
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,560
things, it sounds like some kind of fairy tale or something may prepare him in a way he hadn't been

170
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,920
prepared to seize the moment he gets the shot against an up and comer named John Griffin, John

171
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,080
Corn Griffin on the undercar of the Bear Carnera fight. And he was not expected to beat Griffin.

172
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,760
He was just an opponent. He was the guy who was going to be a stepping stone for Corn Griffin on

173
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,880
his way to fighting Max Bear. But Braddock is a different Braddock and he delivers against Corn

174
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,560
Griffin, stunning the promoters, people who had, you know, these high hopes for for Corn Griffin,

175
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,880
whose name is still in boxing circles, kind of stands for guy who couldn't get it done stepping

176
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,800
stone. It's almost like a Wally pip thing. And almost exactly a year later, I think 364 days

177
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,200
later, he beats, he beats a couple of more impressive fighters on the way sets himself

178
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,880
up for a showdown with Max Bear for the heavyweight title, which nobody gave him a shot. I believe it

179
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,920
was eight or nine to one huge underdog, eight, nine, 10 to one underdog, depending on who you ask,

180
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,120
which at that time was, I think the most lopsided odds ever in a heavyweight championship fight,

181
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,640
of course, we're gonna come to one that's a little more lopsided in a minute.

182
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,040
And Braddock is this guy who's fighting for his family. He's got three little kids. He's got the

183
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,720
wife. They're living in poverty. They're living in poverty when this rise starts. After he wins one

184
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,720
of the fights on the way that year, you know, he goes back, he shows up at the relief office. I

185
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,040
mean, it, it almost sounds like it has to be apocryphal, but everybody said it really happened.

186
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,840
He shows up at the relief office and returns, returns the money, $35 or whatever that he'd

187
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,120
taken on government relief. And he becomes the people's hero. But nobody thought he had a chance

188
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,280
against Max bear who looked utter. Yeah, I mean, Max bear looked like an executioner and he was

189
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,720
physically bigger than him. Oh, and he's a specimen. We just saw Deontay Wilder fight for

190
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,640
the heavyweight championship not long ago at 211 pounds, you know, it ends up being a draw with,

191
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,000
with Tyson Fury. And he's six foot seven Deontay Wilder, I think six, seven, six, six.

192
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Max bear is six two and he weighs more and he is caught. Oh, he's you look at the pictures of him.

193
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,800
He does not have enough. He is he is ripped in a way that athletes were not ripped like that in

194
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,680
that he's 250 pounds. He weighs more than Deontay Wilder without being tubby. And Jim Braddock's,

195
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,280
you know, a former light heavyweight who somehow gets all the way up to like 192, 193, something

196
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,160
like that for the fight. It's not a good fight. It's a pretty boring fight and Max bears clowning

197
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,480
his way through it. He doesn't seem to be taking it seriously. It's his first title defense. For

198
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,600
some reason he seemed well, there are a lot of reasons why he was ambivalent about the sport.

199
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,080
We talked about Frankie Campbell and Ernie Schaff, but he doesn't show up in Braddock. Braddock

200
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:25,640
wins pretty easily. Yeah. And you know, it is a beautiful story because again, maybe it's my

201
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,360
recollections not there, but I remember reading that leading up to the fight Braddock said,

202
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm not losing this fight. Like there is no way like he was fighting for his life, his honor,

203
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,040
his family. He was fighting for something much more beyond him. And you don't get to see that

204
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,760
often. No, it literally was. I mean, you don't often have in a heavyweight championship fight a

205
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,720
guy who is that where the the scent of desperation is so recently in his nostrils. You know, I mean,

206
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,560
if you're fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world, you're probably doing pretty

207
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,840
okay for a while at that point. You've been making money on other fights. You've been getting bigger

208
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,200
and stronger. You've been accustomed to success and only success. And Braddock was a guy who had

209
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,760
been broken. I mean, broken. And there was no chance he was ever going to challenge for anything

210
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,520
like the heavyweight championship again. I mean, impossible. And this would be everything to him.

211
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,600
And he inspired so many people. There were so many people pulling for him,

212
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
but nobody really thought that he had a chance against Max Baer who was five years younger.

213
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,240
By every metric was superior man. He should have won the fight.

214
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,000
And then of course, I think it was by that point Schmeling had upset Lewis, which was,

215
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,240
you know, 1936. That's right, 1936. Yeah. And I think at that point Baer did have a chance.

216
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,680
I mean, you could have argued he should have fought Schmeling, but by that point, the war

217
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,920
was really starting to ramp up in Europe. And again, maybe this isn't true. Maybe this is just

218
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,240
revisionist history, but he had a choice to fight Lewis versus Schmeling. And the logical choice

219
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,040
would have been Schmeling, right? Because he had beat Lewis, but the sort of more American choice

220
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,560
was you're going to fight- What about Braddock's choice, right?

221
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,320
Yeah, sorry, Braddock's choice. That's right. So he fights Lewis. And I mean, we all know how

222
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,640
the story ends, which is Lewis wins. And that goes on to create the most dominant heavyweight

223
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,240
in the history of the sport, 12 years champion, 25 final defenses. But the fight was more

224
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,360
compelling than people expected. I mean, Braddock put up a better fight.

225
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Well, as I recall, he knocks down Joe Lewis in the first round.

226
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,880
Yeah.

227
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,480
You know, that's really, I mean, he would fight one more fight after Lewis.

228
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,920
Which he won and then retired.

229
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,800
Which he won and retired. But the thing about Jim Braddock, what I think he embodies

230
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,920
is this idea whether or not you buy into it, that there is something noble about that sport,

231
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,520
and about the commitment required, and about the dedication, and about its code,

232
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,600
whatever that code, you know, the code of courage, personal courage, of total commitment,

233
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,760
of believing there's something honorable about fighting until you've got nothing left.

234
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,600
None of that stuff mattered to Max Baer. That's the contrast to Max Baer thought this was

235
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,560
show business. And it was a way for him to make a buck. And I think after he killed Frankie

236
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,040
Campbell, and had a hand in the death of Ernie Schaff, it was kind of like, I'd like to make some

237
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,800
money. I'd like to be in movies. He was in movies. He was starring in Hollywood movies while he was

238
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,360
champion before he was champion getting good notices. And of course, moved out to Hollywood

239
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,960
later. And Braddock really felt, you know what, I'm going down like a Roman centurion on my back.

240
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,360
If he's taken my title, Joe Lewis, he's gonna damn near almost take my life.

241
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,480
He's got and that's exactly it. And you know, there's the story in the corner after

242
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,560
Lewis almost rips off his head, and he's battered and bloodied. And he's his corner wants to throw

243
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,880
in the towel. And he tells Joe Gould, who's his manager, his best friend, the guy who's been

244
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,080
there for everything with him, he says, if you throw in the towel, never taught you again.

245
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,840
And I think he meant it. Now today, we'd say that's just silly. You know, Jim,

246
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,280
that's Joe Lewis, that's 23 year old Joe Lewis, get out of the ring. But then it meant something.

247
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,160
And you're new, you're so right about Joe Lewis. I mean, it does break my heart a little bit today

248
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,600
when you see people talking about this sport without an understanding of what came before,

249
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,160
like what did it mean to be Joe Lewis, let's not even talk about the political and social side of

250
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,400
it, which to me is just as beautiful as what he could do athletically. But when you go back and

251
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,160
look at the film of him, including his rematch with smelling, which to me is one of the most

252
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,320
remarkable fights ever, he breaks his vertebrae, he breaks one of the bones in his back in the

253
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,240
first round in this revenge fight, everything he went on to do, you know, bringing it back to Max

254
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Bear. I remember reading that after so Lewis fought Bear two years later. So now Lewis is

255
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,360
champion Bear is not and Lewis beats him badly, but Bear finishes on a knee. So you can, there's

256
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,400
a very famous image in boxing where Max Bear is on his knee clearly looking like he could get up

257
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,720
and gets counted out. Yeah. I mean, what I remember though is that Bear did not want to go

258
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,680
into the ring. I think he had a hand injury. He did not have been in the fight. That's absolutely

259
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,840
right. And so at the press conference after one of the reporters says to bear, Maxie, it looked

260
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,000
like you could have beat the count and he looks at him and he says something to the effect of he,

261
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,880
you know, Bear always had a great way of saying stuff, including his last words before he died.

262
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,120
But he said something to the effect of if I'm going to get executed, you're going to have to

263
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,520
pay a lot more than $35 to see it or whatever the ticket price was. That's exactly right. Which

264
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:39,480
is kind of the summation of everything he felt about the sport. Yeah. And he died young, which

265
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,200
broke my heart too. I mean, he died at 50, right? He had a heart attack. And the famous line, you

266
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,760
know, yeah, you know, these things sound too good to be true. We're so nerdy to be talking about this.

267
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,840
So you got to be skeptical, but you know, he's staying in a hotel in Hollywood, I think, and

268
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,480
he calls down. Yeah. He's having chest pain. He's having chest pain. Oh no, there's two lines.

269
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,560
One line is we'll send the house doctor. And he says, I don't need a house doctor. I need a person

270
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,720
doctor. That's right. Dummy. Right. And then they send somebody up and then, you know, this is

271
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,920
actually bringing it back to sort of my world of heart disease. I mean, you didn't have any tools

272
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,080
to help somebody having a heart attack back then, the way we do today. So once someone's going down

273
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,960
that path, they're gone. And by the time they did get the medical folks up to the hotel, he had a

274
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,920
second heart attack and his last words apparently were, Oh, here I go, or something to that effect.

275
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,240
This is it. I'm here. I go. Yeah. He was, he was a great, he was a fascinating figure. He was a

276
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,520
colorful character. He loses the title fight and then he fights Lewis and he didn't have any

277
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,120
interest in the fight game anymore. Is it a coincidence that you've written the New York

278
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,720
Times bestselling book that describes the entire story of what we just described. And then you go

279
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,120
on to make, you know, one of my favorite ESPN 30 for 30s, which is 42 to one, the parallels between

280
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,320
Buster Douglas and James J. Braddock are comical, right? You couldn't make it up. Right.

281
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,560
They're the two greatest underdogs in heavyweight championship history. Who also rose for a moment.

282
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,160
Yeah. I mean, that's right. Yeah. You know, they're the two biggest underdogs, but they were bigger

283
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,960
underdogs than all those guys who lost the fights. You know, they're underdogs who win the fights,

284
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,120
who sees the moment. And I've always loved the Buster Douglas story to me. You know, as I said,

285
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,320
I was born in 1969. I'm 49. I've seen everything you could see in sports. A lot of it I've seen in

286
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,560
person, you know, other stuff I've watched on TV and the night of that fight, it was nighttime here

287
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,720
in the US. It was the night of the slam dunk contest in the NBA. I remember this like it was

288
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,960
yesterday. It was that night and it was afternoon, early afternoon in Tokyo. And I found out the

289
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,320
result that night I couldn't find anywhere that had regular HBO to watch it. I wanted to watch it.

290
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,560
I tried to locate regular HBO. I happened to be in Hanover, New Hampshire that night.

291
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,280
And I couldn't find it. But somebody told me later in the night, did you hear what happened? Just like

292
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,880
millions of people around the world. Did you hear what happened? Did you hear what happened? No,

293
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,960
can't be can't possibly be could not have possibly occurred. And then my mother sent me a VHS. She

294
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:16,040
had recorded it off HBO and watching it even a few days later in my apartment in college.

295
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,560
It was still so thrilling, so exciting that it's such a great fight. It really is. It's such an

296
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,960
incredible fight. And for Buster Douglas to rise the occasion as he did, again, when the stakes were

297
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,480
so high cannot have been higher. 22 days after the death of his mother, when nobody thought he had a

298
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,680
chance, when Mike Tyson looked utterly invincible, there's nothing else quite like it. I obviously

299
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,120
watched it as soon as it came out. And I think I'm going to watch it again with you tonight at

300
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,280
the screening. But I had not seen the fight in about 15 years. Right. So I watched it probably a

301
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,840
million times at the time, but I'd forgotten a lot of it and I'd forgotten the ninth round. Oh,

302
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,720
I'd for I'd completely blanked on that round. You don't see those kinds of rounds in heavyweight

303
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,880
fighting. No, you put that in the category of round 10 of Riddick Bowe versus of Andrew Holyfield

304
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,040
in a round 10. You put that in a round of Hagler Hearn's round one, which was, by the way, that's

305
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,840
what got me into boxing. That was some Hagler Hearn's round one, April 1985 was when I decided

306
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,720
I wanted to be the middleweight champion of the world. That was, luckily I chose another path.

307
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,520
No, the Douglas fight was unbelievable. And I don't know if you ever heard it, you know,

308
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,880
blank on his name. Teddy Atlas was on Joe Rogan, I don't know, a while ago. And Teddy Atlas made

309
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,800
a really interesting point. He said, you know, Tyson's never won a fight in his life because

310
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,480
every fight he won, you know, won technically, the opponent was beat before they got in the ring.

311
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,840
Every fight he lost is because the guy came in and wasn't afraid. And Douglas was in many ways,

312
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,880
the most impressive of those because he was the first one to beat him. And then of course,

313
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,960
Holyfield would go on to do it twice and then Lewis and then ultimately McBride. I think those

314
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,600
were Tyson's five losses, correct? Yeah, it was Williams McBride, Chudaholy Field and

315
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,560
Lewis McBride, Chudaholy Field and Buster. Yeah. But the Douglas one is a different level.

316
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,440
It's a different level because it's the first and because he gave us not only the blueprint,

317
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:20,360
but because it was Mike Tyson at 23, not Mike Tyson after prison, not Mike Tyson at 37.

318
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:27,080
It was the Mike Tyson who had annihilated Michael Spinks and humiliated Larry Holmes.

319
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,200
And remember his previous fight to Douglas, wasn't it Frank Bruno who he had obliterated?

320
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,840
The fight right before it was, I think it was Frank, I'm getting mixed up now, there's

321
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Carl Williams. Oh, you're right. No, no, you're right. It was Carl Williams in July of 89 was the

322
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,520
previous one. And before that was Frank Bruno. Right, right. And before that was Spinks.

323
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,480
Right. He was 37 and 0, 34 knockouts. Tony Tucker had taken him the distance,

324
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,280
but it wasn't a close fight at all. And then Bone Crusher Smith had taken him the distance.

325
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,160
That's right. And basically clinching the whole way there. He'd gone the distance twice before

326
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,920
Quick Tillis took him the distance. Three of them. Yeah, yeah, it was three of them, right.

327
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,400
And so it was a sense maybe some big guys could give him some trouble, you know, if they approached,

328
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,240
but those guys weren't in those fights. Those fights were not close fights. There was no one

329
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,080
who had stood up to him. And who had matched him punch for punch. And Buster Douglas did more than

330
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,040
that. The thing about the Buster Douglas story, why I really wanted for this to be given this

331
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,680
kind of treatment is because I've known Buster for a long time, I did stories about the 20th

332
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,320
anniversary of the fight, the 25th anniversary of the fight. And this moment for me as a young person

333
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,480
was just so it was such a transcendent sports moment, I said, and people don't get it. They

334
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,920
don't want to give Buster credit. They want to say it was a one hit wonder, he got lucky with a punch

335
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,720
or that he wasn't, he didn't deserve to even be in the same ring with Mike Tyson.

336
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,880
But everything people thought they knew about Buster Douglas was really wrong. Buster Douglas,

337
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,480
of course, you know, dominates that fight. I mean, it is an epic performance. He doesn't get lucky.

338
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,000
It's not a Sim Rockman in South Africa, that's right. Lennox Lewis. It's not one punch. It is a

339
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
butt kicking. It's an ass kicking by round three. Yeah. Like if you go back and watch that fight,

340
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,320
knowing the outcome, which of course now we would all do, you're not blinded by the way you are the

341
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,520
first time you saw it live, which is you're in denial. You're in denial. And by the way,

342
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,960
Or you just think something's going to happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Didn't two of the three judges

343
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,360
have Tyson ahead at the time of the knockout? I think that's right. Which is like those people

344
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,040
should be removed in a sport. And my co-director went to Japan and interviewed one of them and he's

345
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,120
just like, yeah, that's what it looked like to me. But that speaks to the aura of Tyson,

346
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,920
that you could have had Tyson winning one goddamn round besides. Or the Oradon King. Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,680
So, but you're right. It's a total ass kicking. Tyson's eye is swelling shut by the third round.

348
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,760
Even the eighth round where he knocks Douglas down, I mean, Douglas still dominated that round.

349
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,320
Yeah. And then the ninth round, he almost takes Tyson's head off his shoulders. That sequence in

350
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,840
the corner, you know, and that's the thing we didn't know. It also speaks to how tough Tyson was.

351
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,760
We didn't know Mike Tyson had a chin. We had no idea until that fight. Nobody had ever

352
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,200
challenged him. And I mean, the beating that he took, I think the people who thought Buster

353
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,680
were going to win and there were about four of them thought that he would win because he would

354
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:29,000
be able to keep his distance, use his jab. And Tyson wouldn't know what to do after four or five

355
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,600
rounds, that he would just kind of get frustrated and DQ himself or just fall apart physically from

356
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:46,920
the exhaustion. And instead, Mike Tyson, I mean, he's in there for 40 minutes taking an epic

357
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,960
beating, an epic beating from a bigger, stronger, more athletic man. I mean, you know, you could

358
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,080
say everything and look, Mike Tyson was a phenomenon. What Mike Tyson did from 1985 up until that moment

359
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,440
in Tokyo, it's pretty impressive. And it's pretty special. It doesn't look as special now because we

360
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,280
know the next chapter of the story. But of course, at that time, you know, for Buster Douglas to,

361
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,560
you know, Buster Douglas is a bigger guy. He is a stronger guy. Maybe stronger is not the right

362
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:22,120
word. He was a more focused guy. And he was a better athlete. And he used all of his advantages

363
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,400
and he marshaled all of his talents. And that's what's so fascinating about the story to me

364
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:32,840
is that here's a guy who had been considered an underachiever at best and a quitter at worst.

365
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,120
And by the way, I got to tell you, you guys made a great point of that. And the thing,

366
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:44,200
I guess I have a different view. He was beating Tucker Handley, right? And then he basically fails

367
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,320
to answer a few punches and the ref stops it. I'm not sure I call that quitting. I mean, I'm not sure

368
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,120
I do either. I just, I think that was always a very unfair label. It's totally, totally unfair.

369
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,400
A guy, look, boxing is a cruel sport. This is another reason why I want to tell this story.

370
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,160
Boxing, unlike other sports, right? Here's a guy, Buster Douglas, who at that point,

371
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,760
when he gets into the ring with Mike Tyson, right? You know, he fought for the heavyweight title.

372
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:16,040
He fought big, tough guys. He'd beaten Greg Page, who would be a heavyweight champion. He'd beaten

373
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Oliver McCall, who was going to be a heavyweight champion. And yet people thought of him not as

374
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,000
just a guy who's not Mike Tyson's peer, but as a bump, you know, but only in boxing, right?

375
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
No, there's that quote that you guys have in the movie where what did Don King say about him?

376
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,720
He's a dog.

377
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,320
He's a dog. I mean, he's a quitter and he's a dog. Like Don King, if anybody would know a dog.

378
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,920
I mean, it is something, but that's the way I think the average sports fan and even boxing

379
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,280
fans talk about boxers. I've said this before, like if you're the 15th best left-handed pitcher

380
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,160
in the national league, you're getting a contract for like 110, 120 million dollars. Maybe, maybe

381
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,920
that's a slight exaggeration. Eighty five, ninety million dollars guaranteed. And you're an

382
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,720
all-star and people want your autograph and people say, oh, he's so effective and he can do this.

383
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,320
If you're the third best middleweight in the world, but you're not the best, nobody knows your name.

384
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,200
And it's like, oh, he lost that fight. He's a bump. You know, you hear that all the time. And

385
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:20,600
Buster Douglas, the reputation fairly or unfairly had been established in that fight against Tony

386
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,120
Tucker when he's winning. He's five rounds away. I think it was a 15 rounder still at that time.

387
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
You're right. That would have been the last of the 15 rounders.

388
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,880
I think it was 87. I think that I think it was still a 15 rounder.

389
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,040
It was May of 87. So, yeah.

390
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,360
I mean, Mills Lane did the right thing. It was time to stop that fight because Buster is standing

391
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,880
there. He just wasn't returning them. Yeah.

392
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,520
Six or seven, massive. I mean, Tony Tucker was a good fighter. Tony Tucker is a big guy.

393
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,600
He's pummeling Buster and Buster's not doing anything. So the fight had to end, but to call

394
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,680
him a quitter, you get in the ring and take some of those punches from Tony Tucker.

395
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,040
Yeah. The other thing I remember at the time was when Douglas' mother died two weeks before the

396
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,960
fight. And I remember that getting like small news. Remember, this fight wasn't getting that

397
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,120
much news because this was, people are already talking about the Holyfield fight that was supposed

398
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,280
to happen in June, I think. It was already a contract.

399
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,480
So, and I remember thinking, oh man, they're going to have to postpone the fight and he's

400
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,840
never going to get his shot. And I remember just feeling kind of sorry for Douglas. Like,

401
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,280
I at least want him to get paid. You know what I mean? Like, at this point, it's like,

402
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,720
at least you deserve a couple million bucks because you've been through all of this stuff.

403
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,040
There's only 1.2, but that's 2 million today. So, yeah.

404
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,120
Yeah. There were people who thought, I mean, you saw in the film, Bruce Trampler, the Hall of Fame

405
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,160
promoter and matchmaker who knew Buster from the time he was a little kid because he was his father's

406
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,600
father. He said, I thought he should pull out. I didn't see how he could possibly have enough

407
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,080
focus after his mother's death to get in the ring. That's how his brother kind of thought.

408
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,480
Buster said, no, let's go. Let's do this.

409
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,440
And there's something you did that was really beautiful in the film,

410
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,960
which was after one of Buster's fights, he's, I don't remember which fight it was, but he's

411
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,560
standing on the left. His mom is in the middle and the dad is on the right.

412
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,280
Right.

413
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,520
The interview, I forget who it was. It wasn't.

414
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
It's Al Bernstein.

415
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,760
It's right. It was a young Al Bernstein.

416
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,320
Big Al Bernstein.

417
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
I barely recognize him, right?

418
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,440
So Al Bernstein says to his mom, something to the effect of, are you proud of your son?

419
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,240
Al, that's not because you look old. That's not why Peter said that.

420
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,320
It's just you were wearing a strange suit.

421
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And your hair was a bit darker.

422
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,400
And he says to the mom, are you proud of your boy? And you initially, his mom didn't want him to

423
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,400
go down this path because she knew he was just a gentler soul than her husband, who was like a hard

424
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,960
ass. And then you see in this moment how proud she is of him and you see his face. It was this

425
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,880
beautiful look on Douglas's face as he looks at his mom saying how proud she is of him. And I

426
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,520
think at that point, someone basically makes the comment might have been in the narration that

427
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,120
he was just always closer to his mom. Like he was really his mom's child.

428
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,600
It's Bruce talking and he says, you know, that he favored his mother. I think those are the exact

429
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:08,120
words. His disposition was more like his mother, little pearls. He was not the stone cold killer

430
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,360
that his father, Bill Douglas, was in the ring. And that's the contrast to, of course, you know,

431
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,840
Bill Douglas was not a world champion. Bill Douglas was not Mike Tyson. He was a guy who

432
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,600
many people thought deserved title shots and didn't get them because he could do so much damage and

433
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,320
upset the apple cart. But his approach was Tyson like, and he fought with the same style and the

434
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,880
same commitment and the same determination to not just win, but to destroy. And that wasn't Buster.

435
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,600
On a little segue that I want to come back to the boxers who have fought with that ethos,

436
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:50,280
Sonny Liston, Jack Dempsey, George Foreman, Mike Tyson. There was a really interesting article in

437
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Sports Illustrated and I believe it was March of 88. So it was even before Tyson fought Spinks.

438
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,720
If I recall, Larry Bird was on the cover. So it was a very nondescript article. And I wish I could

439
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,400
find it because I, you know, I used to have every Sports Illustrated ever. Wow. And my mom, like 15

440
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,160
years ago, called me, you know where this story is going, don't you? It's just going to break your

441
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,920
heart. I had the first, I had the Eddie Matthews on the cover one. I mean, I had every newspaper

442
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,320
clipping you could ever have on this stuff. And it was boxes upon boxes upon boxes. And my mom calls

443
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,720
me like 15 years ago and she's like, look, Peter, do you want to come and get these things? And I

444
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,840
don't know. I just was like, no, you can pitch them. And like, it's like top three shames of my

445
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,480
life. But nevertheless, there was this. Can't blame her. She asked my mom. It's my fault, not yours.

446
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,320
So at least I could have had them digitally archived or something. Something. So it's this,

447
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,400
again, March 7th, 1988 throwaway article of Sports Illustrated just before the Tony Tubbs fight,

448
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,520
if I recall, because remember he fought Tubbs in Tokyo in like March. First event to the Tokyo

449
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,760
Dome. That's right. March 21st, 88 or something like that. You're really good. Two round knockout.

450
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,800
Tony Tubbs looked like he looked like nothing. The article makes an interesting point. And the

451
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,720
point was this. Now remember, Mike Tyson is three years into the reign of terror and he looks

452
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,680
utterly invincible. And the author says, you know what? The flames that burn this bright burn out

453
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,960
really quick. And the author went back and said, look at Dempsey. This is how bright that light

454
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,120
shone. And then it was gone. And look at Liston and look at Fraser and look at Forman. And they're

455
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,920
like, if you put Tyson in that bucket, this is not a guy who's going to have a long career. He is

456
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,760
going to implode. And I remember reading that as a 13 year old going for 12 year old, whatever the

457
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,000
hell I was thinking, this guy's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Tyson's going

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,200
to be the champion till he's 40. Like it again, which of course, Mike didn't even think he'd be

459
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,800
alive till he was 30. You were going out on a limb. So you just sort of think like, how much does

460
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,800
history repeat itself? Whereas when you look at the guys like Lewis and Ali, the ones that have

461
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,320
had the really, really long careers, you know, there's something different about it. There's

462
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,440
just something different about their ethos. They're a different type of person. They're not killers.

463
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,120
And it's not to say like they're gentlemen versus killers, but it's just

464
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,000
they're artists in a way that I think some of the most destructive and feared fighters were not.

465
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Yeah, well, there's no doubt about that. Because if you fall in love with your right hand, and the

466
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,720
knockout in particular, you're going to get lazy, and you're going to get one dimensional, and you're

467
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,000
going to get exposed eventually. And there are enough good fighters out there who can box who

468
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,960
bring other skills to bear. And if you've got some kind of deficiency, they're going to locate it,

469
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,640
they're going to find it, they're going to wear you down. It is one of those interesting things,

470
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,720
though, those guys, those destroyers, you know, the Dempsey's and the Liston's and, and the

471
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,120
Tyson's and you know, as well as I do there, there are similarities and there are a lot of differences

472
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:07,400
also when we talk about guys like that. But if you are being hailed as the destroyer as the guy who

473
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,480
can do everything and can get it done with one punch, you're not going to be listening the same

474
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,720
way to your trainer, to Kevin Rooney or Teddy Atlas or Aaron Stowell, the way if you've had to

475
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,120
box, you've had some challenges. I mean, the interesting thing about I've been talking about

476
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,080
this a lot the last couple of months. And the thing about Tyson, right, is that he's the heavyweight

477
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:37,000
champion, he's considered invincible, he has this aura about him that no one has had since Dempsey.

478
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,440
So I was going to ask you about that. Because I just, it's hard to extract that from the literature.

479
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,600
Do you believe that Tyson's aura was greater than that of Foreman's and Liston's at the respective

480
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:54,520
times? Yeah, I mean, I guess I'd have to go back and look, I mean, after Foreman does what he does

481
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,200
to Joe Frazier and all that, but I think so because, you know, there's just more of it. And at that

482
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,280
point, he'd taken on all comers. He there was nobody and there was more of it. The fashion which he did

483
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,880
it to so many different guys, I think it was bigger. I think it was more impressive with Tyson at that

484
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,320
time. And it was also his own way of speaking about things, his story where he came from the

485
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,320
kid from reform school. Anyway, I mean, you know, there's similarities to with Liston. But I think

486
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,040
it's not a parallel really with Lewis. Because most people would tell you, and I'm gonna assume

487
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,640
you're one of them that Joe Lewis is the greatest heavyweight champion of all time. I was gonna ask

488
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,280
you what your thought was. It's certainly between Lewis and Ali. Right. So let's say it's Joe Lewis,

489
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,640
but Joe Lewis, before he becomes champion, as we earlier discussed, has already lost a fight.

490
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah, he was knocked out.

491
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,000
Knocked out, humiliated against an older guy that everybody thought was over the hill. So when he

492
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,600
becomes champion, he doesn't have that aura that Tyson has. He builds a different kind of aura.

493
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:05,000
And he builds a different kind of championship record with that blemish from the Schmeling fight

494
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,160
already behind him. Now, if he doesn't have that moment with Schmeling, right? Maybe it's a

495
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,520
different story. The fact that he had that moment, that more than a moment of adversity, he had that

496
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,520
huge setback to his career. It was a year before he would fight again, wasn't it? Before he would

497
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,520
get the Braddock fight. And it was no sure thing that Braddock would fight him. I mean, remember,

498
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:32,840
at this point, it's been more than 20. It's been 22 years since an African American has been allowed

499
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:40,280
to fight for the heavyweight championship. And there was no guarantee that in 1937, that the

500
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,800
boxing establishments would permit it or the public would demand it. It looked like it was heading that

501
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,080
way until he lost to Schmeling. And then it was like, well, we don't have to give this guy a shot.

502
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,760
Anyone who has an excuse. Yeah, exactly.

503
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,240
Right. But Braddock gives him a shot. And it's part of a business deal where he gets a percentage of

504
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,640
Lewis's earnings for 10 years on a great business deal. You wonder, you know, ethically about the

505
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,880
deal. But anyway, I don't remember exactly the point I was making. But Lewis is different. Dempsey,

506
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,400
I think, is similar. Dempsey, you know, he was a destroyer. And there was this cloak of menace.

507
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Did your dad ever meet Dempsey? Because Dempsey didn't, I mean, he lived around for a long time.

508
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,440
He lived until 1983. He had a restaurant here.

509
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,480
He lived for a very long time, Jack Dempsey. And apparently, I mean, I'm not sure about the very

510
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,480
last years, but up until his mid 70s. I mean, I know that he was all there. And it's remarkable.

511
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,880
This isn't a guy who just had all of those knockdown drag out professional fights. I mean,

512
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,280
he fought hundreds of fights as basically a semi pro in mining camps in Colorado and

513
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,680
the toughest possible atmosphere you can imagine. I mean, a lot of it was barefisted and no holds

514
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,640
barred. And I mean, I can't imagine the kinds of now he was great. So I don't know how much punishment

515
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,640
he was taking. But when you're a young guy coming up there, you're getting hit. Oh, but to look at

516
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,320
the Dempsey fights are some of the most amazing things you can remember, though, when he becomes

517
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,520
champion, right. I mean, he goes three years from 1923 to 1926 without defending his title.

518
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:14,440
He is such a big celebrity. He's making so much money just off the championship and its significance

519
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,600
that he doesn't have to get into the ring. Finally, you know, he gets in the ring in 1926,

520
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,480
and he loses to Gene Tunney in Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia. And then they got the

521
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,400
rematch a year later, which is still arguably the biggest sports event in the history of the world.

522
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,720
Dempsey, Tunney to its Soldier Field. I'd probably make a case it's the biggest sports event in its

523
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,040
moment of all time. And he loses again. This one's a long count and all that. But it's funny, the

524
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:47,480
two biggest sports events of all time in my book are Ali Frazier one, March 8 1971, and Dempsey

525
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,120
Tunney to 1927 and Soldier Field. And the guys that we always talk about are the guys who lost

526
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,840
those fights, Ali and Dempsey, not the guys who won them, Tunney and Frazier. There's a beautiful

527
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:03,240
picture I once saw of Ali that morning walking in Central Park in the snow. And it's sort of

528
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,680
amazing. I mean, that's part of, I think what makes New York such an interesting place is the history.

529
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,600
And I think the whole Atlantic City in the eighties and Las Vegas, it's sort of taken away a little

530
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,760
bit from how remarkable it is to fight in Madison Square Garden and what that would have meant,

531
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,720
like how anticipated that fight was. And of course, when Tyson fought Spinks in 88 in Atlantic City,

532
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,000
most people who knew enough about the sport said, look, this is the most anticipated fight in the

533
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,320
heavyweight division since 1971. I mean, this is a really big deal. And of course, at the time,

534
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:37,480
that was only 16 years earlier, which seems kind of amazing to me, given what an eternity 16 years

535
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,720
is when you are 16 years old. When you're young, yeah. It's like, oh my God, that was the dark ages.

536
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:48,760
Yeah, whatever it was. So one question on the 42 to one, 30 for 30, did you guys even try to

537
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,400
interview Tyson? Yeah, so it's interesting because some people felt dissatisfied that we didn't have

538
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,920
today's stuff from Mike, we made a decision, I went to talk to Mike, Mike declined to take part

539
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,280
in the process. I had interviewed him in 2017, though, and asked him a lot of questions about

540
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,080
the fight. And we hadn't used that, I think anywhere. At one point, we had a cut of film

541
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,920
where we had a lot of it. And we had a few bites from it. And we made an artistic decision,

542
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:24,040
essentially at that point, that we wanted to see Mike only in context from the time of the fight,

543
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:31,640
who he was then, because seeing him now with the tattoo, and the way that he's changed, you know,

544
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:40,120
he's, he can be very quiet and low energy. It's such a stark contrast to what we're showing you

545
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,920
of him then, that it's almost jarring. And everybody knows the Mike Tyson story. I've done

546
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,960
no wisdom or Mike Tyson stories than me, literally, you know, on TV anyway, interviewed

547
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,960
more on TV than I have, I would think long form stories about him all that. I just felt this is

548
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,520
Buster's story. People know the Mike story people hear from Mike all the time, we still hear from

549
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,920
Mike all the time. The more you put Mike in it from today, I see your point you detract, you

550
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,480
detract a bit. Yeah. And what did Mike talk about in 2017 when you interviewed him about that fight

551
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,400
specifically? Because I've never really heard him talk much about that fight. There's so much about

552
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,560
him in Holyfield, and the men's that's been made and all those other things. But what is recollection

553
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,400
of that? Probably the best fight we had from that interview is something like where he said, look,

554
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,320
was Buster Douglas a better fighter that morning, that afternoon? Yes. Does that mean that he's a

555
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,520
better fighter than me? No. That's a fair point. He's certainly entitled to make that point. But

556
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,040
in terms of like, what happened? He said, I was living my life too fast. I was doing crazy stuff.

557
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,280
I was this, I was that, you know, it was in people say, well, that's making excuses. It's like, well,

558
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,760
I asked him what happened. I mean, whether it's an excuse or not. I mean, that's the truth,

559
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,800
I think, in his mind, I think he feels if he had approached that fight,

560
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,120
with full commitment, he would have wanted. But of course, he's going to think that and

561
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,640
that does not diminish what Buster Douglas did. Because I mean, if we're gonna, if we're gonna

562
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,480
say, well, it doesn't count, then then you know, nothing counts. Did the Soviet team really

563
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,960
approach the American kids in the Olympics the way they would have approached the Czechs or

564
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,640
something like that? No. Or the Canadian All-Star team or the, you know, NHL All-Star team? No. But

565
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,160
if you're gonna say, well, then it doesn't count, then nothing counts. It's just silly. No, in the

566
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,600
end, everything counts. That was a great line, by the way, with the bookie in Vegas. I love that part,

567
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:36,120
by the way, of him actually talking about the bats. And, you know, he was like, look, people say

568
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,360
that the miracle on ice was the biggest upset in sport. It's not even within a country mile that

569
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,240
that was the biggest upset in sport. Is there ever been Vegas odds bigger than 42 to one overcome?

570
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,080
In a heavyweight championship fight? No. In any sport? Oh, I think so. You know, a lot of people

571
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,840
say, well, Leicester City is a bigger upset because they were 5,000 won or something to

572
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,680
win the Premier League. Oh, yeah, of course. How could I forget that? That's a pretty amazing example.

573
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,560
Yeah, but to me, that's totally different. There wasn't a single game that season. I mean,

574
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,560
I don't know what I'd have to go back and look. Yeah, I bet there wasn't a single game that was

575
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,480
more than four to one or five to one. You know what I mean? And a season long thing.

576
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,640
That's a very good point. Yeah. Yeah. You know, in every year, there's somebody who wins a

577
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,880
conference or who wins a professional league or a championship who was, I think the St. Louis Rams

578
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,280
were 300 to one. That's right. So, I mean, look, even the New England Patriots, the first year they

579
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,080
won the Super Bowl. But all of that stuff is based on teams that because we don't know how those

580
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,240
teams are constituted. Buster Douglas was Buster Douglas. He was the guy who had had six fights

581
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,280
since Tony Tucker. People still thought he was 42 to one. Leicester City, the St. Louis Rams,

582
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,280
whatever you want to say, nobody knew who that team was. That wasn't the team that you had seen

583
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,840
the previous season. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, it's in the single event that's still kind of unusual odds.

584
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,080
Well, it was great. You know, the other thing that was nice to see was, for me at least,

585
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,960
because I hadn't seen much of Buster Douglas in many years, because I remember in 95 when he was

586
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,040
almost dead. I mean, five years after that fight, he's in a diabetic coma, 380 pounds. Bigger than

587
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,160
that. Yeah, really. I mean, yeah, it was kind of nice to see him. I like Buster very much. I've

588
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,920
spent a lot of time with Buster over the years. You know, I'm always cautious about saying this,

589
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,080
he's this or he's that when by the standards of my profession, I've spent a lot of time with him,

590
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,880
you know, three days here, two days here, a dinner here, a dinner there. Is he somebody that I've

591
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,040
spent like a work colleague where you spend years around them? I don't know, but I like Buster.

592
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,080
I think he's a good guy. He's a good person. He has not been a self promoter, which I think

593
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:37,400
has hurt him financially over the years. I think his feelings have been hurt because people for

594
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,880
so long have tried to diminish this victory. And there's so many avid Mike Tyson fans

595
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,720
who always want to make excuses for him, who always want to discredit Buster, for whatever

596
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,640
reason it is, I felt like he had not been fully appreciated for the magnitude of this.

597
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,920
What do you think went wrong after Tyson? Why do you think he didn't show up in shape for Holyfield?

598
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,920
Because on paper, he should have given Holyfield a hell of a fight. I think Douglas was a better

599
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,240
fighter than Riddick Bowe. I mean, you could certainly make that case. I mean, Riddick had

600
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,440
some great moments, most of them against Evander Holyfield, but he was Buster was a very skilled

601
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,600
boxer and he was a very good athlete and he was schooled in the sport. And when he was fully

602
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,520
dedicated and committed, which we saw only on a few occasions, he was very tough to beat.

603
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,880
And I don't think anybody I don't give his Jag Dempsey or Gene Tunney or John L. Sullivan himself

604
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:39,720
would have beaten him in Tokyo that day. I really don't think so. But after he defeats Tyson,

605
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,320
everything is just so chaotic. It's the typical story we hear, you know, too much, too fast,

606
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,080
too many people pulling at him. He's in court with Don King. He's in court over the long count

607
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:57,880
in the eighth round. All of this, as we would say, mishegas is, you know, driving him crazy. He's

608
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,240
getting rid of the people in his camp who had made it possible for him to achieve these great heights.

609
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:10,200
He's got a new team in there and he signs at the time for $24 million to fight Holyfield,

610
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,520
the largest person in the history of sports. Nobody had ever gotten a check like that in the history

611
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,120
of sports, which is like $48 million now. And even after the taxes and paying out Don King and

612
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,040
paying off his team, he still got like $9 million in cash, like $18 million today, something like

613
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:32,760
that. And I think his motivation was gone. And I think the reality of his mother's death sunk in

614
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,480
when she died, he had the fight to focus on. And now he's got this complicated, weird relationship

615
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,240
at times with his father, who's now like going to Don King's party when I think Buster is still

616
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,520
suing Don King. I mean, there's all kinds of crazy stuff going on. He doesn't, I think Buster would

617
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,360
be the first to admit he doesn't show up for that fight. Physically, mentally, motivationally,

618
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,840
didn't care. There's something about boxing that, I guess this is part of what attracted me to it

619
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:08,760
as a participant and then eventually always just as a fan. And maybe I have a slightly different

620
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,360
insight into it because I've done it, but the ring is a really lonely place. It's hard to put

621
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,960
in words what the fear is like when you get in the ring. And again, maybe it's just that that was

622
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,480
just who I was. And maybe there are some people who get in the ring and they're not afraid. But

623
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,360
even Tyson, I remember once said, anybody who gets in a boxing ring and who is not scared,

624
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,400
senseless is lying or crazy. Yeah. My thought was that-

625
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,840
Now I don't think he was scared by the time he got in the ring against Buster.

626
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,520
I don't think Mike was. But you have to have a relationship with fear.

627
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,720
Even if you feel like you're going to win, I think anytime I stepped into a ring, I felt like

628
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:49,480
I was going to win. There are no words to describe that anxiety. There's nothing I've ever experienced

629
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:56,440
since. No professional thing I've ever done that has put that much adrenaline into my body

630
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,120
that borders on the point of being like you're on the verge of it being unproductive.

631
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,440
And the audience can sense that. For me, I've seen a lot of great things in person.

632
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:11,080
By the time they fight in 2002, Lennox and Mike are both over the hill. They're 36 years old,

633
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,960
37 years old, something like that. And yet people have called it the last great fight,

634
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,920
the last big fight. I was covering that fight. I wasn't far from-

635
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,080
Did you see that beating being that bad?

636
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,320
That's what I thought. I really did think so. And I was working with a lot of people who thought

637
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,880
I was crazy, who thought that Mike was going to win. I think Mike was the favorite in a lot of

638
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,800
people's lives. Oh my God. I thought he was going to lose, no question. But I didn't expect

639
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,000
to see him beat up that badly. I'd seen Mike fight a lot over the previous seven years. I'd

640
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,320
seen Lennox fight more. And yeah, I didn't see how he would beat Lennox. Lennox Lewis,

641
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,440
top 10 heavyweights of all time? Off the top of my head, without going back and looking at

642
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:59,160
those two losses to McCall and Rockman, which they count. Yeah, I guess he's probably somewhere

643
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,400
right around there, right around the 10, 11, 12, something like that.

644
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:10,200
So asked another way, from Muhammad Ali until today, who are the three best? Larry Holmes,

645
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,520
let's give you Larry Holmes, right? He's got to be in there.

646
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,880
Okay. Yeah, Larry Holmes has got to be in there. Lennox has got to be in there.

647
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,800
Put Klitschko in there?

648
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,800
I think, yeah, the question is which one or both. I mean, two pretty impressive guys

649
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:33,400
who did impressive things. After Lennox fights, Vitaly in 2003, and Vitaly performs well,

650
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,440
but he doesn't win the fight and he gets a cut and you know, all that. After that, I kind of

651
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,120
stopped paying as much attention to the heavyweights and they, you know, they took the belts

652
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,000
off to Germany and we never really saw much of those fights. And there were a lot of guys that

653
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,480
were fighting who were kind of unknown entities. So I'm a little reluctant to talk too much about

654
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,080
the careers of either Klitschko brother. I don't know quite how to measure them, but before that.

655
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:04,040
But there was a sea change, right? I mean, I think there was an introduction of athleticism

656
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,720
to the heavyweight division that I don't think you saw before. And I think that the prototype

657
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,040
of the Lewis, the Riddick Bow, the Razor Roddocks, the Klitschkos, I mean, there's just a different

658
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,640
level of athleticism size and they are so big. So they are so freaking big.

659
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:27,240
Which is why it was so amazing to me to see a guy like Deontay Wilder, who is still undefeated

660
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:33,080
at this point after the Fury fight. And you know, maybe he's the guy who fights Joshua. Maybe it's

661
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:40,360
Fury, who knows whatever it is. There's a guy who's 212 fighting 212 pounds, who's arguably

662
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,800
the best heavyweight in the world, arguably, because we saw these guys getting 240, 250,

663
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,360
and they're gigantic. They're mountains. They're primo carnera size, these guys.

664
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,760
But with skill, right? I mean, carnera was just a clown.

665
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:00,760
Just size. So you don't think you're ever gonna go backwards from that? They were very tough guys,

666
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,480
Klitschko brothers. I could sit here and talk about boxing forever because it's not often I get to

667
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,480
talk to somebody who sort of thinks about it the way I do. But there are a few other things I want

668
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,600
to talk about. And sort of one of them is your most famous interview, right? With Bobby Knight.

669
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,800
So you don't have to say anything good or bad about him, but having never met him,

670
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,520
he just strikes me as just a deplorable human being. I don't know what it is about him. Maybe

671
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,760
truthfully, maybe there's a part of myself I see, like, you know, I have a really bad temper. And

672
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,640
I look at him and I think, God, I hope I've never done one one hundredth of what that guy has done.

673
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:39,640
I hope I've never hurt anybody the way he's hurt somebody. Did you see the 30 for 30? I did. And

674
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:45,080
it only solidified in my mind how much I despise him. Yeah, my friend Robert Abbott. Oh, it's one

675
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,960
of the saddest ones I've ever seen. It is so goddamn sad to me how many people's lives have

676
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,240
been destroyed by him. Here's the thing. I knew Bob Knight. I mean, again, you know, I say,

677
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,280
know somebody, you know how well I, my father was a friend of Bob Knight's. I had spent time with

678
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:07,720
Bob Knight before that interview. I was one of those people who appreciated his talents. And he

679
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:15,800
had this quote unquote genius, quote unquote genius and his sense of history, his sense of loyalty.

680
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:21,320
Look, there are good qualities there. There are other people who can, you know, talk, you can

681
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:28,040
watch the film, talk about the dark side of Bob Knight. The interview was a challenge.

682
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:34,280
How many days after he was fired was the interview? I want to say it was 72 hours later. It might have

683
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,760
been 48. It was, I can't remember exactly. Why did he give you that interview? Well,

684
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:45,240
I think he gave me that interview because he thought he could steamroll me and he'd known me.

685
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:52,760
And so what year was this 2000 2000. So your dad was still alive. My dad was still alive. What did

686
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,920
your dad tell you going into that interview? You know, I spoke to a lot of people the night before

687
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,000
the interview and the day of the interview because it's one of those, those situations. And I was

688
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,400
young. I just turned 31. And this is the biggest thing that's going on, not just in sports, but in

689
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:17,000
America period, at this moment in time, it really was. And I knew I had to get it right. I knew the

690
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,080
stakes were high for me. And so I spoke to a lot of people and I'm trying to remember what my dad

691
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:30,120
told me. I really don't remember what his advice was about the questions or this or that. I spoke

692
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:36,680
to a lot of people who told me, you know, it was important, of course, to ask him the tough questions

693
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,000
and not back down. And I think that's what I did. And that's, that's what people said at the time.

694
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,200
They said, you know, chaps stood up tonight. He didn't let the bully bully him. I asked the

695
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,960
right questions. I got to the important points. And I think perhaps most important, because there

696
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:58,920
was a moment of peak when I think he revealed himself in a way that he wouldn't often in live

697
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,640
television interview, that that really kind of said who he was more than anything else.

698
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,040
And so people still remember that interview. It was kind of what do you think is the most

699
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:13,480
memorable exchange of that interview? Well, that's indisputable because people remember it very well.

700
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,480
We're having a discussion. We're having a talk about the zero tolerance policy, which is ultimately

701
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:24,040
what led to his termination, ultimately what led to his termination. And he's explained telling me

702
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,960
how he doesn't know what zero tolerance meant and nobody ever defined it for him. And he was put in

703
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:37,080
a lose lose situation, whatever the exact words were. And he says in the real victim here is Pat,

704
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,680
his son who was one of the assistant coaches, the real victim here is Pat because Pat is going to

705
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:47,080
lose his job. And I feel it's my obligation at this point to point out and say, Bob, but

706
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:55,560
Pat wouldn't be losing his job if you had behaved yourself, if you had done what you were told to do.

707
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:04,440
And that's when he got angry, very angry. And he looked at me and he said, he glared at me. He said,

708
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,280
be careful here. You've got a long way to go until you're as good as your dad. And I said,

709
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,240
I appreciate that and moved on. But that's the exchange that everybody remembers. And my friend,

710
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,120
Willie Weinbaum, producer, I work with a lot. He's one of the guys I talked to before the interview,

711
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,560
great journalist, great interviewer. And he said, just remember, he's probably going to invoke your

712
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:33,000
dad at some point or compare you unfavorably, use that as a weapon in his arsenal. And I don't

713
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,720
really remember if it registered or didn't register, but I remember Willie did say that. And of course,

714
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,800
that's what people remember. But at the time, for me, it was like a kind of a career defining moment

715
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:51,080
all of a sudden, it was like, welcome to the big leagues. So what is it like then with a father

716
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:57,960
who's a legend? And it's not like you decided to become a dentist or an anesthesiologist. You

717
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,760
decided to do what your dad did. And that means subject yourself to constantly being compared to

718
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,560
him and living in his shadow. What did your mom say about that? You know, maybe I'm just getting

719
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:15,240
old. I don't remember. I don't remember us ever having really a conversation about it. Not only

720
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:21,160
not with my mother, but not really with my father. I mean, I grew up, especially when I was very young

721
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:26,840
before my parents divorced, like at his side, I mean, going to sports events with him going to the

722
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,840
I remember, on the weekends, you know, what I did was I went to the office with my father in the

723
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,880
morning while he prepared sports stories and sports reports on NBC back then. And I hung around the

724
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,200
office and I read sports books. It was almost like my entire life had been an apprenticeship

725
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:46,280
in the business. So and you weren't worried about the shadow. Maybe I should have been.

726
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,480
I ever gave it a second thought. I know that sounds ridiculous. No, no, it doesn't. Actually,

727
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,640
it's it's it's remarkable. I mean, I don't do anything that my dad does. My dad, you know,

728
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:00,600
he runs quarries. So I couldn't be further from what my dad does. But yet, in many ways,

729
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:08,360
I do compare myself to his work ethic. Right. I mean, like even a few weeks ago, I was sort of

730
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:13,880
complaining to my therapist. I was like, God, you know, I don't think I can work as hard as my dad.

731
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,840
And it's deep down. It makes me feel a little bit ashamed that, you know, my father's never been in

732
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:25,160
a bad mood. He's like the most upbeat, positive, optimistic immigrant that ever lived. Tomorrow is

733
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,720
always going to be a better day. And he can. Where did he come from? From Egypt. And he can will his

734
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,880
way into the world. Like what he wants to happen will happen. And, you know, as a kid, I never once

735
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,840
saw my dad even in bed. You know, he was coming home after I was asleep and he'd be up and gone

736
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,120
in the morning. Like he never slept in on a Saturday or anything like that. So you just had

737
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,240
this view of like, this is like a Superman. And of course, me, you know, I'm different. I can be

738
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,440
lazy at times and I can get into, you know, a fun. But you're still a very productive person. You're

739
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:00,520
just measuring yourself against an impossible standard. Right. But don't we all do that? I mean,

740
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,560
Oh, I do it. Compare ourselves to. That's what I'm saying is at least for me, I can keep the distance

741
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,560
between what we've done professionally. So, so I really can only compare myself to my father in

742
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:15,000
terms of work ethic, sacrifice, and just general disposition. But now you have all of those things

743
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,240
to compare yourself to. Plus, you know, being on the son of one of the most legendary sportscasters

744
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:24,120
of all time. Well, I think I'm just going to go lie down on the couch. Tell me, tell me how you're

745
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:29,640
really sure. You're right. I got to say that it really is a testament, I guess, to my naivete or

746
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:36,520
just stupidity that I got into this business without really thinking about that. And I just

747
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:44,520
knew that I wanted to be in the media. I wanted to work in TV. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to

748
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,720
work. I wasn't sure if I wanted initially to be in sports or news. I started out working in news at

749
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,960
a local TV station here in New York and transitioned into sports. But I'd been in sports. So

750
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,760
that was kind of the tension wasn't was I got to be in the media, it was like, what exactly am I

751
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:07,160
going to do? For me, that was the question. And of course, when I made the decision to do sports,

752
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,040
and not to do news, not to do something else, then of course, you know, I was walking right into my

753
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:19,640
father's field. And I grew up around a guy who I really think was the best at what he did. He was

754
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,840
a great writer. He was a great journalist. He was he was a great TV storyteller. And I figured,

755
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,920
well, if he could do it, I could do it. That's amazing. You know, I do remember reading an

756
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,200
interview very recent, actually, maybe it was maybe maybe was a year ago, but someone once asked

757
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,360
you about, you know, lessons you learned from your father. And I would I remember you saying, I'm

758
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:44,520
going to have to paraphrase it, the gist of it was what it means to be fair as a reporter, what

759
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:51,400
fair journalism means, which means you do have to ask hard questions. And you do have to probe in

760
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,320
areas that are uncomfortable. But you've got to have a bit of empathy, you have to be able to put

761
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:01,720
yourself in the shoes of the person you're speaking with. And I don't know, I feel like that doesn't

762
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,720
exist all that much in journalism anymore, does it? I mean, maybe it doesn't. I'm just not aware

763
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,880
of it. And we see so many exceptions. But anyway, the way you described it, I thought was very

764
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,760
beautiful. And you really attributed it all to your father. Yeah. And I think he did operate in

765
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:23,800
that manner. It wasn't just idle talk. It was what informed his, his body of work. And I worked

766
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:30,360
in a business where there are people who are all about access. And they never asked the tough

767
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,720
questions. And then I work, you know, with people to who work with or there are people in the

768
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,080
business, I don't really, I can't think of any colleagues who are like this, but you see it

769
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,000
happen. It's like, they're tough for the sake of being tough. Yeah, yeah, exactly. They're

770
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,560
antagonistic just to be antagonistic. And I think I've built a reputation 30 years of the business

771
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:53,080
of being the guy who does ask the tough questions and doesn't shy away and is willing to sacrifice

772
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:59,880
relationships for the truth. And that's important. But fairness is the underpinning of everything,

773
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,560
right? You know, it's not just about being fair to the subject is about being fair to the audience.

774
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:12,520
It's about being fair to the story and fair to the truth. And it seems like it's a pretty simple

775
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:19,640
principle, really, to, I think it's not like I'm a Scotty Reston here. Or, you know, I mean, you know,

776
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:24,680
I work in the world of sports or the toy department, but it's a pretty simple principle. But I can't

777
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,640
say that it's always applied. We were talking about this a while ago, but it's sort of hard to

778
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:36,680
believe your father died in 2001 because it feels a lot more recent to me. And maybe that's just a

779
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:42,760
sign that we're all getting a little older. Time starts to travel faster because 2001 on paper is

780
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:49,000
a long time ago. But it's interesting because I believe his last broadcast was the Sunday after

781
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,800
9 11. And he actually talked about the insignificance of sport in the context of what had happened,

782
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:02,840
what, five days earlier. He would go on to have an elective hip operation a couple weeks later.

783
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:09,320
And one complication slash medical error after another. And ultimately he died. You're young,

784
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:15,720
you're 30 at the time. 32. 32. How hard was that? Oh, it was dead on two levels. Right. I mean,

785
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,800
I'm asking it sounds like an idiotic question, right? It's not, it's not hard to lose. But

786
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,200
it's one thing to lose somebody when they're old enough that you just expect to lose them. It's

787
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,480
another thing when someone goes into the hospital to have a procedure done and mistakes get made

788
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:35,080
and they don't come out of the hospital. It was devastating. I was extremely close with my father

789
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,360
and we had been, you know, for a long time at that point, there had been a period, you know,

790
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:45,000
in my teens and my parents divorced where the relationship had frayed. I mean, it felt like a

791
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,400
million years at the point when it was happening, but it's probably 18 months or something like that.

792
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,520
And then, you know, I went off to college and then I went into the business and we were doing

793
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,360
radio shows. I mean, we probably spoke once or twice a day and saw each other frequently.

794
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,440
They lived in the same place and connected by the business work for the same company. I mean,

795
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,640
you know, so there's the personal anguish seeing your father go through something like this and

796
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,080
he's in a coma most of the time, you know, you can't communicate with him. There's nothing when

797
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:19,080
he goes under, they put him in, you know, an induced coma to let him heal. You never get a

798
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:28,040
chance to say goodbye. And 13 weeks in ICU, you know what that takes out of family and the guilt,

799
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:34,200
like, are you there every day? Are you not there? I mean, all of that stuff. And then for it to also

800
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,160
be playing out, you know, as a public story as well, people would happen to ditch out what's going on,

801
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,440
how sick is he? Is he going to recover? You know, that doesn't make it any easier. And this is all

802
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,680
against the backdrop of this national calamity, which had taken place a few miles south of the

803
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:56,520
hospital in which he was in the intensive care unit. So there is that surreal grief stricken

804
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,520
moment as well in the history of the city in that country. So it all feels like a bad dream,

805
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:09,160
everything that was going on in the fall of 2001 for me, you know, and then, you know, there were

806
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,120
moments also, it's all it's made even more painful by the moments where you think they're telling you,

807
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:20,440
oh, he's made a turn for the better he's gonna be I mean, literally, I think, within two or three

808
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:26,840
days before he died, it seemed like he had suddenly recovered. And they were making plans

809
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,800
to take him out of the coma and slowly wake him up again. And you know, but you got to remember,

810
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,480
you know, I remember having a talk with one of the doctors like, you got to understand your father's

811
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,320
going to be he's recovering, but he's not going to be the same guy, he's gonna have to go to

812
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,160
rehab facility for a while, you know, strength back and this and that, but he's gonna be back,

813
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,400
and then all of a sudden, it was like, and I don't even you know, honestly, I don't remember what

814
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:53,080
happened in those two or three days after that. I mean, I remember what happened. I remember being

815
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:59,480
there when he died, but I don't remember how it went from so hopeful and optimistic to over very

816
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:05,240
quickly. So it was very hard on several levels. Was there anything about that collective experience,

817
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:11,160
meaning the loss of your father, which is, I mean, literally superimposed on 911 that made you

818
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,360
revisit your connection to sports? Did you ever go through the phase of, oh my god, I'm devoting my

819
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:25,400
life to a game versus no, wait a minute, sports is an amazing substrate for metaphor for life. Like,

820
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,560
how did you go through that process? I mean, I remember very vividly having a discussion.

821
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,840
I don't know if he remembers, but having a discussion with Keith Olbermann during the

822
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:44,680
baseball playoffs that year. And we were so this is a few weeks after 911 with my father in a

823
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,840
coma in the hospital. And we weren't talking about that we were talking about 911 and Keith,

824
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:54,440
with that time was still working in sports, I think at Fox Sports at that time. He's a very

825
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,880
smart guy, friend of mine, smart guy. He was telling me like, we can't be in sports anymore.

826
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,520
Everything is over. Everything we've known has changed everything. Nothing will ever be the same.

827
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,680
The country's going to be under constant attack. I mean, the result, you know, he's saying, you know,

828
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:13,960
get out of sports now, because nobody's going to care about sports anymore. And I remember not

829
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,560
being able really even in that moment process where you're saying but it certainly made sense.

830
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:23,800
It's it's how we felt at the time, as a country, like everything was discombobulated. We didn't

831
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,000
know where we stood anymore, in some regards. But for me personally, I remember having that

832
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,120
discussion. But I don't remember that being a moment where I say and myself,

833
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,280
I want to get out of sports, I want to do something different. I had had those discussions

834
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,880
a few years before that people at ABC News about maybe transition. I remember I wanted to go.

835
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,160
I had a meeting up there, one point where I said, you know, I don't want to work in sports anymore.

836
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:53,720
I want to transition. I want to go cover the war on the Balkans or something like that. And like,

837
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:58,840
no, we don't want you to get killed over there. Something like that. And I wasn't qualified. But

838
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:05,160
no, I don't remember reassessing my relationship with sports in that moment, except I did have an

839
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,960
immediate reaction to the whole idea that sports was going to make everything better. And if the

840
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,000
Yankees won the World Series, which they went ended up losing that it was this, that it would be this

841
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,160
incredible moment of catharsis or something like that. I thought it would be a few minutes of

842
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,880
catharsis. What do you think today many years later, right? We're already we're back in the

843
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,640
swing of things. What do you think is the most important thing that following sports as a

844
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:40,040
spectator, as a fan does for us? Because in many ways, what people like you do is you provide a

845
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:46,200
narrative that gives us who don't know as much a nuanced understanding. Again, just even to me,

846
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,840
like you probably won't find a bigger ESPN 30 for 30 fan than me. Like there might be two I haven't

847
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:57,640
seen. But I love that type of deep exploration. The story behind the story behind the story.

848
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,600
What do you think that does for people outside of the obvious, which is teaches you about a

849
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:08,200
sporting event? Well, I think that there's a greater appreciation now for sports is something

850
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:15,160
more than the toys or the toy department when we cover it that, you know, it's not just tribal.

851
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:21,480
It brings us all together. Right. I mean, I travel all over the country, I travel internationally a

852
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,880
lot, you can have discussions with sports with people anywhere. And it's, you know, in a lot of

853
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,920
ways, it's gotten harder to have discussions about other things, as we know, and, and sports can be

854
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:37,480
divisive as well. So there is the sense that it is this lingua franca, right? Some guy I don't know,

855
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,320
I'm sitting next to on a plane, we could have a four hour discussion. Right. Because you can't,

856
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,080
you don't want to talk about religion or politics. And yeah, there are too many things you

857
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,320
can't talk about anymore. There's that and we just like talking about sports too. We like sports.

858
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:54,360
And sometimes we overlook like the physicality of it, how much watching just the remarkable

859
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,520
way that athletes use their bodies and their minds, we sometimes lose appreciation for that.

860
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:07,560
There's so many things about sports that can be edifying. And also for me, I've used sports as

861
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,040
a platform to tell stories about other things going on in the world that transcend sports about

862
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:20,840
societal issues about cultural issues about crises of sexual abuse, homophobia, whatever they

863
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:26,200
are. I mean, a lot of the stories that I've done over the years, sports is a starting point, it's a

864
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:31,960
hook. And then it's about something bigger. And sports does that in a way, right, that other things

865
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:37,720
don't because so much of us are interested in sports, you know, there's a reason why

866
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:46,920
Jackie Robinson breaking the color line in 1947 is one of the most important moments in the annals

867
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:52,520
of the civil rights struggle. Why that's a watershed moment. There's a reason why Muhammad Ali

868
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:58,280
refusing induction is a watershed moment, whether you agree or disagree with him. Sports touches us

869
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,120
in a different way and it touches society in a different way. In Title IX, which wasn't just

870
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:08,360
about sports, we see mostly through the prism of sports when we talk about equality for women. And

871
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:14,840
the way in my father's lifetime that the emergence of the African American athlete was, I think,

872
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:21,400
the big story. You know, in a lot of ways, the last 40 years, the emergence of the female athlete,

873
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,560
the empowerment of the female athlete has been the big story. And sports is usually, I'm not going to

874
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,280
say always, but seems usually to be in the vanguard, you know, when society is going, you see

875
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:39,560
it first happening in sports. Now, in some ways, sports is old fashioned and resistant to change.

876
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,040
And there are plenty of examples of that as well. I mean, we could talk about golf clubs and that

877
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:50,760
kind of stuff. But sports has sparked change, and it's drawn our attention to issues. And I did a

878
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,960
story about Al Campanis on the 30th, I guess it was the 25th anniversary of the time of, you know,

879
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,680
his infamous Nightline interview where he said blacks lack the necessities to be coaches and

880
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:06,360
general managers. And I interviewed Ted Koppel and Ted Koppel told me I mean, Ted Koppel, the greatest

881
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:17,720
television newsman, I would argue of the last 50 years, the guy, you know, he said, the one

882
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,840
episode of Nightline, the one edition of Nightline, he gets asked about the most is the Al Campanis

883
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:31,560
episode, where he was so great in that moment. And he was so fair, but persistent and tough. And,

884
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:37,000
you know, but my point is that that moment, it sparked a discussion about a lot more than

885
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,240
coaches in the NFL or whatever. Yeah. So, Jeremy, you've reported on a ton of stories in sports.

886
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:48,520
And again, I'm a fan of many of them. But has there ever been one that you've done where in

887
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,720
retrospect you look back and you feel you made a mistake? Yeah, you know, I'm not sure if I would

888
01:17:53,720 --> 01:18:00,680
characterize it as a mistake. And it's complicated. But I was the guy covering the home run chase in

889
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:09,480
1998 for ESPN with Mark McGuire. Wow. You know, so I was there, I saw, I think 20 of the 70 home runs

890
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:15,880
he hit in person. And I dipped in a couple times early in the season to do stuff when he was on

891
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,240
a great pace, I think, but I really picked it up in September, I think, when he had that crazy

892
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,040
September. So does that mean you interacted with Maris's family as well? I never interacted with

893
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:31,320
Roger Maris's family. No, but I was there when he broke the record when he hit 62. I mean, I was

894
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:39,640
there, I think, for every home run from 52 to 70. Wow. And there had been the story that summer

895
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:45,560
about the Andro and the locker, which now seems like, I don't know, if it was a red herring that

896
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:51,240
he was planting or, you know, the right way to put whatever it was. But looking back now, of course,

897
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:56,680
20 years later, or even five years afterwards, I wish I had approached that story with more

898
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:01,000
skepticism. Do you think you were just so caught up in the moment? Like you couldn't believe this

899
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,640
was happening? You know, it was funny, because of course, it wasn't as if it wasn't out there in the

900
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,040
ether. You know, people were talking about steroids, people had talked about them with him

901
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:16,360
going back, you know, years before. But the subject was kind of taboo. The Andro story

902
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
seemed to put everything to rest like, oh, he's not doing steroids that are

903
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,960
Yeah, it's Anderson Dion, which at the time was a supplement that was basically legal. Right. And

904
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,680
question became, well, maybe it is legal, but he shouldn't be using it. And the guy was prying it.

905
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,840
And I certainly didn't say vouch for him and say he's clean or anything like that.

906
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:41,960
But in the absence of evidence that he was cheating, we just kind of bought the story.

907
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:50,360
And I wish I'd been more skeptical because I don't know what I could have expressed at the time. And

908
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,840
I'm not letting myself off the hook. It was the entire national media. There was nobody expressing

909
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,920
any skepticism. Everybody was celebrating this. Everybody was so excited about the home run chase

910
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,760
and Sammy and Mark and all that. I was around Sammy too. But not the way that I was around Mark,

911
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:10,680
I was covering Mark every day for like a month plus. I wish I'd been more skeptical. Now,

912
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:17,400
because everything I saw was fake, was all fake. It doesn't mean anything anymore. You know, I saved

913
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:23,400
the newspaper. When Mark hit 62. I'm like, wow, I saw something really historic in the whole country

914
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,760
was I mean, you would have thought that you know, he'd landed on the moon. So I wish I had approached

915
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,280
that with more skepticism later when I covered cycling and I covered the Tour de France and I

916
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:41,320
covered Lance Armstrong's last two Tour de France victories. And then I covered his comeback as well.

917
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:47,720
I did ask the questions as I recall, you know, I asked them, Lance, you know, how does anybody

918
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:55,080
do this without being on EPO or where I mean, I asked the questions. But again, after he denies it,

919
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,720
there was great reporting. There was some great reporting being done by David Walsh at the London

920
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:05,880
Times. He got sued. The London Times lost a million pounds, I believe. I'm sure they've got back more in

921
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,040
space. Right. Yeah, going after him. So I asked the questions, but it was kind of like everybody

922
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:15,720
else asking the questions, but not digging deep enough to get to the truth, which was that Lance

923
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:20,360
was cheating too. In some ways, it's a bit sad. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Roger

924
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:26,120
Maris because he's sort of a footnote to this story. But in some ways you could make the case,

925
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:31,720
he's still the home run King. And in that sense, that to me is where, and I'm probably biased,

926
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,000
but I find the cycling quote unquote scandal to be less upsetting because it really was a uniform

927
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,320
playing field. It was everybody doing it. I mean, you couldn't be a GC contender between 91 and

928
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:48,280
2010 without being on- The protocols were too good, were too effect. Yeah. Whereas we do tend to forget

929
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,600
what Mickey Mantle did and what, I mean, Mickey Mantle, he's in a different league because he's

930
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:57,240
so loved, but Maris sort of gets forgotten in a way. And when you think of that season,

931
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:03,240
when he hit 61 and how hated he was trying to do it and chase down Babe Ruth's record, like,

932
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,720
I don't know, I just have this softest spot in my heart for this guy. Oh, you know, and then that

933
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:14,840
phony stuff with McGuire and Sosa paying tribute to Maris' family at the time, I mean, that now we

934
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:21,880
look at and it's upsetting. This was Roger Maris' legacy, that record, the 61. And it was stolen

935
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,200
from him. And I think that's a fair way to characterize it. Look, a lot of guys were doing

936
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,120
it. Now, the counter argument, which again, I think the counter argument's a reasonable one is,

937
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,560
hey, the pitches were also doing it and the pitches were harder to hit off. And does that

938
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,800
normalize it? Does that equalize it? Well, the evidence, of course, is that it didn't normalize

939
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,880
it enough because the offense is what exploded. And it's not just, it's the magnitude. You're

940
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,880
the doctor, you understand this stuff, just because they're both using it doesn't mean that

941
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,960
it's as beneficial to the pitchers as it is to the hitters. And we saw that.

942
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,080
Well, that's interesting because when you think of it that way, and I can see why in hindsight,

943
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:02,920
you know, and I've actually had this discussion with Lance, which was, I actually believed Lance

944
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:07,240
was clean until, and this might make me sound like a dope.

945
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,200
Alpe d'Huez?

946
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:13,800
Nope. Because this is something you can do the math and justify on a Watts per kilo.

947
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:18,840
You could say, look, given what he did in 93 as a world champion in Oslo,

948
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,360
like the stuff that he would say back then, I was a world champion, you know, before.

949
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,720
But even doing the numbers, like you look at the Watts per kilo then and the Watts per kilo in

950
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:31,080
the Klein, when it became clear to me that he absolutely had to be doing this was when,

951
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,120
when Tyler Hamilton came out. Because Tyler Hamilton was the first guy that came out that

952
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,200
I thought was truly believable. I don't know. I don't know Tyler. I've never met him,

953
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,160
but he just struck me as so credible. And when Tyler basically spilled his beans,

954
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:50,360
and that's when you realized how ubiquitous it was. Because prior to Tyler, like you could make

955
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,520
the case, man, not everybody's doing it. But when Tyler came out and said, Oh, no, no, no,

956
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,480
we're all doing this.

957
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:00,520
Well, also the stuff with the Andraeus, it was frankly, I remember thinking at the time,

958
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,960
well, why would they be lying? I mean, they, the position as I remember it was they were

959
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:13,000
compelled to testify, to tell what happened in that hospital room. They didn't volunteer,

960
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,920
they weren't selling books, they weren't doing anything like that. They were asked under oath,

961
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:22,840
what happened? What was the conversation? Because Lance was getting sued. And they said, you know,

962
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:28,920
he had done steroids. And so it was easier for me to dismiss that because I always thought Betsy had

963
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,320
a little bit of a different agenda. I thought deep down Betsy was more pissed that Frankie had done

964
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,280
these drugs behind her back. I always thought there was something going on there.

965
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,560
Right. I just didn't see why they would lie under oath.

966
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:44,520
I always thought Betsy kind of wanted to be in the limelight more. But to me, Tyler was the

967
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,160
most credible cyclist to come forward.

968
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:52,360
And everybody who was covering it, and I was there for three summers, if you'd ask them,

969
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,240
your life's at stake, what's the right answer here? You know, the lady or the tire, like,

970
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:57,800
yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,000
You would have said, he's doing it.

972
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,320
Yeah.

973
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,520
They're all doing it. He's doing it. But we didn't have the proof.

974
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:02,840
Yeah.

975
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:07,800
I mean, Wada couldn't bust them. The cycling federation couldn't bust them. The French

976
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,040
couldn't bust them. The Spanish couldn't bust them. They had a very sophisticated,

977
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:18,280
I mean, in some ways, very sophisticated, almost clownishly, also brazen in some ways. You know,

978
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:23,000
they were so good at concealing it. And they were so aggressive about going after

979
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,040
anybody who questioned them. But we all thought.

980
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:31,240
And I will say this, though, Jeremy, it is it really chaps my ass that those seven years

981
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:36,280
have no champion. And yet you look in the years before and the years after, and there's a champion.

982
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,040
I mean, to me, that is ridiculous. And I, this will be, there's a lot that's ridiculous.

983
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,520
This will be the single most unpopular thing I'll ever say, I'm sure. I absolutely believe

984
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,760
Lance Armstrong deserves his yellow jerseys back. Because if you're going to take his away,

985
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,920
you better take away Pantanese, you better take away Ulrich, and you better take away

986
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,640
Bjorn Reese and probably Miguel Indran. And you know what I mean?

987
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,720
They did take away some of those, didn't they? Am I wrong?

988
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,360
None.

989
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:58,440
None.

990
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,200
None. It is ridiculous.

991
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:00,760
That doesn't make any sense.

992
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,160
It's a little bit awkward.

993
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,120
You're right. That doesn't make any sense.

994
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,080
It's totally crazy.

995
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:04,520
Well.

996
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,880
And they certainly took away Floyd's.

997
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,880
Yes, but then they gave it to the guy right behind me. I mean, it's so ridiculous.

998
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:15,000
Yeah. So, well, anyway, no, that's, I can, I can see how now with the benefits of hindsight and

999
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:21,000
you feel foolish for having been swept up into it. We all do, right? I mean, we feel like.

1000
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yeah. And at the same time as like, well, you ask the question, you get your kind of

1001
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,960
same response from Lance, you know, why would I do that? Why would I put that in my body?

1002
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:36,760
And everybody was so swept up in the story, the redemption story, the comeback story,

1003
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,960
the survivor story. It was tough.

1004
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,680
I think it's interesting today to look at cycling because to be honest with you,

1005
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,760
I'm too far away from the sport and the numbers and they're still very concealed in what they do.

1006
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,880
But I still think there's something going on. I just don't know what it is.

1007
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,360
Me neither.

1008
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:58,280
What's the most interesting story you think that's out there that isn't being told yet in sports?

1009
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,640
Whew. There's so many stories that I think we don't pay attention to. I mean, there are big

1010
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:07,240
issue stories. Obviously the head trauma stories, the biggest, I think the biggest story the last

1011
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:13,240
20 years in sports. That's a story that's still obviously in the news all the time. That is being

1012
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,200
covered. Are you surprised that hasn't had a bigger impact? I mean, or maybe it hasn't. I just,

1013
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,360
I'm not aware of the metrics, but. I would say it's had a big impact. I mean,

1014
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:26,920
youth participation, tackle football in certain parts of the country, plummeting.

1015
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:33,080
And if that happens, it's a time question until college football starts to decline. And if college

1016
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,280
football declines, then what does the NFL look like in 20 years?

1017
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:41,160
That's the million dollar question, right? Like, does football have an existential problem?

1018
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:50,200
Does it find a way to change the nature of what it's been for so long in a way that will alleviate

1019
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,040
concerns about the long-term effects of head trauma? Does it become more regionalized where

1020
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,440
we see it in certain parts of the country where people say this is part of what we do,

1021
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:08,440
this part of our culture, and we reject the narrative that it's going to destroy the brains

1022
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:13,960
of those who play? We don't know. We don't know. I mean, of course, what we do know is that

1023
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:20,440
everything changes when you're in the moment. It seems like nothing will change. The NFL will

1024
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:25,400
always be number one. Football will always be the most popular sport. You know, that's probably

1025
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,520
how it felt to fans of baseball 60 years ago.

1026
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,680
Or to fans of boxing in the 1930s.

1027
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,560
Or fans of boxing in the 1930s. Or fans of harness racing in the first decade of the 20th century.

1028
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:40,120
But what we do know is everything changes. Is head trauma going to be what changes

1029
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:46,280
the way we consume football? Or is it only going to change the way that we participate in football?

1030
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:53,240
Does the decline in participation necessarily lead to a decline in fan interest and viewership?

1031
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,840
The other thing I have learned is not only does nothing stay number one and everything changes,

1032
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:05,560
but no one can see the future. I mean, nobody is good at seeing the future with anything. Those

1033
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:12,360
who can, many just get lucky and they don't do it a lot. Or they'd be in Vegas. Or now New Jersey.

1034
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:17,640
I'd love to know what you think is the story that's not being told yet. Because I,

1035
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:24,040
I mean, I think about it a little bit from my lens. And one of the things that I find interesting

1036
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:29,720
is why drugs will always exist in some sports and why some sports seem relatively free of drugs.

1037
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,040
Because I think drugs would help any athlete in any sport. I mean, I can't think of a sport in which

1038
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,800
a drug, a performance enhancing drug, won't make a difference. And yet there are some sports that

1039
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,760
are relatively clean. Like swimming. If you look at the United States and Australia, the two most

1040
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,480
dominant countries, and there are certainly countries that have had lots of cheating. But

1041
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:51,480
I do believe, and I don't think history will prove me wrong, but it could. I don't think that

1042
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:55,640
Australia and the United States have a doping program in swimming. And yet they're the two

1043
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:00,920
most dominant countries. But yet if you look at other Olympic sports, I mean, I am convinced the

1044
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,160
track and field is always going to be full of growth hormone because it's undetectable.

1045
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,840
That's the story I was going to say is the biggest story once you brought up drugs is that

1046
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,880
human growth hormone is undetectable. So when we talk about guys who are clean,

1047
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,640
we talk about female athletes who are clean, we really don't know what we're talking about.

1048
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:25,000
Yeah, because HGH is effective. It does work. It makes a huge difference. And they say their

1049
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,800
tests that detected, but they really don't. Right? You can test for its byproducts, but it's not like

1050
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,640
testosterone. If a person takes exogenous testosterone, you can look for pair molecules,

1051
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:39,480
you can look for epi testosterone. And if that's not rising at the levels of testosterone, you know,

1052
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,080
they're taking it exogenously. And you can look at other hormones that get suppressed

1053
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,800
when you take testosterone. So if you're taking testosterone exogenously from outside the body,

1054
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,480
the pituitary hormones that tell the body to make it, luteinizing hormone, follicle-cementing

1055
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:55,880
hormone, they go down. Yeah, there's lots of ways, but no, I think human growth hormone,

1056
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,400
I don't have a lot of experience with it even clinically to know how effective it is, but

1057
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:06,920
I think it's used pretty rampantly. My intuition is that that is certainly in most sports

1058
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:13,000
got to be the drug of choice right now. And I think from my standpoint, the interest is,

1059
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:17,800
do we have any sense of what the long-term harm is, which I don't pretend to know.

1060
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:22,600
Yeah, I don't either, obviously. Well, we've got to get to this thing tonight, don't we?

1061
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:27,320
We do. We do. We have to get there. We have to, we've got about a mile and a quarter to cover.

1062
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:31,640
So, and it's rush hour in New York. We're going to walk there faster than we're going to go.

1063
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,560
Last question, what is your favorite 30 for 30 that you weren't involved in making?

1064
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:43,080
Wow, if I'm not involved. Give me three, without even ranking them if you want. Just give me a few

1065
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,240
of your 30 for 30s that you love. It's an answer I think a lot of people give. I thought the Escabars,

1066
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:52,600
the two Escabars, was great. I thought that was a great show. It was so heartbreaking. Yeah.

1067
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,520
I was at that game at the Rose Bowl. You were? I was at that game at the Rose Bowl. I was 94.

1068
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:04,120
94. I remember that vividly. Do you buy that if Pablo Escobar was still alive, Escobar would

1069
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:08,920
not have been killed? It's been about nine years since that came out. I don't remember

1070
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,400
my feelings. I don't even remember. Was that the conclusion that was drawn basically?

1071
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,160
I don't even remember if that was the conclusion drawn from the 30 for 30 or if it was just my

1072
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:21,960
conclusion post hoc. And maybe it was like rejuvenated when I watched Narcos a few years ago

1073
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:28,280
and I got all reminded of everything in Escobar's life and the weird sense of loyalty that he had.

1074
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:35,640
He was this evil guy with a good streak in him. I don't know. I wondered.

1075
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:41,080
Yeah. I thought that was really powerful and well done. I thought The Night Show was really,

1076
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,280
really well done as well. That's a very recent one. There have been so many. Last year alone,

1077
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:50,520
there was the two Bills thing. Oh, the two Bills was pretty darn good. That's interesting. Yeah.

1078
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:57,000
Those guys. One of the ones that I loved watching even when it came out, because it came out,

1079
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,280
so Bo Jackson when I was a kid, that was my prime of-

1080
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,680
I couldn't say that when I was in that one. That's right.

1081
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,880
I'm disqualified for watching that one. When I go back and watch that, and my wife

1082
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,880
and I were talking about this because we watched it for a third time a year ago maybe, we had that

1083
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,440
moment of, are you freaking kidding me? I almost forgot how athletic that guy was.

1084
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,360
You could make the case he's the greatest athlete ever.

1085
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:26,680
Well, my father said he was. My father voted for him as the greatest athlete of the 20th century

1086
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:32,360
in the sports century polling. I think he had a great case. It's interesting though.

1087
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:39,000
Recently, I was with somebody who had played- I was interviewing Matt Millen,

1088
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,720
who was waiting for a new heart. Just got a heart on Christmas Eve. He's doing well.

1089
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,000
At this point, I'm going to see him again next week. Matt was telling me the teammate in Oakley,

1090
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,520
he said, the funny thing is, and he had teammates who said this, Bo was obviously an incredible

1091
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,680
track athlete, incredible football player, incredible baseball player, but he couldn't

1092
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,680
dribble basketball. Interesting.

1093
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:09,000
This was with Matt, I couldn't catch the football. Because he was a pretty good defensive player in

1094
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,600
the outfield. He was not a good pass catcher. He didn't know the right technique to catch a

1095
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:20,520
football as a running back coming out of the backfield. It was all hands. He didn't know how

1096
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,400
to use his body to catch a ball. I think he said, there were guys, they try to teach me, and I say,

1097
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:30,360
so it's an interesting dichotomy, because he's this incredible athlete with incredible hand-eye

1098
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,760
coordination, incredible strength, incredible speed. Could have won the Olympic decathlon,

1099
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:40,520
honestly, if he dedicated himself to that. But there are also these kind of lines.

1100
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:46,040
Little gaps. When we talk about him, of course, then I also think about, you know what story

1101
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:50,680
hasn't been done yet? Because it's been done, but it hasn't been closed. I'm kind of waiting for

1102
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:56,840
Barry Bonds to just acknowledge the steroid use. I feel like, aren't we past the point where this

1103
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,360
matters? Can't we just have an open and honest discussion about it and close the chapter?

1104
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:04,360
Well, Sammy Sosa would tell you, no, I did something with Sammy this year. He certainly

1105
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:10,600
wasn't prepared to go that far. I think from Barry's perspective, what does he have to gain?

1106
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:16,280
And Barry's always had, how do I put this, a complicated relationship with the media.

1107
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,880
Yeah, I think that's funny and loud.

1108
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:23,080
And I don't think he cares. I don't think he has any interest in creating closure for us.

1109
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:28,040
I'm going to create a lot of enemies by saying this, but I wish that Barry Bonds could just

1110
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,240
acknowledge what he did and get into the Hall of Fame and be done with it. And we could acknowledge

1111
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,400
that that was the era that we were in. A lot of people would find that a very controversial view,

1112
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,960
but.

1113
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,320
Oh, I don't think it's necessarily going to work either because Mark McGuire has admitted it and

1114
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,440
he's not in the Hall of Fame.

1115
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,040
Yeah, no, truthfully.

1116
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,160
Yeah, they're different.

1117
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:47,000
But Barry, you could make a much better case for Barry Bonds and Mark McGuire, right?

1118
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,440
You could. You know, it's an interesting thing though, right? Like I've thought about this a lot,

1119
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:54,680
probably way too much over the years, the Hall of Fame and steroids and all that. And I've heard

1120
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:58,600
the argument many times, Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds are different because they were Hall of Fame

1121
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:03,160
players before they started taking steroids. Although, of course, we don't know when they

1122
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:07,880
started taking steroids. And this is based on the assumption that they did take steroids. And

1123
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:12,840
it's hard to state that as just a fact. It's more complicated than that. But let's assume they did

1124
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:18,200
take steroids and they should be in the Hall of Fame because they were these kinds of once in

1125
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:24,360
a lifetime, once in a generation players before I said, okay, I get that. But they're being kept

1126
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:31,320
out because they desecrated the record book in the minds of the voters by cheating. They broke

1127
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:37,000
faith with the history of the game and the record book and all that they made a mockery of these

1128
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:43,160
hallowed numbers, which means so much in baseball, not other sports. And nobody says, well, Joe Jackson,

1129
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,880
I guess a few people, Joe Jackson's not in the Hall of Fame, nobody would dispute the fact that

1130
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:53,480
he was a Hall of Fame player before the 1919 World Series. You know, it's like, well, he should be in

1131
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,760
the Hall of Fame because up until the point that he participated in the fix or did not do anything

1132
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:03,800
to stand in its way, he was a Hall of Fame player. Yeah, 356 career hitter. He's one of the greatest

1133
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,760
hitters of all time. Babe Ruth, I think, called him the greatest hitter of all time. He'd been

1134
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,920
around long enough. He's got the career numbers and all that. But you don't make the argument,

1135
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,560
well, okay, but let's put him in the Hall of Fame because of what he did. It's what you did at that

1136
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,840
moment that disqualifies you. Yeah, these are such tough questions. And for the sake of time,

1137
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,760
I'm not going to take us down the path of cycling, which is another sport where I think

1138
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,960
you can't do grand tours without drugs. And we've had a period, there was a 20 year period from,

1139
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:37,320
call it 91 to 2011, 2010, I would say, when the drug use was simply comical. And what do we do

1140
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:41,480
with those years? But anyway, all that said, Jeremy, this has been, I think it will be the

1141
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,400
shortest podcast I've ever done, but that's only because we have this time constraint.

1142
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,160
We're going to have to do it again then. I'm in.

1143
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:51,400
We'll do around two. But no, this has been super interesting. And I just think that

1144
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,960
I have a complicated relationship with sports. Sometimes I feel guilty for caring. Sometimes I

1145
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:00,760
feel like, why do I care so much about this? Why am I not caring more about something else that

1146
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:08,120
quote unquote matters more? But in the end, I think why I care about sports is they are basically the

1147
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:13,320
substrate for some of the greatest metaphors we have in life. And I think when I think about why

1148
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,960
do I want my kids to play sports? It's not because I think any one of them will ever be

1149
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:23,720
a professional athlete. It's because of what they learn about themselves in this quest.

1150
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,880
There's no doubt about that. And the other thing is, I mean, sometimes I think most people

1151
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:33,400
are over this, but kind of the snobbish way of it, you know, sports is one thing, but the fine arts

1152
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:39,720
are something else or, you know, ballet or opera or theater are on some plane that's above sports.

1153
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:45,080
Look, I'll say this. There is nothing else. I mean, I'm a Giants fan. I was at the Super Bowl,

1154
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:49,960
Super Bowl 25 when they won that game against the Bills and last second when Scott Norwood

1155
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,240
missed that kick. That kind of joy you felt. That's another amazing. That might have been.

1156
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:59,960
That was good. The four falls of Buffalo is. There's nothing else. I am a fan of the theater.

1157
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:06,600
I'm a fan of the arts. I'm a fan of music. You don't go to a concert or you don't go to a

1158
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,880
Broadway show or anything like that. And the end of it go completely nuts the way that,

1159
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:16,600
say, for instance, it's Super Bowl 25. I was going nuts or all those hundreds of thousands of other

1160
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:22,680
fans are going. I was at the World Cup final in 98 in Paris. I've been a three World Cup final games.

1161
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:28,040
I was only one. The one in France 98 where the home team won. France wins its first World Cup

1162
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:33,480
at home in that stadium in San Denis with 100,000 people. There's nothing else that gives us that

1163
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,320
kind of moment. And that's universal. I mean, that's around the whole world. So there's

1164
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,480
something special about sports that we've got to acknowledge. I think your point about it being

1165
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,560
the lingua franca is actually I'd never thought of it that way, but I think you're right. It may be

1166
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:51,240
the greatest lingua franca of them all. Or as I said it incorrectly lingua franca.

1167
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,760
Maybe I'm saying it incorrectly. You're right. I think you're right.

1168
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:00,200
Well, Jeremy, this is awesome. And thank you so much for your time. And let's go watch 42 to one.

1169
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:06,040
For me, it's only the 45th time. It'll only be my second. You might still appreciate.
