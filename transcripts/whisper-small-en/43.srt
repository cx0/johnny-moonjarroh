00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,000
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr. Alan Bauman, a hair

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,600
transplant surgeon who is one of the few people who is actually board certified in hair transplantation.

47
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
There are lots of hair transplant surgeons out there, but Alan is one of the very few who's

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,640
actually board certified. And I've gotten to know Alan very well because one of my patients,

49
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,480
actually two of my patients went to him for procedures a couple of years ago. I was sort

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,520
of blown away by the results because the best hair transplants are the ones where after the fact,

51
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,840
you have no clue that the patient had a hair transplant. Got to know him better and was

52
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,320
impressed immediately by how open he was to all of my questions. And believe me, there were a lot

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,760
of questions before I refer one of my patients to another physician, especially a physician who's

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,840
going to do a procedure on them. I want to be able to vet the heck out of them. And I want to

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,800
understand how they're doing what they're doing. And internally, we put together summaries of the

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,040
stuff that we learned. And Alan was so gracious in his ability to share his data, share his insights,

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,440
acknowledge what he didn't know that over the past couple of years, I've sent more and more

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,080
patients to him who have inquired about both surgical and non-surgical solutions to hair loss.

59
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,880
And this is of course true for both men and women. So at some point I said, Alan, we need to sit down

60
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,400
and talk about this. And Alan is of course one of the experts in the world on this topic. He's treated

61
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,480
over 20,000 patients. He's done over 8,000 hair transplants. The thing about this that's

62
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,960
interesting is you come to learn as I learned that this is a problem that both men and women think

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,600
about. And so in this episode, we talk about what hair loss looks like in both men and women. And it

64
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,200
turns out that pretty much nobody goes through their life without some change in their hair

65
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,240
pattern. Now for men, I think it's a little more obvious we see the results of hair loss, but of

66
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,080
course any woman who's been pregnant knows that just there and then she's going to experience a

67
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,760
dramatic change in her pattern of both gaining hair and then losing hair post pregnancy. But of

68
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,480
course for many women, this changes as they get older and once they go through menopause. And

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,320
I think most women aren't aware of some of the solutions that exist maybe as much as men are. So

70
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,560
we talk in great detail about what the non-surgical or non-invasive approaches are. And

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,680
there turned out to be many more than I had ever understood or even appreciated. And I think Alan

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,920
does a great job of explaining those. And then of course there are many invasive things such as PRP

73
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,520
that would be even pre-surgical. And then of course within the surgical side of hair restoration,

74
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,000
like anything, I suppose there are many different techniques and they have advantages, disadvantages.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,600
And Alan does a great job here of explaining the method that he has chosen and why I think

76
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,120
it certainly seems to produce unbelievable results in the cases that I've seen. This is an episode

77
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,120
that has been, I've been asked about a lot in social media. So this is a great example of

78
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,240
bugging the heck out of me over social media for topics that you want to hear about. And both men

79
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,760
and women have said, please interview somebody who's an expert on hair restoration. And so

80
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,440
with that said, please continue to ask about things that you're interested in hearing about.

81
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,840
And hopefully I'll be able to continue to find exceptional people with whom to bring

82
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,880
expertise to you. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Alan Bauman.

83
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,360
Hey Alan, thanks for making time today. Peter, thanks for having me. This is great.

84
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,160
Yeah. Well, we met actually through a patient because I mean, a lot of the doctors that I

85
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,240
know who are doing really cool stuff, I'm somehow finding on my own, but perhaps just as often

86
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,560
actually, now that I think about it, I come to meet somebody through the work they've done

87
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,040
with one of my patients. And then that takes me down the rabbit hole because unfortunately,

88
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,600
a lot of times, a patient will go and see somebody and the outcome for anything, whether it be a

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,000
colonoscopy or whatever, it's not what you want. But in particular, the patient that saw you had

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,440
such a great outcome. And because you're in Florida where I just don't really have much of a network,

91
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,280
I was intrigued by the outcome and the patient insisted that I speak with you. He was like,

92
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,840
you got to talk to him. He's your kind of guy. You're going to connect. And I was like, of course,

93
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,400
yeah, I mean, I'm happy to learn. And so the first thing that amazed me when we spoke was that you

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,040
trained as a general surgeon. Correct. And I don't know why I thought that would be so unusual. Is

95
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,720
that common for people who are doing hair transplantation to have done a complete residency

96
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,360
in general surgery? Well, there are many general surgeons in the field of hair transplant surgery

97
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:48,040
but I would say years ago was mostly dermatologists. But hair transplant is kind of a potpourri of all

98
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,880
different types of areas of medicine. I mean, we have people in the field who are psychiatrists,

99
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,800
urologists, as well as the commons, you know, ones that you would see dermatologist surgeons,

100
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,720
vascular surgeons, things like that, who have made a transition maybe from a previous type of practice

101
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,680
into hair transplantation. And is there a like a board certification for hair transplant the way

102
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,200
there is for general surgery or thoracic surgery? So the American board of hair restoration surgery

103
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,000
is not recognized right now yet by the ABMS, which is, you know, the American board of medical

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,880
specialties. So it's kind of in its primordial stage. When I first got interested in hair

105
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,000
transplantation, there wasn't even a board certification test anywhere on the horizon.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,400
And so of course my parents thought that I was going down a deep rabbit hole, maybe with a dead

107
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,040
end because I would never become board certified. And they were very, very nervous about my interest

108
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,000
in hair transplantation back in the early 1990s. But now it has a certificate in the way that

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,400
transplantation or surgical oncology, which are not board certified specialties are still

110
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,040
certificates. Right. Even restorative dentistry has these types of boards. And so it's a rigorous

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,120
process, one that was a lot of fun to go through, to be honest, because before that, you know,

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,520
I never took a test that was specifically geared to my primary specialties. All I do,

113
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,520
all I've done for well over 20 years is hair transplantation. So to prepare for that was an

114
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,560
exciting time. It's rigorous, written exam, oral exam. And you guys go through that every five

115
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,120
years or how often do you research? Oh, got the recertification. You know, I don't know. I just did

116
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,280
my recertification. I should know it's probably like eight or 10 years or something like that.

117
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,040
So what got you interested in the space? Because it sounds like you're not,

118
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,040
again, I don't know if it's the exception of the rule, but you went into surgery to do this.

119
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,640
Whereas as you pointed out, there are a number of people who come to this probably as a second

120
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,920
career in surgery, right? Right. So I kind of fell into it almost by accident. My first love

121
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,440
was plastic surgery, constructive surgery. My first mentor was a plastic surgeon, pretty prominent,

122
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,280
plastic surgeon on the upper east side of Manhattan. And he was close friends of the family.

123
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,080
His kids were my age. They had no interest in surgery. And he kind of took a liking to me. And

124
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,400
I, he said, Hey, if you're going to go to medical school, you're going to be residency in New York,

125
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,320
Beth Israel and Mount Sinai is where I did my general surgery. But this is way back when I

126
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,920
was a teenager. He said, Hey, if you're thinking about going into medicine, you should come and

127
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,600
watch me operate. And I was like, well, I don't know what kind of operation he does, but, you know,

128
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,360
I went to go see him and he was a plastic surgeon. And that was the first time I ever saw surgery

129
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,520
because back in the 1990s, this was in the 80s, no YouTube, no discovery channel. I mean,

130
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,880
I didn't really know what surgery was, to be honest, as a teenager. And I remember being there

131
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,800
at Beth Israel, getting dropped off in the lobby and looking over shoulder in the OR, you know,

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,200
he dressed me in scrubs, whatever, stand here, don't touch anything blue. I guess the security

133
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,800
wasn't so great. But, you know, I was looking over his shoulder and he was doing his procedures.

134
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,040
And I was blown away. I was like, this is what I want to do. I want to do surgery.

135
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,440
And from there, you know, it was years and years of just shadowing him and being mentored,

136
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,720
often on vacation times and things like that. And I pursued general surgery through, you know,

137
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,080
my interest in going that route through plastic to get to plastic reconstructive work.

138
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,640
Yeah, because back in that day, I mean, today there's a combined plastics track where you can

139
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,800
do three of general and three of plastics. But presumably when you went through it,

140
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,360
and even when I went through training, those were the exception. Most of them were still doing five

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,760
years of general surgery plus two years of plastics, right?

142
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,000
Right. And that's just what I figured I would be doing. I did an externship while I was in medical

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,400
school that happened to be, not happened to be, but coordinated with one of the hospitals where

144
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,840
he was in attending. So I got some very, very close mentorship there. I was doing things with him

145
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,560
in medical school that he wasn't letting his fellows do in rotation in the hospital. So it

146
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,840
was kind of interesting. I felt like I had a nice leg up. I got to watch him interact with patients

147
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,400
in his practice, as well as see him operate. And he really was an amazing teacher and a great

148
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,920
mentor of mine and really changed the course of my whole life really into the surgical end of

149
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,880
medicine and seeing how he dealt with patients, seeing his passion for the artistry and getting

150
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,760
the results taught me a lot. He was a low CD, which is great. That's exactly what you want in

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,640
a surgeon. Yeah. I think, I think you want that in your engineers, your accountants and your surgeons.

152
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,960
For sure. So I remember just being ecstatic, just every time we were together, you know,

153
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,800
it was like, what are we seeing next? And so I always thought that plastic and reconstructive

154
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,560
surgery, that's kind of where I was headed. And it really wasn't until I met a patient

155
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,600
who had had a hair transplant, did I even consider looking at hair transplant surgery as a potential

156
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,600
procedure that I would even want to perform. I thought it was all painful or pluggy looking.

157
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Like why would anybody ever want to have a hair transplant? I just, it was just totally out of

158
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,920
sight out of mind. And when I, when I met this patient and I couldn't tell that he had had a

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,080
hair transplant, I was basically blown away. I was like, well, we need, let's talk about this for a

160
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,440
minute. You know, and of course he was getting something else done at that day. And I was the

161
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,520
good resident doing the intake forms and the paperwork. And he was telling me about why he

162
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,520
flew here or there to get his hair transplanted. And he was a layman. He told me all about, you

163
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,800
know, what he knew about the procedure. And I'm looking at a scalp, you know, do you mind if I

164
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,560
ask you, where did you get this procedure done? Where did you have this procedure? And he said,

165
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,160
Oh, up over there in Canada or something like that. And I said, no, where on your scalp? He's

166
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,240
like, well, right here at the hairline. And so he started to explain to me in layman's terms,

167
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,920
the use of single follicles, I mean, individual hairs. What year was this? This was in the mid

168
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,080
1990s. And what year was your training? So I was in my second year of general surgery or the end of

169
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,240
my first year general surgery. I was thinking to myself just after that conversation, because he

170
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,200
was so ecstatic about it. And it was really something I never thought about before. And it

171
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,840
was kind of unusual that the result was totally different than what I expected. Because you know,

172
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,880
as a general surgery resident, you think you know a lot, you know, you think you know everything.

173
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,880
And first of all, why would he have gone to Toronto to have the procedure done when everything

174
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,640
is here in New York, you know, which is where I was trained. So, you know, a lot of things kind

175
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,920
of struck me that way. But it was it was exciting. And to see that, and to see that it could be done

176
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,040
in a way that was totally unexpected to me. And of course, I watched my dad go through his hair loss

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,000
process. So immediately I'm thinking maybe my dad should look into this. And I thought then also,

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,640
well, if this is that good, maybe I should look into it and perhaps learn how to do it so I could

179
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,480
add it to my future practice later on down the line. And so that started me on the path to like

180
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,680
looking into hair restoration, hair transplantation as something maybe I would consider doing.

181
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,400
Well, I want to come back to that because I want to know about the genesis of the

182
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,400
surgical perfection. I mean, to me, one of the fun things about surgery is

183
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,080
kind of understanding how operations evolve. You know, I chose the residency program I chose

184
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,960
because of its proficiency in doing this Whipple procedure. And so you would go in there, you would

185
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:45,240
learn everything about how barbaric that procedure once was and how over years of being perfected in

186
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,040
surgical technique, even the type of suture that was used, the mortality of that could fall from

187
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,120
50% to, you know, 0.3%. So I want to actually come back to this, but I guess I want to take

188
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,120
a step way back and just talk about hair loss in general. So how common is it, I guess, both in

189
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,520
men and women? Let's start with that. So hair loss is super common. Almost a hundred million

190
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,120
Americans are suffering from some form of hair loss. And we know now it could be as close to 80

191
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,960
million men and even 46 million women out there who are struggling with the hair loss process.

192
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,840
So there's a lot of people out there who are experiencing hair thinning. They may be

193
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,440
experiencing receding hair lines, loss of volume, loss of coverage of their scalp. And it's a big

194
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,080
concern for many, although very much undertreated. And is there data on how many people care? I mean,

195
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,160
or what percentage of men with hair loss care versus what percentage of women? Like, is it naive

196
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,920
to assume that this is even though a smaller problem by numbers in women, that it might create

197
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,960
more distress in women? Well, first of all, everybody cares about hair, don't they? I don't

198
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:57,800
understand the question. Yeah, perhaps, right? No, but certainly it varies because you could be

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,080
a young guy in your twenties losing your hair and be really devastated by it. Or you could be someone

200
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,280
who has a slower hair loss problem with the exact same amount of hair loss, but at a much older age,

201
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,520
and you may be at a different place in time where you may not necessarily be focused on that hair

202
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,640
loss. And remember that in men, it's socially acceptable. I'm looking at your bare scalp,

203
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,920
you shave down to number zero or two or one or, you know, with a, with a trimmer, maybe that you

204
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,600
shave once every other day, perhaps once a week. So, okay, so there you go. But the point is, is

205
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,840
that in women, there's no socially acceptable option for female hair loss. And so it can be

206
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,200
much more devastating for sure, even though it's easier to cover in women. So there's, there's a

207
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,400
lot of nuance there. Women can lose, you know, half their hair and you would look at them across

208
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,960
the room and think that they have a full head of hair. And that's how the physical optics of hair

209
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,960
fibers work, meaning that you can lose 50% of your density. And from across the room, the coverage

210
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,840
will be pretty much the same. Okay. Well, that's really interesting, right? Because yeah, some

211
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,000
people listening to this might say, or get a mental image of somebody loses half their hair,

212
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,040
like one half of their head is bald. The other is not, of course, that's not what you mean.

213
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,200
You mean evenly distributed across their head, half the density, you know, you, you, every two

214
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,080
follicles become one, that's pretty easy to mask the longer the hair is, right? Right. And of

215
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,720
course, you know, female pattern hair loss happens in a very specific pattern behind the hairline.

216
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,840
That's where that density loss can occur. So it's not equally, it's very rarely equally distributed.

217
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,320
And same in men, there's a very specific pattern that you can see basically progressing from across

218
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,720
the room. But it's a, it's a commonly accepted knowledge point that you can, we see it obviously

219
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,040
every day in the office that you can lose 50% of the hair mass. So that might be a number that's a

220
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,040
combination of the density and the diameter of the hair. If you lose 50% of that, that's roughly the

221
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,040
break point between coverage and, you know, maybe some see-through to the scalp. Does that make sense?

222
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,640
It certainly does. Yeah. So you alluded to something I guess I hadn't even really thought

223
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,160
about, which was, you know, someone losing their hair very young. So is there a definition for

224
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,240
premature hair loss? Like, cause you hear that expression thrown out there, but does it mean like,

225
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,840
everybody to the age of X is supposed to have perfectly normal hair volume and anything,

226
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,600
anyone that loses hair below that it's quote unquote premature? No, that doesn't make any sense.

227
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,920
Sort of a bogus term. Premature is in the eye of the beholder, obviously. If you think that

228
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,840
you're prematurely losing your hair, just like prematurely gray, right? So there's a spectrum.

229
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,640
Some people go gray in their 20s, some people go gray in their 80s, some people never go gray.

230
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,560
So how quickly you go gray is genetically predetermined. If 70 is the new 50, then maybe

231
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,520
you don't want to be gray at 70. So hair loss is very much the same thing. But you know,

232
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,240
when we see young men, I mean, hair loss can start anytime after puberty, right? 20% of men

233
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,200
in their twenties, 30% of men in their thirties, 40% of men in their forties have visible signs of

234
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,720
hair loss. That's a quick heuristic with percentage by decade. Yes. Pretty darn close. And so what

235
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,240
does that mean? Remember I said that you can lose half your hair by the time it's noticeable to the

236
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,680
naked eye. So immediately after puberty, that's when hair loss starts. And this is predominantly

237
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,280
more in boys than girls though. Correct. We were talking about male pattern hair loss, right? When

238
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,360
I give you those numbers. So the female hair loss, typically it's a little bit later on and there's,

239
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,600
it's more multifactorial. We can see other things that are affecting the hair loss process.

240
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,960
You know, women are just more complicated, man. Yeah. They do have that luxury. So

241
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,080
you mentioned for a moment ago, like that, that if you're graying, that's genetically determined.

242
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,760
How much is hair loss genetically determined? In men, it's, you know, 99%, 98, 99% is genetically

243
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,120
determined. How quickly it's noticeable to the naked eye where it progresses to somewhat of

244
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,800
the pattern, you know, is it more loss in the front versus the crown? You know, there's some

245
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,320
variations there genetically. Of course, there's 200 genes that regulate hair and that would include

246
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,240
color, curl, texture, and all of those play a role in terms of coverage, right? Because again,

247
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,760
those are the physical properties and then hair styling, of course. So if you're a 20 year old guy

248
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,360
and you know, with your friends hanging out in the bar on a Friday night and you are experiencing

249
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,920
some recession of the hairline, you may be one out of your group of friends that's having some

250
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,200
significant male pattern hair loss. So for you, that's premature. You're looking at the rest of

251
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
the guys in the group, four or five friends, they all look like they got pretty much full heads of

252
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,720
hair and you don't. So that can cause a lot of stress and anxiety. I think in this day and age,

253
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,040
you know, Instagram age or however you want to call it, people want to look good and feel good

254
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:34,360
and they don't want to be rushed into having to accept the fact that they're going to look older

255
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,640
than their stated age. And I didn't realize that there were 200 genes that played a role in hair.

256
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,000
I never counted them, but that's what they say. No, no, no, no. Directional, yeah. So it's not a

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,600
simple, if your dad or your mom's dad or something like you, I've heard these things that say that

258
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,360
that's the direction it tracks. It sounds like that's not the case. Right. So X-Link,

259
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,360
mom's dad should tell you whether you're going to go bald or not. That's really not the case

260
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,000
anymore. We know that there's other factors that come from both sides of the family, you know,

261
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,800
the genetic components that play a role in all those factors that I mentioned, you know, the

262
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,120
color, the quality, the hair and so forth and speed at which the hair loss occurs and the patterns

263
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,320
and so forth. And I have friends who are brothers who one has total hair loss and the other looks

264
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,920
like he's got the thickest head of hair I've ever seen in my life. And maybe one's good at football

265
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,600
and the other good at math, you know, and so everybody, that's how genetics work. It can skip

266
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,440
siblings, it's recessive gene. So it could skip generations, you know, or it can be a wipeout.

267
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,520
I mean, I have the grandfather bringing in or the dad's bringing in the grandfather and then the

268
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,080
kids come in and, you know, and it's like a whole family affair because the, you know, the force runs

269
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,440
strong in that family, if you know what I mean. Now talk to me a little bit about what's going on

270
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,560
with women because I am aware of this only in that, you know, I've taken care of more and more

271
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,920
women over the past few years. I realized that it's sort of like you say, like, I don't even notice

272
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,280
it, but they notice it, right? And they'll say, you know, do you think that this hormone is right

273
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:04,040
in me or this hormone or taking a step back? I certainly remember watching my wife go through

274
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,920
pregnancy, right? Where her hair would get very, very thick. You have a baby, a lot of that hair

275
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,400
falls out and then it just kind of all grows back to normal. So putting that aside for a moment,

276
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,280
which is, it must be clearly driven by hormones. Of course. So the amount of follicles that are in

277
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,240
antigen when you're in pregnancy is a much higher percentage. So antigen is the growth phase. You're

278
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,880
going to have more follicles staying in antigen, longer time in antigen. So your hair will be thicker

279
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,560
and fuller during that time in pregnancy. And then when the hormones crash back down after childbirth,

280
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,520
then those ratios go back to normal and a shedding phase and a fluvium or telogen

281
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,760
of fluvium can occur in about six to 12 weeks. But if you're prone to female pattern hair loss,

282
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,840
sometimes you don't necessarily recover from that dramatic effluvium. So you shouldn't,

283
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,080
shouldn't just say, Oh, well, it's just pregnancy shedding. And that's it. Because sometimes women

284
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,440
come in and they say, look, I had my kid three years ago. My hair never rebounded from that

285
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,640
situation. It changed right after that. And the other thing I hear women say a lot

286
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,400
is the thickness was never the same after. So it's, they don't, I mean, I don't know that,

287
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,680
that one of us, meaning me or the patient is skilled enough to assess follicular density,

288
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,760
but thickness is very easy for the patient to accept. And, you know, I've heard women say a lot,

289
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,280
you know, after my third kid, like my hair is so thin and they're referring to the actual hair

290
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,160
itself. Right. Well, they could be referring to the hair fiber diameter and that can change just

291
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,520
with age. Honestly, it gets thinner with time, but it could also be that they feel like their whole

292
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,400
head of hair is not as thick as it was. And that would be a volume issue. So that could be the

293
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,120
sheer numbers of hairs that are growing at any given time, giving you what's just called the

294
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,160
ponytail volume. You know, a lot of women will say, you know, when I was in my twenties, I put my

295
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,640
ponytail in the, you know, with a scrunchier or whatever or a rubber band and it, I could just,

296
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,120
I turned it two times and boom, that was it. It was like a, you know, a horse's tail. And now here

297
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,960
I am 10, 15 years later and I have, I can turn it three times. Meaning they need another wrap.

298
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
That's an interesting litmus test I would have never thought about.

299
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,320
Yeah, for sure. So, and of course now in the office, we have scientific methods,

300
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,400
ways, devices, tools that can actually quantify different areas of the scalp and give us literally

301
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,440
cross-sectional bundle measurements of scientific ponytails. And we can go back to the same area

302
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,000
again and again, but we may be going ahead of ourselves in terms of diagnosis and treatments

303
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,080
and such, but there are ways to measure that. When someone says, I have less hair, I have thin hair,

304
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,800
we need to figure out what exactly does that, what are they saying when they talk about that symptom?

305
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,560
Because shedding is also another confusing symptom. People say, I have shedding.

306
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,880
Well, shedding happens every day. Hair follicles turn on and turn off. Hair follicles will grow

307
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,920
for five to seven years, a long strong hair, and then turn off, rest for 90 days. And then

308
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,320
the cycle begins again and a certain percentage of hair follicles are in that growing phase.

309
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,680
I mean, let's call it 84, 85%. But all of a sudden, if you do something to switch

310
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,320
those percentages, then you're going to get a thinner head of hair, meaning that there's

311
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,720
less trees in the forest perhaps. So, going back to the males for a moment,

312
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,400
which is pretty strongly genetically linked, as you said, my overly simplistic view of the problem

313
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,640
is dihydrotestosterone is a hormone that will precipitate this in a genetically susceptible

314
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:39,000
individual, which is why two of the most popular systemic agents to mitigate male pattern baldness

315
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,200
block the enzyme that turns testosterone into DHT. Is that the only hormone that's playing a role

316
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,440
or is that just the one that we have a treatment for? Well, that is the primary trigger according

317
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,040
to the data that we see right now. And the data is very clear. If you put someone on Finasteride,

318
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:02,200
about a milligram a day, they have a 90% chance of looking the same or better into the long run.

319
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,280
Long run for pharmaceutical clinical trials, you know, is about five years. It's not infinity,

320
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,160
but it's five years. And that tells you that, you know, we're pretty close to, that's a pretty safe

321
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,680
bet that DHT is the bad guy, you know, responsible for a lot of follicular homicide out there.

322
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Does that mean that, again, as a thought experiment, I don't think it would ever make

323
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,880
sense to do this. If the moment a boy went through puberty, he was put on Finasteride,

324
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,760
are you suggesting that there may not, like that might be enough to mitigate baldness,

325
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,120
at least in men, because I think in women it probably is different, correct?

326
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,960
Well, there's always, and the answer is complicated. Yes, I think that would help

327
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,680
in a huge percentage. I'm not advocating that, of course, but remember that even if you put

328
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,080
someone on Finasteride or even Dutasteride, which is a stronger DHT blocking agent, right,

329
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:54,040
blocking both pathways to DHT, you still squeak by with a little bit of DHT. So there is still

330
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,640
some of that happening in the body, even with those strong pharmaceutical blockades.

331
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,800
And these things are not without their side effects. I mean,

332
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,560
a subset of men experience sexual side effects with them. And I think the literature in the

333
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,600
prostate land is still very confusing about lower rates of prostate cancer,

334
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,360
but potentially higher grade when it strikes and all of this confusion around-

335
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,320
I can tell you how that's been explained to us as care surgeons by the urologists that were

336
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,360
involved in some of those studies. For example, Finasteride, five milligrams is one of the more

337
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,920
prominent treatments for BPH, benign prostatic hyperteria, a large prostate. You put somebody

338
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,840
on five milligrams of Finasteride, the regular prostate tissue shrinks. And so that's likely

339
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,760
what's happening also at a one milligram dose. And so what happens if the normal prostate tissue is

340
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,520
shrinking and you go to biopsy that tissue, you might be more likely to find some high-grade

341
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,120
cancer or cancerous material in there just because the normal tissue is less voluminous.

342
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,880
So that's why not everybody in the world gets a prostate biopsy, but everybody in a clinical trial

343
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,760
does. So that can skew the numbers. And that can, I don't know if I'm explaining right, but that

344
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,880
one of the ways it's been explained to us in the world of hair restoration surgery,

345
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,080
that you're not causing the prostate to become cancerous. And of course, thank God people don't

346
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,320
die of prostate cancer. It's a very slow moving thing. Obviously there's very good survivability

347
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,360
if you should be diagnosed. But the point is that you're shrinking that good healthy tissue and

348
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,280
then you're more likely to find something on the biopsy and that more likely be high-grade.

349
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,640
And high-grade cancers in prostate are very, very rare. So it doesn't take much to skew the numbers

350
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,040
from like, let's call it, and I don't quote me, but let's call it a quarter percent to three

351
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,000
quarters of a percent. All of a sudden it doubled. Could be just a couple of biopsies to throw it

352
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,640
off. So you talked about finasteride, which of course is the generic name. Proscar is the five

353
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,600
milligram formulation of that and Propecia is the one milligram formulation, correct?

354
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,680
Correct. Which are both now off patent, obviously, as you know.

355
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,600
Were they developed in parallel or was it first a BPH drug and then they noticed,

356
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,960
hey guys, hair is falling out less. Oh, we don't need to use as much of this. Let's create a new

357
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,800
drug. I will tell you that Merck knew from the get-go that it was going to be a hair loss drug.

358
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,920
They also knew about the effect on the prostate. They went after the prostate indication first,

359
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,600
got that FDA approval, and then did the, and had safety studies and such done for that,

360
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,400
and then pursued the hair loss indication after. And it was FDA approved for hair loss

361
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,280
as a one milligram dose in 1998. Got it. So it was not serendipitous as minoxidil was.

362
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,320
And some people confuse those two stories like, oh, this prostate drug, they figured out it grew

363
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,120
hair. No, no, that's not the way Finasteride came out.

364
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,520
Wasn't minoxidil at least systemically a blood pressure drug?

365
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,800
Yes. So I think back in the seventies, minoxidil was administered for hypertension. And it was,

366
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,640
I think it was people who were on dialysis honestly that were being noted to be on this

367
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,600
drug for a long, long periods of time. And the people running those clinics were seeing

368
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,360
patients on minoxidil, oral minoxidil, and they're literally growing hair on their knuckles almost,

369
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,080
and seeing hair growth in other places. And that's how they, and it wasn't really that great of a

370
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,880
blood pressure drug, minoxidil. And so that's when they decided to move into a topical.

371
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,880
One man's side effect is another man's indication, right?

372
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Yeah, yeah, for sure. The story of Viagra, not quite as elegant, but similar. So we'll come back

373
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,440
to minoxidil because it's topical. And that's what Rogaine is by brand name?

374
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Correct. So Rogaine was the first drug, Rogaine was a minoxidil formulation with propylene glycol,

375
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,640
and that was the first FDA approved medication for hair loss. So that is an important data point

376
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,040
in the history of hair loss. You know, when we write the history books, that really started

377
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,200
hair loss as something that we can treat and the beginning of the end, if you will,

378
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,320
of a snake oil era. So Rogaine is purchased over the counter, correct? So today Rogaine's available

379
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,240
in a number of different formulations over the counter. You can get 2% or 5% solutions or foam

380
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,560
versions. There's generic versions all over the place. But the problem is, is that most of those

381
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,760
are very, very irritating to the scalp. They can be very greasy or gooey. The foam versions,

382
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,680
if you have any kind of hair on your head whatsoever, it can be very difficult to apply

383
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,680
to get into the scalp. So those formulations have some issues. And that's why Rogaine,

384
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,480
if you will, or over the counter minoxidil is consistently ranked as the most disappointing

385
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,280
hair loss treatment ever by Consumer Reports. They had a big report on that a number of years

386
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,360
ago. And the reason is because it's very difficult to use. So I would say about 15 years ago,

387
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,120
we started looking at compounding pharmacies to really help us make a better minoxidil. Could we

388
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,240
create a minoxidil that was penetrating better, easier to use, less irritating to the scalp,

389
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,600
take advantage of some of the other knowledge that we have about the hair loss process,

390
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,840
like inflammation and so forth. What could we do to potentiate or accelerate the movement of

391
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,440
minoxidil across the epithelium into the location of the follicles where we need it the most?

392
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,920
And that's where we came up with some of these more sophisticated formulations like AD2M and

393
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,960
AD2F and so forth. All right. Well, I want to come back to that as well, because that sounds

394
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,280
super interesting. Going back to just close the loop on the pathophysiology in the women who,

395
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,200
and again, separating it from sort of the pregnancy cycle. You have a woman who 20 years

396
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,760
after or 10 years after having her last child starts to say, my hair is getting thinner. And

397
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,840
it's to the point where she's noticed that either just based on the volume of hair coming out in

398
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,080
the shower, brushing her hair on a pillow or whatever, and or even just able to visually

399
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,480
see the difference. What do we think is driving that acknowledging that it's going to be more

400
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,360
complicated than just her DHT, which is probably very low. Yeah. Her DHT levels could be very low,

401
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,200
but she can also be androgen sensitive. So there is about a 50% success rate when you apply

402
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,680
finasteride in postmenopausal women with hair loss. When you say apply, you mean don't take it

403
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,840
orally. Orally. Oh, I thought that it was completely contraindicated in women. Well,

404
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,320
women of childbearing age, it can be used off label in postmenopausal women because the risk

405
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,360
is to a developing male fetus. Yeah. And that's the main issue because, you know, DHT in a developing

406
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,200
male fetus is the driver that makes men look like men for lack of a better way to explain. So,

407
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,480
you know, we would never want to use finasteride in women of childbearing age. And it's not FDA

408
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,280
approved at all in women. And for those reasons in particular. And but we do know that there are

409
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,720
some studies out there that showed that 50% of women who are in these clinical trials with female

410
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,360
pattern hair loss postmenopausal, right? No risk to a developing male fetus at all. We're treated

411
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,920
with finasteride and they got some response from it. So their DHT may be a driver in some of those

412
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,160
patients. So what androgen sensitivity is something that is, I mean, we don't know the incidence,

413
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,040
but let's say 50% of women with hair loss have some degree of androgen sensitivity that could be

414
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,160
driving it. And, you know, if you think about, for example, the most common hormone abnormality of

415
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,600
women of childbearing age with PCOS, what are the things that kind of roll together in PCOS

416
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,200
syndrome? There's acne, there's here's herecitism, hair growth on the face and acne. Did I say that?

417
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,440
And hair loss. And so those are the, what are the, all of those have in common?

418
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,320
They're all androgen.

419
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,360
Correct. So, so there, it is, there is a common androgen connection.

420
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,160
So do young women with PCOS also experience hair loss?

421
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,520
Yeah, it's devastatingly bad.

422
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
God, I just, I didn't realize that.

423
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,960
Yeah, it can be devastatingly bad.

424
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Very common in PCOS. A lot of our-

425
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,000
And you're stuck because they'd probably respond to a five-alpha reductase inhibitor,

426
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,160
but they're in childbearing years, so you couldn't use it.

427
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,760
Correct. They're under treatment typically to improve their fertility.

428
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,160
Yeah.

429
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,000
So it's a delicate dance, you know? So we're left with other non-androgen modalities. And so that

430
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,360
would be minoxidilter to directly stimulate the scalp, maybe low-level laser therapy to impart

431
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,000
energy to the hair follicles, maybe injectable treatments like PRP and so forth.

432
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,120
Do those women in particular, these young women with PCOS,

433
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,640
can their hair loss be restored or is it permanent?

434
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,320
Well, that's a trick question because-

435
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,480
Meaning if you resolve the PCOS, you know, you can treat them and they can

436
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,240
bear children and such, will they also regain the hair that they lost?

437
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,520
It's tricky. So here's the thing. If you can normalize their hormones,

438
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,000
many of their hair loss symptoms improve slightly. But remember that once the follicle is,

439
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,480
let's call it just damaged beyond repair, miniaturized down to a certain level,

440
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,880
it reaches a point of no return. So the terminal hair is a good, healthy oak tree in the forest.

441
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,400
That's the- your best, best quality hair is a terminal hair.

442
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,560
Velus hair is the type of hair you have on the top part of your cheek. It's invisible. It's less

443
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,880
than two millimeters long. It doesn't have any pigment to it. And it's very thin in terms of

444
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,840
its diameter. So if a follicle was producing a terminal hair and then it miniaturizes all the

445
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,920
way down to now creating a velus hair, you're out of luck. Meaning that there's nothing that we know

446
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,600
of that I know of that's going to revive that follicle and get it to regain any kind of

447
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,040
significant amount of growth. So whatever kind of hair loss you have, male, female,

448
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,680
the idea is that you got to take action soon to protect the functioning of the follicles before

449
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,040
there's that point of no return. That makes sense. You alluded to Rogaine being the first

450
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:38,520
drug or topical agent that actually had clinical efficacy, which therefore, I think you described

451
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:46,200
very nicely as the beginning of the end of snake oil, not the end, but at least the first shot

452
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,560
across the bow that this could be a legitimate industry. Correct. Just briefly, what are some of

453
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,800
the top three, top five snake oil things that were being peddled out there to people? Oh gosh,

454
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,000
well, we'd have to go back to the history books, but there were all kinds of tonics and such that

455
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,440
were promoted through advertising and so forth. When you look at old Meg,

456
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:15,880
there's always ads for exactly some tonic or some ridiculous chemical that you could-

457
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,480
Dr. Johns, whatever, you know what I mean? There's always a picture of a woman with a

458
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,960
beautiful long head of hair. What happened was that then, I guess it was Johnson & Johnson or

459
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,680
whoever it was that had Rogaine was then able to say, you can't advertise hair growth from that

460
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,040
kind of lavender oil extract because we have FDA approval for that now. That was the method that

461
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,920
kind of started to clear out the industry, if you will, moving some of those literally oil treatments,

462
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,280
tonics and so forth that had no clinical efficacy whatsoever out of the market. Because now,

463
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,360
if in order to advertise hair growth, you had to have that FDA clearance. You had to have that

464
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,040
FDA approval behind you. We don't have to do an exhaustive list now, but I would love to list to

465
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,440
an exhaustive link in the show notes. What are some of the snake oils you're seeing out there today

466
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,400
that people come to you saying, I've been on this and it hasn't been working or what do you think

467
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,280
about this? Well, there is a long list, but here's the thing. You have to be careful because people

468
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,520
say, oh, well, Rogaine didn't work for me. But remember we said earlier on that-

469
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,360
Yeah, application matters.

470
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,840
Application makes a big difference. Compliance. Most people, they pick up a bottle of Rogaine,

471
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
they're lackadaisical about it, they don't do it twice a day, they can't get it on their scalp,

472
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,600
they have some kind of irritation, they don't know that it's working. So a lot of it is expectations

473
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,520
too, right? So people say, well, yeah, Rogaine didn't work. Or this handheld laser that I bought

474
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,080
back in 1999, it was supposed to grow hair, but it doesn't. But well, the problem with, for example,

475
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,160
that small little handheld laser is just that you're trying to water your lawn with a watering

476
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,560
can when really what you needed was a sprinkler system, you needed a different type of delivery

477
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:12,280
system. So we kind of get into trouble sometimes saying, well, people thought that laser was a

478
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,320
bogus treatment. Even my colleagues for many, many years thought that low-level laser therapy had no

479
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,200
influence on the hair follicle. And obviously they're all proven wrong by the exhaustive studies

480
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,760
that have been done now and all of the FDA clearances, which prove not only safety,

481
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,360
but certainly hair growth. And we've seen patient after patient.

482
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,120
But what about biotin and things that you see people taking like these tablets or these makeshift

483
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,640
things? So biotin.

484
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,440
New York is full of doctors who, I just know this because when you do an intake with your patient,

485
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,600
you find out all the medications they're taking and there's like all these cocktails of pills

486
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,600
that they're taking for hair growth. And I'm obviously familiar with some of them like

487
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,800
finasteride, dutasteride, but I mean biotin, what is biotin?

488
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
Well, you have to know what they actually do. Biotin has been shown to improve keratin

489
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,720
production, not only in the animal kingdom, because it's used in horses who have hoof

490
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,720
issues. And a lot of that science is out there. You can put a horse on a high dose biotin and

491
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,200
their hoofs improve. And that would be important if you're raising thoroughbreds, for example,

492
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,560
because a hoof problem in a valuable racehorse is a big issue. So there's no question that

493
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,520
there's a lot of science and data out there. It's less honestly in humans. There's less data out

494
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,000
there. But you know, if you put patients on biotin, a high dose, let's say 10,000 micrograms,

495
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,120
nine times out of 10, they'll tell you their nails are getting stronger. And we know that you can do

496
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,600
hair tensile strength studies and put, you know, literally stretch and pull on those hairs and see

497
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,680
the strength improve. But remember that that's not going to improve your female pattern hair loss or

498
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,440
male pattern hair loss problem to any substantial amount. It may make the hairs that you have

499
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,280
stronger, but it's going to need to be coupled with some other effective treatment. And that's

500
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,520
where layering these kinds of therapeutic interventions are really, really important.

501
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,720
So have you ever had a patient come to you and say-

502
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,920
With a bag of vitamins?

503
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,760
No, no. Have you ever had a patient come to you and say, I'm 25 years old and everyone in my family

504
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,400
has lost their hair, you know, when they're in their forties. I'm, and it's male or female,

505
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,960
by the way, so feel free to answer the question differently. Is there anything I can do preventatively,

506
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,120
even though now my hair is still seemingly perfectly normal, but it look, if history

507
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,480
repeats itself in 15 years, I'm going to be losing it or it's going to be thinning.

508
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,800
Well, a lot of my patients come to me with that exact question and concern. Many of my

509
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,040
patients who we've transplanted or treated with other therapeutic interventions will bring in

510
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:45,080
their teenage sons or daughters and say, listen, I, you know, I got measured too late. Can you

511
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,000
measure my son or daughter? They're going off to college. They're going to grad school. Let's get

512
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
them measured. Let's see what's going on. And then the son or daughter may or may not have a concern.

513
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,960
Very often it's the parents, just like probably they paid for braces. So, you know, they're

514
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,000
concerned about keeping their, their child's hair intact or at least as long as it possibly can.

515
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,560
So we'll perform some evaluations and measurements. So we know that there's a hair loss risk in the

516
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,160
family. A father's hair transplant patient, obviously, or something like that. We'll use the

517
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,080
trichometers to do hair bundle measurements. We'll look at the areas that are permanent,

518
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,880
for example, in the back of the scalp. And we'll measure that and see what is their maximum

519
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,320
hair mass index. That's the, that's the term that we use for the number that is a combined

520
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,040
measurement of the diameter and the density in a given area of scalp. And then we'll compare that

521
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,160
area to an area that might be at risk, like the crown area or the frontal zone or in the temples.

522
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,200
And so it's normal to see a little bit less in the temple areas, but when you're going through

523
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,960
puberty, your hair mass is essentially all the same over the entire top of your scalp. So I can

524
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,520
pick up if they have a tendency towards hair loss very, very early on, way before it's noticeable to

525
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,560
the naked eye. They may not, young man may not even have a receding hairline. And we can tell

526
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,760
by measuring the instruments are so sensitive, we can tell already he's got maybe a, let's call it

527
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,960
20% loss in that frontal zone. Because you're sure that it's not just 20% less genetically.

528
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,520
Correct. It should be the same. You know, these areas are the same. I have patients that come in

529
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,480
and they get measured and they are the same. All of the areas measure A-OK. Now a lot of those

530
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,960
patients are, you know, really teenage years maybe, or women who have hair loss problems,

531
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,640
a different type of, not necessarily a hereditary hair loss problem, some other issue.

532
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,960
Is hair loss sort of like atherosclerosis where, you know, if you lived long enough,

533
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,560
everybody would get atherosclerosis. Is this one of those things where if you, you know,

534
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,000
because sometimes you'll see like, you know, like Ronald Reagan, even at the end of his age,

535
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,440
he looked like he had this thick mane of hair. If you did that high fidelity testing on him,

536
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,000
would you suspect you would have detected differences? I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure that,

537
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,640
I'm sure that it's not the same. If someone figured out a way for people to live to be 500,

538
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,440
everyone's eventually going to lose their hair if they don't take some. I think so. I mean, you know,

539
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,960
there are a few exceptions. I have a friend of mine from New York. He's in the music business

540
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,440
and, you know, he's on the admin side, the managerial side. And man, he's got the hairline

541
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,560
that he had when he was a teenager. It literally goes straight across his head and it has not

542
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,520
budged. It has not moved and has not, I don't know what the exact density is. He doesn't let

543
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,680
his hair grow out. It's basically kind of like a buzz cut, but you can see that hairline straight

544
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,840
across. Now he, now I've come across tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people in

545
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,680
my life so far and I've never seen anybody else like him. So I don't know if it's 100% true,

546
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,360
but I would guess that it is something like that where over time you will see some kind of thinning.

547
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:46,200
So what are these risk reduction techniques that, or what do you recommend to patients in that

548
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,800
situation? Well, of course, in those early stages for men, sometimes the first visit to the doctor

549
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,800
is their visit to the hair doctor, honestly. And there may not be any other medical conditions

550
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,080
that we can necessarily pick up at that time that require, you know, drastic intervention.

551
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,520
But if we switch gears for a moment and look at a little bit of an older age category,

552
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,360
either male or female, when they start being on at the age where they're taking medications for

553
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:16,360
blood pressure or cholesterol, or they're on some mood modulators, those are some top, those are

554
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,360
like the top three types of medications that can really impact hair quality.

555
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,920
I didn't realize that. And is it always negative? I'm assuming.

556
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,400
Yeah, for sure.

557
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,080
So what were they again? So blood pressure.

558
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,000
So blood, yeah, antihypertensives.

559
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,680
Anti lipid.

560
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,760
Right. Cholesterol modulating medigates.

561
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,760
And is there a particular type, is it SSRIs or is there a particular type of,

562
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,600
you were a little vague in your description of that.

563
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,840
Yeah, I would say it's just in general, anything that decreases the blood that's

564
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,160
being used to decrease the blood pressure. I can't say if it's only SSRIs, but it's a general

565
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,440
rule. If they're on some kind of blood pressure medication, typically they can correlate. If you

566
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,560
ask them a point of questions, you can sometimes see at the time that they started that medication,

567
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
that there is some effect on their hair.

568
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,040
Now, how many of those things are sort of hypotheses you have versus documented facts?

569
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,640
Is that, I guess, I mean, not that I'm in this literature, but I didn't know any of those things

570
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,920
actually. I didn't realize that hair loss was a side effect of those meds.

571
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,840
Well, it's just been so clear. I mean, I've treated about 20,000 patients and many patients say,

572
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,080
you know what? When I started that medication a year ago, fill in the blank, you know,

573
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,480
cholesterol medication, that's when I really started to notice my hair changed.

574
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,840
And when women tell you that their hair has changed, unlike many dermatologists out there,

575
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,480
we believe them very much so.

576
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,080
You're going to upset the dermatologist. Why don't dermatologists believe them?

577
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,840
Well, the general feedback from most of my patients is that they've been around,

578
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,240
unfortunately, they've been around the block to a number of different physicians,

579
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,200
maybe endocrinologists, dermatologists, a primary doctor, family doctor,

580
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,960
whomever, doing all sorts of blood tests, looking for why their hair is thinning.

581
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,520
And no one has ever even looked at their scalp, measured their hair, or talked to them about

582
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,440
potential treatment options. Except maybe on the counter, Rogaine bottle on the way out the door,

583
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,600
hair catch. So a lot of dermatologists have a certain bias where they look at the woman who,

584
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,800
as we've talked about, looks like she's got a full head of hair and say, well,

585
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,280
you're not dying of cancer, so you're okay. And so this is not, I wouldn't say, it's a sweeping

586
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,080
comment that I've made, I wouldn't say it as appropriate for every single dermatologist

587
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,080
out there. And I think that many derms are starting to wake up to the fact that hair loss

588
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,720
is important, something important to treat. And then it can be devastating for many men and women

589
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,760
who are experiencing it. So my heart goes out to them if they've been to a dermatologist or several

590
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,520
and kind of been ushered out the door saying, well, we're here, we're lopping off cancer

591
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,080
growths over here, that's what we do. So you got all your hair, your hair looks fine.

592
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,400
Are there dermatologists in high volume places like New York and Florida that would be doing

593
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,600
what you're doing, which is they're taking a sort of either surgical or non-surgical approach,

594
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,920
but basically doing pure hair restoration. Like it sounds to me like one of the problems in that

595
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,680
scenario is, if you seeing a dermatologist who's mostly interested in skin cancer,

596
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,760
it's like you might as well be asking your radiologist that question, right?

597
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:15,240
Yeah. Well, unfortunately, dermatologists often hold themselves out as experts in skin and hair,

598
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,400
but yet they have little ability to diagnose the hair loss process. They have no interest in

599
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,040
measuring or monitoring or prescribing even a treatment regimen and keeping a patient compliant

600
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,520
with it. So it's just kind of like a doorknob conversation for them and they don't have the

601
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,160
time to do it, honestly. I mean, a good strong hair loss consult in my office takes at least an hour,

602
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,640
typically. Patients usually spend about an hour and a half in my office when they come in for

603
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,120
a consultation. You're not going to spend an hour and a half with your local derm, certainly.

604
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,720
You know, they're going to do a quick exam, you know, look for some funky mole and then

605
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,560
kind of send you on your way. So they don't have an hour to spend with you. So I think it's

606
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,600
part of it is that those practices are just not simply set up to treat hair loss.

607
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:03,560
So I mean, the takeaway is, I guess, if you go to see a doctor about a concern you have on hair loss,

608
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,480
find a specialist. Find someone who's going to do a bunch of measurements. You want to make as many

609
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,320
objective measurements as possible. Absolutely. Well, find somebody who does it full time.

610
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,760
That's their area of expertise and specialty. And yes, who has those tools at their disposal to

611
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,680
measure and monitor and figure out what's going on or whether it's genetic testing to look at

612
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,760
androgen sensitivity and that postmenopausal women. I mean, a lot of derms don't just don't

613
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,640
have access to some of that stuff. And what, so what were the tests again,

614
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,360
you do a test of tensile strength, you do density and then you, what sounded really interesting was

615
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,200
the comparison density test, right? Where you do density in a region where there's never going to

616
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,440
be hair loss, make that your control and then look at the crown. Yeah. Crown or frontal and

617
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,200
temporal areas or anywhere really that the thing is occurring. You know, you have to look at the

618
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,040
scalp and you have to see is the skin tone normal. And you know, we've spent a lot of time talking

619
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,960
about hereditary hair loss, but there are many other types of hair loss. So if you're figuring

620
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,000
out what's going on in each of these different areas, you know, requires someone to look at the

621
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,680
scalp and see what's happening. How many times do you look at the scalp and you see something

622
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,880
completely unrelated, like, you know, a fungal infection that can completely be treated and

623
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,320
ameliorate the whole situation? Quite often actually. And one of the things that we've

624
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,840
learned, I say I've learned over the past, maybe five to seven years is the impact on scalp health

625
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,040
to hair growth. And you know, we had kind of an inkling that maybe this was important,

626
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,640
but there is some good data out there, journal articles and such that talk about,

627
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,480
especially coming out of like the dandruff, if you will, treatment protocols of zinc,

628
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,680
pure thione zinc and some other treatment protocols for Malthy's the yeast overgrowth

629
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,760
that you get in the scalp that show that if the inflammation and the overactivity of those

630
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,520
populations are out of control, then you can get a detrimental effect on hair growth.

631
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,320
So we know that today, that's that scalp health is important so that the soil in the forest needs

632
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,560
to kind of be fertile. And if it's really inflamed or there's inflammation, you know,

633
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,800
if there's inflammation going on, that can definitely shut down the follicle and impair

634
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,920
hair growth. So that's important to look at that. If somebody has dandruff, do we have a sense of how

635
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,080
much that's increasing their risk of hair loss? So dandruff is kind of a nonspecific symptom,

636
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:14,520
right? So flakes, right? But flakes could be thick and yellow, they can be small and white.

637
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:21,560
Your scalp could be oily and dandruffy, they could be dry and flaky. So, you know, that's a

638
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,280
whole other deep discussion on trichology, which is the study of the chemistry of the scalp,

639
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:32,280
essentially, where we look at scalp pH levels, moisture levels, sebum levels, and really try

640
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,280
to assess what's the right protocol of scalp care, just like you would do that. An esthetician might

641
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,000
do that for your face, for your skin of your face. Well, we want to treat the scalp in that same kind

642
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,560
of way, figure out, well, what's the right protocol? How often should you shampoo? What's

643
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,440
the right shampoo for you? And that's not sometimes a simple question to answer, especially if you

644
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,640
ever, well, maybe for you it is. But if you walk down the shampoo aisle in any supermarket, you

645
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,000
see that there's thousands of choices, right? So there's got to be some confusion there.

646
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,920
Yeah. Do you have any takeaways on what people should be doing? Are there any do's and don'ts

647
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,800
with shampoos and conditioners? So I think the best thing, well, of course, the do's and don'ts. So

648
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,480
shampoos and conditioners, if you have any length of hair, you should always follow your shampoo

649
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,680
with a conditioner. Shampoo is like a degreasing, essentially. It's a cleanser. And if you shampoo

650
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,480
in a harsh way or with a strong surfactant, let's call it, then you're going to strip out a lot of

651
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,000
the natural oils of the scalp and also of the hair and a conditioner replaces those natural

652
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,160
moisturization of the hair. So it's kind of important to do both of those things.

653
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,080
But there's a huge spectrum of different types of shampoos. First of all, shampoo is not going to

654
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,640
cure your hair loss. So when you asked circling back about some snake oil type treatments,

655
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:47,240
there's no one shampoo that's going to fix your hair loss situation. But again, you have to

656
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,600
understand if we can rectify some imbalance at the level of the scalp and reduce inflammation or

657
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,880
tackle a fungal overgrowth, and we're going to start to improve some things. And if we have some

658
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,200
ingredients that maybe we want to apply in the shower while the scalp is kind of steamed, if you

659
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:08,360
will, you know, sometimes that's the right time to do it. But I guess the point is that finding

660
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:14,680
the right shampoo and conditioner regimen for you has to do with some of the variables that I just

661
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,480
mentioned, the scalp pH level, moisture level, oil level, what's your natural sebum production?

662
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,440
What does your hair care regimen look like? Does it require a lot of product or hairspray or things

663
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,200
like that that need to be rinsed and washed out? Are you in a dirty environment? Do you live in the

664
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,200
city where there's smoke and toxins and things like that, you know, and debris that you need to

665
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,680
wash out of your hair on a regular basis? So how does somebody, I mean, given that I don't think

666
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,520
about this problem, how does somebody who does think about this problem find out? I mean, is

667
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:47,000
this something where you can go to a website where there's like a, you know, if you fit these

668
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,640
criteria, this is the shampoo conditioner combo you should use? Well, there are just some general

669
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,160
guidelines, right? So if your hair is kind of long and curly, for example, let's call it even kinky

670
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,240
or afro type hair, then you need like durable conditioning. You need conditioners that kind

671
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,400
of stick around for a while. If your hair is on the other end of the spectrum, let's just call it

672
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,800
like thin and kind of limp, then you need very, very light conditioners and you want to make sure

673
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,440
you're using shampoo that strips out a lot of that oil so that you get some weightlessness to

674
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,720
the hair in order to style it. So there's, there's some general guidelines. I remember when my

675
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,720
daughter was little and I would give her a bath. I don't know what this might've been just a total

676
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,760
wives tale, but I remember that I was told shampoo is more important in the scalp conditioner,

677
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,720
more important. So you would start the shampoo at the head and work out to the ends. And then when

678
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,240
I would put the conditioner in her hair, I would start at the ends and work up. Is that total

679
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,720
nonsense? No, it makes some sense because the ends of the hair are the ones that are typically the

680
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,440
driest. It's, it's been around the longest. The hair doesn't self-repair. It's a keratin fiber,

681
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,040
right, that your body has produced. It's not alive. So when the fiber is long, it means it's

682
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,040
been around a long time. And so the tips of the hair is the part where you're going to see a

683
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,880
fraying of the hair, right? It's the part that looks the driest. It was the part that's been,

684
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,720
had the most exposure to UV radiation and everything else, a heat, or if you've done

685
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,640
a Brazilian blowout or some other straightening treatment or curling treatment or coloring

686
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,560
treatment, the part that's received the most amount of abuse is the tips. And so the tips of the hair

687
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,840
are typically the ones that look the unhealthiest and feel the unhealthiest. They may be rough. The

688
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,880
cuticles starting to peel up. The ends are starting to split and fray. And if that continues,

689
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,680
obviously, then that's, then it could lead to hair breakage, which can actually is a very common

690
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,320
problem for hair loss in women or trigger of hair loss in women. The hair breakage,

691
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,720
literally that they've, they've stressed out the fiber so much that the fibers are actually

692
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,120
breaking. And we see that with harsh chemical treatments time and time again, or the new

693
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:49,640
trends for flat ironing and such, you know, where you put the hot ceramic flat iron again and again

694
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,320
and again and again and again on your hair to straighten it, to straighten out the curl.

695
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,320
And so that application of heat and or other products can degrade the hair fiber. So you

696
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,280
should condition that hair itself rather than the scalp. But don't forget that sometimes the

697
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,560
scalp needs a little love too. And we have a bunch of different types of products that are for

698
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:13,480
exfoliation and for moisturization and inflammatory is and things like that. I mean, obviously,

699
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,520
if you have a severe psoriasis issue, we need to get those flakes out of there. We need to treat

700
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,800
that psoriasis, you know, that's a bigger bit of business than just trying to like, well,

701
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,320
what kind of shampoo should I buy at the supermarket? Right. So once we get to treatment,

702
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,200
when I think about this, I kind of create four buckets. So I don't know if this is right or wrong,

703
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,360
but you know, we've talked a little bit about systemic treatments. So something that you take

704
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,640
like a pill where it's going to act, you know, across your whole body, but you reap some benefit

705
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,760
in the hair follicle. And then we've talked a little bit about topical as well, like, you know,

706
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,720
minoxidil. I don't know if we would consider laser also topical, but maybe that could be

707
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,760
considered something topical. Well, let's talk about, for example, putting oral and topical

708
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,000
medications or pharmaceuticals in one bucket. And then let's talk about non-chemical therapies

709
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,280
in another. Okay. So our non-chemical therapies would be laser and or PRP. And so a lot of times

710
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,760
during a consultation process, we're looking to try to institute something that's going to help

711
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,000
someone's hair loss issue. And they may say, you know what, I just don't want the risk of side

712
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,320
effects of this drug. I don't want to apply this medication into my body. And I can certainly

713
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,560
understand that they may want to try something that's non-chemical, whether it's a real or

714
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,040
perceived value of less side effects. Laser has no side effects, for example.

715
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:37,160
I see. So you think of laser PRP topical as maybe something you would try even before you go

716
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,240
systemic. I mean, for a patient who wants to be stepwise, obviously you could do them together.

717
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,320
Well, for men and for women, it's going to be different. So for men, we talked about the fact

718
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,160
that finasteride knocks out the DHT level. And that's the primary treatment. It's a strong

719
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,720
treatment, 90% success rate, very low incidence of side effects. So for men, we're almost always

720
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,960
going to consider that. Correct. We're going to talk about that first. Now they may say, hey,

721
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,040
no way. I don't want to do anything that's going to lower my DHT level. And they may have heard or

722
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,160
read about side effects. Or they have side effects. They may have side effects. So there's ways to get

723
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:10,200
around side effects, changing timing of the dose, frequency of the dose, the amount of the dose,

724
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,360
moving that finasteride from an oral treatment to a topical with a prescription product, like

725
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,840
82F is a way to get around that. So that would be for men. Let's try to at least address the DHT

726
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,000
issue first. And if we're not going to go that route, then let's choose from the other tools in

727
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,760
the toolbox. Now for women, because DHT is not the issue most women are of childbearing age,

728
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,760
we're not even thinking about finasteride for them. We're going to be looking at laser light

729
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,120
topicals as kind of the first types of therapies and maybe PRP. So talk to me about why does laser

730
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,480
work? Why does it work? Or how does it work? Laser works by imparting energy to the follicle. So

731
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,000
we know now photobio modulation is a very serious science. Dr. Michael Hamblin did much of the

732
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,760
lion's share of the research at Wellman Center for Photomedicine here in Mass General in Harvard.

733
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,200
He described, and this is going back now almost 15 years or more, the mechanism of action of low

734
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,640
level laser therapy. How and where the photons of light in specific wavelengths are accepted at the

735
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,600
level of the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial membrane at the cytochrome C oxidase.

736
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,000
And what you get is a hyperpolarization of that mitochondrial membrane. And if you remember back

737
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,800
from basic science that those ions flowing back and forth into and out of the mitochondria is

738
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,680
really what generates ATP for kind of a simple way to think about it. ATP is the energy center

739
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,000
within the cell. And if you can charge up those energy centers, if you can make those mitochondria

740
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,960
kind of fire up and produce a lot of fuel, you end up getting a better, stronger, healthier hair

741
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:41,400
growth. Do we know that in people who are losing their hair, there's a deficiency in ATP production

742
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,400
at the follicle? Or is this something that we're doing to override whatever it is that's

743
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,680
potentially causing the issue? We're trying to override it. And it's the same thing with

744
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,920
minoxidil. When you apply a topical medication like minoxidil, you know that it has nothing to

745
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,640
do with the DHT, but you're basically pushing that gas pedal all the way down to the floor,

746
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,840
trying to push that follicle into the best possible growth. What is the mechanism? I forgot.

747
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,440
It's so funny. I've never seen a patient take minoxidil for blood pressure. And yet I sort

748
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,520
of remember studying this on USMLE part one. What is the actual mechanism?

749
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,200
Yeah, it's a potassium channel opener.

750
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,640
Okay. And so what is that doing to the follicle?

751
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,920
So that's a great question and probably beyond my pay grade, but there are some many physicians,

752
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,880
great colleagues of mine in the UK who have kind of figured all of that out and I can provide that

753
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,360
research for you. But essentially what minoxidil does is it keeps the follicle in the growing

754
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,760
phase. So remember we talked about the antigen, which is the growing phase. And then of course,

755
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,240
the catechintelegin, those are the resting degeneration phases of the hair follicle.

756
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,320
And we know that in a certain area of scalp, there's going to be about 84, 85% of the hairs

757
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,000
in a healthy area, 84, 85% of the hairs are in a growing phase. But as you get to a male pattern

758
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,040
hair loss or female pattern hair loss situation, many, many more follicles are in a resting phase

759
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:05,480
than in a growing phase before those ratios change and the hairs spend less time in a growing phase.

760
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,440
So the antigen phase starts to shorten. So that's one of the reasons why if you have someone with

761
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,520
thinning hair, whether it be male pattern hair loss in the hairline or female pattern hair loss,

762
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,240
let's say in the frontal zone right behind the hairline, typically you can make a part with your

763
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:27,320
comb and you can see these very, very short kind of spiky hairs. That is indicative of miniaturization.

764
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,080
And if you look at the microscopic level, you'll see even shorter, thinner,

765
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:37,880
weaker, wispier hairs than that. So what happens is that when you put somebody on minoxidil,

766
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,680
resting follicles start to kick into action and grow. So you're going to start to produce more

767
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:49,000
fiber. So fewer spikes, more of the long guys, right? And the guys who are already growing that

768
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,200
may want to turn off too soon are kept in the growing phase. So those, the antigen is going to

769
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:59,960
be delayed, meaning that the antigen is going to keep going. And we also know that the longer you

770
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:07,000
keep a follicle in antigen, the thicker the fiber becomes over time. So there's literally fewer

771
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,480
exits at the cellular level in the matrix at the base of the follicle near the dermal papilla.

772
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:17,240
The cellular material continues to aggregate in that area and almost like swell, essentially,

773
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,560
as long as you keep it in the antigen phase, you actually get a thicker hair follicle over time

774
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,200
and a thicker fiber as a result of that. So your question was, how does minoxidil work? It

775
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,600
decreases the amount of follicles that are in that resting phase, keep them in the growing phase.

776
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,680
And so you're going to get better, thicker, stronger, healthier hair from those follicles

777
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,840
that could be rejuvenated, that are not too far gone. Yeah. Okay. That was the next question I

778
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,680
was going to ask you. Thank you. So let's go back to something you alluded to earlier, which is

779
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,480
most physicians, this is one thing I know about hair loss. Most physicians I've spoken with

780
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,200
have said what you said earlier, which is you don't want to buy minoxidil off the shelf,

781
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,960
you should have it compounded. Correct. What? I didn't realize that there was foams and I didn't

782
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,440
know what the exact issues were. So that's obviously one issue you're trying to overcome

783
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,920
is create a different viscosity that makes it easier to reach the scalp. But what are the other

784
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,200
agents that they typically add to minoxidil to make it more efficacious? So Tretinoin, Retin-A,

785
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,840
is excellent to be mixed with minoxidil. Wait, doesn't, wouldn't that also aggravate the

786
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,200
scalp? Usually not. If the percentage is 0.025% that we're working with, you're not going to get

787
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,080
an aggravation, but there's a lot of good clinical data that shows that the combination of minoxidil

788
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:35,560
plus Tretinoin improves the hair growth. So there's some basic science that describes the

789
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,280
increased penetration. And then there's also on the results and increased hair density and hair

790
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:46,600
growth that you get from combining minoxidil and Retin-A. In, for example, the formula 82M product,

791
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:53,240
which is our most powerful, most popular treatment, most easily compliant version of minoxidil,

792
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,800
it's a prescription compound, obviously, you're going to have also a tiny little bit of flucinolone

793
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,080
in there. So it's a little anti-inflammatory. What is it? I'm not familiar with that.

794
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:06,920
It's a steroid anti-inflammatory. Oh yeah, that's one that you would put on your skin if you've had

795
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,920
like a rash or something like that. Yeah, it's very common in the dermatological world. There's

796
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:17,560
basically a whiff of that in the 82M formula. So even, you know, inflammation is such a big

797
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,040
topic on this podcast. It comes up in every disease. Interesting. I would not have thought

798
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,520
it was going to come up in hair loss. So I was part of a study in the University of Miami where

799
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,400
they looked at the microinflammation at the level of the hair follicle. We donated a number of

800
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,160
follicles from hair transplant patients from donor zones and recipient zones and such. And what they

801
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:42,680
determined is that there is an inflammasome, which is this mediator of inflammation that was

802
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,720
discovered and elucidated through some of that research. So there is microinflammation. It's very

803
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,960
well known male pattern, female pattern hair loss. There is a lot of microinflammation at the level

804
01:05:51,960 --> 01:06:00,120
of the follicle. So we think that maybe not only could the flucinolone that's in the 82M be making

805
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:05,880
it more tolerable to the scalp, certainly people can have dermatitis from just about anything,

806
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,800
you know, you can put a piece of scotch tape on your head and have dermatitis from it. So maybe

807
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:14,600
it's keeping the scalp a little bit healthier in that way, but also addressing that microinflammation

808
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,720
right at the level of the follicle and shutting that down a bit. And that also helps us out in

809
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,400
understanding that there's some microinflammation also helps us understand some of the more

810
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,960
nutraceutical ingredients that we see. It also helps us understand maybe how some of our

811
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:33,240
sophisticated PRP creation techniques may improve hair follicle function. Once you understand that

812
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,400
there's some bit of inflammation going on, it kind of opens the door to some other modalities

813
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:45,720
of treatment. So we've established that for most guys, a combination of 5-alpha reductase inhibition

814
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:53,080
plus this type of a compounded topical minoxidil plus or minus the laser to hit. And it's so funny.

815
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,880
I'm totally familiar with that technology for some of the experimental use that's going on with

816
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,680
Alzheimer's disease for the exact same reason. It's hitting cytochrome C oxidase. By the way,

817
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:08,200
they're also using methylene blue, which is a cytochrome C oxidase activator as well. But I'm

818
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,840
guessing putting minoxidil methylene blue on the scalp isn't going to be a great idea because

819
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,560
every time you apply it, you'll have to spend an hour washing your skin to get the blue off.

820
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,040
Yeah. I don't know how that would work so well.

821
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
So that sounds like a pretty interesting regimen.

822
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,280
Unless you're coming here to Vegas to be part of the Blue Man Group.

823
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,600
Yeah. I saw a woman in the airport today that had that going on. So she would be fine,

824
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,640
but she looked like she had great hair. So I don't think she needs it. For women,

825
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,960
you've got those two options, which is the same compounded minoxidil. You don't have to make a

826
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,120
different formulation for women. We do not make a different formulation. AD2M works very, very well

827
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,120
in our female patients. Plus the laser.

828
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:49,880
Yes. They may use the laser. Plus or minus, they may or may not use low-level laser therapy.

829
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,040
One of the good things about the AD2M product, just for the women specifically, is that it has

830
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:58,200
a little bit of a skin conditioner and a hair conditioner in it. One of the main complaints

831
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,760
with over-the-counter Rogaine is that it just makes the hair nasty. It just makes it greasy

832
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,120
and gooey and basically unmanageable and styleable. And so the AD2M product goes on very, very clean

833
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,160
and dry. And we teach also how to apply it so that it's most active effect at the level of the

834
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,920
scalp and you really don't get it on your hair.

835
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,600
I've never really understood that. How do you apply it to... I mean, if someone's in the early

836
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,400
stages of hair loss or if it's a woman who barely has hair loss, how do you actually get it on the

837
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,080
scalp? Yeah. And it's a tricky bit of business. And if you're using a Rogaine foam version,

838
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,080
then forget about it. Most of it is not getting on the scalp. And that's part of the reason why

839
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,880
a foam is not necessarily such a great option for women. But what we do is we teach how to

840
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,880
part the hair. The bottle that the AD2M comes in has an applicator tip. So you actually put the

841
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,560
tip of the bottle directly onto the scalp when you apply it. So you're kind of parting the hair

842
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,920
and you're directing the application directly onto the scalp. So it may sound complicated,

843
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,680
but literally once you know how to do it, it takes you 90 seconds twice a day every day.

844
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,840
And that's the other piece of the puzzle. Most people who buy minoxidil over the counter

845
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,640
think that once a day is going to do the job. And that very, very rarely has any substantial

846
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,800
effect on hair growth whatsoever. And what is the requirement of the laser? How often

847
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,280
does that need to be done? So that depends on the type of laser that you have because the laser

848
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:23,480
energy that comes out of these different devices could be intermittent, meaning that there's a duty

849
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,440
cycle to the laser, right? How much time the laser spends on or off during any given minute

850
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,680
of therapy. And also how the lasers are kind of designed into the device to shine onto the scalp.

851
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,520
Is it something where it's a spot treatment that you have to move around? Like years ago,

852
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,080
we had the laser comb and you had to like move it all the way around your head every five seconds.

853
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:50,360
Pretty laborious. Today, the laser cap or cap therapy devices just sit on your scalp like a

854
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:55,240
baseball hat and the battery pack clips to your belt or sticks in your pocket and you could be

855
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,120
done in as little as six minutes. And you do that once a day or twice a day. So that would be, well,

856
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:04,920
different devices have different recommendations. So let's just start with the best of the best.

857
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,680
The capillis RX is really the top device. It's a physician only device. It has 312 diodes,

858
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,040
which is a lot. When you say physician only meaning you have to be in the physician's office

859
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,760
to use it. No, it's only prescribed and dispensed by physicians. Oh, I got it. You're not going to

860
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,360
get it like over the counter. You're not going to get it. You can't buy it on Amazon or Costco.

861
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,560
I mean, unless it's through the pharmacy or something. Not the 312. The RX device.

862
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,360
How much does one of these things cost? So the RX is $3,500.

863
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,800
Wow. But what do you say? Wow. I don't know. I guess I just think it's a lot of money.

864
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,760
Well, actually laser therapy is your least expensive treatment over time.

865
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,520
I guess because there's one cost and that's it. Correct. They last for 10 to 15 years. I have

866
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,600
many patients using the same laser caps that they did from 10 years or 15 years ago. All they've

867
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,640
done is swapped out about it. Yeah, when you put it that way, it's a buck a day.

868
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,040
Yeah. And no side effects, non-chemical. It's a great investment.

869
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,560
So let's talk about PRP. You alluded to it.

870
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,840
You did ask me how often you would do it. So the capillos or X is six minutes a day,

871
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,320
but there are other devices like the laser cap, which was 20 minutes every other day.

872
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,600
Got it. But it sounds like you can be doing something else.

873
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,040
The harder thing seems to me like the minoxidil because you have to apply it twice a day.

874
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,160
Yes. So sometimes, for example, we busy college students, kids just starting a job,

875
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,680
so forth. They may have difficulty applying something to their scalp twice a day. They're

876
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,920
living in the dorms and whatnot that may be difficult. So we may do something more like

877
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,160
laser or PRP for them. It might be easier for them to be compliant with that.

878
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,760
Although it sounds like it's harder to walk around with a laser cap in a dorm room than...

879
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,800
No, because it's covered by a baseball cap. Oh, literally a baseball cap.

880
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,080
Literally, it fits underneath a baseball cap. Geez.

881
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,880
Wow. Okay. I can't wait to link to a picture of one of this.

882
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,800
See? So, later on when we go down to the expo, you'll have a chance to see...

883
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,280
I'll stick it under my hat. Okay. You alluded to PRP. Now,

884
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,960
in say the world of orthopedics where PRP is used quite often,

885
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:05,640
I think the jury's still out on the efficacy. I think most orthopedic surgeons I speak with

886
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:12,200
believe there probably is some efficacy to PRP, though it obviously seems to be dependent on

887
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:18,200
two things. The technique used to basically create the formulation and the clinical judgment and

888
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,160
when and... Patient selection, basically, for lack of a better word.

889
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,560
For sure. Because think about it. If we relate it to the hair follicle for a moment,

890
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,920
if the follicle is dead and gone and you're hoping that your laser minoxidil PRP regimen

891
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,720
is going to do the job, what do you think that success rate's going to be?

892
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,360
Probably not pretty good. So, you can't come into a baldness clinic with total hair loss and think

893
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,120
that a PRP is going to solve the problem. It's not going to work. And so, I would imagine

894
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,440
orthopedics is pretty much the same. If you have someone who needs surgery because there's some

895
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:53,400
severe depletion of whatever, I don't know, it's cartilage or something else that's not going to be

896
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,200
gently fixed by a little bit of regenerative medicine, they're going to need surgery for that.

897
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,400
And PRP may not necessarily solve that issue. So, I think patient selection is a big

898
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:08,200
concern and as it is in hair loss and many other worlds of medicine.

899
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,400
So, I mean, you've sort of alluded to it, which is there's probably a sweet spot, right? Where

900
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:19,400
someone who's not experiencing any loss but is trying to be prophylactic, that's way too early,

901
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:24,200
and someone who's already experienced the death of the follicle, you're basically wasting time

902
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,160
and money. Correct. So, well, you're not wasting time and money if you have ongoing progressive

903
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:34,920
hair loss, right? But you may not reach your goal with PRP, but it may help mitigate future loss,

904
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,440
just like the use of minoxidilin laser is not going to bring back that receding hairline,

905
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,720
but it's going to keep it from receding further or faster.

906
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,840
Fair point. Yeah.

907
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,320
So, combination therapy, there's, again, thinking about what we do in practice every single day in

908
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:55,800
my office is part of the process is to prevent loss of the follicle function and enhance whatever

909
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,640
follicles you have. And then the other piece of the puzzle is to restore density to those areas

910
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:08,040
which are too far gone. So, PRP has a role in that, right? A PRP has a role in preventing

911
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:12,600
the loss of that follicle function. It enhances those follicles that are weak,

912
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:19,720
kind of like what minoxidil or laser might do for up to a point, right? And we would need to use

913
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,760
that over time. So, tell the folks listening how PRP works. I realize I'm sort of taking it for

914
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,760
granted that people know what PRP stands for, what it is, how you harvest. Can you spend a

915
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,240
minute just explaining if someone comes into your office and you decide that they're a good

916
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:38,280
candidate for PRP, tell me what the process is. So, PRP stands for platelet-rich plasma.

917
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,680
And platelet-rich plasma is an autologous treatment that means it's derived from your own blood.

918
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,000
So, in the office, we're going to take a sample of your blood and we're going to spin it in a

919
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,760
centrifuge, which essentially separates the formed components in the blood. So, red blood cells were

920
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:58,680
way much more than platelets do, right? Blood cells. And so, when you spin a sample of the blood,

921
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,560
you can then separate the blood components based on their mass, based on their weight.

922
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:09,320
And the reason why we want to do that is that platelets contain very powerful ingredients

923
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,480
called growth factors and cytokines. And their platelets are responsible for not only clotting

924
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:19,080
blood, like we've all learned in grade school, but platelets are responsible for tissue regeneration

925
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,320
and repair. They're like the orchestrators of repair in the body. If you get a paper cut,

926
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,640
platelets come to clot the blood and then they also orchestrate the repair of the skin in that area.

927
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,440
They're the first thing that kind of happens. Platelets get activated by that injury. They

928
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:38,440
release these powerful growth factors, which may call into action wound healing cells. It may call

929
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:44,280
into action or recruit stem cells into the area. They may then trigger other functions in the body,

930
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:49,000
like increasing new blood vessel formation and so forth. But what does all this have to do with

931
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,360
hair? So, what we found is that anything that helps out with wound healing tends to have a nice

932
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:01,240
positive effect on hair growth. And so, PRP was started, this dates back maybe, you know, 15 years

933
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:07,000
ago, PRP into the scalp, at least in our clinic, we were using it as a wound healing treatment in

934
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,520
conjunction with hair transplantation. And we, because I'm a born and raised general surgeon,

935
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,120
we know that anytime you want to cut the skin, you want to heal it. And so, hey, by the way,

936
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:21,560
low level laser therapy does that too. But PRP was one of the first indications was for wound

937
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:26,920
healing for chronic ulcers and to accelerate healing in diabetics and so forth. And so,

938
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,320
as a wound healing treatment, PRP works really, really well. And it was around this time,

939
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,360
some of our physicians were also noticing that when they applied PRP for wound healing,

940
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:41,240
they were also reporting some improved hair growth. And at first, I think many of my colleagues

941
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,600
were very skeptical about these early reports, but we were using PRP as wound healing adjunct.

942
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,800
I figured if we can get our patients healed a little bit more quickly, that would be a good

943
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:54,040
thing, less downtime, we'd get them back into their regular team more quickly after a hair

944
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,000
transplant, but we were noticing it as well. We were seeing this improvement in hair growth.

945
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,360
Let me ask a silly question perhaps. Presumably you were using it on the donor sites,

946
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:08,440
because that's where the incisions are made or were you using it on the like recipient site?

947
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,080
Both.

948
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,920
I see. Because, okay, makes sense.

949
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,680
Yeah, we were using it in both areas. The recipient zones, obviously, the ones that were

950
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:21,160
pretty much more visible at that time in, let's just call it on 2007, 2006, and that's really

951
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:26,200
when we got started with PRP. And our colleagues were also noticing that, as I said before,

952
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,760
that there were some improvements in hair growth. And so, we started to apply it a little bit more

953
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,360
aggressively in some of these patients and applying it into other areas of the scalp that

954
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:40,600
maybe we weren't transplanting. And lo and behold, colleagues and myself included were noticing

955
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,240
that there were some improvements in the thickness and the caliber and the length of

956
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,840
some of these miniaturized hairs.

957
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,320
What size needle do you use to inject it?

958
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,280
So, I use a 27 gauge half inch.

959
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:52,840
Is it painful?

960
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,400
To inject PRP. No, PRP is not painful because we use a complete local anesthetic block.

961
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,160
So, we're going to block the entire area that we're going to treat. People say, well,

962
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,240
of course, once the local anesthetic is in place, you won't feel anything on your scalp.

963
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,600
Obviously, that's how we do a hair transplant. People often say, oh my God, it's so painful.

964
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,400
Even if you put the local anesthetic in, that's going to be painful. No, it's not. We have a

965
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,320
ProNox device. It's a nitrous oxide delivery system. It's on demand. If you want to take

966
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,600
a couple of puffs on the nitrous, usually makes it 100% painless. And to be honest,

967
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,200
nine out of 10 patients say that it was dreamy when they had their treatment done.

968
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,040
So, the outcome should not be painful.

969
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,320
So, that's a good point for people to know.

970
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:29,880
Should not.

971
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:35,320
Yeah. I'm amazed you can get it out of a 27 gauge needle. I thought it would have been

972
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,920
too viscous to come out of that.

973
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,480
No, platelets are tiny. Platelets are super duper tiny. I mean, we can look up the exact

974
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:42,840
measurement, but-

975
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,960
Yeah, I was going to think of it there.

976
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,560
I mean, they're extremely small.

977
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,200
Yeah.

978
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,520
Yeah.

979
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:46,760
It's basically part of plasma.

980
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,760
Platelets are smaller. Yeah, but platelets are cell fragments that are smaller than red blood

981
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,160
cells. So, they're extremely tiny.

982
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:58,360
And just as a directional number, not that you're counting, when someone comes for a

983
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,800
quote unquote standard PRP therapy, how many actual injections do you think they require in

984
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,760
a typical treatment?

985
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,160
So, most patients want to know how many needles are you going to hit me with, Doc?

986
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,800
Yeah, exactly.

987
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,920
So, that's always the question. Of course, as I said, with local anesthetic applied appropriately,

988
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:22,280
applied painlessly, you will feel none of my PRP going in. So, you will feel none of the 700

989
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,560
injections that are required for the PRP.

990
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,800
Well, no, I wasn't asking from a pain standpoint.

991
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:25,960
No, I know.

992
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,240
More from a bleeding standpoint.

993
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:32,200
No, but for your listeners, they need to know that they're not going to feel any of the 700,

994
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,480
very, very tiny injections.

995
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,920
How long does that take you?

996
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,520
It takes only about 10 minutes.

997
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,560
Wait a minute. How can you do 700 injections in 10 minutes?

998
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,520
Well, actually, my nurse practitioner and I tagged team in the scalp, and so we do

999
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,880
half and half. So, but my thumb is pretty strong.

1000
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,000
Wow. Each injection gets how much volume?

1001
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,280
A tenth of a cc. It's pretty quick, to be honest. I mean, the whole treatment procedure in the

1002
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:58,200
office is about an hour, start to finish. And most of that is honestly the preparation time

1003
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,720
of the PRP.

1004
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,720
I have patients who are being treated in New York, so they're not patients that you take

1005
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:09,720
care of of mine who have had excellent results with PRP. And I know obviously our mutual patients

1006
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:16,440
have as well, and we've talked quite a bit about it. Is it your expectation once you've decided,

1007
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,240
or once, obviously, the persons that they're seeing in New York? I mean, there's lots of

1008
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,840
good people out there. But once you're in the hands of someone who has a really good set of

1009
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,240
patient criteria selection, are you pretty optimistic that PRP is going to move the needle?

1010
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,400
Oh, yeah. I mean, PRP works well.

1011
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,720
How often does one need to be treated that way?

1012
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,240
Well, that's a great question. So, everyone's a little bit different in terms of the power and

1013
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,160
strength of their PRP. Remember, this is not coming out of a bottle, this is coming out of your vein.

1014
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:45,720
So, if you come to my clinic and you have 150,000 platelets per microliter,

1015
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,560
you have a different platelet concentration than somebody has 250,000.

1016
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,120
So, stop your aspirin before you show up.

1017
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,560
Well, it is a smart idea. But remember that if you believe that the aspirin is simply just delaying

1018
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:03,080
the activation of the platelets, I mean, as a surgeon, you know that all bleeding stops. So,

1019
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,760
eventually, the platelets get activated. So, maybe it doesn't matter.

1020
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,400
I'm not so sure that that's such an important, you know, hard rule.

1021
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,240
So, remember how we used to give all those patients a ton of aspirin after splenectomies

1022
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,560
and stuff like that when they were getting the macrocytic, or maybe it was the shape of

1023
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,160
their platelets that was changing. I don't remember if it was the number of the shape, but okay.

1024
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,080
I don't remember. But I'm not so...

1025
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,400
You don't worry too much about that.

1026
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:31,160
I really don't. I really don't. I want to know that I'm getting a good platelet concentrate.

1027
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,720
So, I'll do a CVC at the bedside. I have a Coulter counter in the office,

1028
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,960
unlike most physicians. I have the device as a Beckman Coulter counter.

1029
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:45,160
And we'll do a CVC on the whole blood that comes right out of the vein immediately right there,

1030
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,680
right before we do any kind of spin. After we do our, what's this called,

1031
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:53,240
a proprietary protocol of spinning and separation and concentration of the platelets,

1032
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,960
we'll do a final count on that. We'll use a couple of microliters, not much,

1033
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,200
to get a final platelet count on what exactly we're going to be injecting. So, I can tell you,

1034
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,920
if you come into my clinic, exactly how many platelets we're going to be injecting for you.

1035
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,120
And I think that over the years, having done about 4,000 PRP injections,

1036
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:17,880
I feel like we have a very, very good handle on how platelet count affects the outcome.

1037
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,600
So, we're working on that down right now.

1038
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:26,920
Something as simple as someone shows up with 150,000 versus 400,000, presumably the more that

1039
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,400
they show up with, the better. Yes. And there's some good journal articles that describe the

1040
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,680
effect of platelet concentrate on these biologic processes that we're interested in. So, physiologically,

1041
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:42,440
we know that there's a dose curve. As you increase the concentration of platelets, for example, on

1042
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,440
neovascularization, there is a dose dependent upward curve on that. So, the higher the platelet

1043
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:53,720
concentration, the more neovascularization you're going to get. Now, there's a biphasic dose curve

1044
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:59,240
on stem cell mobilization. So, as you go up on the number of platelet concentrates, there's a kind of

1045
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:04,120
a sweet spot that occurs. And then if you go over that amount, then it starts to dip downwards.

1046
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:09,560
So, what exactly is that concentration in both of those studies that I just said,

1047
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,640
what is that concentration supposed to be? And according to that data, it says somewhere between

1048
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:21,800
1.4, 1.5 million platelets per microliter is where that sweet spot exists. And what we're

1049
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:27,800
trying to show in the office is that that correlates also at the bedside to the clinical response.

1050
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,800
And I mean, I assume you're gathering those data. You've done 4,000 of these,

1051
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,040
so you have your own prospective series? Yes. So, what I can tell you is that I think that there's

1052
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:40,920
a strong correlation between the amount of platelets that you come to the table with and the amount

1053
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,640
that we can concentrate. So, obviously, we have to maybe make some adjustments in our protocol

1054
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,280
if you are kind of low on platelets. But again, there's some other things that we may not

1055
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,800
necessarily be taking into account. Everybody has a different size and shape of platelets.

1056
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,840
Let's say your platelets are low, but they're very big. We don't know what exactly do those

1057
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:04,600
platelets contain. But again, there's some data in the clinical literature where we can correlate

1058
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,920
growth factor concentrations with platelet counts pretty well.

1059
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,960
This sounds to me like it's something that's still in its infancy where...

1060
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,520
Absolutely.

1061
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:17,320
I mean, that sounds like the crudest of all metrics, and it's probably an oversimplification

1062
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:23,480
for what's really going on. And hopefully in 10 years, you have a different assay than just

1063
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:28,360
something as blunt as the CBC, right? You can measure some cytokine or you can measure some

1064
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,520
other functional property of the platelet that probably matters a heck of a lot more than the

1065
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:37,560
number. Right. I mean, look, eventually, maybe there'll be a bedside PCR where we can figure

1066
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,440
out exactly what exactly those growth factors are that are doing their job inside. But the other

1067
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:47,080
thing that I've learned over the years of doing those thousands and thousands of PRP treatments

1068
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:52,920
for nearly 10 years is the importance of the white blood cells. So the monocytes are a very,

1069
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,000
very important component. I think they're underappreciated in not only in the literature in

1070
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,240
terms of what they do in the body, but especially in PRP. And I'm a very strong proponent of the

1071
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:10,040
importance of monocytes in the final PRP. And we say that our PRP is monocyte rich,

1072
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,960
and I don't think that that's really a term that's caught on yet, but I think that it will.

1073
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,560
And monocyte rich PRP might- Wait, so you can, obviously, it's easy to pull the platelets out,

1074
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:26,040
but when you're looking at leukocytes versus monocytes versus eosinophils, you have a sensitive

1075
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:31,000
enough centrifuge to get that banned? So the way that we've been able to do that is through a dual

1076
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:38,040
spin process. So the dual spin process, for lack of a better way to explain it, the first spin is

1077
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:43,320
kind of a gentle spin to take off the red blood cells. We don't want red blood cells in our PRP.

1078
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,200
Red blood cells in the skin are extremely inflammatory. When those red blood cells

1079
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,320
lyse, the heme is extremely inflammatory and there's a lot of-

1080
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,720
Makes sense. Yeah, the iron would be devastating.

1081
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,240
It's really bad. So we don't want that in the skin if we can avoid it.

1082
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:02,760
So I prefer to have PRP that has less than 1% hematocrit. So the PRP may look pink in the

1083
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,160
syringe, but it's a very, very small amount of red blood cells. Now, of course, when you're trying

1084
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:12,760
to decant the platelets, decant the buffy coat, you're right up against those red blood cells.

1085
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:20,280
So the first spin takes off the layer of red blood cells and leaves us with a plasma,

1086
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,680
which contains the platelets. So the plasma-based spin, which is the second spin,

1087
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,120
then essentially pushes the platelets to the bottom. So we've captured this maximum number

1088
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,840
of platelets. We can take off the platelet pore plasma to as much as we would like,

1089
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,680
leaving us with then a reconstituted amount of whatever we choose, concentration and volume

1090
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,920
of PRP. So that process, that dual spin process, and I haven't found another one that has been

1091
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:56,280
able to duplicate this, consistently removes the red blood cells, consistently gives me a very high

1092
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:01,720
concentrate of platelets, and consistently gives me this bump or boost in monocytes.

1093
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,040
And remind me about how many tubes of blood are you actually drawing out for the full treatment?

1094
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,360
We take 60 cc's on the treatment. Okay.

1095
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:13,960
So 60 cc's concentrates down to about seven and a half cc's of PRP.

1096
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,080
Wow. That's incredible. And how many hours does it take?

1097
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,760
What do you mean? It takes-

1098
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,960
From the time you do that first prick of blood until you're injected-

1099
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,120
It takes just an hour. They're walking out the door in an hour.

1100
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,480
Okay.

1101
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,000
They're out the door in an hour, man.

1102
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,360
I obviously know very little about this specialty.

1103
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,600
Yeah. So when you come in, you'll see.

1104
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:36,120
Let's get to the meat of it, which is the transplant. So how do you think about-

1105
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,840
You don't want to know how long the PRP lasts in my hands?

1106
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,560
Okay, yeah.

1107
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,160
Come on. This is really important because most dermatologists are spinning test tubes.

1108
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:47,160
They're getting all two to three times concentrate. They're not getting seven to eight times

1109
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,200
on the platelets. They're missing all the monocytes. And besides all of that,

1110
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,320
they're booking their patients for every other month or every month treatment.

1111
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,080
So the treatments that I just described to you that we do,

1112
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,200
that proprietary protocol is essentially about once a year. And so people say,

1113
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,400
well, you know, you could claim five years, you could claim six months. How do you know?

1114
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,840
Well, we know because we measure. So we know that 90% of our patients get a positive response from

1115
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,720
the PRP that lasts about 10 to 14 months. And that there's a small percentage of patients,

1116
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:20,280
maybe 5% that need it more often than that. And then I have another small cohort of patients that

1117
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,520
can get away with it almost every two years and that's it.

1118
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,160
And what's the percentage of patients that are not responding?

1119
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,920
Well, everybody responds to some degree. The question is, are they responding where they want?

1120
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,480
So if someone comes in with a receding hairline, they say, hey, doc, I really want PRP here at the

1121
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,280
receding hairline. If they're hoping for some regrowth, chances are that they're not going to

1122
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:43,880
get too much action there because why we talked about that, that there's just less follicles in

1123
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,720
that area. There's not enough trees in the garden, so to speak, when we are plants in the garden,

1124
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:52,040
when we go to fertilize, but the other zones that they didn't even realize we're thinning,

1125
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:57,960
we're going to get a 20 to 50% boost in volume in many of those areas. And that's pretty typical.

1126
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,680
And when they're leaving, obviously you're putting them on the regimen that is medical, topical,

1127
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,720
plus or minus laser.

1128
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,680
Could be any of the above or just one. Many patients are doing monotherapy to start. They

1129
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:12,520
don't want to do two, three, four different things. And then other patients come in and

1130
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,600
they want to do kitchen sink approach. So it varies. It varies on their motivation,

1131
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,600
sometimes the beauty budget, sometimes it's just their time effort and energy involved.

1132
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,480
Their desire and their goals, honestly, some patients come in and they say,

1133
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:29,960
you know what? If I just stayed the same as I am right now, I'm pretty happy the way I am right

1134
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:34,760
now. If I stayed the same, I would be cool. And so we make a plan for that. But then there are

1135
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,240
other patients that say, hey, we want to turn the clock back. And that's where the transplant comes

1136
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:39,560
in.

1137
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:47,560
So is it more often the case that the patient says something to you that makes you say transplant

1138
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:54,520
is really the only option here? Or is that generally the inevitable path for most people

1139
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,200
once they start going down the treatment?

1140
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:00,920
Well, I think we're so clear about what these treatments do that the patients will typically

1141
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,360
say, Hey, you know, in order to accomplish what I want to accomplish, it sounds like we need to

1142
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:10,360
transplant. So very much patient driven process. My patient is our priority. We have a patient

1143
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:14,680
centered practice. So it becomes very, very clear after spending the time with the patient

1144
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,960
for the patient, the patient knows what they're going to need, essentially. So they may say, well,

1145
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,560
hey, you know what? I think I'm probably going to need a hair transplant. It's now is not the right

1146
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,240
time. Maybe it's going to be next year. Let's see what we can get with the non-invasive therapies.

1147
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,080
And I'm cool with that. But if somebody comes in and says, Hey, you know, I really want to fix this

1148
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,800
hairline with PRP and laser. I mean, I have to be honest with them and show them with the microscope

1149
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,280
look, man, we can wish and we can hope and that's okay. But you know, wishing and hoping is not a

1150
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:40,840
strategy.

1151
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:46,120
So let's go back to that first patient that you saw who had gone up to Toronto. Where did they go?

1152
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,640
What was special in Toronto? Having grown up there, I'm curious because I didn't think much

1153
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,560
was special in Toronto. So what was happening?

1154
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,520
Other than the Scholl Dice clinic for hernia repair.

1155
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:55,000
Interesting.

1156
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,880
That's very special.

1157
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:01,320
Yeah, for sure. So things that were happening in the early, I would say the mid 1990s were that

1158
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,440
hair transplant surgeons were learning to use single follicle implants, meaning that instead

1159
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:13,640
of a plug or a punch or four millimeter biopsy of skin, they were cutting down and dissecting or

1160
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:20,520
getting down to literally a one hair follicle graft. And what that enables you to do, if you

1161
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:26,360
angle and orient that appropriately in the right position in the scalp is to create a result that

1162
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:32,520
looks like mother nature made it make it look natural. It's soft. So you can't put them in a row.

1163
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,960
You can't put them perpendicularly in the skin. You have to angle them. But there are ways to work

1164
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:46,600
with single follicle implants to make your end result look 100% undetectable. And that is why

1165
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,960
that gentleman traveled from New York to Toronto, because there was a gentleman up there who was

1166
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:57,160
doing that work and his doctor Seager at the time is the surgeon that was doing that work.

1167
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:02,760
And he's since passed on but he was doing that work with linear harvesting. So that was the old

1168
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:07,880
style strip harvest and using microscopic magnification to dissect the hair follicles

1169
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:13,080
and then implant them in a way that would make the end result look natural. And it seems like,

1170
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:19,480
well, why wasn't everybody doing that? Well, not every surgeon was using microscopes. Not every

1171
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:27,720
surgeon was using tiny grafts. They were using either larger, what they called micro mini grafts,

1172
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,560
let's say, or those punch grafts to create the density.

1173
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,800
Two comments there. The first is, so they were still doing a linear graft, which means that these

1174
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:43,080
patients were having hair taken out with a big scar, presumably in the back of their head.

1175
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:50,680
So that's a comment. And then the question is, how in God's name do you take a strip of hair out

1176
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:56,360
of the back and isolate it by follicle with or without a microscope? I'm just talking purely

1177
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:00,680
from the standpoint of patients. How many years does that take?

1178
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,120
No, no, no, it doesn't take years.

1179
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,480
I mean, I'm being facetious, but I can't fathom-

1180
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:08,520
No, I understand. So there's a lot of labor, right? So my training and my training happened in

1181
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:14,520
the 1990s there. We took linear harvests on patients and we moved two to 3000 grafts in

1182
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,600
a single day for those patients. And I did that early on in my practice as well from a linear

1183
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,720
harvest. And the way that we did it was with labor. We had surgical technicians working

1184
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:31,800
two, three, four, five at a time under backlights or microscope, stereoscopic magnification,

1185
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,720
literally doing the bench work to process that tissue into rest.

1186
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,320
But this is all done sterily.

1187
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:42,520
It's done aseptically. So you can't sterilize the scalp. It's a

1188
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,320
common knowledge. Good news, the scalp is very much immune to severe infection. It's just,

1189
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,920
we're built that way much like the face.

1190
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:55,080
So you said two to 3000 you could harvest in its grafts. And would that be like one strip that

1191
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,480
would be what, how many centimeters long and how wide?

1192
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:03,400
So the single strip could be, depending on the size of the case, could be 10 to 20 centimeters

1193
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:08,680
long and a centimeter wide. So it's going to go from ear to ear, essentially around the back

1194
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:14,360
of your scalp. And unfortunately for many of those patients, they ended up with some wide scars.

1195
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:19,160
Even with techniques like I helped pioneer back with the linear harvesting,

1196
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,400
trichophytic techniques where we would actually overlap the closures to get hair to grow through

1197
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:29,480
the scar. There's still a scar and a scar has not as much hair. It's a little bit smooth. Sometimes

1198
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,720
it has a different type of color than regular skin. So even with short haircuts,

1199
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:40,040
hairs growing through the scar can still be a scar that can be disfiguring. And so I'm sure

1200
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:45,880
you remember in the field of general surgery, there was a paradigm shift from open gallbladders

1201
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:52,360
to laparoscopic. So that was happening in the mid 1990s. So I was very much attuned to changes

1202
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:58,360
in surgical technique and surgical paradigms. And when FUE, follicular unit extraction,

1203
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:02,680
started to become kind of a chatter on the internet, there were some guys in Australia

1204
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:09,160
doing it and a few people here around the US, I wanted to really try to do that procedure and

1205
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:16,280
perfect it. And so that led me down the road to adopt FUE, follicular unit extraction at a very,

1206
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:23,000
very early stage of the game. So I just, so follicular unit extraction is the use of a very,

1207
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,200
very tiny punch. Let's call it about a millimeter. In the early days, we use disposable punches

1208
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,760
that were sharp that were used for punch biopsies, but these were very, very small items, smaller than

1209
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:38,360
the tip of a ballpoint pen typically, to harvest the individual follicular units. So those are the

1210
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:43,640
groups of one, two, or three hairs each out of the scalp. So the graft comes out of the scalp,

1211
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:49,800
basically ready and without a scalpel and without stitches. Now in the early days, it was very

1212
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:56,520
difficult. I designed the first manual hand turned instrument available to physicians to be able to

1213
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,720
do this procedure. It was called the Bauman Mindex. And we were doing these procedures in a very,

1214
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:07,320
very slow way. They weren't very efficient. They weren't very accurate. But what we learned

1215
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:12,680
through many, many years of time on tissue, applying this kind of technique, eventually we

1216
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:19,080
got to a point where it became a viable procedure. And is the harvest scar such that it doesn't even

1217
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,880
require a closure or do you still need a stitch? No, no, it's less than a millimeter. It closes up

1218
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:30,280
50% in 24 hours and the skin is totally clean within another day or two. Really the only thing

1219
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:36,280
that you would see on a shaved scalp is if you had, think of the head of hair like a five o'clock

1220
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:40,760
shadow is that you would see a little bit less shadow in those areas. There's no visible linear

1221
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:47,800
scar. So now you could move a lot of hair and not leave someone with a disfiguring scar in the back

1222
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,200
of their scalp. It gives them much more flexibility in hair styling. Is it safe to say today that

1223
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:57,160
nobody is still doing large scars? Because even if I open up the magazines on the airplanes,

1224
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:03,560
I feel like once it's in the airplane magazine, it's no longer inside baseball. They have the

1225
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,400
picture of the guy standing there. You're looking at two guys from a head behind and there's the

1226
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:12,760
scar and there's the no scar. Is it safe to say no one is having that type of a harvest any longer?

1227
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:18,520
No, it's actually not true at all. Many of the large national clinics that you see on late night

1228
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:26,120
infomercials still do linear harvesting. And many of my colleagues here in the US still prefer to do

1229
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:33,320
a linear harvest than FUE. So I want you to play skeptic, devil's advocate for a moment. Why are

1230
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:37,720
they still doing it? What are they saying is better about that approach than the approach you just

1231
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,760
described of single follicular extraction? Well, you know, probably some surgeons that are kind

1232
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:48,360
of stubborn. Yeah, but I would like to think that in something where aesthetics play such a

1233
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,480
role, it seems like kind of a no brainer. There must be some other explanation other than like,

1234
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:58,680
put it this way, if I'm a patient and I'm going to see somebody who's about to do a huge linear

1235
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:05,080
scar on my scalp and I say to that person, why are you still doing it this way when the pictures

1236
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:09,400
in the airplane magazine say I should not have a scar? They're going to say, oh, well, we get a lot

1237
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:14,840
more hair this way. It's a lot more efficient. I don't have to buy any expensive equipment to do

1238
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,720
this. I don't have to learn any new skills. It seems like it's much less efficient because,

1239
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,920
well, I guess it depends how you define efficiency. You have more hands involved,

1240
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,200
but presumably it can take less time. Is that what they mean by more efficient?

1241
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:33,320
It definitely would take less time. If you're doing a 3000, 4000 graft procedure in your office

1242
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:37,880
with a strip and you have enough staff, that could be much quicker than an FUE procedure for sure.

1243
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,960
So if you had a patient and you were, I don't know if you'd do this, but if you were going to

1244
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,200
dedicate the entire day to that patient, like it was a one, quote unquote, a big case of the day,

1245
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,960
how many follicular units can you harvest and implant?

1246
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,480
So we've done very, very large cases all in a single day, but today we would really prefer to

1247
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:00,840
do anything over 2000 grafts in two consecutive days. We find it a lot more comfortable for the

1248
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:06,520
patient. It's a lot more comfortable in the office for the staff and our harvest rates and our harvest

1249
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:12,120
quality is much, much more improved than trying to do a marathon, you know, into the evening type

1250
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:17,400
of session. So most of our patients, if they're going to do a large maximum, as much as possible

1251
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:23,240
procedure, they're going to get, let's call it around 3500 to 4000 grafts over two days.

1252
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,480
And that's with a wide shave all the way around, provided that they have the hair to do it.

1253
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:31,560
You know, and there are exceptions. I mean, we've done 5000 grafts on some guys and,

1254
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,520
you know, sometimes we try to get 3000 and we just can't even do it.

1255
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:38,520
What is the greatest number of grafts you've implanted on a patient?

1256
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:45,320
And I'll ask it two ways. One, harvesting only from their head and two, harvesting from other

1257
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:50,120
sites on the body, which I'd never even heard of until you mentioned this a couple, maybe six

1258
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:53,080
months ago, we were talking about this and you mentioned that in one of these patients,

1259
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,240
you'd actually harvested something from his beard.

1260
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,640
Oh yeah. We actually do quite a bit of beard harvesting these days. Many of our patients have

1261
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:04,280
old style scar tissue from either procedures that I did back in the early days, you know,

1262
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,920
in the early 2000s when we were still doing half of our work with the linear harvest technique,

1263
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:14,040
you know, and I'm not afraid to correct those cases and to, you know, update those cases into

1264
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:19,560
the latest and greatest possible situation that they could have. So top numbers. Well, you know,

1265
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:24,440
my dad comes to mind, he had almost 8000 grafts. He was totally bald before we started. Most guys

1266
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:29,000
were totally bald at the top, meaning that they only have the hair around the sides and the back.

1267
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Most of them will need somewhere around six to 9000 grafts to kind of fill up the zones.

1268
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,760
And do you have, if someone is that bald, do they have enough donor site on the remainder hair?

1269
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,480
Most of the time, if they've never been harvested, they do. But if they've had some less efficient

1270
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,720
harvesting techniques, then we may have to go to other places, as you say, alternative sources of

1271
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:54,600
donor, like the beard or the body hair to satisfy that. And I've never really thought about it,

1272
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:59,720
but my beard hair, actually it seems about the same thickness as my hair, but I don't know,

1273
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:03,800
is beard hair thicker than hair? Yes, usually it is, but everybody's different. So some people

1274
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,320
have thicker beard hair than their scalp. Some people have thinner beard hair than their scalp.

1275
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:12,040
Some people have curlier, coarser hair on their beard. It seems to be most common. So we're not

1276
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:16,040
going to put your beard at the frontal hairline typically. It's going to be used as filler.

1277
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,360
It's filler in the back. Yeah. And it works really well.

1278
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:24,200
And body hair seems less, much less thick and robust than hair hair. I mean, scalp hair,

1279
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:28,600
right? Again, everybody's different. I mean, if you are a person with very, very thin,

1280
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:33,960
fine hair on your scalp, you may find that the other body hair is a better thicker force or

1281
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,840
caliber. But the problem is, and this is just a general idea, that as you get farther away from

1282
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,480
the scalp, the follicles spend less time in the growing phase. So again, we're going back to this

1283
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:48,440
antigen, categin, telogenation. Sure, sure. The body hair doesn't really grow. I mean, it's...

1284
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:53,800
So it spends less time in antigen, but it also, out of, let's say 10 follicles from the body,

1285
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:58,440
the chest, maybe only five of them are growing at any given time. So it's kind of like hiring

1286
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:03,880
part-time workers in your factory. You've hired 10 people, but only five of them are showing up a

1287
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:07,800
day. That's not so good. So the beard is pretty good there for a male.

1288
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,080
The beard is really good for that. It kind of solves a lot of problems.

1289
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:17,960
Beard is good to fill in the scar too sometimes. Yeah, that makes sense. Now for women, is this...

1290
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:22,680
Yeah, the beard's not going to work. Yeah, no. This strikes me as a much easier problem in women

1291
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:29,480
because you have generally far less volume to cover and far greater ability to cover up donor

1292
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:35,640
sites, right? So women pose different problems than the men. If you want to do a large session

1293
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:40,360
on a man, you can say to most guys, hey, can we give you a pretty short haircut? And they'll be

1294
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:44,760
like, yeah, okay, no problem. I may not love that haircut, but I'll do it. For women, that's not

1295
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:49,080
really going to work. So if you need to move a lot of hair for a female patient, it needs to be done

1296
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,640
in steps and stages. So there's a couple of ways to approach the donor area in women that would be

1297
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:57,320
like shaving a tiny little stripe, so a little horizontal area where we're going to take the

1298
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,840
individual follicles from, right? Because we're not going to cut a strip. We're going to take the

1299
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:06,600
individual follicles that way. Or we may trim a couple of hairs here, let's say one out of every

1300
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:11,400
10 or 20 hairs, and then go after those hair follicles the next day. So there's no shaving

1301
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:16,680
whatsoever. Nice way to handle that. But you know, you'd be surprised how many women have receding

1302
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:21,320
hair lines, like their temples really with female pattern hair loss really go back as they age,

1303
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:27,800
55, 65 years old, they can start to lose that feminine shape to the hairline, you can really

1304
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:33,240
start to move backwards. And that's the most common area that we transplant in women is the

1305
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:38,520
temples, a part of the hairline. A lot of women want to move their hairline. They're not happy

1306
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:42,680
with the size and the shape of their forehead. They want a hairline lowering procedure that

1307
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:48,120
doesn't involve cutting with a scalpel or stitches or a prolonged recovery or risk of

1308
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:55,000
invasive surgery. And it's very easy to do transplantation, to fix a high hairline and

1309
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,400
to bring the hairline down into what DaVinci would call the golden ratio, which is one third,

1310
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:04,840
one third, one third. So what are the biggest risks of this procedure besides the obvious risks

1311
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,360
that we talk about in every surgery, bleeding, infection, et cetera, or is there anything that

1312
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,440
is unique to this surgical procedure as far as a risk? Sure. Well, bleeding, infection, extremely

1313
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,800
rare, thank goodness. Even though we're making thousands of little tiny sites in the scalp,

1314
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:23,080
not only the harvesting and implantation part, bleeding is not an issue. I mean,

1315
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:27,320
just like if you cut yourself shaving or you got a paper cut, you know, in 20, 30 seconds you stop.

1316
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:32,440
Infection, your worst infection typically with a hair transplant might be a pimple,

1317
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,600
to be honest. And maybe most people have one or two and we call it, you know, could be around

1318
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:40,200
the time when the hair start to kick in like an ingrown hair, you kind of have to pop it like a

1319
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:45,000
pimple, release the hair that may be caught at the level of the scalp. And it's pretty rare, maybe like,

1320
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:51,000
you know, one out of every 20 or 30 patients that has more than, you know, a half a dozen pimples or

1321
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,360
something where it needs something more significant in terms of wound care to kind of release those

1322
01:44:56,360 --> 01:45:00,520
hair follicles. Maybe they have curly hair or something like that. But I would say the main

1323
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:07,000
concern for hair is not the physical attributes of the procedure itself because we can recreate

1324
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,600
something with artistic bent, you know, we apply an artistic approach to the shape of the hairline,

1325
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:17,640
the angle, the orientation and position of the hairs, the variation in terms of hair density

1326
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:22,600
to make it look normally natural, not a wall of hair, straight density across the hairline,

1327
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:27,560
the shape that builds into the sides, the temples, the temporal point on the side of the scalp,

1328
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,440
the angle and orientation that's required for recreating a crown area. But really the risk

1329
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:38,520
comes to that you're simply not happy with the result. And so, again, it all comes down to the

1330
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:44,360
consultation process. What exactly are you expecting out of this procedure? And have we gone over

1331
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:49,720
exactly what we believe we can achieve? Because if I tell you you're going to be a 10 out of 10,

1332
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:56,280
and the reality is that it's going to always be a five out of 10, then I've promised you the wrong

1333
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:01,560
thing, and you will be forever unhappy with that. So we have to be very, very clear about what's

1334
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:08,200
possible and what's not. I can't put back a full head of dense hair for you, but I can make you

1335
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:12,840
look like you have a full head of hair. You know, I go back to my dad, for example, total, total

1336
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:18,040
baldness for two decades, wore a hairpiece and all that. The transplants that he has, if you look at

1337
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,160
him today, even 15 years later after his procedures, it looks like he has a full head of hair,

1338
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:28,520
but it's an illusion. It looks like he's got full coverage. You see the frame of his face,

1339
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:33,640
you see that Da Vinci golden ratio. He looks 20 years younger than when he had his procedure,

1340
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:40,280
but he never will have that density that he had as a teenager until we can figure out how to

1341
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:46,520
clone these babies. That makes a lot of sense. And I guess that as your practice continues to grow,

1342
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:52,440
one of the greatest things that each patient is providing as a gift to a subsequent patient is a

1343
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:58,040
before and after photo that gives you a bigger and bigger database to show patients more closely,

1344
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:03,960
I suspect, what they can expect based on where they are because you've got just a greater basis

1345
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:09,160
from which you can say, look, I've got 27 patients who look almost identical to what you looked like.

1346
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:14,280
Here's the range of outcomes. And if you're not comfortable with that range, you're not going to

1347
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:19,800
be a great candidate. Correct. So after 8,000 surgeries, I can tell you with very, very good

1348
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:25,720
confidence what's possible and what's not and what it will take to get there. And if the patient is

1349
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:29,560
all in and he's going to protect the existing hair, we know that that's going to add a lot of

1350
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:34,600
great benefit to the end result. If he's lackadaisical and he's losing other hair while we're

1351
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,160
transplanting this area, other areas are being lost, that's going to be a much tougher battle.

1352
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,600
So it's very much a team approach. And my patients become very much drivers of the bus,

1353
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:48,840
so to speak, because in order to get the best results, there has to be a good amount of buy-in

1354
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,880
and partnership with what we do and what we recommend. I can tell you what kind of therapies

1355
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:57,720
and treatments and such that are going to keep your hair growing strong, but you have to do that

1356
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:02,680
work. When you take a hair off the side of the head or the back of the head in an area as a donor

1357
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:09,000
hair, a hair that was never going to fall out and you put that hair back on the top, is it susceptible

1358
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:17,960
to its nature or its nurture? In other words, is it now susceptible to the DHT forces that took out

1359
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:23,320
the hair that it's replacing or does it bring with it its genetic pattern from its donor site?

1360
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:29,000
So the whole basis of the field of hair transplant surgery is based on the concept of donor dominance.

1361
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:34,200
So that would mean, and again it's the theory, right, of donor dominance, meaning that the hair

1362
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:39,080
follicles from the sides and the back of the scalp, which are virtually immune to the effects of DHT,

1363
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:45,000
most guys with a total baldness problem never ever lose that hair, that it will grow, live and grow

1364
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:53,560
forever in its new location. There are, I would say, very small numbers of scientific reports that

1365
01:48:53,560 --> 01:49:00,680
kind of put a dent into that. So in these few and far between cases, we believe that there is some

1366
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:07,320
recipient area control. And the way that I would explain that to patients is if, remember we said

1367
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:11,960
how long the follicles stay in the growth phase has a lot to do with where those follicles come

1368
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:17,160
from. Well, one of our more prominent researchers and colleagues in the field took a hair follicle

1369
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,640
from one place on his body and put it into another place and then move that follicle someplace else

1370
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:26,520
and track those lengths of time that it spent in the growing phase. It tracked the antigen, the

1371
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:31,080
growth phase. And so what you would expect initially is that wherever you took it from,

1372
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:34,760
like let's say the chest, it grew for an inch and that's it. You put it in the back of your arm,

1373
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,960
it should grow, or back of your hand, it should grow for an inch. Well, it didn't, it grew

1374
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:43,400
differently in those different locations. So there is some local effect. So what we do say,

1375
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:48,120
and especially true for women, where sometimes they can have a more diffuse hair loss problem,

1376
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:52,840
right? Because it's maybe not necessarily all androgen dependent, that we say that those hairs

1377
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:58,120
are relatively permanent. Has anyone ever done the experiment where you take a hair and implant it

1378
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:03,160
in an area that has zero hair, like the palm or? Of course. Yes. In fact, I did that for someone.

1379
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:09,160
Have you ever heard of Nalts from YouTube? No. So Nalts from YouTube is a prankster. I'm sure

1380
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:14,200
he wouldn't be upset with me sharing with you and your listeners that he had some hair follicles

1381
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:20,840
implanted into the palm of his hand during his last hair transplant procedure. And it grew fine.

1382
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:25,960
Wow. So that is, from a, just from a pure biology standpoint, that is really amazing.

1383
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:30,600
No, it's not because listen, the hair follicle is an organ. It's a self-determining organ. If you

1384
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:35,960
have a scar, which doesn't make any hair on its own, you can cut that scar. It's going to bleed,

1385
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:40,600
right? You throw a hair follicle in there, it will survive. It will grow. It will thrive.

1386
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,560
It will demand more blood flow. But there must be something very unique about

1387
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:49,080
parts of our body that don't grow any hair that, I don't know, I guess, I mean, look,

1388
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,760
I don't think about this obviously very much, but it would just, it just strikes me as counter

1389
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:58,200
intuitive. If this were an exam and you asked me that question, I would guess that if you implanted

1390
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,560
the most robust hair into an area that otherwise would never grow hair,

1391
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,760
it wouldn't have the fertile enough soil to promote it.

1392
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:11,160
No, anywhere that you have a blood flow, it will grow because all it needs is energy. It needs the

1393
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:16,840
oxygen. It needs the nutrients, the hair follicle. If you have a non-healing wound on the side of

1394
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:22,440
your leg, a diabetic ulcer, you can implant follicles into that area. And those follicles

1395
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:26,360
are so metabolically active that they will actually secrete the growth factors, demand

1396
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:31,400
more blood flow and vascular neogenesis will occur and wound healing will be accelerated

1397
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,480
and enhanced by placing hair follicles into that non-healing wound.

1398
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,400
That's incredible.

1399
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:41,800
The hair follicle cell population, the population of cells within the hair follicle are among the

1400
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,600
most highest metabolically active cell populations in your body. It's one of the reasons why

1401
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,680
chemotherapy knocks them out as well as the lining of your gut and bone marrow, right?

1402
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:54,840
I mean, if your gut, your bone, your hair, those are some of the most highly metabolic

1403
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:01,320
and metabolically active cell populations that we have. And so they continue to work and grind

1404
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:08,200
away to grow on your head, a full head of hair, right? 150,000 hair follicles will produce

1405
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,240
somewhere around 1500 feet of hair a day.

1406
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:13,800
That's interesting. Did you say how many hairs on the head?

1407
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,040
So you're born with about 100 to 150,000.

1408
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:22,360
And it's amazing that you said you could take someone who is completely bald and through very

1409
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:27,080
strategic placement using only 10,000 hairs say.

1410
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:29,320
No, I said 10,000 grafts.

1411
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,760
A graft could be two to three hairs.

1412
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:31,240
Correct.

1413
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:31,880
Got it. Okay.

1414
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,840
Because, you know, again, we're not going to recapitulate a teenager hairline,

1415
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:41,000
age appropriate matters, right? So the recession of the hairline, that's going to look normal and

1416
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,960
natural. That's where some of the nuances, right? And the discussion between our patients who are

1417
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,360
maybe in their twenties who want to look like they did in their teenage years versus patients who

1418
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:54,200
may be a little bit more mature in their thirties or forties. So the idea is to design

1419
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,160
something that looks normal and natural as they go through the process.

1420
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:01,560
Well, Alan, this is super interesting. I suspect that there are going to be a lot of people who

1421
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,440
listen to this who are going to potentially revisit assumptions that they've had on this

1422
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:14,520
entire topic. I'm actually surprised at how often, you know, a patient asks me a question about this.

1423
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:20,120
And obviously I just don't know much. I mean, all I've learned over the years is to find

1424
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:24,920
people like you who I can send them to. But I think what surprised me the most in this

1425
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:30,680
discussion is how far this field has come in what seems like a decade and a half, basically.

1426
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:36,520
Yeah. I mean, it's incredible. This is the most fast moving field. I mean, it's incredible how

1427
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:40,920
quickly things have changed in hair transplantation from, you know, whether it be linear harvesting

1428
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:47,800
to follicular unit extraction to the use of cellular therapy, you know, PRP and other things

1429
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,960
like low level laser therapy and compound of medications to attack the hair follicle. And

1430
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:56,760
from all sides and all different ways and all different modalities to help our patients really

1431
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,680
grow better hair and look great and feel great. I mean, that's what it's all about, right? It comes

1432
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:05,800
down to the emotion. When you look in the mirror and you see that hairline growing back in, you

1433
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,640
know, patient after patient, they say, this is amazing. This is a miracle. This is like, I never

1434
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:13,800
thought I would see my hairline again. I never thought I'd cover that bald spot except with a

1435
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:18,280
hat. I mean, that's the exciting thing that keeps me going every day. Well, Alan, thank you very

1436
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:23,480
much. I appreciate the input and I hope that anyone listening to this who's had some questions

1437
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,240
about this has got some of those answered. Great. Well, great to be here with you.
