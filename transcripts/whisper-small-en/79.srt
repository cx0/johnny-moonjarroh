00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,600
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,640
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,300
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,920
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,080
doing, you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,400
available for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,760
you choose to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,320
will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,480
plan to build upon. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,460
nature of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,880
in the regular Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,840
portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,840
that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,360
already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,960
will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one,

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,660
the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members. I want to thank

44
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,140
you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content

45

46
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,340
My guest this week is Rick Elias. Rick is a dear friend. I got to meet him in 2013. I had seen his

47
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,020
TED Talk, which at the time was, and to this day remains, my favorite TED Talk of all time. And I

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:19,460
was speaking at TED Med. Someone there knew what a fan I was of Rick and a few minutes following my

49
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,540
talk introduced me to Rick and it sort of became a love at first sight. He is someone I consider a

50
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:32,580
dear friend, an amazing mentor. And this podcast is really an opportunity to allow me, I guess,

51
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,660
to through a discussion with Rick, share so much of Rick's wisdom with all of you as listeners.

52
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,820
We begin our discussion by talking about the day that would change Rick's life forever, but we also

53
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,180
go a lot deeper. And after we finished recording this podcast, you know, Rick said, man, I have never

54
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,620
been pushed so far and so deep into what really happened and transpired that day and how it

55
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,420
impacted my life. So I'm honored that we were able to have that discussion and that he was able to

56
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,620
sort of trust me enough to share so much so broadly. I don't think there's much more honestly

57
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,300
that I need to say about this. There's so many things that we talked about that go beyond

58
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,900
surviving this plane crash. We talk a lot about Rick's incredible role as a CEO of an enormous

59
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,340
company, his remarkable work in philanthropy. But I think it's just better that you hear this one

60
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,980
from the horse's mouth. So without further delay, I hope you enjoy my conversation with my dear

61
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:32,820
friend, Rick Elias. Rick, thank you so much for making time. I know you're super busy this week,

62
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,820
but when your office was able to coordinate us getting together, I was delighted.

63
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,380
It is so much fun to be with you today, Peter. I'm a huge fan of your podcast and we're dear

64
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,020
friends. So when you asked me to be on it, I was honored. A lot of people have heard me talk about

65
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,260
you. I wrote a blog post, I don't know, probably five years ago about how your TED talk was at the

66
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,780
time and actually still remains my favorite TED talk of all time. It's a very short talk. And I'm

67
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,740
sure for folks who haven't heard it yet, we'll make sure we link to it. But I can't resist starting

68
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,660
with that story. So let's just put the profundary niceties aside and just go straight to it.

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,700
Thursday, January 15th, 2009, you're in New York City. Why were you here? I was here because one

70
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,980
of our partners, Directivi, at the time was here and I was having lunch with the CMO the night

71
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,460
before I had dinner with a good friend of mine and was having a couple of small meetings in the

72
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,700
morning. And then I was flying home to coach my son's basketball team when I landed in Charlotte.

73
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,260
The flight was going from LaGuardia to Charlotte. How many times did you take that shuttle, that

74
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,500
flight? That's probably a common flight. A hundred times. Do you remember having breakfast that

75
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,180
morning? I went to play hoops in the Reebok Club on the Upper East Side. And it was a cold morning

76
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,820
and it was snowing big flakes and I chose to walk because it was so beautiful. How would you

77
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,060
describe your life at that point in time? How big was Red Ventures, your company? We had about 700

78
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,220
employees. We'd gone in this really nice growth spurt after really struggling the first four years.

79
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,860
We started in 2000. So we were doing really well, but we were at risk of two bad things happening

80
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,620
and not having a business. So there was this kind of constant juxtaposition of this is not going to

81
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,660
last. I actually told our employees, enjoy the good old days, they won't last forever. And they

82
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,900
were annoyed by me saying that, but it was a reminder that this was very fleeting. Would you

83
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,180
have described yourself as a happy person? Like how would people describe Rick back then? Yeah,

84
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,100
generally I'm a very positive person. I like to think that I've lived through a lot of great

85
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,660
things in my life, some that have actually happened. So that's like how I see where all

86
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,580
been since I was a kid. That said, I was super stressed and I was trying to build

87
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,940
a business so that we could tell it and I could go do other things in life. Your kids at the time

88
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:58,500
were how old? My daughter was in first grade. My son was in second grade. And so how were you

89
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,860
thinking about balancing the incredible stress of running a 700 person company, the travel that

90
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,740
comes with that, and then being the dad, being the coach, being the husband, was that balance,

91
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,060
did it feel in balance to you? Looking back, it was completely out of balance and it was,

92
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:20,980
I kind of rationalized myself around quality over quantity. And I would literally talk myself into

93
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,540
all these, I'm coaching my son or I was like many of us are doing those stages just really taxed

94
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,860
mentally. And my wife really carried the burden of raising our kids. And I look back on it and it was

95
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,300
95 five when it should have been a different number. Jeez. Yeah. 95 five. I can relate. You

96
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,980
were staying at a hotel that morning when you got up? I don't remember the hotel that was in the

97
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,620
Upper East because of basketball in the morning, which there was priority. Life of running on

98
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,380
basketball. Five 30 AM run, which is great. This is pre Uber, I'm guessing. Yeah. 2009. So you

99
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,820
probably took a taxi to LaGuardia. Yes. Do you remember anything about your transit from getting

100
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,580
through security, getting on that plane, anything about it? It was hard given that it's such a

101
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,420
routine for you. Yes, I do remember because of that impact, everything around it becomes

102
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,900
kind of much more real, but it's a wacky story. I remember I was a little early, which I never was.

103
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,740
And I went and got a soft serve ice cream at McDonald's and I worked out really high that

104
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,060
morning and that was the only place where I did this. And, you know, I think that it'll change

105
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,860
that whole eating area, but I'm making love to this ice cream. It just tastes so freaking good.

106
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm literally just enjoying my vanilla ice cream while I wait for whatever an hour for my flight.

107
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,620
And I started walking to the gate and it was so good that I turned around and went and had another

108
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:49,300
one, which I never done. I can relate to that as well, by the way. Although soft serve ice cream

109
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,060
isn't a particular weakness of mine, but there are other airport weaknesses I have. Trail mix is my

110
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,660
airport weakness. That's why you look the way you do and the way I look. I don't know. I would say

111
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,580
the ice cream is probably no worse for you than the trail mix, by the way. So they call you guys

112
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,380
to board on the plane. You're sitting at the front of the plane. Yeah. It was a really kind of crappy

113
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:17,060
day. It was gray. It was cold. It was wet. Kind of gone out of snow and rain. So it was not the most

114
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,220
pleasant day in New York. So I boarded, I was in first class, so we boarded first. And I remember

115
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,300
sitting in my seat and kind of processing, okay, here's all the stuff I got to do on the plane.

116
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,620
As soon as I land, I got to do this. And then when I come back, I'm like, my brain is super busy.

117
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,220
Just thinking about the non-never ending list of things to accomplish. You listening to music or

118
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,740
anything? Do you know? I'm not. I'm just sitting there kind of vegging a little bit, just thinking

119
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,380
about life. So 2009, we would have been sort of third generation iPhone and Blackberry were

120
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,500
probably the dominant things. Which one were you using? I had just switched, literally like two

121
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,700
days before. So you're on like an early iPhone. Early iPhone. And then the first row, so you can't

122
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,980
have a bag on their legs. They have to go up and up. So I'm sitting there and it was a little bit of

123
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,420
a slow departing, I think because of the weather things kind of back up. What time was it? What

124
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,220
afternoon? It was like at 2 30 or something like that. And I remember kind of dozing, you know,

125
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,860
the plane puts you to sleep. And so I was kind of going in and out of that as the plane took off.

126
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,540
And I was very cognizant when we kind of took off. I was kind of in and out of consciousness,

127
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,060
right when we took off. How long after the takeoff do you know something is not right?

128
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:36,660
So about three minutes, I think we're about 4500 feet up or something like that. There's a massive

129
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,700
explosion. Bam, like a pipe bomb. And this was 10 years after September 11th, but it's still September

130
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,140
11th. And for all of us who lived through that. And I had the really lucky seat because I can see

131
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:56,500
the flight attendant kind of kitty corner. I looked at her, we were still flying. We were horizontal

132
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,260
and I looked at her and she was calm. Her eyes were calm. And I was like, okay, we probably

133
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,700
lost an engine. And for the next couple minutes, Peter, all you could hear was the engine struggling.

134
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,500
Like they were trying to restart it when she'd go look at the transcript. That's where they were

135
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,260
doing. There was a really nasty smell going into the cabin. So it smelled like a really bad burnt.

136
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Yeah, burnt, like burned and kind of not. He had turned the plane pretty quickly. We were heading

137
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,220
back into New York. And in my mind, I'm like, okay, I'm not coaching today. The flight attendants'

138
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,980
eyes told me all I had to hear, which is it's just going to be a long travel day.

139
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,500
So when you're leaving LaGuardia, you're up and circling around. So you're sort of over Queens.

140
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,820
Yes.

141
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,220
And you shouldn't be coming back over Manhattan, correct?

142
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,500
Right, correct.

143
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,420
So what do you see out the window?

144
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,260
I am in the aisle. So I'm not really seeing out the window necessarily. I'm just literally for

145
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,060
this two minutes just going like, wow, this is really bizarre. I got to figure out who the

146
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,540
coach is practice for my son. And that's all I was thinking about.

147
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,060
Was the next sign that something was wrong, the reduction in sound in the cabin?

148
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,700
So about 90 seconds before we hit down. So two minutes pass of this.

149
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,380
Of the engine trying to restart.

150
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,180
Right. And then Captain Sullenberger gets on the voice system for the first time.

151
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,380
And he only says three words. He says, brace for impact.

152
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,820
At the same time, they turn off the struggling engines and he lines up the plane with the Hudson

153
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,460
River. You and I have been here long enough, though, and flaunting up that there's no runway

154
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,060
right at the end of the Hudson River. So I knew in that moment, a hundred percent with certainty

155
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,740
that we were going to die. I looked at the flight attendants eyes and it was no longer

156
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,620
annoyance. It was complete terror. I didn't know this, but in airline speak, that means

157
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,660
we're not landing at an airport. And all of this happened in 90 seconds from when you.

158
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,340
Two minutes. So there's a two minutes from hitting to when he does that. And then there's

159
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,820
90 seconds as he's gliding the plane down that you literally.

160
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,460
You're now at the very top of Manhattan when this is happening.

161
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,740
All the way up. Yeah.

162
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,580
And you have 90 seconds to basically say goodbye to your life.

163
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,460
What is really unique about that experience is you are 100 percent certain you're going to die.

164
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,620
If anything, I was saying to myself, please blow up.

165
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,580
I don't want this to break in 50 pieces and drown in this cold water.

166
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,780
So you're kind of playing all these things out and you are just realizing that there's no suffering.

167
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,900
So you're not burning or drowning or something that wouldn't make it different.

168
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,580
But you have 90 seconds to say goodbye.

169
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,780
But you still don't know what that end is like, do you? I mean, it's not to get too morbid, but

170
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,420
if I were in that situation, I wouldn't actually understand what the end is.

171
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,500
I just seen enough documentaries to know that planes don't land on water.

172
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,780
Yeah, they break into a million pieces and they spiral over.

173
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,020
They know how, but I know what was going to happen.

174
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,860
And at this point, it's silent in the cockpit or are people screaming?

175
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,780
It was more silent than screaming. I'm first rowed, so I can't hear

176
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,660
a ton. And you go into, imagine the amount of adrenaline that is going through your system

177
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,820
as you are literally trapped to your death for 90 seconds.

178
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,380
Did you think I have time to make one phone call?

179
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,420
I didn't have my phone.

180
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,380
Your phone is up top.

181
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,940
Yeah. It was very cleansing.

182
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,020
I look back and I was raised Catholic.

183
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,660
So first thing that crosses my mind is like, okay, I'm not a practicing Catholic, but

184
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,420
you can repent and all sorts of good things could happen.

185
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,940
And I asked myself that question, am I going to do something that I've chosen not to believe

186
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,500
in this part of my life? And I didn't. And I said, I'm not a hypocrite.

187
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,140
It may be.

188
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,300
Meaning I'm going to live with the choices I've made.

189
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,220
Yes, which was interesting for me to after my relationship with religion and so forth.

190
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,820
But it was very powerful 90 seconds because the most important thing I realized was,

191
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,980
wow, this all changed in an instant. I thought I had years.

192
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,820
And now it's all of how old were you on that day?

193
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,300
I was 42. How old are you?

194
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,180
46.

195
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Yeah. I thought we tend to believe we're going to live forever.

196
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,820
And it would all change in an instant. And there was I really had a ton of regret about

197
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,660
the things that I did not get to things experiences people I needed to ask for forgiveness

198
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,980
from people. I wanted to say, again, I love you.

199
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,540
People wanted to hug one more time. And you're like, wow, it all changed. And

200
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,060
then there's no going back and there's no turning that back. And that was one emotion.

201
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:44,900
The other emotion and also around regret was really how much I had allow my ego to become

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:53,540
very active in my life and how I spent so much time being wronged by people or just spending so

203
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,220
much time trying to be right versus choosing to be happy. I realized, wow, I've lived my life in

204
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,100
a very wasteful way because so much of my energy has been spent on things that did not matter

205
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,060
with people that did. Think about all the fights you've had with pick your wife. You don't even

206
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,580
remember 90, you know, 30 days later, what you fought about. Yeah, you were so passionate about

207
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:20,820
it. It just doesn't freaking matter. And then the last kind of regret, because that's what it felt

208
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:27,220
like, was this notion that I had not focused on the thing that matters most in my life. I

209
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,820
inherently knew that my most important responsibility was to make sure my kids were the best versions

210
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,700
of themselves. And I had completely delegated that to my wife in a very unfair way. And I had

211
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:47,300
prioritized not just work, but just everything else. And so those were regrets. And I literally

212
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,060
thought about all of that. But you know what was really interesting, Peter? Dying to me was not

213
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,500
scary. I've always thought it would be a scary moment. It was super sad because I didn't want

214
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,060
to go. I really liked my life. I really wasn't done. I had lots of regrets, but it was not scary.

215
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,780
And that in itself also has been clarifying for me. Had you spoken or have you since spoken about

216
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,340
this with the other people on the flight? And do you know if any of them felt that? I have not. I

217
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,140
had so much support when I landed on Love and all that, that I kind of stayed within my realm of

218
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,140
comfort. And then immediately after there were all sorts of things, books and lawsuits and this,

219
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,980
and it all felt so disingenuous to me. The U.S. Airway sent us a check for $10,000 and I refused to.

220
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,740
I've seen your check. You've seen it. It's sitting in Jay Walker's library. Yes. You're probably the

221
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:48,020
only person that didn't cash that check. You know what? I just did that karma. I didn't want to cash

222
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,300
that check. And it's not the right thing. No matter how big it would have been a million bucks,

223
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,420
I would have not cashed it. I was given the ultimate gift. And the ultimate gift was to say

224
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,700
goodbye to your life, to close your eyes, to touch your own arm, say, I love you, to wish for it to

225
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,420
blow up and to open your eyes and realize that you had a second chance. As the plane is coming

226
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,420
down, do you see the George Washington Bridge? Can you see it? Oh yeah. I saw it more as we were

227
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,940
going over it and you can see the cars that are a scary close place. Like literally, we see cars

228
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,100
in a level you never see them in an airplane. I wonder. I see the level of detail. The detail.

229
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,500
Again, we almost took on that bridge. I don't know if you've seen the movie, but if he chooses to go

230
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,300
to Teeterboro, we take out a bunch of buildings. He literally made all these calculations that he

231
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:45,940
didn't have enough thrust to get there. And he said, the only chance I have is to go in the water.

232
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,380
And you will relate to this story because I know the struggle or your internal fight against

233
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,500
authority when it is not well placed. And we've talked a lot about this. So when he

234
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:03,460
communicates to the tower and said, I'm going in the water and the tower goes like, please repeat,

235
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,220
because I can understand that. And basically he was done with protocol. He's like, I'm going to do

236
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,020
my best to try to land this thing. There's all sorts of mathematical equations here. We landed,

237
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,420
I think at 151 miles an hour or something like that. If we are at 153, we blow up at 149.

238
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,500
We tip the wind was like 12 and a half miles an hour. At 14, this came like, there were so

239
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,100
many things that had to be within such a small degree, all compounding into a moment that you

240
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:37,220
can land a cylinder with 158 people full of gas. That's like hitting cement. Yeah. I just know that

241
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,380
from sort of the literature on people who jump off bridges and into water. And when you jump off

242
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,940
the Golden Gate Bridge, which is something like 220 feet up, much lower than where you guys are

243
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,420
coming from. It is like hitting cement. And the only people who survived that jump are generally

244
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,500
people who land exactly feet first. They end up breaking most bones. They break every bone in

245
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,300
their feet, ankles, compress the spine, but at least they don't pivot land sideways, have a rib

246
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,820
tear through their liver or something awful like that. So yeah, it's like a cement, a wet cement

247
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,180
landing. I don't know if I've ever told you this story, but about five years ago, I met a guy

248
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,860
through a friend. We were in Houston and the three of us were having dinner. And somehow it came up

249
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,460
that this guy was in a helicopter crash. He was the only one that survived. There was a pilot,

250
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,540
three, maybe three or four other people in the helicopter and him, and there was a technical

251
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,740
malfunction in the helicopter. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was one of those

252
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,420
things where it was clear they were crashing and it was clear they were all going to die. I mean,

253
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,220
helicopters just look like the most unstable things when they're out of control. And interestingly,

254
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,700
it was about the same length of time. He had about two minutes of crashing and he hadn't heard of you.

255
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,940
So he hadn't seen your TED talk after the fact he did. Of course, I directed him to it.

256
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:01,140
And what blew my mind, Rick, was the similarity in the way he described that two minutes. He said,

257
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,260
he said, Peter, you'll think this is crazy, but I just wasn't afraid to die. But boy, was I sad.

258
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,980
He was about your age. He was probably 40 when this happened. He was hurt in the crash. I mean,

259
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,380
he broke both his legs. I mean, he was again, the only survivor, but walked away with his life.

260
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,460
I'll never forget that, how he explained something about not being afraid, but just being so sad.

261
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,980
Yeah, it makes me wonder how many other people on that plane would echo that same thought. Obviously,

262
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,300
I can't relate, so I don't know what that means. I feel like I'd be afraid, but I'm looking at a

263
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,620
man who's been through it and tells me that that's not what he felt. I just bought a lucky ticket.

264
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,980
So when did you close your eyes? How far do you think you were above the water? You know, when

265
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,300
you fly a lot, you can almost sense when you're going to hit, even if you're dozing off, you feel

266
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:52,740
the ground coming, right? So in about 10 seconds left, I can feel the countdown in my system in 10,

267
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,220
nine. And that's when I grabbed my arm and I said, I love you. Why did you do that? I think I had a

268
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:07,540
sense of needing comfort as you exit life. I probably, there was probably a lot of acceptance

269
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,220
in that statement, subconsciously. Prior to that, were you someone who struggled with

270
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,300
loving yourself? Were you hard on yourself? No, no, no, no, no. By many issues, that's not one of them.

271
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,980
That's interesting. I'm very hard on myself. I wonder if I would even have the foresight to

272
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,940
think that it's a beautiful sentiment. What was the sound like? It was, he puts the tail and then

273
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:39,460
kind of the nose just jams. So it was a violent accident. And then we get to the left. I have my

274
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:47,060
eyes closed. I open my eyes and I am completely disoriented because I'm expecting to being upside

275
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:53,460
down. Like if I left my eyes open, I think I would have been much more oriented. And it took me a

276
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,540
split second to realize that just looked like a cruise ship. We had this plane sitting on the water,

277
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,500
kind of all around us. When your eyes open, the plane is still moving? I don't remember. I don't,

278
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,180
I don't think so. I think I come to a stop or close to coming to a stop. Was there any part of

279
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,580
you that thought this is death? I'm dead. This is an afterlife. This is sort of a few circuits firing

280
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,860
in what remains of my central nervous system, but I'm actually dead. Like, I mean, I, again, what is?

281
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,820
It didn't to me, you would think that that would be a very realistic, it just was so quick, right? That

282
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,260
it was confusing. It was unusual. You know, when you have zero probability or something and it

283
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,340
happens, you're like, did that really happen? And immediately we went into kind of, holy cow,

284
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,500
we got to get out of here. Do you have a moment of realizing what has happened or do you immediately

285
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,980
shift into business mode of, okay, now it's an emergency excavation. Now it's like all that stuff

286
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,580
that nobody pays attention to. When the plane is taking off the slide, how does the slide work? Who

287
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,380
takes the door off? How many doors are there? Where is the nearest door? All that stuff. You guys go

288
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,140
right into that mode. And is it orderly? Is it chaotic? Are people screaming, clapping, crying?

289
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,540
What's happening? That plane was not equipped for water. That's why people were standing

290
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,860
on the wings, not on rafts. I don't understand. What do you mean it wasn't equipped for water?

291
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,620
If you look first class, there's rafts. Yeah. But in the coach section, there were no rafts because

292
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,260
that plane was not supposed to go over water. So that's why nothing deploy when you open those

293
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,980
emergency doors. Only you can stand on the wings. I thought every plane had that. No, if the plane

294
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,060
had landed on the east side, there's not the ferries and the hustle and bustle of where we landed.

295
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,060
That thing was taking water. They evacuated the people from the wing because we were sinking.

296
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,180
So there were so many things. There were a bunch of ferries around us as soon as we landed. So it

297
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,660
never felt like we were not going to be safe in that regard. But on the east side, I think it would

298
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,900
have been different. How cold was the water? Do you remember the feeling? It was very cold.

299
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,980
But adrenaline takes over. So it's only cold after it wasn't called in the moment. And

300
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,500
I'll tell you a story that I have really not shared with many people. I think because I was tired from

301
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,220
hoping and staying out late and working and all this stuff and eating so much sugar before I get

302
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,460
on the plane. I'm kind of comatose sitting there on my seat as people are boarding late in the

303
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:25,940
boarding process. An elderly lady in a wheelchair in her is coming down the ramp. And my voice inside

304
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,540
of me and I've done this before says, get up, give up your seat and go sit and coach. I'm six five.

305
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,140
But you know, it's the right thing to do. And then I'm like, I'm tired. You know, it's not a long

306
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:43,140
flight. I'm being completely selfish. And then her daughter is behind the person that is helping the

307
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,180
lady. And wow, there's two of them. We can't do it. And I'm pretty sure this guy won't give the

308
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:53,540
seat. So I rationalized myself to being completely selfish. So once we are in the rafts, and I know

309
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,820
that this elderly lady is in the back of the plane, I start freaking out because I know she can't walk.

310
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,620
So I start screaming, where's the lady? Where's the lady? We're in the raft. And by the way,

311
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,900
it was really interesting in the raft and our side. Some people were completely frozen. They

312
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,140
couldn't understand anything. Some people were panicking in the raft. And then there was a

313
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,260
handful of us were like, okay, let's problem solve. And eventually the older lady comes to the

314
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,220
front of the plane, they bring her in because they got to put her in a raft. And I grabbed her. And

315
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,940
I'm sitting there. And she's completely traumatized by this. And I'm just thinking about Oh, my

316
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,220
goodness, my last act would have been one of my most selfish acts. That was an interesting emotion.

317
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,980
And then when we got to the ferry, we had to climb about 10 steps. Everybody evacuated. I'm

318
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,500
the bigger guy. I'm saying, I'll bring this lady up. The guys were trying to hold her.

319
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,500
Peter, I think something crazy happened as I'm going up this frozen ladder with no gloves,

320
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,300
no anything, no jacket. And I'm holding her basically in my chest, my hand slips.

321
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:05,940
I was within a split second of dropping an 80 year old in the water. And I grabbed. And

322
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,620
those are very all of this is happening in this moment. As soon as I got to the top of the boat,

323
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:19,060
and she will say, we were all safe. I started crying. Like the river of emotion was insane.

324
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,100
What about others? Did they experience that? I mean, I'm guessing that different people are

325
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,220
processing this at totally different speeds. There are probably still people who don't actually

326
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:37,780
understand what has happened. It sounds like you've moved. You're in post processing on some level.

327
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,180
Are you talking amongst each other? No, everybody. As soon as one of the people in the ferry,

328
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,740
I grabbed the phone. I really wanted to call my wife. By then she was at the pediatrician with

329
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,380
the kids and her sister called her and goes, where's Rick? And she said, he's coming from New

330
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,420
York. She goes to turn the TV on and Brenda turned the TV. And she thought that we all had died. So

331
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,780
she's crying at the pediatricians. The kids are screaming. And I call from a random number. And

332
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,500
as she tells the story, she thinks it's the police saying, Hey, your husband died. Right. Random New

333
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:20,260
York number. And I call and I say, honey, I'm okay. And she screams, he's alive. He's alive. And

334
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,700
kids are completely confused. They just lost their dad, but he's alive. And so everybody were passing

335
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,820
on this phone and all of that. Where was the crew at this time? So most people ended up on the New

336
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,420
York side. Some people ended up in the New Jersey side. I ended up in the New York side and I think

337
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,100
it was pure 42. And my guess is the crew is the last to get off the plane. They have to make sure

338
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:48,100
everybody's off. And I'm guessing Sully is the last of the last 100%. And he ends up, I'll tell you

339
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:55,060
a quick story on Sully. So we end up in, and by the way, New York is an amazing city in so many ways.

340
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,980
Yeah. If something's going to go wrong, this is the city to have it happen. You got the best rescue.

341
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,820
Unbelievable. Well, the first responders, by the time we got to the pier, they were like...

342
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,020
There's hot chocolate waiting for you.

343
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,060
The Red Cross and, you know, there were priests and rabbis and everybody and they're kind. And

344
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,500
like, it was amazing. Like we were sitting there and they're interviewing everybody because they

345
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,100
don't know if I'll play or whatever. Right. And before they release anybody, they need to

346
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,060
interview everybody. Three hours later, they release, they start putting us in buses to take us to a

347
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:28,260
hotel and Captain Sullenberger standing there, what it looked like fully dressed, you know, stoic,

348
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,220
probably contemplating what in the world just happened. And I went up to him, there was nobody

349
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,300
around him. And I went up to him and I said, Captain, I didn't know his name. I said, thank you for

350
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,700
saving our lives. And Peter, he said something to me that day that I say to myself all the time when

351
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,380
someone thanks me for something. I don't say it out loud much. You know what he said to me?

352
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,980
He said, I was just doing my job. Can you imagine if we all just kind of did our jobs

353
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:05,540
at every level? That really shocked me that that was his process. So they put us on a bus and

354
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:11,380
media's there and all of that. And we get to the hotel and there's food and they were amazing.

355
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:18,420
And they're like, OK, you want a hotel? The train is tomorrow. Many people lived here. And I looked

356
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,420
at the lady and I said, I need to get on the next flight. And she looked at me like I got him in the

357
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:33,140
head. Right. Like this guy has completely lost it. And the way I said it to myself was like,

358
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,900
listen, the probability of this happening twice is like if this plane goes down and I die,

359
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,140
it's me. God is coming to see you. Right. Let's go. Let's go get this over with. If it dies and I

360
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,380
don't die, Oprah Winfrey and I are going to share a stage somewhere. And if I get on this plane,

361
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,460
I'll never be afraid of flying again. Did you fly out that night? I flew out that night.

362
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,940
What did you feel like when that plane was taking off? How did it feel different?

363
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,660
I remember the next time I took a flight, which was maybe a couple of weeks later, and I had a seat

364
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,460
again. I got upgraded first class and I gave it up and I wanted to sit in the first seat of coach.

365
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,380
And I wanted to see me on that plane. And I sat on the left hand side of the plane and I just

366
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,980
watched and I needed to relive all of that. You know, that flight, I just wanted to come home.

367
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,340
My mom and dad picked me up because my wife was at home with the kids are young and our home got

368
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,380
60 people within an hour and they all came and like everything, but nothing had really happened.

369
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,940
We were fine, but it's just beautiful love and beautiful expression of support and community.

370
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,620
So my parents picked me up and there's media and everybody there and I like squirt around

371
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,260
and I don't want any, like people are talking to the cameras and whatever. And you can see

372
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,540
when you look at the footage, I'm like pretending I'm a normal passenger on the plane.

373
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:59,300
And my mom, it's all a five, three at the time she was 70. So she's about to turn 80. And I remember

374
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:06,340
giving a hug to my dad and giving a hug to my mom and feeling like this was the safest place in the

375
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:12,260
world. A little lady hugging a six, five foot guy was the safest place. And I remember feeling like

376
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,140
a kid again. I had asthma as a kid and that was the only place that I could breathe. And it was

377
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:23,780
so beautiful to embrace my mom in a way that again, it started this journey of I am not taking

378
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:33,460
anything for granted. And that hug was like the switch. And there's not a day that goes by that I

379
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,900
will not do something and remind myself I'm not taking this for granted. And I love that hug with

380
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,980
my mom. My mom has fairly advanced Alzheimer's now, as you know. And so those hugs are not there

381
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,340
anymore the same way, but I'm so glad I was able to be a kid again as it relates to hugging her.

382
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,540
We were together a few months ago and you mentioned to me that you had never seen

383
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,140
Captain Sullenberger since that day you saw him on the docks and then you saw him for the first

384
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,140
time. You had just seen him for the first time. Tell me about that. So one of our companies is

385
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:16,020
the points guy and the points guy has a big award show here at the Intrepid and he was going to be

386
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,660
the guest of honor. And Brian, who is the points guy and a good partner and a good friend, he's

387
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:26,420
like, hey, would you like to introduce him? And I said, I will be honored. Why had you not sought

388
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,780
him out earlier? I wasn't ready. I have a big idea that I have. I've been working on and I'm

389
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,580
going to do something my way. I just had said thank you to him that day. And I know he had been

390
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,340
overburdened and I said, the world will bring our energies again. And so we're in the red carpet,

391
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,620
this big event, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, all sorts of things. And he knows that

392
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,460
I'm introducing him and he knows that I was a passenger. And I'm like, I am so curious as to how

393
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:02,980
I'm going to react. I see him. I shake his hand. We embrace the four year interview before

394
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,580
and Peter, not a word came out of my mouth. There was nothing coming out of my mouth and it was

395
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,020
amazing. And it didn't have to come out of my mouth. He could see my eyes, what I wanted to say

396
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:20,980
in a way that was so deep and he understood and I saw in his eyes a connection that two human beings

397
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,180
can't manufacture. It was really an amazing moment to see the person that saved your life

398
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,140
and then to have the honor of introducing him a couple hours later and give him an award.

399
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:37,620
How did you even think about and prepare for making introductory remarks in that setting?

400
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,900
Did you wing it? Did you plan it? I planned it, but I didn't write it. Just like the TED talk.

401
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,620
I'm not a great memorizer, but I need to have a framework and I need to let my heart go.

402
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,300
I told a few stories when I introduced him up that day of a very kind guy that basically

403
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,100
gave everything he had that day to all of us and he was going under and I talked about the

404
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:04,740
first responders and I told the story of him doing his job as the core of this. But what was

405
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,540
unique to him is literally he had prepared for that moment his whole life. And I went through

406
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,900
his background as an instructor and maybe as a glide instructor. All the things that he had done

407
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,380
was because he will tell other pilots, you're only a pilot when you lose an engine. And he literally

408
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,060
had prepared his whole life to be a pilot, not for the tens of hours he flown, but for the moment

409
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,420
that he lost an engine that he didn't think it would be to. So I admired him doing his job.

410
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,700
Do you get the sense from all you now know about the details of that? What percentage of pilots

411
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,940
that fly commercial airlines could have done that under the same setting? I mean we can never know

412
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,340
the answer to that and I'm guessing the answer isn't a lot, but I know very little about this

413
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,820
of course, but watching the movie, reading the book, that sort of thing. But it seemed like

414
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,700
improbable that a lot of people could have acted the way he did because of the length of time they

415
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,860
had to process. To me it was maybe I'm incorrect by the way because I'm not a pilot, maybe I don't

416
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,340
even understand all the nuance, but to me the single most important thing was how quickly he

417
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,340
could process information and make a decision about what to do. And even a pilot with more

418
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,820
technical skill, and I don't know how much more technical skill one could have or need,

419
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,940
but if you took an extra 15 seconds to come to the same decision it wouldn't have mattered.

420
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:43,700
To your point earlier, if he had tried to go to Teeterboro, no way. You're plowing over land if not

421
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,300
hitting the bridge on the way to New Jersey. If he tried to turn to LaGuardia he's probably plowing

422
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:56,260
through Manhattan at that point. So I don't know, I mean I just... I think the answer is close to zero

423
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,460
if not zero. Because there are a bunch of factors. I think he... because he was a gliding instructor,

424
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,860
I don't know how many of them are out there, but it was what allowed him to place that plane in the

425
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:15,300
water in a way. Because he had taught flying for so long and he had prepared pilots for this, but

426
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,620
more importantly there were all those factors that all had to fit within a very narrow margin. So even

427
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:27,940
him in other moments where other factors go, and then there's a lot of luck. One of those wings tips

428
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:35,140
the water and we go through it. So the odds of that kind of situation happening, it's close to zero.

429
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:40,660
Do you remember the scene in Saving Private Ryan at the end of the movie when the character played

430
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:48,180
by Tom Hanks is dying and Private Ryan, who's been saved, basically is sort of coming to grips with

431
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,780
the realization that in an effort to save his life an entire group of men have died. And the

432
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:02,420
character played by Tom Hanks basically says to him just two words, earn this. Did you feel some sense

433
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,420
of, look I've always lived my life, I didn't know you before this, but I'm imagining you were not

434
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,420
that different a person. I don't think you like you overnight became the great guy you are today.

435
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:19,220
But did you feel a bigger sense of obligation to your community, both your immediate community,

436
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,020
meaning your family, but your larger community, which is your company, and then the even broader

437
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,900
community than that, which is the world around you. Has that changed in any way? 100 percent. A couple

438
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:36,660
days later in my own quietness, I was trying to make sense of all of this now, and I made a

439
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:44,900
commitment to myself. I made a promise to myself that when I die in six months, six years, or 60

440
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,500
years, if you help me live long, hopefully longer, I am going to ask myself one question, and this is

441
00:39:50,500 --> 00:40:02,180
how I would judge my life. And that question is, did I earn my gift? And I was given the ultimate

442
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:08,020
gift because we in our evolution can't process death, otherwise we would have never left the cave.

443
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:17,300
I left the cave. I was given the gift. And that gift is a responsibility, not a gift.

444
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,420
Who do you think was the first person around you to see that difference? I mean, I have to guess

445
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,420
your wife must have, just because of her proximity to you and how close the two of you are, what do

446
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,660
you think she noticed first? Once the dust settled, meaning the months that followed. Now think about

447
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:43,940
the clarity of not postponing anything, not dealing with negative energy, and focusing on what matters.

448
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,060
So my three thoughts at the plane was landing of no regrets. I try to live a life of no regrets,

449
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,100
and by no means is perfect. But if I was to, I don't know, index the amount of negative moments

450
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,460
of how with my wife, I bet you they're under 10% of what they used to be. I asked for forgiveness,

451
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,220
not because I may have done something wrong, but because someone was offended by what I did.

452
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:14,420
I choose to be happy, not righteous. I want to sort of focus on that a little bit, because even just

453
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,900
if nobody listening to this can relate to that, I still want the benefit, but I suspect I'm not alone.

454
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,060
When I was a kid, actually in high school, and I was a struggling high school student, and I showed,

455
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,460
I wouldn't say I showed no potential, but it was certainly not clear what I was supposed to be when

456
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,900
I grew up. All I wanted to be was a professional boxer, but they made me take this aptitude test.

457
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,100
And it was not about sort of academic aptitude, but more of emotional, like where would he fit?

458
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:49,620
I remember the result of the test was the strongest signal they had ever seen for someone who values

459
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:56,980
justice and things to be in correct order. And they were like, well, you've probably got a career

460
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:03,140
in law enforcement ahead of you, son. You really ought to consider joining the police force, or

461
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,620
maybe you end up going to law school and you'll become a judge, but you really have this strong

462
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:14,100
arc of justice. You just want justice. And I think that that's sort of a detriment sometimes.

463
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,660
I think it's because you do, you get into these arguments with your spouse, and even if you're

464
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,220
going to be objective, in some situations they're wrong, and you're right, but you're right. This

465
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:30,180
idea that what is the upside to that? You could very easily just drop this case, quote unquote,

466
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:38,020
and get back to just being a happy existence with the world. So were you someone who would argue a

467
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,660
point if you felt you were right? And because I've never known that side of you, it's so hard for me

468
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:48,980
to imagine you having any of that streak in you that I have, for example. I'm lying, I'm hotheaded.

469
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,540
Less than that, I would be too passionate about certain things. But think about it. There's always

470
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,340
three sides to an argument. Yours, theirs, and the truth. And if you start every argument

471
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:07,220
understanding that you don't have the truth, you have your truth, it's really easy to surrender to

472
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:14,180
that. And most things in life are a shade of gray and not completely black and white. And the problem

473
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,860
is when we believe we're right, we have made something black and white. Do you think that that

474
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,260
is something you knew beforehand and choose to ignore, or is that something that you

475
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,620
somehow came to you as an epiphany as a result of this? This is my mom's teachings,

476
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:36,260
this sort of, but I ignore them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My favorite, I plagiarized most of the things I

477
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,860
said in being Puerto Rican and learning English when I came to college here. I literally, I'm

478
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,700
constantly collecting new thoughts from others. I had an original thought after the plane crashed,

479
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,660
like mine. Like I could literally claim this set of words may have been uttered, but I've never heard

480
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:59,060
them. And it is that I collect bad wines. You know, now I plagiarize that from you. Oh, good.

481
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,700
Finally. Tell us why you do that, because I love it. I collect by wines is the trigger thought

482
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:13,540
for not postponing anything. And the thought is if you go to my house, I have a lot of bad wine

483
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,420
because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening my best one. This changes in

484
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,940
an instant. I don't want to leave with a bunch of good wine that I never drank. And it's a way of

485
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,180
living. It's a way of living in everything. So collecting bad wines means so much. It just means

486
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:37,780
taking the trip, making the call, taking the risk, having the courage, forcing yourself to things

487
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:44,020
that you know you need to do. I know you know this, but I was 45 pounds heavier at the time when this

488
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,740
happened. And this was a commitment to me and saying I'm doing all of this. It becomes very

489
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:54,420
centering. Which by the way, a little counterintuitive. Some would argue, good thing you

490
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,140
had those two ice creams. Like wouldn't you have regretted it if that plane's crashing and you're

491
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,140
like, man, I just wanted those two ice cream. You know, you can take these things to two different

492
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,900
extremes. And there is a bit of a contrast, which is on the one hand, you're living for the moment,

493
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,180
in which case we should be as hedonic as possible. But at the other hand, you've lost 45 pounds. You

494
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,740
are healthy to begin with, but you're much healthier today. You're probably 10 years younger

495
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:25,460
physiologically, which is a very forward looking point. How do you reconcile those completely at

496
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,060
odds, behaviors, or behaviors is the wrong word, but viewpoints. I still have the ice cream. I think

497
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,740
again, it's an notion of balance. I think it's defining the game. Is your game longer or shorter

498
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:43,860
today? So there's a book that it's coming out called the Infinite Game. And I believe in the

499
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:50,260
Infinite Game before the book, Simon Sennick and he's great. He's a friend. And he wrote this book.

500
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:56,100
It's very much a philosophy of which I live life, which is the whole purpose of the game is to play

501
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:03,780
the next game. There's no winning. There's no outcome. There's no end. So because I play the

502
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,860
Infinite Game in life, I want to be healthy enough to continue to play the game. I can win the game

503
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:15,060
of complete pleasure for a day, a month, a year, but then I lose my ability to keep playing the

504
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,900
game. It's called the Infinite Game. It's phenomenal. Yeah. I've heard him speak about it. I'm looking

505
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,940
forward to it very much. I want to go back to sort of the winter and spring of 2009. You did

506
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,500
mention in your Ted talk that I don't know if it was weeks later or some period later, you're at a

507
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,260
recital for your daughter. Tell me about that. Do you ever watch a movie Ghost? That's the Bruce

508
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,620
Willis or no Patrick Swayze. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Many, many years. Many years. And there's a scene

509
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:46,820
in that movie where he's dead and he's a ghost and he's watching. He's seeing life as it's happening.

510
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,020
And I felt like I was sitting there and it was probably two weeks later or something. It's a very

511
00:46:52,020 --> 00:47:00,180
recent and I felt like I was the ghost. Like I was not supposed to be there. And here I'm watching

512
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,140
my daughter and just completely bawling and people around me, I'm like, this is supposed to be a happy

513
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:15,140
play, dude. And I was bawling because I was giving that gift of seeing her on that stage.

514
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,940
And by the way, it doesn't have to be a stage. It doesn't have to be a play.

515
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,860
The magic of seeing your kids every day grow up, if you want to choose to see it that way,

516
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:33,620
can be equally powerful. So it was a moment where I realized, wow, this is the gift,

517
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:40,260
is to be able to watch my kids grow up. And it was centering around that of all my priorities

518
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,380
is my most important one. How did your travel schedule and your relationship with work change

519
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,580
as a result of this? Was that a quick change? Was it a gradual change? I remember you sat me down

520
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:00,660
six years ago and showed me your calendar and we walked through sort of the way you ran things.

521
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,620
Tell me a little bit more about that today. Time is our only currency, is the only thing that matters.

522
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:15,940
In our civilization, we solve for wealth first, but find any really rich person that is old or sick,

523
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,820
and they'll trade it all for more time. It's worth pausing on that for a moment because most people

524
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,300
listening to this think, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's easy to say. But I've asked

525
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:32,660
the following question to probably 50 patients and more than 100 people, I'm sure. And the answer is

526
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:39,700
always the same, which is you ask someone who's at the age of 40, 50, 60, would you trade places

527
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,900
with someone who's 90 years old in exchange for a trillion dollars? And everybody thinks about it

528
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,420
for a second and goes, well, no, I actually do the math. I said, well, take your age now,

529
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:59,140
subtract it from the age of 90, take that delta, divide it by the trillion. You're telling me that

530
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,420
you value time more than this. You could actually make a calculation, and it's telling you how

531
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,220
valuable time is to you when phrased that way. And most people don't appreciate that. I certainly

532
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,660
at times fail to appreciate just how much of a premium I truly place on time. And yet,

533
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,540
even today before we started this podcast, I was lamenting the fact that I agreed to take a call

534
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,540
as a favor to somebody and it like ate into an hour of my day. And I was sort of like,

535
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,820
sometimes I just don't say no enough. I don't protect time enough. And yet if I did that

536
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,620
calculation more, I would. So how did you calculate that? And how did you implement it?

537
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,260
I'll tell you, but you reminded me of one of my favorite stories. And I tell this story to

538
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,140
kids. I go speak in a lot of middle schools and I just, or younger kids, and they're all

539
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,260
cut up in all this material stuff. And I said, okay, I'm going to give you a million dollars,

540
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,620
but you have to give me your arms and all the kids are, no, no, no, I'm going to give you

541
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,420
$5 million. And you're going to give me your arms and your legs. No, no, no. Can't give you

542
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:04,980
$10 million for your arms, your legs and your eyes. And the value of the story is you're already rich

543
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:12,740
because you have your health money really can buy that. So value how lucky you are.

544
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:17,380
The talk is around the power of luck. And most of the things that show up as unlucky things

545
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,100
ends up being lucky things in life if you choose to see them that way. And so you just remind me

546
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:29,460
of that story. So listen, I waste no time. I waste no time. I only do things that I find that are

547
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:35,620
aligned to what I want to, what I'm prioritizing or that I enjoy a lot or that put me on a path

548
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:40,820
forward to what I want. And as a result, I am really comfortable saying no all the time. I'm

549
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:47,220
very thoughtful and polite. I don't join any outside boards. I have demoted friends that I

550
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,100
outgrew so that I can make room for new friends. I travel light. I travel light through light

551
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:59,140
because I need to figure out a way to increase the value of my time. I have an amazing chief of staff

552
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,740
who solves for 40% of the stuff that I shouldn't be doing and all that stuff. So I put enough

553
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,900
structure around me that I can be really efficient with my time, but it's really finding always more

554
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,580
ways to do it. But saying no is everything. How do you say no? First of all, if someone says,

555
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:22,420
hey, would you come speak at this event? My answer is pretty standard. I'm honored that you would ask.

556
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,780
I'm humble that you would ask. Right now, my priorities are my family and growing our company.

557
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:34,180
And as it is, I don't have enough time. Eventually, I hope to have time to do things like this. And if

558
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,460
you would have me, I would love to do it. Does it feel bad to say no? Oh no. Because when you're

559
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:45,620
saying yes, you're saying no to something else. So everything in life has a price. That's so funny.

560
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,700
I interviewed a good friend of mine, Jason Fried, and he said the exact same thing, which is such

561
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,020
a beautiful way to think about it is every time you say yes, you're actually saying no to a number

562
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,420
of things that you can't anticipate between now and then. It's easy to say, do you want A or B?

563
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:03,060
It's hard to say you want A or door number B and you don't know what it is. And most times we don't

564
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,460
know. Opportunity cost is really, it's by the way, one of the keys to business is

565
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:14,180
not settling for good and waiting for great. How many days a month do you think you traveled

566
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:23,540
prior to 2009? I went and tracked it. I was probably on the road 15 nights. 15. And what is

567
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,860
it today? That's not vacation with my family. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, time away from family.

568
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:33,620
Four. Wow. And it's literally decreased like one per year. And I track it. I track now too,

569
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:39,460
thanks to you. Good. This is the first year I'm going to break, meaning I'll be less than 10 days

570
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:45,780
a month away from family. I'll average through December 31st. I'll hit 9.9. Wonderful. Yeah.

571
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:52,180
I want eight next year. That's the way to go. We focus on what we measure. It's just our brains

572
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,700
are distant. So that's what they say. It's a dream until you write it down and then it's a goal.

573
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,980
It's the same thing, the same principle. Do you think your kids at the time knew what happened?

574
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,900
Yeah. They're sort of six and seven, right? Yeah. They kind of understood that something

575
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:11,220
really big had happened, but it really impacted him. My son just did a project of his identity

576
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:17,140
in life. And one of the central story was this story. I don't even know. And he's 18. So it

577
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:24,340
tells you how hopefully he gave him context of enjoying life. You said something earlier that I

578
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:30,500
just thought was so incredible. And I can't stop thinking about it. This idea that Sully basically

579
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:38,340
said you are only a pilot when you lose an engine. Like everything you've done is sort of preparation

580
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:44,340
for that one defining moment of your life. Have you thought about ways that that extrapolates to

581
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,340
what it means to be a father, what it means to be a husband, what it means to be a CEO? What are the

582
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:56,580
equivalents of the engine losing moment when the rubber hits the road and all that other stuff

583
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:03,780
is just there to prepare you for that moment? The easy answer on the business side is you're only

584
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:11,220
a leader in a moment of crisis. Otherwise you're just in charge. So and you as a leader have to

585
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,500
prepare yourself for the moment of crisis and it's going to come. And unfortunately, because

586
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,340
economically we've been such a benign 10-year period, there's a lot of people that don't have

587
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,820
the temperament to deal with what's coming. Maybe in a year, maybe in three, maybe next month.

588
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,500
It's coming. There's going to be a year. So that's the easier one is bringing your organization along

589
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,860
to understand that when things change, we're going to have to lead in doing fire drills around it and

590
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:42,580
doing scenario planning around, okay, what happens if we have a data breach? What happens if we have

591
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,780
business? What happens? Like all those things we do not constantly, but we do it enough to create

592
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,820
consciousness about it. And then time will tell when the crisis comes, are you going to be able to

593
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,620
lead or not? I find it interesting when people call themselves leaders and they've never done

594
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:02,100
anything in a time of crisis. I'm like, oh, you're in charge. I'm not sure you're a leader yet.

595
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:08,180
I think with kids, we like many other families have had to deal with our share of experiences

596
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,900
with teenagers that are very, very hard and our kids are in a good path and they're going to be

597
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:19,140
great, but it hasn't been easy at all and has been really, and Brenda and I talk about it a lot,

598
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:25,940
not only has it united us even stronger to help our kids through their situations, but it is,

599
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,300
I've learned more about myself through being a dad because hard driving people like you and I think

600
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:38,340
we know and what you realize that your key of being a father or mother is to find their gift

601
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,820
and then to help them get to their gift and accept them for their strengths and their weaknesses. And

602
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:52,980
the last thing you want a kid to feel is shame. And when we want something different for our kids

603
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,820
than what they seem to want, there's a high chance you end up shaming them without wanting to or

604
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:08,500
guilting them. So I think for a parent to lead is to meet the kid where they are in finding their

605
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:14,980
natural bent and encouraging it and making them their version of themselves. And that was not

606
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:20,500
apparent to me when I signed up for this. This has been with two teenagers that are super gifted and

607
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,220
super kind, but they are teenagers and they have to deal with a lot of the stuff you and I didn't

608
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,300
have to deal with. It's not easy. I'm dreading every second of it truthfully because I do

609
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,260
think kids today live in a world, maybe every parent says that, maybe my parents felt the same

610
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:41,220
way, who knows, but I think it looks brutal to be a teenager today. Maybe what I'm telling you is

611
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,780
that you're going to have to grow up a lot to be able to do that well. That's what we've

612
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:52,180
seeked a lot of help and it's been great and we have dug in and we've done a lot of research and

613
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,380
we tried a lot of things that haven't worked and it's a real commitment. And by the way, we're not

614
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:03,300
out of the woods yet. I'm just going to get incredibly selfish for a moment and just ask

615
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,420
for some advice. So how do you handle things like electronics and social media? What have you

616
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:12,100
learned? And this doesn't necessarily have to be at the expense of your own relationship with your

617
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:17,540
kids, but even from other parents, again, you have a company of thousands of employees. You have a

618
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:22,660
purview into the lives of more than just your own. What advice do you give parents who are trying

619
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,700
to think through those issues? I'll tell you an anecdote. So last week, my daughter's school had

620
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,380
a trip to Disneyland and my daughter is one of the few kids in her class that does not have a

621
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,740
smartphone or a cell phone at all. So most of the kids do and they're driving up and it's my wife

622
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,980
and another mom that are driving up in sort of the minivan and there's the four kids are in the back

623
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,460
and three of them have a phone and my daughter gets my wife's phone and they're playing with it.

624
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,700
And at one point my wife looks back and she says all four of them are glued to the phones. They're

625
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,740
not talking, they're not interacting at all. It's like a road trip and they're all glued to these

626
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,500
phones. And so she sort of says, hey guys, let's put the phones away and you guys got to do

627
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:04,180
something. You got to talk, you got to play a game, you got to whatever. Okay, well extract that moment

628
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,740
for a second and you realize there is a lot of stuff that they're missing and you could argue,

629
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,460
look, maybe they're getting things we didn't get that were better for them. Who knows? But to see

630
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:20,660
the lack of basic socialization concerns me. How do you or what advice do you have to navigate that?

631
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,180
I don't have better advice than others. I think kids should be kids,

632
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,340
meaning parents should decide what are the controls. You don't give a kid a remote to the TV

633
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,580
and say do whatever you want. I think my mom said, which I love, raising teenagers is a tug of war.

634
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:42,180
You ultimately must lose because that's how they become adults. So there has to be enough tension.

635
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,780
You can't lose at 13. It's at 19 they have to. But you have to be losing incrementally. You can't

636
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:52,260
be winning and then lose. So it's a tug of war that you're the resistance. So you also have to

637
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:58,580
think about it kid specific. Every kid is different, age specific, but you also don't want them to be

638
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:04,580
the misfit. You also don't want them to be missing out and we kind of tend to project our reality into

639
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:10,020
others. They're going to live in a world where your kids are probably never going to drive.

640
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,740
Your kids are going to live with probably not even a cell phone. They're going to see screens

641
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,660
in their glasses. They're going to do all this stuff that you can't even understand. They're

642
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:25,220
going to live in a mix of a VR world and a real world. You want your kid to be able to be successful,

643
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:32,740
happy, settle, whatever it is, your goal in that world, not in 1982 of the VHS. So you also got to

644
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:37,060
remind yourself that this is a... You can't hold on to the past so much. You can't. And you know,

645
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,380
I find very interesting. I have this conversation with lots of friends. If you ask anybody,

646
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,260
what is your goal for your kid? They'll tell you some version of the same thing. Happy, well

647
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:51,860
adjusted, contributing, growing, finding their passion, whatever BS we'll talk about. And we

648
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:59,060
mean it. But then you watch the way we raise kids is over schedule, two sports, a trainer,

649
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:06,340
at this, at that, another coach, pre-SAT, pre-SAT, pre this, take it six times. Did that really help?

650
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,860
Did stressing kids out to that extent? They're like, Oh, why are they so stressed? Well,

651
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,780
we're making them super stressed. This culture is stressful enough. And I think as parents, we

652
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:19,780
judge so much of our own self-esteem by what others think about our kids that we fail to

653
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:24,500
understand what really is our goal. If you really want your kid to be happy, adjusted, whatever, you

654
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,380
would do a lot of things differently. So back to your question of just remind yourself what is it

655
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:35,060
that you're trying to do and try to align to them. It's a great point you make about, you know,

656
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:40,020
I was telling you a story before we started about my son and that moment I had in that experience

657
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,500
where I realized, man, how is it that I've let my ego become tied up in his behavior? How is it that

658
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,420
how he behaves in public as a five year old? And when he has a temper tantrum, I somehow internalize

659
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:57,940
that as people are looking at me as a bad parent. I mean, it's, it feels so silly to even say that

660
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:03,460
out loud, but I don't think I'm the first person that's felt that. And that gets carried forward.

661
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,740
I think that is such a big part of the over-scheduling, overdoing it.

662
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,220
It's hard. We make so many mistakes ourselves and we look at each other like, what are we doing?

663
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,980
Like, it's a long race. I do believe, I think it was outliers or whatever, but I do believe that

664
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,780
the more you make kids feel comfortable and successful in the race they're on, we judge

665
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:29,140
ourselves against our relative set. So put kids in situations that they feel like they are progressing

666
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:37,140
and they'll find whatever their ceiling is in long enough time. So many kids quit sports because

667
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,380
we push them too hard, too early. And they're like, this doesn't feel good. This has produced

668
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:48,340
no endorphins at all, on the contrary, right? So I think a lot of the issues with kids in this age

669
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:53,140
is the parents, not the kids. And we want to blame electronics and all this stuff that are issues.

670
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,820
But the issue is really that I don't think we're that honest as parents in terms of our goals and

671
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:04,260
our actions. Why do you think that has changed in a generation? I mean, you've spoken a little bit

672
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:09,940
about your parents and it's kind of amazing, right? So they seem to be wise beyond their years.

673
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:16,420
Your mom's comment about the tug of war that has to slowly be lost is honestly one of the most

674
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,220
insightful things I've ever heard about parenting. Were your parents as educated as you are?

675
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,460
I was born in a Latin family and my dad is an amazing guy, but my mom raised us

676
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:31,620
four kids in six years. And I think that the definition of one's life success is where do

677
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:37,940
you come from and where did you end? Did you help advance the cost of our race, the human race? And

678
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,140
you do that through your family first. And if you're lucky enough through your community,

679
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,460
if you're lucky enough in a broader way like you who are impacting a broader set of people.

680
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,860
But I think the ultimately goal of life is to make it better for others, starting with your kids.

681
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:57,220
And I think my mom is the most successful person I know because of what she was giving versus what

682
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:01,860
she gave us. How old were you guys when you left Puerto Rico? I came to the US to go to college.

683
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:08,420
So I came to Boston College in January of 1990. So your family stayed born and raised? Yeah. Okay.

684
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:14,820
What was that like to show up in Boston at 18 or whatever you were? Ignorance is a wonderful bliss.

685
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:22,740
If I knew what I would have never come, I really think that ignorance is a bliss. I showed up as

686
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,060
a second semester freshman because it was the year after Doug Flutte and there were no dorms.

687
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,580
And my parents are like, we're not paying for an apartment. So I came with a second semester

688
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:36,500
freshman and they put me on a plane. They gave me 200 bucks. My dad said, go be a man. And I got

689
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,660
on a plane. I didn't even know how to go to the gate by myself, travel a few times. I put a Rico

690
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:46,340
and what I realized as soon as I got to Boston is I didn't really understand English and I was ill

691
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:51,380
equipped to go to college. But overcoming that was the greatest gift. Why did you go so far into

692
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,860
such a cold place? Why didn't you go to school in Florida, for example, or I don't know, my uncle

693
01:03:55,860 --> 01:04:02,180
said Boston is great. So I said Boston is great. Doug Flutte said, I was racing at Catholic school.

694
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,380
So Boston college was Catholic. So I just, I landed. I'm like, what in the world is this?

695
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,620
And I ended up in the freshman. You said second semester. So it's winter when you showed up.

696
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:16,420
I showed up five days before anybody at 200 bucks. And I have lots of stories of like

697
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:22,260
completely embarrassing things that happen as I went through this. And because I was ill equipped,

698
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,380
I was a misfit in every regard. And I never faced racism, which I did at the time. I faced all sorts

699
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:32,260
of things that I'm glad I did. Cause it made me a lot more aware of what other people go through.

700
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:37,140
What had your parents or your mom even specifically done to prepare you for that moment?

701
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:42,180
Taught me independence, taught me that. Where are you in the birth order of the three out of four?

702
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:48,260
Yeah. Did the two above you leave Puerto Rico for college? My brother, one above is in Kansas City

703
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:53,540
as a doctor. And my sister went and then came back after a couple of years. Did you talk to

704
01:04:53,540 --> 01:05:00,820
them about it before you left? Technically, my brother wrote my essays. I think I gave him

705
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,780
something in Spanglish and he wrote them and I got in. Hopefully they don't take my degree away.

706
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,180
If so, we'll find somebody to give you an honorary one instead. Tell me about the remainder of those

707
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:16,420
three and a half years though. Obviously it sets you on a good path and you decided to stay.

708
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,860
Yeah. I came here wanting to go back to Puerto Rico and halfway through and I'm like,

709
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,500
I love this country. I love what this is about. I worked at Fenway Park as a security guard. I

710
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,540
drove a limo in the summers. So I was hustling, making money. My dad said, I'll pay a third. You

711
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:34,500
get loans for a third and I had an academic scholarship for a third, but you're responsible

712
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,540
for your own money. So it was the greatest thing. Yet I don't know why I wouldn't do that to my kids

713
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:45,220
because it's very different. Do you think about that? Do you think about your story of coming

714
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:49,780
here as an immigrant, having nothing is a story that many people can relate to. And because of

715
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:56,340
your success, your kids have a privilege that you've never had. How do you think about imparting on

716
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:03,860
them? Some of the, I don't know if lessons is the right word or internal fortitude or whatever,

717
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:08,100
call it what you want to call it. How do you think about that? I actually think about it

718
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,380
almost the inverse of what you said. I think it's really hard to be our kids. I think we're giving

719
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:22,020
them not privilege. We're giving them a big, big cross to carry. And I feel a lot of responsibility

720
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:29,060
for not bearing so much of a shadow that my kids can find their own son. And we travel, we travel

721
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:33,620
in certain ways and whatever. What are you sending our kids up? I think it's really hard. It's a lot

722
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:38,980
easier to grow up the way I did, which I can do better. I think it's harder and you have to set

723
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:44,660
up a different game. You have to set up a game that they feel they can win. And you have to get

724
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,460
them thinking about the infinite game of there's no end here. That's why so many of them end up in

725
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:53,860
drugs and end up in other things because they say that's not something I can be successful at.

726
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:58,100
First of all, I actually think you're correct. I think both of the statements are correct. So

727
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:03,700
it's harder and easier and that the hardness and easiness pay off are actually coexisting and

728
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:11,140
creating that dynamic. So you can't dim your own light. I mean, as you said, especially someone

729
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,660
like you who's been kind of given this gift. We haven't even got to talking about Red Ventures,

730
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:21,380
which I want to in a minute, but you can't not be Rick Elias. So how can they be your kids?

731
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:27,060
I think first of all, it's not what you say, it's what you do. I work really, really hard.

732
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:34,260
I want them to understand that working hard is part of the way you achieve things in life.

733
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:39,300
To me, I don't have any issues with that. And as long as it's protecting our family time and what

734
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:45,940
matters to us. I think secondly, is how you treat other people. The best thing that you can do to

735
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:52,820
teach your kids how to live is to treat strangers with kindness. They're watching your every action.

736
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:59,140
They're watching and by the way, it's you are a teacher all the time and not with your words

737
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:04,100
because they won't hear you, but with your actions. So every time you find yourself, which we all do,

738
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:09,380
getting upset about something with a driver or a waitress because something was cold or a manager

739
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:15,460
because they made you wait and you get a little righteous, which we all do, you're doing the

740
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,820
opposite. You're teaching them a behavior that is not going to help them. So I view our responsibility.

741
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:26,900
The best thing I can do is model hard work, model giving and kindness, model good energy to other

742
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:31,620
people, respect. We're lucky to know a lot of people that others will consider super famous.

743
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:37,060
And I treat them exactly the same way that a stranger that is doing whatever job and they see

744
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,140
that. So those are the things. The only things you can do, you can't apologize for your success and

745
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:48,100
you can't run away from it, but you have to talk to them about not, hey, I want you to get into an

746
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:54,020
Ivy League school and I want you to do all this stuff. I want you to find your gift and I want you

747
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:00,500
to figure out a way to give that gift to others. Again, I think that's so well said. It's hard and

748
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,780
this is not a perfect journey, right? We're full of flaws in it. Were you ever a person that struggled

749
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:12,100
to apologize before 2009? And if so, is it easier for you to apologize today? It was very hard. I'm

750
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:17,060
very proud. I'm very competitive in those two things and I can rationalize anything as to why

751
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:22,420
I was right. You know what, Peter? I apologize for things. I don't even know what I did because I

752
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,900
don't give a shit. If it's creating negative energy, I can really easily say, listen, I am

753
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:33,300
really sorry I offended you. It was not my intent. That's it. Move on. And I don't seek to understand

754
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,220
and argue the kind of argument. I was like, does this really matter? Am I going to remember it

755
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:42,980
in six months? Is it going to change anything? Just move on. It's like a leakage of energy.

756
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:48,180
And when you leak energy, it consumes time and that's your only currency. Imagine if you were

757
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,780
like your toilet was running of hundred dollar bills nonstop. Like that's the visual. That's

758
01:09:53,780 --> 01:10:00,180
what a silly fight is. You know, you probably have the longest list of anybody I know of things that

759
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:05,140
don't matter. What is on your list of things that do matter? What is worth fighting for? What is

760
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,220
worth being upset about? Those are two different questions. So that's why I might pause. Things

761
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:14,900
that matter and things worth being upset about. I think injustice is worth being upset about.

762
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,500
And obviously based on everything you've said, it's not about your own injustice. When the

763
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:23,060
Uber driver doesn't show up and when the waitress spills your soup, that's not injustice. It's,

764
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:29,780
as you know, I'm attracted to places where this system fails people that can't help themselves,

765
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:34,020
that want to help themselves. That's kind of our sweet spot and all our social impact work.

766
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:38,500
Let's talk a little bit about that. Actually, I think to whom much is given, much is expected.

767
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:44,980
And I think the best way to do any type of social impact work is using your platform,

768
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:50,740
not just using your wallet if you can. And so here I am, I have a thriving company with a lot

769
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:55,780
of young people that are exceptional. How do I put them to do something that matters to them,

770
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:02,500
which is give back, thickens our culture, but also allows us to do something that gives us our real

771
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,100
purpose, which is leaving our wood pile higher than we found it. That's what we talk about as

772
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,940
a company. That's the only purpose of the company. We're not going to go public. We're not going to

773
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:15,140
sell. This is the infinite game. Someday it'll go to zero. Hopefully someone else is running it.

774
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:19,460
This is a way that we spend our energy together, the people we work with and the problems we solve

775
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:25,380
and all of that. So when you put it in that context of none of this really ultimately matters

776
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:30,020
other than advancing the game, I am attracted to injustices where the system is not working. I'll

777
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:35,300
give you an example will be undocumented kids. They're known as DACA now in the Supreme Court

778
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:41,140
is hearing the case. And these are kids that were brought here without two years old, four year old,

779
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:47,220
six year old illegally. The parents brought them here illegally, but we don't check education for

780
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,780
primary school, secondary school or high school. So many of these kids don't even know Spanish or

781
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:55,220
whatever the language is. They never really remember being in their country. And by the time

782
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:00,580
they get to 18, we said, sorry, you can't go to college. There's no federal financial aid because

783
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:06,020
they're not citizens. And then there is no in state tuition in about 26 states. So their chances

784
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,260
of going to college are basically zero. And I'm not talking there's like thousands of these. There

785
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:16,660
was about a million of these in 2010 kids that were zero to 18 that were investing all this money.

786
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,420
So even if you want to take the Republican side of this, which is a valid argument, they're going

787
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:25,140
to be a lot more productive if you educate them. That's the whole reason to do this. So they'll

788
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,420
pay a lot more taxes. So that guy is Obama passes his executive order where he says, okay,

789
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,900
if you graduate college and you are undocumented and you're within these ages, you can get a work

790
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:40,100
permit. So now going to college makes sense because it used to be that you got an education. There was

791
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:46,020
no way to get a job. And that's what's getting debated right now. There's like 600,000 of these

792
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:51,540
kids with work permits. We have about, I don't know, probably 50 of them working at Red Ventures

793
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:58,500
right now. So what I did is 50. Wow. But we have 300 plus going through college that we're

794
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:04,660
supporting. So Golden Door Scholars got launched. We did our first class of 12 and 17 and 25 and 30.

795
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,500
We're now reviewing applicants for the next class. And this is the first time we're using non doc.

796
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,220
I say you, if you're undocumented, we're going to take a stance for you. And if you deserve to go

797
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:22,100
to college, you are going to go our top 200 candidates, Peter 3.91, unweighted GPA, unweighted.

798
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:26,740
Think about the waste of talent. None of those kids are going to college. Tell me what happens

799
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:32,740
to those kids. If they don't go to college, they end up working in a fast food place or just waste

800
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,980
time, waste of time. Many times they don't even find a job because they ever go back to the country

801
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:41,060
that they were born in. That's the problem. They don't feel culturally assimilated. They're American.

802
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:44,980
A lot of them don't find out that they're undocumented until they go take a driver's

803
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:50,020
license or something. They're like, you can't. It's very, very cruel for these kids. And they're

804
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:55,940
they're your kids friends. And they're as American as our kids are. I find those kids did not come

805
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:00,420
into crime. Those kids did not have a choice to move here at two years old. Those kids have done

806
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,660
everything we've asked them with the system. What is this country all about? Isn't this the country

807
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:10,260
where if you want to put in the work, we give you a chance. And so I find that to be a place that

808
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:15,860
we put a lot of energy towards 18 to 24. There's about five and a half million young adults in the

809
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:22,660
U.S. These are not undocumented. These are citizens out of school or out of work, terminally

810
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:28,180
on their employee, five and a half million. And I think companies can do a lot more for them. So we

811
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:34,180
set up a 501c3 call road to hire where we're training these kids and coding in tech, back

812
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,820
tech and all this stuff. And we're now opening the platform for the companies. So B of A and

813
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:42,980
Novant and other companies in Charlotte are literally hiring these kids. We train them as

814
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,540
an adult in school for six months and we pay them to adult them. We train them skills and then we

815
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:51,860
put them in a two-year apprenticeship program and we hold their hands for two years. We have another

816
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:59,060
program called Live Sports. Eighth graders in Title I schools in Charlotte are two years behind

817
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,620
on reading. Charlotte is probably no different than other places. Title I schools is assisted

818
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:09,540
lunch. And our belief is that hope has an expiration date and that expiration date

819
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:16,580
educationally comes about that age. And sports is a universal language. So we have basketball,

820
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:22,500
soccer, girls basketball, where we bring these kids in out of the work schools every day. We give

821
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,060
them usually their last meal of the day. We give them an hour worth of reading because we think if

822
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,820
they can catch up with reading, they'll extend their hope. And then we give them an hour and a

823
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:35,060
half worth of exercise every weekend. There's activities. We have 250 kids now in the program.

824
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,340
We started it two and a half years ago. We're going to grow. We're going to be alone. So we're

825
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:43,220
just trying to do our part. Like these are drops in the water, but they matter. And then for me,

826
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:47,460
matter after her hurricane Maria, that I did something for Puerto Rico. So we launched

827
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,820
seven, eight forward seven, eight, seven. That's the area code. So we're training.

828
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:56,900
Right now we're training about 70 young Puerto Ricans in the US that we want to reverse the brain

829
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,060
drain. So we're going to bring them back. We're giving them real digital chops and we're going to

830
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,140
move businesses to Puerto Rico so that we can bring people back to Puerto Rico.

831
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:10,980
I want to go back to the first of those because you're not a dogmatic guy. You're not a

832
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:18,020
self-righteous guy. You're a very empathetic person. Help me see my blind spot, which is

833
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:23,620
like you. Well, no, no, you're one of the first generations. So my parents came to the country

834
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:28,180
with the hundred dollars in the pocket sort of thing worked like crazy. And now we get to live

835
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:34,420
this better life. And because I saw a lot of that, I never really understood the sentiment against

836
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:38,660
immigration. Now, part of that is because I grew up in Canada. So Canada, very different from the

837
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:45,700
United States on many levels. If you were to try to explain from the standpoint of empathy,

838
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:52,100
what do you think is the view that sort of opposes immigration or opposes immigration reform? Because

839
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:56,740
even though you're very clearly on this side, you strike me as someone who can also see the

840
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:02,420
other person's viewpoint. I think immigration is one of the hardest issues for us to contend

841
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:07,140
because philosophically, this is a country of immigrants. Practically, this is a country that

842
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:13,700
has lots of issues with its own people. So this is not an easy answer that you say, okay, here's the

843
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:20,020
solution to immigration and anything that we as a country decide as a policy will have pros and cons.

844
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:25,940
So I don't tend to profess that we need to have immigration and we need to have immigration reform

845
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:31,060
and we need to have better controls and we need to figure out what we do with 10 million immigrants.

846
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:37,140
By the way, if we take all the illegal immigrants out of this country, we will not function because

847
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:43,620
so many jobs that get done today that you and I relied directly and indirectly, no one wants to do.

848
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:49,300
Our unemployment rate is sub 4%. So it's not like we have 18% unemployment rate and a line of people

849
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:54,820
who want to do these jobs and immigrants are doing them for half the money. No, there's no people

850
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:59,140
that are sitting waiting to do a job and these jobs no one wants to do.

851
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:05,060
So I think this we underestimate, but it's a real issue and I think we have to deal with

852
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,820
those 10 million people. I think kids should be dealt with separately. These are the DACA kids and

853
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,380
by the way, both Republicans and Democrats agree on the undocumented kids, but they don't want to

854
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:19,940
give it up because then you give up all the immigration issue. Meaning it's the thin end of

855
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:25,540
the wedge or the slippery slope of this. So that's what the argument has been. Well, I'll give you

856
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,620
that. But if we do this and I don't know if the answer is a wall or no wall, I'm not educated

857
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:35,300
enough. We need controls. We need smart immigration. We need, you know, the fact that we have all this

858
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:39,700
PhDs that we're educating at Stanford and all these places, and then we're sending them back

859
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,260
when they want to stay here. That doesn't make sense, right? But it's not an easy answer. And

860
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:49,140
there's a really good argument to say, listen, we can't take our resources and you open up the

861
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,780
gate with Mexico and you have tens of millions of people from Central America and all that coming

862
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:59,140
in. We don't have our house in order enough to be able to absorb that as much of a humanitarian as

863
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:04,580
you want to be. But there should be a thoughtful way that we allow different types of people to

864
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:10,900
come. And some decisions could be very easy, which is any PhD out of our system. Some can be very

865
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:16,020
humanitarian. We're going to bring in this amount of people. Some of them can be very thoughtful in

866
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:19,780
terms of skills, but everything, again, I don't know enough, but there can be a lot around work

867
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:25,460
permits. Like the problem here is that it's an underground. It's an underworld. If you brought

868
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:31,380
it above board and, you know, about five years ago, maybe six years ago, I visited you at Red

869
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:37,540
Ventures and I got to spend a full day watching something you call the business review. I don't

870
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:43,700
know why I came for that, but I knew I was really looking forward to it. We must have been speaking

871
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:49,300
about the way you manage teams. I think it just interested the heck out of me. And I was like,

872
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:54,420
can I come and spend a day watching? And you were like, of course, we'd be honored to have you.

873
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:59,300
I'll preface this by saying, I don't have a degree in business. You went to Harvard, you have an MBA,

874
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,460
but I was around a lot of Harvard MBAs and Stanford MBAs and stuff because I worked at

875
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:07,300
McKinsey. So I know I may have been around the block. I can talk the talk a little bit. And I

876
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:11,620
mean, at least know enough to recognize when people know what they're talking about. I have

877
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:21,140
never seen anything like I saw that day, Rick, your ability to process information, to multitask,

878
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:28,180
to make decisions, to sift through what was not relevant and to always be asking the jugular

879
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:34,100
question in the setting and context of more information than could be processed by any person

880
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:40,420
blew my mind. And to this day, more than five years later, I still talk about that day

881
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:47,300
constantly. And when I ran into Dan, your partner, your co-founder, a few months ago,

882
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,860
it was the first thing I asked him about, how are the business reviews?

883
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:57,860
Can you explain to people listening how this idea came about? Because I suspect that anybody who

884
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:04,020
leads a team in any domain will find this to be illuminating. Yeah, first, I'm humbled by your

885
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:10,260
words. I'm not really sure that I buy all of that. I think that I heard a quote that I loved in life.

886
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,980
There's two kinds of people. I heard it recently from a good friend of mine, the humble and those

887
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:22,020
that are about to be humble. I think our journey was such a struggle for the first four years. I

888
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,740
know if you remember, we raised $2 million and by November, we had no revenues and a hundred grand

889
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:32,180
left. And it took us three years to get back to zero. So when you taste your own blood for a long

890
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:37,780
enough period of time, you realize that a lot of this is you got to fight the fight and you got to

891
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:42,580
stay with it. And you have to stay hungry. And a lot of this from here is avoiding complacency and

892
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:46,740
all the things that end up killing most organizations. So really, you had two deaths.

893
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:54,100
Probably that's true. You basically tasted death on January 15th, 2009. And you tasted death a few

894
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,740
years earlier than that from a business perspective. Yeah. And for me, I gave my words

895
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:06,100
to my friends that I was going to do all I could. And I wanted to go to my reunions. I decided

896
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,700
I'm going to, we're going to hustle and we hustle and we, and by the way, I am so glad like that.

897
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:14,180
It's such a rich part of who we are. The humility that you see in our building. We,

898
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:19,540
we have this beautiful campus, but I see car payments, but people see success and stuff.

899
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:23,860
So the business reviews have evolved and continue to evolve. One of our basic, and you know that

900
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,140
I don't maybe tell folks for a moment what Red Ventures does, even though I don't think that's

901
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,700
relevant to the story. I think if you were running any business would be the same way,

902
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:34,100
but just give people a bit of context. So it's changed twice since you were there, but today

903
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:41,300
we are a significant network of digital assets that all have deep integrations into the different

904
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:47,140
service providers. So we are trying to aggregate lots of services that consumer price by owning

905
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:52,660
assets like the point sky or bank rate of all connect or health lines. So we have about 130

906
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:57,940
million uniques every Monday into our network of assets. And then we do very deep integrations with

907
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:03,620
all the services providers, all the card issuers, all the banks, everybody in healthcare, and

908
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:08,580
basically trying to change the consumer experience digitally. That's a very different business than

909
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:13,060
we were when you were there kind of five years ago. I don't know if you remember, but I don't

910
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:18,100
believe that business should be run with values. And I had this really interesting debate with

911
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:22,660
Meg Whitman at the same event we were at. I didn't get to watch yours. And she's a much

912
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:26,260
more accomplished CEO than I will ever be. And although that, and she, we were talking about

913
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:29,700
culture and she said, Hey, it's all about your values. And then they asked me and I said,

914
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:35,220
to me values is a noun. And I don't know how to run a business with nouns. I know how to run them

915
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:40,340
with verbs. So we have a set of belief statements. By the way, we're not right. Just the way that we

916
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,900
choose to use the word, but we have a series of belief statements that anchor our culture.

917
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,900
And in the middle of that belief statement, the core one in the middle is everything is

918
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:54,020
written in pencil. It's a wonderful belief statement because it helps us recruit. If you're

919
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:58,900
somebody who wants certainty, you want all this stuff, you're never going to fit in. It allows us

920
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:04,180
to evolve and change our mind because the world is changing so fast, so we're not anchored.

921
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:08,980
And then it really gives us permission to experiment because everything is written in

922
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:13,860
pencil. The last one is we believe that our leaving the willpower then we found that is our purpose.

923
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:17,380
So that's the give us some of the others. The first one is we believe in running up the

924
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:22,580
escalators. So that means that business have to play with pace. This is not about speed, speed,

925
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:27,940
speed. This is about pace. The more reps you get, the more you iterate through problems.

926
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:33,460
And this is review is an example of a place that forces reps. And what that means is how do you

927
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,780
organize your organizational design? How do you compensate people? All those things really,

928
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:43,620
really matter. Running a company is really like an orchestra. There's no right way. There's no

929
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,420
perfect song as long as the orchestra is in harmony. Where you get in trouble is where

930
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:52,740
there's dissonance in the orchestra and you see instruments kind of going their own way.

931
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:56,500
So for us, it's really important that we're playing at a high space. That doesn't mean we

932
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:01,300
work to 7pm every night, but we work hard. We're very purposeful. We're small teams.

933
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:07,140
We're decisive. We're okay. Most things in business are pass fail. Yet we are trained

934
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,260
our whole lives for grades. And I think where a lot of leaders get in trouble is this is why

935
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:16,820
people have a hard time prioritizing. This is a pass fail event. I'll put in 20% of the effort.

936
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:21,780
I just pass. So in the business, really understanding what's pass fail and what's great is a really

937
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:27,300
important kind of skill. And you do that when it's pass fail, you just run up the escalator.

938
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,740
So that will be another example. We're great people to work with. We believe that we want to

939
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:34,900
be great people to work with. And I think diversity really matters in a company because

940
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:40,900
you make better decisions. People not only feel accepted if you're welcome, it is a way that it

941
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:46,580
is important. But I think what diversity does, it's lends the opportunity to create inclusion.

942
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:50,020
And if you think about a lot of our social impact work and all of this is about creating

943
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,180
inclusion for people that are not getting access to certain opportunities that we were lucky to

944
01:25:54,180 --> 01:26:00,180
have. So being great to work with is to being very, very much attuned that we all bring something

945
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:04,100
unique to the company and to the table and so forth. But since they're all written in pencil,

946
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,660
they're all going to change. Explain how business review works. I know it has changed by the way,

947
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,740
but even the example of the one I saw, not that you could possibly remember that day five years

948
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:20,340
ago or whatever, but you were basically in a room and you sat at a conference table and there were

949
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:25,380
business leaders basically all presenting to you. And what was the format? How did it work?

950
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:32,100
It's 20 minute meetings. No charts are passed. Nothing in color. None of that. A couple of

951
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,140
charts on the screen are fine, but you got to be able to get to your point.

952
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,860
Right. No big PowerPoint decks were being passed out.

953
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:42,500
No. And you had to start the meeting. Okay. Here's the problem we're trying to solve or here's what

954
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,460
we're trying to talk about. Like you have to define your problem and then you went through it and then

955
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,860
we conclude it with something. So there's many ways to organize meetings. Amazon does it with,

956
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,220
you got to write something. I think it's five pages and you come prepared to the meeting.

957
01:26:55,220 --> 01:27:01,380
There's no right way of doing anything as long as people understand how you are going to calibrate

958
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:06,740
work. But the pace of this was like nothing I'd ever seen because I remember when I was getting

959
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:11,220
ready to come for it and I wanted to sort of be mindful of what I was about to see so I could,

960
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,540
if nothing, participate by asking a question that could be helpful. I remember them saying,

961
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:21,300
okay, so it's, I forget the number, it's 27 meetings. And I was like, well, what do you

962
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,300
mean 27 meetings? And they said they're 20 minutes each. It's a 10 hour day. You know,

963
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:30,260
there's an hour break in there and we keep it. Everybody understands the clock. There is no,

964
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:34,500
you play to the clock. One person would stand up there and explain some problem about,

965
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,860
hey, we're doing this deal with AT&T and it's got to look like this and it's got to look like

966
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,100
this, but boy, we can't get this deal done because blah, blah, blah, blah. And you would ask five

967
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:48,260
incredibly pointed questions. And I was like, wow, I mean, that's amazing because 10 minutes earlier

968
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:53,620
you were hearing about something totally unrelated and you could pivot so quickly to this. And then

969
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,380
you'd exit with a plan, which is okay, great. Here's an idea. You're going to go back to your

970
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:00,900
counterpart at AT&T. This is going to be the idea you're going to pitch boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

971
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:05,540
we'll see you in a month. Let me open a window. I think it's an interesting thing. I learned this

972
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:10,180
from a good friend of mine that anything you do in life should be a threefer, meaning at least

973
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,420
threefer. Some things can be a fourfer and most people are happy to get a twofer. And what I mean

974
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:19,060
is you can do something that has many purposes. The quick example is you're going to go play golf

975
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:23,620
because you play golf. That's a onefer. If you go play golf at a beautiful course, that's a twofer,

976
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:27,780
at a beautiful course with your best friends and with great weather. Great. So in business,

977
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:35,300
the business review is a fourfer for us. It's a way to force prioritization. It's a way to train

978
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:40,740
people how to present. It's a high stakes environment. Your team was so impressive. You're

979
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:45,060
absolutely right about that. I've watched people. I mean, I am a real stickler for having information

980
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:51,620
presented and it just kills me to watch people who can't get to the point. And there was not one

981
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:56,740
example in 27 meetings of somebody who couldn't get to the point. I think our strength is there's

982
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:03,780
2,025 year olds at Red Ventures that have been trained at a level because of all this exercise

983
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,340
that it's great. It's the best business school for a lot of these young adults. The third is it

984
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:13,380
forces decision making. A lot of those things were tough decisions and the worst decision is a no

985
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:19,860
decision. So it forces decision. And the fourth is that acculturates. So it's a very much there were

986
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:24,900
teaching moments. There were things that happened. You showed up with certain things, some things.

987
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:29,940
So I'd like to set up as an organization if we're going to invest that kind of energy and time

988
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:35,380
something that has currency in many different directions. How did you sharpen your sword to

989
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:39,620
get to that point? Is it literally just the reps? It's reps. Intuition is nothing else and haven't

990
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:44,420
seen something before. And when you start getting all this pattern recognition, it's because you've

991
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:50,100
seen so many times a movie. And the key is not to see the movie. Peter, I think is to be introspective

992
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:54,740
about what happened in the movie. So a lot of times I'll finish a negotiation. I'm like,

993
01:29:54,740 --> 01:30:00,100
oh, I screwed that up. I did not read that cue. I was too aggressive. Last night I had a dinner and

994
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:04,420
it was really great. And the last five minutes I fumbled it. As soon as I got in the car, I'm like,

995
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:08,420
what did you just do? And I don't want to make you talk too much about it, but can you say a little

996
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:13,300
bit more about what it is that you think you fumbled? When you do a lot of interpersonal skills,

997
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:19,700
the other person is talking to you nonstop without words. And a lot of this is knowing when you stop.

998
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:26,740
In my last two statements, I lost some of the momentum I got with the other 55 minutes. And I

999
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:31,460
just knew it in their eyes. That doesn't matter, right? That's just part of the journey. So my

1000
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:37,700
point being is you got to be super self-awareness is really important in life. Self-management is

1001
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:42,100
the key to success. Most people are like, I'm self-aware. Well, can you self-regulate? Can you

1002
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:46,260
self-manage? Can you think about all the things you think about and you teach around longevity

1003
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,580
and nutrition and all that is the self-management part of that that matters. I would take it one

1004
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:54,580
step further. I mean, I think the self-management on the emotional level might be the single most

1005
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:59,780
important of them all. To manage how you eat and exercise, I think is much easier than to manage

1006
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:04,900
your thoughts and your emotions in terms of how you interact with the world. That's not true.

1007
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:09,940
Yesterday morning I had a negotiation. Someone flew in before I came to New York and he was a pro.

1008
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:14,980
And the moment he sat down, I'm like, oh, this is going to be a good one. He was a master chess

1009
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:19,460
player. So I knew every time they asked something, he wasn't asking something. So you're constantly

1010
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:22,660
going, okay, what's the question behind the question? What is it that you're trying to

1011
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:28,420
angle? What is it you're trying to find? And good negotiation is when you can find currency

1012
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:32,500
that they value more than you do. And then you find a way to make it work for everybody.

1013
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:37,300
When someone is a very good negotiator and they're trying to do that, then you can almost play the

1014
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:41,940
inverse game is that can you create an impression of something so that you can create value for

1015
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:45,060
something so that you can get something else and then you're reading what they're doing. So it's

1016
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:50,820
really fun. Do you teach this deliberately to your teams? Because I got to tell you, I don't think

1017
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:56,500
that reps alone are sufficient. In other words, you could put me into a hundred deals to negotiate.

1018
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:01,780
I don't think I could ever extract the insights that you seem to extract. I think you're doing

1019
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:06,500
something at a meta level that few of us do, which is it's what you said. It's not just seeing the

1020
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:13,300
movie. It's knowing what the movie means and knowing how to recreate pieces of the movie in

1021
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:17,220
subsequent movies. That's a totally different skill. I don't have it. I know that for a fact.

1022
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:21,220
To start by the way, I don't think I'm great at it. I think there's much better people. So this

1023
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,740
is a journey that there's always someone better than you. So I'm in this constant journey and

1024
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:30,180
want to get better at all these aspects. So the moment you think I'd finished negotiations,

1025
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:33,620
discussions were like, oh, there was a pro at the table and it wasn't me.

1026
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:43,300
That was a masterful event. It was happening. You kind of laugh, but when you're so attuned to it,

1027
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:48,500
every interaction is a game of influence with your kids, with your spouse, with everything else.

1028
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,540
And it's not a negotiation. Negotiation means someone wins, someone loses. You're constantly

1029
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:57,060
trying to influence with your thoughts and then you're allowing others, people to influence you.

1030
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:05,060
What type of person do you run from in business? Negative energy, selfish.

1031
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,940
What are the telltale signs of that? Because when that's obvious,

1032
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:11,460
those people usually don't even get in the door. What are the subtle signs of that?

1033
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:16,420
Like for us, pronouns really matter. We versus I or?

1034
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:21,220
Yes, but it's the subtlety on when you say it. Are you taking the credit for things?

1035
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:26,420
So you may use the we, but it's all about you, right? So it's the next level of all of that.

1036
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:31,140
So how do you internalize things? I'm looking for people that are really ambitious

1037
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:34,500
for something bigger than themselves. And in that journey, they want to do well.

1038
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:39,380
They want to provide whatever it is, but it's much bigger. If someone is interested in just

1039
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,540
one thing, I think we all have a competitive drive, for example. So when I look at people,

1040
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,620
I'm trying to understand, and this is a little bit what I'm trying to explore in the current

1041
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:51,860
podcast we're doing with all the super athletes is what's driving your competitive spirit.

1042
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,100
And I've kind of honed it down. And again, I played the Rises from somebody. So,

1043
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:02,260
but you're either driven by competing and killing a competitor. Think of Muhammad Ali or somebody,

1044
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:07,940
like he needed to see the other person stand over them. You're driven by fear of failure.

1045
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:12,340
I just interviewed an erotic in the first episode of this podcast. And you can tell he's like,

1046
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:19,060
listen, I was driven completely by fear. But what you see is the first person is a warrior and the

1047
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:26,180
warrior, unless they evolve, they know they'll lose the last battle and therefore they quit.

1048
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:30,420
And you see it in sometimes in boxing, they come back from one more and that's when they lose and

1049
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:37,620
whatever. The person that is motivated by fear, eventually taps out out of exhaustion. And the

1050
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:42,500
more successful they become, the harder the fall, they're like, I got to run. And I see a lot of

1051
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:48,820
friends of mine who quit at 48 50 52, and they have all this gas in the tank. And I realized that many

1052
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:54,580
of them are driven by fear of failure. And they just don't want that. The value of success is so

1053
01:34:54,580 --> 01:35:00,260
much less than the pain of failing that they can't take the trade anymore. The success became

1054
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:07,220
too significant. The third in where I'm like really focused on is, is the people that love to compete

1055
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:13,300
because they just love to get better all the time. It's a race against themselves. One is a race

1056
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,140
against somebody. The other one is a race against fear. The other one is a race against yourself.

1057
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:25,300
And I find people that have that energy have a better balance about it and can run the longer

1058
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:30,260
race. And if you see people like I know lots of guys that are in their sixties or seventies that

1059
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:36,020
are still refusing to let the old man or old woman in is because they're driven by the game

1060
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,980
by getting better. Professionally, how much of your energy is into your business versus your

1061
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:48,340
philanthropy? Not time, but energy. It was say a world percent six years ago. It's probably 15%

1062
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:55,220
now. Going to go to 30. Eventually it will be 50. What do you want to accomplish philanthropically

1063
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:59,380
that you have not yet accomplished? And not just necessarily at scale. Is there a problem

1064
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:06,740
that you have not yet gone after because A, you haven't acquired the knowledge. B, you haven't

1065
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:10,820
thought of the angle at which you can have the most leverage, but there's a problem that's nagging.

1066
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:17,140
Again, because there's no winning, you're just advancing something forward. I am very motivated

1067
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:22,900
by reversing a bunch of the trends in Puerto Rico. I'm not going to solve Puerto Rico. I

1068
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:27,220
may barely do anything, but I think I can do something to start reversing some of the trends.

1069
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:32,180
I think the bigger opportunity I see is how do companies become a force of good?

1070
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:37,140
How do business leaders see themselves and their responsibility to be a force of good in their

1071
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:43,220
communities? I think this platforms or businesses are so powerful, not just monetarily, but as

1072
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:50,500
engines of people and problem solving and access to opportunities that I want us to become a bit of a

1073
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:56,500
beacon of like, wow, you can be successful and be good at the same time. And they don't have to

1074
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:01,060
come against each other. Do you think that public companies can do that? Is that part of your

1075
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:06,180
decision to stay private? I just, I don't like authority. So I hate having a stock ticker on my

1076
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:12,020
head. So that's why I don't want to be public. But I think public companies today, this is a Milton

1077
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:16,660
Friedman kind of challenge. And Simon talks about it in that book is shareholder at the center.

1078
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:21,140
That's changing. Look at what the business council just announced in the last couple of months. Hey,

1079
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:27,220
there's a bunch of stakeholders here. These are pendulums that swing when we get a fairly far

1080
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:32,820
left precedent in our country. A lot of this stuff may change. And so these are pendulums. This is

1081
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:38,420
this is not new. What challenges you the most in your business today? You get a great challenge.

1082
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:43,300
You play basketball. It's still such a huge part of your life. You are so competitive with yourself

1083
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:47,540
in basketball. What are you trying to sharpen your sword in business? I mean, you talked a lot about

1084
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:52,980
negotiation. Obviously, I can sense in you this passion to be better and better and better at that

1085
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:57,620
and to understand the relationship and the dynamic because obviously the best negotiation is one and

1086
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:03,540
when both people win. What other skills are you honing? The answer you may not like, but I feel

1087
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:09,940
like I'm over my head right now. This is so much fun. I'm like trying to run the matrix. We are in

1088
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:16,180
seven industries from financial services to healthcare to entertainment. We're building a

1089
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:20,900
lot of tech and I'm not a techie and we're a techie company. We have 800 engineers and I'm not an

1090
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:26,660
engineer. How many total employees right now? 3200. We have 200 employees in London. We have 110 in

1091
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:33,620
Brazil. You have to know countries. You have to know markets. Most challenging is we grew organically

1092
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:39,140
for a long, long time. We were almost like a culture of settlers. You came through our system

1093
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:43,780
and we've done a number of acquisitions and now we become a culture of immigrants.

1094
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:48,580
When your culture is your competitive advantage, which I think 100% it is,

1095
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:55,540
and you have added so much newness to it, leading our way through it is really challenging. I have

1096
01:38:55,540 --> 01:39:00,740
no idea what I'm doing. I'm like Forrest Gump. I just show up every day and I give it really all my

1097
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:06,420
effort and I can't get fired, which is good. And if it goes to zero, it goes to zero. I don't care.

1098
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:11,380
Somehow I wouldn't bet on that. No, for sure. I am 100% sure that if Red Ventures went to zero.

1099
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:15,060
No, no, no, no. I'm not sure. Oh, that it will get zero. I could in 30 days, I'll be super happy to

1100
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:19,140
go to zero. I'm farm purpose and something else. None of this stuff really matters. There are a few

1101
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:24,820
people who can say that with more certainty than you, but of course that's probably exactly why it

1102
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:32,100
doesn't happen. I'd certainly bet against it. If you go back to the morning of Thursday, January

1103
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:37,540
15th, 2009, and you could run into yourself as he's leaving his hotel, rushing to the airport,

1104
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,060
and you couldn't tell him what was going to happen, but you could say anything to him. What would you

1105
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:48,900
say? Don't miss that flight. That was the most remarkable, remarkable gift I ever got. And

1106
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:55,300
I feel bad. There's people that were on that flight that will never fly again. And other people on

1107
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:00,100
that flight that still can't sleep well. And I am really sorry for that. I'm really lucky that

1108
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:06,340
the way it landed in my system was it gave me urgency, it gave me purpose, it gave me humility.

1109
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:13,220
It gave me a game to play, which is a game with no regrets. Rick, I can't thank you enough. I don't

1110
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:16,820
know what I did deserve two hours of your time today, but you've given a great gift to a lot of

1111
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:22,420
people. An honor to be here. You are one of a kind. I learn so much from you every time. And

1112
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:29,700
thank you for being my friend. You can find all of this information and more at PeterAttiaMD.com
