00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia. The drive

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,000
is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,700
with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,800
years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,220
this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,140
a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more

00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,740
information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:47,980
In this episode, I interview my good friend Dominic Dagestino. Dom, as he is known by,

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,660
is a professor at the University of South Florida. His PhD is in neuroscience and that's

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,340
where he got his background. But Dom is probably most recognizable to people listening to this

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,900
because he is certainly one of the experts on ketosis and that's in all variants of it.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,060
So starvation ketosis, nutritional ketosis, and in particular the use of exogenous ketones.

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,060
Gosh, Dom and I go way back. We met probably a little over five years ago and instantly

14
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,500
formed a friendship around our obsessive N of one experiments. Although I will say he

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,500
is closer to winning a Darwin Award on the basis of his N of ones than I am. A couple

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,740
notes about this podcast. First, this is highly technical at times. And in fact, we'll timestamp

17
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,740
it in the show notes, but I would say roughly the first hour is even a little more technical

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,340
than I had intended to go. I think part of the issue is just once I get talking with

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,900
Dom about this stuff, I couldn't stop asking him questions. And I think there were times

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,500
when I guess we forgot we were recording a podcast and it was just us getting really

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,060
technical. I don't think it's too technical to follow if you have some background in understanding

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,780
of biochemistry, but we'll do our best in these show notes to make sure that we're given

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,060
even the recreational user necessary tools to follow this. Now that said, if you get

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,380
20 minutes into this thing and you're like, I don't understand what the hell these guys

25
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,580
are talking about, do not hesitate to skip ahead. There's a lot of stuff that gets later

26
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,900
on into the podcast and this is a long podcast. It's nearly three hours. There's a lot of

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,420
stuff we get into at the end that I think will be kind of the stuff people really want

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,820
to know, even if they don't want to get in the gory details. So in particular, we talk

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,860
very specifically about all of the ketones and I'm getting a lot of questions about Peter,

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,300
what's the difference between a ketone ester or a ketone salt? What are the mono esters?

31
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,540
What are the diesters? Where does MCT fit into this? What about the caprylic acid and

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,780
how many should we be using this one versus this one? And what are the advantages and

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,140
what are the benefits of this? This is going to be your dissertation level course in that

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,020
subject matter. The other thing that we get into at the very end, and we almost end on

35
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,460
this, but again, look to the time stamps for exactly where it is, is we get into what I

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,620
consider one of the most interesting discussions I've ever had on what I sort of loosely describe

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,420
as a metabolic oncologist playbook. So when I asked Dom about this, he had just some of

38
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,820
the best ideas. He was really impressed by the breadth and the organization of his thinking

39
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,460
around this. Now I want to point out something here and I say it in the show, but it's really

40
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,820
important for me to caveat this here. This cannot be construed as medical advice. Dom

41
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,860
is not a medical doctor. He doesn't pretend to be one on TV. He is a research scientist

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,900
who focuses on basic and translational research. He collaborates with lots of physicians. He

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,980
has trials, but ultimately Dom is not offering medical advice and frankly, nor is anybody

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,260
or nor should anybody be on a podcast. So this information I asked because I get asked

45
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,020
this stuff a lot and frankly, I don't know enough about this sort of outreaching and

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,460
outlying metabolic therapies out there, but I hope that if people are listening to this

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,140
and they're afflicted by cancer, which statistically speaking is obviously going to happen given

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,380
that one in six people are going to get cancer in their lifetime. I hope that if some of

49
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,620
this stuff does scratch someone's sort of desire to understand more that they can use

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,500
some of the resources we're going to link to, to potentially identify the right places

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,180
where either clinical trial will be taking place or they could at least pursue some of

52
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,780
these things under the appropriate medical guidance. I could go on and on about other

53
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,580
nits and nats in here, but honestly, I think the best thing to do right now is probably

54
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,220
pay a little bit of attention, maybe more than usual to the show notes, treat this as

55
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,460
a little bit like a buffet, go to the places you want to go to. Of course, I would recommend

56
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,380
the entire thing if you really have an interest in this subject matter. And I hope that this

57
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,460
podcast is going to answer many of the questions that I see people asking out there. I actually

58
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,940
learned quite a bit on this and I tend to know the subject matter reasonably well. So

59
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,420
without any further delay, welcome to the podcast with Dominic DeGostino.

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
Hey Dom.

61
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Hey Pete.

62
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
How are you, man?

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm doing well. How are you?

64
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,620
I'm doing really well and I'm really grateful for you making the trip all the way up here.

65
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,060
I know that in part you're visiting family, but it's great that you've carved out time

66
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,860
to come from New Jersey all the way up to the lovely city of Manhattan.

67
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,060
I appreciate the invite and love being here. Yeah, I love to visit.

68
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,660
Well, there's going to be a number of people listening to this today who are already incredibly

69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,060
familiar with who you are, the work you've done. I certainly consider you probably one

70
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,460
of the two most authoritative persons on the subject we're going to get into today. But

71
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,460
for anybody who's listening to this who is not entirely familiar with you, I suspect

72
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,460
by the end of today they're going to want to get a lot more familiar with you. So I

73
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,460
actually remember the day we met and it's kind of funny. I was in Florida giving that

74
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,460
talk at IHMC and I knew of you by name, but I didn't know who you were or what you looked

75
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,460
like, so I wouldn't have recognized you. And I gave a talk that I was going to give to

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,460
you. I recognized you and I gave a talk. This would have been 2011 maybe, maybe 2012.

77
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,460
And at the end of the talk there was like a Q&A and it was a long Q&A and it just went

78
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,460
on and on and on. And then you asked a question now, I wish I could say I remember the question,

79
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,460
but I knew from the question that that guy knows what he's talking about. And then of

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,460
course, Ken Ford, who knew us both, had basically arranged for us to all have dinner that night.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,700
So that was the night we met. And it was really, at least from my standpoint, not to

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,300
embarrass you. It was like a love at first sight. I was just so giddy to be able to sit

83
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,500
there and have dinner with you.

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,540
Same, same here. Yeah, I knew who you were and I was looking for that talk and I made

85
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,940
the drive up there and I felt like we were connected before we even connected. We're

86
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,580
definitely on the same wavelength on this stuff.

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,300
Yeah, you've got such an interesting history that we're going to get into about how you

88
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,260
got interested in this space. But also I think one of the things that many people might

89
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,740
not appreciate fully that I appreciated just because of the convenience and luxury of how

90
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,940
we met was just your interest in self experimentation as well. And sometimes when you're studying

91
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,500
something or interested in something that is not entirely mainstream yet, you have to

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
bootstrap it and you have to look at like limited amounts of animal data, limited amounts

93
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,220
of in vitro data, and then sometimes combine it with insights that you get through early

94
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,180
experimentation on yourself.

95
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,900
Absolutely. So I immerse myself in what I'm doing.

96
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
I think that's sort of why we connected.

97
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,420
That's how we learn. Yeah, that's really the best way to learn.

98
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,300
So you did your PhD in neuroscience, correct?

99
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah.

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
What were you-

101
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
In physiology.

102
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,860
In physiology. So you're finishing your PhD and you're what, planning to do a post-doc?

103
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,740
Yeah. I did it in the neural control of autonomic regulation. So the brainstem mechanism sort

104
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:47,260
of sense O2, oxygen and CO2 and modulate respiratory rhythm generation and also cardiovascular

105
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,420
sympathetic tone to the heart, like those neurons and how they sense oxygen. During

106
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,260
my PhD, I got interested in diving physiology and it was amazing to me that we don't really

107
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:04,480
understand how our brains and our physiology functions in extreme environments as it pertains

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,920
to elevated hyperbaric pressure, elevated oxygen, CO2, anesthetic gases, for example.

109
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,120
We know the anesthetic potency of a gas is proportional to its lipid solubility, but

110
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,080
we don't really know what that means. Like why, what's happening at the level of the

111
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,600
membrane of the mitochondria? So my postdoctoral fellowship was actually developing technologies

112
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,520
to study that, and that would be hyperbaric atomic force microscopy. And that was like,

113
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,960
that's what I just delved into for-

114
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,760
So how does that work? So I know what hyperbaric means. I know what microscopy means. Tell

115
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
me about the part about the force.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,480
The first term for atomic force microscopy was scanning probe microscopy. And instead

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,280
of using light or electrons, it uses a very sharp tip probe that can be so sharp it's

118
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,880
mono-atomic. And it essentially raster scans across the sample and can detect very subtle

119
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,720
changes in the topography of the sample that you're scanning. So it actually spawned the

120
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,800
whole nanotechnology world. So this particular instrument was used to characterize materials

121
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,080
and really helped develop Silicon Valley in many ways. And it's a microscope that we took

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,240
basically an off-the-shelf atomic force microscope that gives you the scanning resolution of

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
an electron microscope, but also has the capacity to image living cells. And took this

124
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,400
technology and put it inside an environmental chamber, a hyperbaric chamber. And part of

125
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,840
my project was doing the electrical, the fluid, and the gas penetrations to make the thing

126
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,960
functional and also doing a series of studies and calibration tests to determine that we

127
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,160
could reliably make hyperbaric atomic force microscopy measurements inside this chamber.

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,720
And with this technology, it gives us insight at the nanoscopic level of what's happening

129
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,400
to the mitochondria, to the cell membrane. So I got a grant through the Department of

130
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,720
Defense, which they give these equipment grants to develop this technology and also a grant

131
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,760
to use it. And then later another grant to put a confocal microscope. You might have heard

132
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
of a laser scanning.

133
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:22,120
I actually used a confocal microscope in my undergrad thesis to do optical sectioning

134
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
of...

135
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Tom?

136
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,520
No, because I was an engineer. So I was interested in a question of, did the direction of extrusion

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,040
that you put on a tibial plateau, so when you do joint replacements, does the direction

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,840
in which you extrude what's called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, does that predict

139
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,160
its fracture? And it turned out it did. But the tool to help us measure that was this

140
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,200
confocal microscope. So that was my introduction to high-end microscopy.

141
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,560
It's an amazing tool, yeah. So the second grant I got...

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,080
Yeah, you got it. They're the toys that we have in the lab. So that was the next phase

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,280
of sort of my experiments was installing a laser scanning confocal so we could optically

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,520
section individual cells and look at the mitochondria inside the cells under graded levels of oxygen

145
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,080
and hyperbaric pressure, essentially, pressure of an inert gas like helium, nitrogen. So

146
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,720
to simulate, for example, a Navy SEAL dive or a deep sea dive. And in the context of

147
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,800
developing this technology and imaging a wide variety of cells from primary neurons

148
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,400
to glioblastoma cells to human dermal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, I noticed that cancer

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:40,600
cells would produce proportionally more superoxide anion, which is the precursor oxygen free radical

150
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,160
that comes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a consequence of normal

151
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,640
metabolism. And the cancer cells look to have what appeared to be chock full of mitochondria,

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,760
and they were moving around very dynamic structures. And under normal levels of oxygen,

153
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,720
they kind of produced a normal level of superoxide anion or oxygen free radicals. But when we hit the

154
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,280
cancer cells with hyperbaric oxygen, the superoxide production went off the charts.

155
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,560
And it was very apparent to me that they were producing excess free radicals. And as we made

156
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,360
measurements over time, it was very apparent that it was accelerating membrane lipid peroxidation,

157
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,560
which we use a variety of tests, one is a T Mars test where we look at malandialbhyde production.

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,080
And the technology the atomic force microscopy allows us to look at very subtle changes of the

159
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,960
surface of the membrane. You measure the perturbations on the surface of the membrane

160
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,760
and nanoscopic changes. And we look at membrane roughness, and you could look at the roughness of

161
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,400
the membrane and calculate that and that can correlate to membrane lipid peroxidation and it

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,200
correlates the numbers correlate well. So what you're looking at is the physical correlate of

163
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,800
membrane lipid peroxidation when you capture that data with atomic force microscopy. Is that clear?

164
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
Let me back up and make sure I can disaggregate this into steps. So the first thing that you

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,600
notice is lots of mitochondria in cancer cells. And these are what types of cancer lines?

166
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,840
The main one that I was working with that I ended up publishing the paper neuroscience with

167
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,200
was U87 glioblastoma cells. And they're taken out of a 44 year old patient.

168
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
So a human cell line.

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,040
Human cell line. A lot of people use it.

170
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,840
And these are astrocytes, right? These are not neurons.

171
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, of a glial origin. Yes.

172
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,840
So observation one, lots of mitochondria. Okay, good to know. Because obviously there's a

173
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,720
understanding that Warburg pointed out that says, hey, like, you know, these things largely are

174
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
anaerobic, not aerobic. So they shouldn't really need much mitochondria. And then what you're

175
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
saying is you put them into a hyperbaric environment. And how hyperbaric, how many times

176
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
atmospheric pressure would you need?

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,000
I saw the observation at, so normal oxygen is 0.2 ATA, we say atmosphere is absolute.

178
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,320
And I saw a big jump up in superoxide anion production at 0.95.

179
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
So that's almost five times atmospheric pressure.

180
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,640
That's almost five times. Yeah. And actually 0.95, if you're breathing produces a PO2 in the brain,

181
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,840
if similar to breathing 2.5 atm of oxygen. And then I actually went up to it, did the experiment

182
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:29,360
with 3.25 atm of oxygen. And then that basically was cooking the cells from the inside out the

183
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,360
mitochondria were producing so much oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species. So

184
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,080
superoxide anion can go to hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction through hydrogen

185
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,280
peroxide. And that can be driven in different ways. And I basically saw the mitochondria exploding

186
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,080
under hyperbaric oxygen conditions. And I had never seen that before.

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,680
Do you have a control in this of non-cancerous glial cells that are not doing the same thing?

188
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,360
Yeah. So most of my experiments prior to this was like smooth muscle cells I was looking at

189
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,080
and primary cortical neurons, primary hippocampal neurons. At the time, I was just basically looking

190
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,640
at I was doing these experiments to validate the tool that we had just built. So no one actually

191
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,760
had imaged living cells under hyperbaric conditions because no one had a hyperbaric microscope for.

192
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,720
So I didn't actually know what I was even looking at. I was not a cancer biologist. I knew that

193
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
cancer cells were rapidly proliferating. So they probably had amped up metabolism,

194
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
but it was just a very interesting observation to me. It was very interesting that they're also

195
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
dying. And I figured cancer cells should be hardy and that you should be able to throw everything,

196
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,840
but the kitchen sink at them and they should live. And then when I saw them basically the

197
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,960
mitochondria exploding and the membrane starting to become permeable and necrotic cell death,

198
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,040
I became more and more interested in that. And we ended up publishing the observation,

199
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
but I didn't actually know what it meant. Like I published it more like here, I built this cool

200
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,480
tool and we did this experiment. And I was actually just looking at the cell line as a model system

201
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,320
to study reactive oxygen species and oxygen toxicity seizures, because part of the military

202
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,760
was funding me to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxygen toxicity seizures.

203
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,680
And it's thought that high levels of oxygen creates oxidative stress and that perturbs

204
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,920
the brain in a way that causes these grand mal tonic, clonic seizures. And we were developing

205
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,840
tools. You can't understand it unless you know fundamentally what's happening at the level of

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,040
the cell and the mitochondria. So I want to come back to that because that now makes sense for why

207
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,320
diving could increase that risk. Because if you're using an oxygen rebreather,

208
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,120
you're getting a higher concentration of oxygen and then you're under multiple atmospheres of

209
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,440
pressure. You now basically replicated in a person what you were seeing a cell. But going back to the

210
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,080
cell thing for a sec, do the free radicals that get generated destroy other cells beyond the cell

211
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,840
that is generating the free radical? Or is the problem largely contained to the cell?

212
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,040
It's a dose dependent phenomenon. And we were studying cells in this particular experiment

213
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,840
in a Petri dish or on a cover slip. So you have sort of like an intact neural network or cellular

214
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,640
network. So the cells are literally connected to one another, unlike a tissue slice where you have

215
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,160
an intact cytol architecture, which that's a little bit different. But the oxygen free radicals and

216
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,160
the substances that the cells produce do actually influence other cells adjacent to it or juxtaposed

217
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,240
to it. That's obvious from some of the experiments we do in cell signaling. If one cell becomes

218
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,160
permeable and we could detect cell death with various molecules like Athenium homodimer one,

219
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,600
when that cell dies, it can stimulate excitotoxic events in the surrounding cells.

220
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Same thing happens with the cancer cells. It's obvious that cancer cells use reactive oxygen

221
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,960
species for growth and proliferation. And I know this is something that may be contradicting

222
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
to many people. We view free radicals as something that's damaging that the cell needs to get rid of,

223
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,520
but they're very powerful signaling molecules, especially for cancer cells and growth and

224
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,360
proliferation and in normal tissues. And you mean nuclear signaling?

225
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,360
In nuclear signaling and activation of transcription factors. Basically, there are

226
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,800
many, I study as neuroscientists, I study redox sensitive ion channels. So the redox state of

227
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,000
an ion channel can dictate the permeability and the gating functions of that ion channel,

228
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,440
which is intimately linked to cellular excitability by influencing the resting membrane potential.

229
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,320
So as a neuroscientist, you can study a very particular and cells have hundreds of thousands

230
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,560
of ion channels, specific ion channels that are redox regulated. But what was obvious is that

231
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,120
cancer cells have elevated rates of reactive oxygen species that they use for growth and

232
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,760
proliferation. And it also fuels metastasis and invasiveness of cancer cells. And because they

233
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:15,840
overproduce oxygen free radicals in the context of high oxygen, you can push the cells above their

234
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,440
antioxidant potential and then trigger apoptosis. So it's like a double edged sword.

235
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
It's basically a U-shaped curve or inverted, depending on how you want to think about it,

236
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
where the cancer cell is not only optimized to survive, it's optimized to thrive at a certain

237
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
level of elevated reactive oxygen species. An elevated level, but if you go too far,

238
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,120
it becomes counter. Yeah. So they have elevated endogenous antioxidant capacity, right? But

239
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,440
because their mitochondria are defective in many ways, and there's that term is kind of

240
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,480
controversial. Some people think the Warburg effect definitely endows the cells many benefits,

241
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,360
but the aberrant activity of the mitochondria is creating this excess free radicals and

242
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,160
hyperbaric oxygen and chemotherapeutic drugs that augment oxidative stress are therapeutic modalities

243
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,960
that can be used. It was very apparent to me seeing that in a hyperbaric chamber,

244
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
looking at a microscope, looking at these cells, and no one had seen it before because no one had

245
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,040
hyperbaric microscopy. Nobody had the tool. Yeah. And that kind of, at the same time,

246
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,800
I was growing these cells under different conditions. I was very interested in lactate,

247
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,600
and I became interested in ketones too, just not for this reason. I was not yet interested in the

248
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,080
ketogenic diet. I was looking at it for a different reason actually, but I noticed that

249
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:44,400
the cancer cells were not growing as rapidly as they should in the context of 1, 2, and 5 millimolar

250
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,280
of beta-hydroxybutyrate, which I was growing them in. And I thought the lab tech may have been doing

251
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,400
something that was influencing, but she assured me it wasn't. So we would pull the media off and put

252
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,480
regular media on without the ketones and the cancer cells would start growing rapidly. Why

253
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,360
were you using ketones in the media? Well, I was looking at a variety of different substrates back

254
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,800
in 2008 and nine. I see. So you were just saying lactate glucose, BHB. Yeah, 2-deoxyglucose. Yeah,

255
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,160
lactate. I was using a variety of different, and ketones were like, well, let's just see what

256
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,600
ketones do. You know, that ketones were something that the body would produce in fasting, but I

257
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,680
didn't, I didn't even know the anti-seizure properties of the ketogenic diet. I just thought

258
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,640
of it as like, what do brains, and a couple odd papers that came out like ketones could be used

259
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,680
as fuel. I was very interested in alpha L poly lactate, various forms of lactate that could be

260
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,600
used to preserve brain energy metabolism in the face of oxidative stress. And the ketones just,

261
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,280
they sort of shined. So basically what they were able to do was allow the neurons to preserve their

262
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,120
membrane potential and normal cellular function, even in the context of extreme oxidative stress.

263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And it made sense, right? Because the ketogenic diet, you know, I started looking more into this

264
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,520
and discovered that the ketogenic diet was a very effective anti-seizure strategy, even when drugs

265
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,760
fail. About two thirds of patients respond favorably. You get, you know, 10 or 15% or super

266
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,800
responders that never have seizures again, you can get them off your meds. And it was probably

267
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,160
working through a mechanism independent of any anti-seizure compound because the ketogenic diet

268
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,640
worked when drugs failed, you know, suggesting it was working through a different mechanism or many

269
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,680
mechanisms kind of in synchrony. So the tools that we developed really sort of started to allow us to

270
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,680
understand from a cellular and molecular mechanism how ketones are working. And I was looking at other

271
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,600
compounds at the time, but it's just, as I kept studying, I was looking at sigma receptor agonists.

272
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,640
I was looking at other antioxidants, many different antioxidants and combinations of

273
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,560
antioxidants that were catalase, memetics, superoxide, dismutase, memetics, you know,

274
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,400
all these things that were in theory, they should work really well, but nothing was really working

275
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,960
as well as ketones. And it also motivated me because when I discovered the ketogenic diet

276
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,120
was a grossly underutilized anti-seizure strategy. I was like, wow, I could go back to my nutrition

277
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,880
roots because when I was undergrad, I majored in nutrition science, but I didn't pursue a PhD in

278
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,200
nutrition because nutrition was not like a real science. Like there was no jobs in nutrition and

279
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
in the 90s was a decade of the brain. So it was like, let me try to get into a cellular

280
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,840
neuroscience program. So I kind of just left nutrition and this was my opportunity to bring

281
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:48,480
nutrition back into my research projects into the lab. But my going back to that BHB in the media.

282
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Did you have the same amount of glucose in as you had in the BHB free media?

283
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
Yeah. So we did everything in the context of the same amount of glucose.

284
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,760
In other words, the benefit was from the addition of BHB, not the reduction of glucose.

285
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,720
Absolutely. Yep. And as I started to get into the literature and read into this a little bit more,

286
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,960
we started doing glucose subtraction and adding ketones and saw that normal healthy neurons

287
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,920
functioned and thrived in a low glucose environment if the ketones were present,

288
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:31,120
but the cancer cells would die. And this was also replicated and published in various neuroblastoma

289
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,600
cell lines. And I think Skinner was one person that published and I found that he was at

290
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,360
University of Florida, but he was a fellow and just had left the school at the time.

291
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,120
And then I went up there and gave a talk, I think in 2010. And that further, that got me more and

292
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,920
more interested in studying cancer, even though it was not funded to do so. It was like this pet

293
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,000
project that was completely very intellectually stimulating to me and something that I could not

294
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,120
just shelf and come back to at a later time. I had to, I felt like the environment was kind of hot

295
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,400
for this. So I just kept reaching out to different scientists and showing them my data

296
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,520
and asking them to explain it like top level cancer biologists. And then I stumbled across

297
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
Tom Seiford actually. Speculating. Why do you think Tom was one of the few people that latched

298
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,200
onto this? Was it simply because he'd already been thinking the same things or because it's

299
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
really, it is interesting when you think about how many really interesting and impressive people in

300
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,480
cancer have not sort of come around to thinking about this stuff. Now in 2009, I think it was 2009,

301
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,120
and I'm sure you have read this paper a thousand times. It sort of, I think it was the first

302
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,320
obvious mainstream view of this was the Matt van der Heiden, Lou Cantley, Craig Thompson

303
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,360
science paper. Was that 09? That sound about right? Which reminded me of, they had a couple papers

304
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,840
around that time. Which one was? Well, this is the one that offered an explanation for the Warburg

305
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,200
effect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was basically an energy synthetic. That's right. It was expanding

306
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,560
the biomass, directing metabolites to do that. Yeah. And that was interesting because that's

307
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,880
a different explanation than presumably Tom would offer, right? It's accepting the Warburg effect

308
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:19,120
as a very powerful, but the question that Tom has really set out to address, no one is arguing the

309
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:28,800
Warburg effect is present, but the initiation of the Warburg effect and that damaged mitochondrial

310
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:37,040
respiration causes an energetic crisis that kicks on the oncogenes that basically turn on the genes

311
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,600
that are the essence of the Warburg effect. Well, let's describe the effect. I should, I'm going to

312
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
take for granted that everyone listening knows what the Warburg effect is. So for someone who doesn't

313
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,000
know, how would you explain the Warburg effect? The Warburg effect simply stated is insufficient

314
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,320
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or what we call respiration with compensatory fermentation

315
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:08,560
in the form of establishing the cell establishes its energy, its production of ATP, our energy

316
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:16,400
currency through the glycolysis and substrate level phosphorylation. And it's well recognized

317
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,080
that cancer cells, 90% of them, I would say, have a Warburg phenotype, meaning that they have highly

318
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,960
accelerated glycolysis and substrate level phosphorylation. So let me simplify that a little

319
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,840
bit more. Our cells can turn glucose into something called pyruvate and that occurs outside of the

320
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,720
mitochondria. And that's not a highly energy efficient process. It doesn't generate much ATP.

321
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,040
You then have a decision to make as a cell, which is basically how quickly does the body want ATP

322
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,600
and as a general rule, when it wants it quickly, it's an anaerobic environment. You think about

323
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,760
things that drive quick ATP requirement. And so then it will just say, look, we'll just turn this

324
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
pyruvate into lactate. That's the glycolytic pathway, which is not particularly efficient

325
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,720
either. It doesn't generate that much more ATP, but it has the luxury of saying, I can guarantee

326
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,600
to do this quickly. And I don't need to be limited by cellular oxygen. Under ideal circumstances,

327
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,920
you would want to generate the most ATP, you would shuttle that pyruvate into the mitochondria

328
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,360
as acetyl CoA, and you have this other process. So what you're saying is the Warburg effect is, hey,

329
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,880
even under conditions at rest, a cancer cell seems to disproportionately do this glycolytic thing.

330
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,640
And it generates its ATP that way, as opposed to going into the mitochondria.

331
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,120
Exactly. Even in the presence of normal oxygen, it utilizes glycolysis and pumps out lactate.

332
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,640
So under no other conditions do normal cells ferment and pump out lactate.

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,680
So that's now Warburg, did he win a Nobel Prize for this observation?

334
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,480
He won a Nobel Prize. Yeah. For his work in metabolism cancer cells. Yeah. And it was,

335
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,280
is more kind of appreciated a little bit later what the implications of this was,

336
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,880
but it was part of his Nobel Prize. Yeah. You know, I remember reading an article about this

337
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,120
once that has since escaped me, but then maybe I'm wrong. So correct me. But one of the reasons

338
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,800
that the hypothesis was, cause this was in the 1920s, if I recall. Yeah. Warburg was, yeah. So

339
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,520
one of the reasons that this sort of got discarded for lack of a better word, or at least ignored was

340
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,600
people tended to focus on the exceptions and there were exceptions, right? Certain lung

341
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
cancers certainly seem to pose an exception to the Warburg effect. And so the idea was, well,

342
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,240
look, if you have an exception, then the rule is not so much a rule anymore. And is there another

343
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,720
reason why the Warburg effect was largely ignored for, you know, a generation and a half to two

344
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,680
generations? Travis Christofferson wrote a book called Tripping Over the Truth that nicely sums

345
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:52,080
that up. I think there's a lot of reasons for that, but I think the big focus was on understanding

346
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:59,600
the gene pathways that were associated with carcinogenesis. And then if we can understand

347
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,240
the gene etiology of cancers and different types of cancers, then that would explain cancer in a

348
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,720
much more fundamental level. And that is the case. There is a dynamic interplay between metabolism

349
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,680
and genetics. So now we have an appreciation that metabolites, you could call them oncometabolites,

350
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:28,800
are epigenetic drivers. And metabolism is just not producing ATP. There are so many different

351
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,400
intermediates and redox signaling and so many different signaling molecules from metabolism

352
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,120
that have epigenetic regulation. And I think that has become, when I got into this, there was no

353
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,240
cancer metabolism conferences, you know, and now there's a dozen or more where Lou Cantley is a

354
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,520
keynote speaker and Craig Thompson is, and this has all sort of exploded shortly after some of

355
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,680
these observations that I made. And it's just, you know, it's, I don't think it's coincidence.

356
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,240
I think, I think, yeah, remember when we had that dinner in DC at that conference?

357
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,800
I still look back at that as one of the most remarkable rooms to be sitting in as a fly on

358
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,760
the wall. Cause there was only about 12 people there. Yeah. And you know, you had Lou Cantley,

359
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,000
you had Michael Bishop, Steve Rosenberg, David Sabatini. David Sabatini. Who else was there?

360
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,920
Michael Pollock. A Vanderheiden. Yeah. Matthew Vanderheiden. I mean, you basically had some of

361
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,440
the most thoughtful cancer scientists in the, in the world, certainly in the United States,

362
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,160
in one room. And that was an amazing evening conversation. Yeah. If I could go back in time,

363
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,160
exactly. That was golden. We'll talk those guys into getting in a room again. Yeah. I mean,

364
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,680
I think what you're basically saying is, look, part of its reason for being discarded,

365
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,600
or at least forgotten about was a new sexier idea emerged, which is, Hey,

366
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,480
we started to understand the role of the genome. And there's this weird sort of debate you hear.

367
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,200
And the observation that things like viruses, you know, which could, you know, encode and

368
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,960
change our DNA. But the viruses that cause cancer are the very same viruses that damage

369
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,640
the mitochondria that damage the DNA in the mitochondria and causing respiratory insufficiency,

370
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,960
which triggers an energetic crisis, which can trigger the activation of oncogene through

371
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,680
retrograde response. So that needs to be appreciated too. But there was this explosion

372
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,040
of technologies that allowed us to understand genetics. And that was sort of being leveraged

373
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,480
to really delve into cancer, I think there was, there was some politics influencing that too.

374
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,360
So it was the first thing you did from that point, because there's really two separate

375
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,840
problems that you're talking about. The first is, why are these seizures occurring? And I'm

376
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,320
referring very specifically to your DARPA funded work, which was, why is it that when these

377
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,160
Special Forces guys are doing their ultra secret dives, which require rebreathers,

378
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,360
why are a subset of them having these fatal seizures?

379
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,360
Well, it's the Office of Navy Research. Oh, it was. Okay. DARPA was doing this.

380
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,760
They were doing warfighter performance with ketone esters, just prior to, you know, what I was doing.

381
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,320
So that's one problem. Yeah. And then the other problem that's that you've also articulated is,

382
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,040
hey, what's going on with cancer? Yes. So oxygen toxicity seizures are a limitation for navy seal

383
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,480
divers. And we don't know how to predict them or prevent them. It's also a limitation of hyperbaric

384
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,120
oxygen therapy, right? So if you have carbon monoxide poisoning, right, and you need to live,

385
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,760
especially you need to get that, that carbon monoxide off your hemoglobin, you need to basically

386
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,720
increase the PO2 in your tissues. Oh, because carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity than

387
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,800
oxygen for hemoglobin. So you have to basically outcompete it. Yes. So if you were to take a ketone

388
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,240
ester, which we know now increase your resistance to oxygen toxicity by like 600% and take a ketone

389
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,400
ester and then get inside a hyperbaric chamber, you have a much greater chance of living. If you

390
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,040
have wounds, there's 14 different applications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. We think that

391
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,720
therapeutic ketosis strategy would make it much safer and more efficacious. So in the context of

392
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,400
an oxygenary breather, the advantage is that there's a stealth component because you don't

393
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,760
produce bubbles. You can dive in a quiet lake and go all the way across and surprise your enemy.

394
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,760
But it just 50 feet of seawater within 10 minutes at 50 feet of seawater, you run the risk of getting

395
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,920
oxygen toxicity seizures. That's pretty shallow. Wait, wait, say that again. At 50 feet. At 50

396
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,960
feet of seawater in 10 minutes, if you're on a draeger rebreather, according to the oxygen

397
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,800
dive tables, that has been enough to trigger a seizure in many guys. So that produces a PO2 in

398
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:52,080
your brain of about roughly 2000 times higher than what your oxygen level in your brain would be

399
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,120
right now. 2000% higher. I was going to say. Yeah, percent, not time. Okay. Okay. So that needs to be

400
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,800
sort of appreciated. And of course, this could all be averted if you just stick to the dive tables.

401
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,000
Right. But if you have, you know, enemy fire with 50 caliber machine guns coming down on you,

402
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,840
and you want to stay down, if the water is clear, you got to go down deeper. If you have a plan of

403
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,080
mine and get to the bottom of a ship or a bridge, you might be underwater for three or four hours,

404
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,680
and the enemy is still up there. And it's, you got to get down there and do your job and dive deep

405
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,080
and avoid that. And then, you know, after a time, you have pulmonary oxygen toxicity too,

406
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,280
if you're down there long enough. But generally speaking, these rebreathers are for shallow

407
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400
diving, but situations where they need to go down deeper. Do you have an estimate of how many

408
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,120
Navy divers just in the United States, both in training or combat, would die in a given year

409
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,280
from this or be injured? It's pretty rare. Fortunately, it's pretty rare. And if they do

410
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,080
get hit with oxygen, you know, our friend, Kurt Parsley, will tell you that Navy SEALs

411
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,160
are notorious about not telling what their issues are with their health, right? So if they do have

412
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,480
a seizure, they would be kicked out, you know, a lot of these guys, because that may make them

413
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,200
a weak link that they're vulnerable. So we know recreational divers that push the limit who have

414
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,440
been hit a couple times, you know, with this, and we're doing some studies right now, recreational

415
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,000
divers. So it's very underreported, but studies have shown, I always show a video in one of my

416
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,720
talks of a guy in a chamber where he has a mask on and the mask is breathing 100% oxygen. And the

417
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,240
guy inside the chamber is breathing hyperbaric air. And within at 2.7 atmospheres of oxygen,

418
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,680
he gets hit with a seizure and has a really violent tonic clonic seizure. And it's stopped.

419
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,600
As soon as you remove the oxygen mask and start breathing air, even if it's at the same barometric

420
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,640
pressure, the seizures stop. So one of the beneficial things of these seizures, if you

421
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,360
want to, if there's a beneficial component to it is that they quickly stop as soon as you remove the

422
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:04,080
hyperbaric oxygen source, or you go from breathing 100% oxygen to hyperbaric air. So what's happening

423
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:11,440
is that the high levels of oxygen are creating oxidative stress and actually impeding various

424
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,840
metabolic processes in the brain. And the brain is becoming hyper excitable. And the neurons are

425
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,200
firing so many action potentials that the cells essentially can't maintain their membrane potential.

426
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,800
And you get excitotoxicity that causes mass firing in the neurons and a seizure.

427
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,440
And this is obviously under a very super physiologic.

428
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,600
Super physiologic. It only happens in these extreme environments of pressures. And the

429
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,880
reason for it now is you have S-nitrosylation of glutamic acid decarboxylase. There's two

430
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,280
different isozymes. And then what we think now is that you have more glutamate to GABA ratio.

431
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,760
So the enzyme that converts our gamma-aminopatoric acid is actually created from glutamate.

432
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,760
So you have much more excitatory than inhibitory neurotransmitter.

433
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,720
So that ratio changes. And it's a redox dependent reaction. Actually, you have S-nitrosylation of

434
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,920
this enzyme that converts more glutamate to GABA. So you have increased neuronal firing and increased

435
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,960
release of glutamate and also less conversion of the glutamate to GABA, which has a brain

436
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,800
stabilizing effect. So this is going off topic for just a second, but we know that as people age,

437
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,240
we see greater and greater oxidative damage. So we see, you know, the susceptibility to ROS going

438
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,600
up. Does any of what you learned in this super physiologic environment where in a very short

439
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,640
period of time, you're going to generate a ton of Ross by exposing someone to high pressure and

440
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,880
high O2. Does anything you learned in that environment offer an insight into non-super

441
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,400
physiologic or normal aging and disease progression? Yeah, I think in many different ways. So it's

442
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,720
almost like exercise, right? If you exercise intensely, your reactive oxygen species are going

443
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:10,320
to go up inflammation, all these things kick on. So high pressure oxygen increases oxidative stress,

444
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:19,040
and that kicks on many different processes that can endow the cell with greater cellular protection.

445
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,600
So it can, for example, cause an increase in superoxide dismutase. It can enhance our antioxidant

446
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:33,440
defenses. So the oxidative stimulus is a trigger for adaptive processes that can allow our systems

447
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,960
to be more resilient against the same level of oxidative stress. This happens very robustly in

448
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:49,840
a young animal and is significantly attenuated in an older animal. And I think that needs to be

449
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,880
appreciated. So the adaptive response to the stimulus varies genetically, probably between

450
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,840
the individual. There's a lot of individual variability between people. And even if you

451
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,160
take the same person under different conditions, whether it be if they're sleep deprived, what they

452
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,160
ate that day, maybe if they're dealing with a little viral illness or something, their susceptibility

453
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,480
to oxygen toxicity seizures can be greatly affected by a lot of different variables. But

454
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,240
that adaptive response, so we know hyperbaric oxygen stimulates the production of stem cells

455
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,040
as much as something like GMCSF, like a neupogen or leukine. It's that powerful. It causes the

456
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,160
production and the release of stem cells, which kind of hone in on sites of injury and aid in

457
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:46,400
repair. So that's why its most utilized application is actually for enhancing wound production or wound

458
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,760
healing effects. I see. You mentioned that there were 14 approved applications. I wasn't aware that

459
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,600
there were that many. I certainly... I think it's 15 now. So what are some of the others? You don't

460
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,760
have to put you on the spot to rattle off all 15, but we can look it up. But just on the top of your

461
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,480
head, what other ones do you know? Yeah, radiation necrosis. So for cancer, if you are getting

462
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,520
radiation therapy for cancer, it is FDA approved for that. So if you have patients who have

463
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,440
radiation therapy, of course there's decompression sickness. So we're recreational diving. If you get

464
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,120
bent, another term for bent is decompression. It's the same deal. It's basically get the nitrogen

465
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:28,080
out by basically... Pump the nitrogen out. Beating it out with oxygen. Yep. Carbon monoxide poisoning.

466
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:34,480
Obviously diabetic wounds. All the hyperbaric, the UHMS, so hyperbaric medicine society,

467
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,480
approves the facilities. And I would say 90 plus percent of their revenue generated from that

468
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,920
is diabetic wounds, which is a huge problem. Like you probably, in your practice, you probably see

469
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,240
people with wounds that just don't heal. Well, I don't see my practice, but I certainly cut my

470
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,040
teeth on it during residency. Yeah. No pun intended, significant problem. Yep. So that's,

471
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,440
I mean, that's a few different applications and there's a lot of sort of rare things. There's

472
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,800
noise induced hearing loss. If you use, that's one of the newer applications that can be... So

473
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,760
some things that are kind of counterintuitive. So when we think of high pressure oxygen, a lot of

474
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,040
times you think of retinopathy or prematurity, right? If you put a newborn and give them high

475
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,880
levels of oxygen, you could cause them to go blind, right? A newborn. So that's an interesting...

476
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,360
Meaning a newborn is more susceptible. More susceptible to oxygen. It was very common,

477
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,080
I guess you could say, to put newborns on high levels of oxygen if they're born premature.

478
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,360
And why, what is it about the newborn that makes them more susceptible? The development of their

479
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,040
lungs. Is it the angiogenic component of this? Yes. Yes. That could be a component too. And maybe

480
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,840
they just don't have the robust endogenous antioxidant capacity, but probably it might

481
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,840
be the angiogenic component too. Do you know off the top of your head if elevated mercury or

482
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,240
mercury toxicity as an indication for hyperbaric? Because I've heard of a lot of people doing this,

483
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,560
but it strikes me as a little bit off label. Probably not. There's so much off label stuff

484
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,680
being done. So one of the things that I'm really interested in testing is for traumatic brain

485
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,920
injury. And I do think that low levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, if used shortly after

486
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,680
a traumatic brain injury, I think the faster you restore oxygenation, the more likely you are to

487
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,400
salvage those neurons. So ideally you want to treat with something that's going to reestablish

488
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,120
energy in neurons, decrease inflammation, and increase oxygenation to hypoxic pockets. And

489
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,720
I think from my perspective, giving something like a ketone ester with lower levels of hyperbaric

490
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,720
oxygen therapy would probably work. That's probably the, by far the most controversial

491
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:54,960
application because there are some remarkable responses from people who have even a regeneration

492
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,760
of brain cells after the hypoxic injury, for example, in kids who are very resilient anyway.

493
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,080
I know Dr. Paul Harch has been on pretty much all the major news networks with a girl that

494
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:14,560
sustained an incredibly severe hypoxic injury and brain death and regenerated some of her brain

495
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,040
brain function and brain tissue. How old was the girl? She was pretty young, I think five or six,

496
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,000
I believe. And I met her actually, one of the conferences and it's very clear that nothing was

497
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,600
working for her until she did hyperbaric oxygen therapy. So, but kids are completely, could be

498
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,480
another story. You know, we don't know if we could replicate that, but there are a lot of stories out

499
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,600
there, anecdotal reports, but it just has not been studied appropriately and those studies need to be

500
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,560
done. And what do you see as the resistance? I mean, when you look at what's happened in the last

501
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:56,160
five years in the NFL that has brought along with, I think, just the returning vets, TBI is, I mean,

502
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,600
I don't think you could walk down Madison Avenue and hit someone with a rock who hadn't at least

503
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,120
heard the term TBI. So everybody knows what it is. We've got, you know, these two completely

504
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:14,800
different demographics who are highly affected by it, athletes and soldiers. What's the hangup? I

505
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,160
mean, you and I have spent a lot of time behind the scenes trying to get organizations like the

506
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,200
NC2A interested in studying this. I'm struggling to understand what the hangup is. You know,

507
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,680
they're looking for devices to, you know, quantify TBIs and concussions. So that's a lot of funding

508
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,280
is going into that area, at least when we talk about the NFL hit challenge and something that,

509
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,640
you know, we submitted to. You know, I don't really know. I don't really know. I think the

510
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,320
scientific rationale for a metabolic-based therapy for the brain makes a lot of sense in restoring

511
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:56,320
oxygenation. I think the waters are very muddy though when it comes to hyperbaric oxygen with

512
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,080
TBI because I mean, we even did some rat studies where repeated doses of hyperbaric oxygen

513
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:12,400
in a concussion or a brain injury model, a rat caused more injury can exacerbate the effects.

514
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,640
Whereas a single dose of hyperbaric oxygen right after, at least in our rat model, decreased the

515
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,520
infarct size by maybe 30%, something like that. So this is dangerous. I mean, we don't want

516
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,920
someone listening to this who's suffered a TBI thinking I'm going to go to some off-label clinic

517
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,280
and just max, you know, repeatedly expose myself to hyperbarics. I mean, we, the point here is this

518
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,520
has to be studied. It has to be studied rigorously. It has to be studied empirically. And then we

519
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,600
haven't even got into something we will get into later, which is the potential augmentation of the

520
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,800
exogenous ketone. Yeah. Yeah. I would not do hyperbaric oxygen therapy if people are going to

521
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,240
do it with and without, you know, what I say, I would definitely do hyperbaric oxygen therapy

522
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,640
if you're going to do it in strong nutritional ketosis, because a consequence of hyperbaric

523
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,960
oxygen therapy is, could be CNS oxygen toxicity. So you do not, the last thing you want if you have

524
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,480
a brain injury is to have a seizure. And we know 85% of all penetrating traumatic brain injuries

525
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,000
lead to seizures and people who've had penetrating. What about blunt? I mean, it's less than that,

526
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,120
but how much less? Yeah. So I don't know. I guess you would have to quantify the blunt. The severity.

527
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:32,240
Yeah. But when it comes to penetrating, but it's, it's, it's upwards about 85% of penetrating

528
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,920
traumatic brain injuries have seizures. And that's because you have excess glutamate,

529
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,760
you know, and that's a very thing that's actually contributing to oxygen toxicity seizures. Right.

530
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,000
So I think the biggest thing to do is to augment your brain energy metabolism to burn energy more

531
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,840
efficiently. The ketones do that and lower neuro inflammation. And I think there's a variety of

532
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,200
ways to do that, but you don't want to throw more fuel on the fire. And I think high levels of

533
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,440
hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be doing that. I think maybe these soft chambers that go to like 1.4,

534
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,440
1.5, maybe a better means to implement that. Let's get into ketosis a little bit. I want to

535
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,400
come back and talk about cancer. I want to come back and talk about the exogenous ketones,

536
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,920
both the salts, the esters, and even different molecules. But one of the most interesting

537
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,840
experiments we've seen in the physiology of ketones, like, you know, as far as old school

538
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,720
experiments was the George Cahill starvation experiments. Right. So highly motivated by that

539
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,960
study. We're going to link to it here, but let's, uh, why don't you give people the reader's digest

540
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,120
version of what George Cahill did that could probably never be done again. Yeah. Yeah. And

541
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,640
I was very lucky to connect with him. Before he died. He passed away in 2012 by connect with him

542
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,560
a few years before that. And just to figure out, you know, did he really do this studies? And there

543
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,080
was a lot of studies that also didn't get published that were pretty remarkable too, that somehow they

544
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:02,800
got past ethics review at Harvard medical school, but essentially what he did a very elegant study

545
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,840
to look at brain energy metabolism, the AV difference in blood and metabolites in subjects

546
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,960
that fasted for 40 days. And most of the subjects were, uh, divinity students, I believe, or maybe

547
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,360
conscientious objectors to the war or something like that. But each person had like a different

548
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,760
story behind it. And he fasted these subjects for 40 days. And just to be clear, this is water and

549
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,680
mineral only water, no calories. So they took minerals, right? They had magnesium and sodium.

550
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,720
They did. I think they took a mineral supplement and they also were, they weren't lean subjects.

551
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,960
So they were subjects who from their perspective were overweight, if not obese subjects. So they

552
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:52,480
had some weight to lose. And it was very well documented and well controlled study where they

553
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:00,240
monitored free fatty acids, insulin glucose, beta hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone.

554
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,880
And let's all just pause you there for a moment for the listener. We'll come back to this because I

555
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,000
want you to explain the difference between beta hydroxybutyrate or BHB acetoacetate or AKAC and

556
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,080
acetone, how they're produced, which ones are metabolically active, which ones aren't, but

557
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,840
hopefully by me just saying this between the two of us, we'll remember to come back to that.

558
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,600
Yeah. So yeah, essentially three ketone bodies, beta hydroxybutyrate being the primary ketone

559
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,880
that's elevated and more stable in the blood and probably more likely to be a brain fuel.

560
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:37,360
And if we just focus on that ketone body after seven days, it reached the level to where it was

561
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:43,600
at or above the level of glucose in the subject. So glucose came down from five to six millimolar

562
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,800
down to three and stayed at three millimolar throughout the duration of the experiment,

563
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,160
throughout the duration of the fast from day seven, essentially to the remainder of the 40 days.

564
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,760
So for the Yankees listening to this who aren't familiar with the metric system,

565
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,720
three millimolar is about 55 milligrams per deciliter. Yeah. Yep. Okay. So that's pretty

566
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,400
darn low. Yeah. But what's interesting is it gets down there. I think it was between day seven and

567
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,280
day 10, it hit three millimolar and then it just never went down again. Yeah. Yeah. What the heck

568
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,120
is going on? These people don't eat any glucose. How are they? How do they sell? And what that

569
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,960
tells you by definition is their liver still had glycogen because you have to be putting that

570
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:33,520
glucose out from the liver. Yep. So the maintenance of glucose is under very powerful homeostatic

571
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,280
mechanisms. So we have, we're hardwired from an evolutionary perspective to maintain glucose

572
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,640
and the glucose can be coming from gluconeogenic amino acids. So we are breaking down some muscle

573
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,480
and then the glycerol backbone of triglycerides too also contributes to the production of.

574
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,800
So triglycerides being the storage form of fatty acids, you have a three carbon backbone that's

575
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,240
called a glycerol backbone. It has three of these free fatty acids that are, well, they become free

576
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,200
once they're cleaved. They become the substrate that you're going to explain to us in a few minutes

577
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,040
is how you make BHB or beta hydroxybutyrate, but you don't just throw that glycerol out.

578
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,160
You can actually, the liver can turn that back into glycogen within itself to then slowly trickle

579
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,600
out into the bloodstream. Exactly. Yep. So when Cahill did this, if I recall insulin levels also

580
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,720
got very low by, with about by day seven, the insulin levels were at rock bottom and sort of

581
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,920
stayed there. Yeah. Yeah. One of the interesting things about the experiment, in addition to the

582
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,000
stuff I want to hear about, which is the brain metabolism and how did the brain partition those

583
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,200
fuels is, was it this experiment or a different one where he was able to give insulin lower glucose

584
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,760
levels, but not generate CNS trauma through that? Yeah. So the subjects were asymptomatic for

585
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,280
hypoglycemia and they felt really fine. And in another. Down to what level? Like one millimolar.

586
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:05,680
Yeah. So they infused IV infusion of 20 IUs of insulin and pushed glucose from three millimolar

587
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,640
or thereabouts down to roughly one millimolar, which is like 18 milligrams per deciliter. Yeah.

588
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,160
Which would be fatal. That would be universally fatal level of glucose. Even two, two becomes like

589
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,760
coma and essentially fatal if it's maintained. I hit two very briefly during an insulin suppression

590
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,800
test I had at Stanford and I was no longer in ketosis because I was doing this insulin

591
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,240
suppression test. So I started at about two and a half or three millimolar, but 90 minutes later,

592
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,800
my ketones had withered down to like 0.3, 0.4. Yeah. And then my glucose hit about 38 milligrams

593
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,640
per deciliter. And I really, that was the day I thought I was gone. That's a dangerous area. Oh,

594
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,200
yeah. No, I thought I was gone. I have a little self-experiment. I can mention after this,

595
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,680
but essentially what they did, which was a very bold and gutsy demonstration,

596
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,680
they injected insulin, which facilitated glucose disposal in the patients essentially and brought

597
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,400
blood glucose down to, you know, roughly one millimolar, which is universally fatal. And the

598
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,560
subjects were relatively asymptomatic for hypoglycemia, which was remarkable. Their ketones

599
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,720
were maintained at about above five to six millimolar. That is out freaking

600
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:31,680
rages. Yeah. Like that when you just stop to think about how you could take a normal healthy

601
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,640
volunteer and do something, I mean, we're all in the spirit of learning, but when you just think

602
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,880
about that from an ethical standpoint, like how close. I can't do that in mice. I'm not allowed to

603
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,680
do that in mice. The IACUC, the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee, you know, would not

604
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,400
approve fasting for more than 48 hours. I think it's for 24 at our institution. Yeah. So that's

605
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,680
for mice and maybe rats might be 48. But yeah. And the use of insulin to further, you know, that

606
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,600
would, I serve on the IACUC. I mean, these things would be quickly rejected. I mean, this is, this

607
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,440
was the wild, wild West. Yeah. And then just the last thing on this topic that I remember,

608
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:13,280
which I'd love you to expand on is what did we learn about how the brain partitioned fuel?

609
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,680
How much of the brain's energy once you were in that steady state after about 10 days

610
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:24,160
came from glucose, beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate? Yeah. So beta hydroxybutyrate

611
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:34,240
accounted for approximately 60% of the energy and probably 10% acetoacetate. And roughly at that

612
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:41,040
point, after about 10 days, only about a third of the energy was coming from glucose, right? And

613
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,880
basically what's in your blood as far as ketones and glucose is what your brain is utilizing. You

614
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,280
know, your brain's in a hungry state and it's effectively utilizing and clearing those, those

615
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,680
metabolites. You can do that. It was, it was very elegant demonstration and it kind of changed our

616
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:04,160
understanding of brain energy metabolism as glucose being exclusive predominant fuel. So in a fed

617
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,000
state, they were consuming 100% of their brain energy metabolism was from glucose, but only after

618
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:16,000
being fasted did that change. And he went on to write a number of reviews and went on with Dr. Veach

619
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,600
who actually created and developed some of the, they published together. He was a postdoc with

620
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,880
Cahill, wasn't he? A postdoc. Yeah. He was a student of Hans Kreb actually. And then, yeah, he was one

621
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,920
of the, I forgot that fact. Yeah. He was one of his best students from my understanding. Yeah. From

622
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,040
word of mouth. Yeah. They went and they worked together in different capacities. Yeah. I think

623
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,520
he might've been a fellow with him. I think most people listening to this, if they can dig back to

624
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,600
high school biology, that name Krebs will sort of ring a bell, right? Yeah, he should. Yeah. So you

625
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,840
mentioned that Cahill shared with you stuff that wasn't even published. Do you remember anything

626
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,040
that was, that struck you as super interesting that was unpublished? Yeah. You know, some things

627
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:03,520
maybe, uh, not worth talking about. Well, yeah, I don't know if he, I do with some stories and then

628
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,920
I heard some stories through other people too. Well, I don't want to make you say anything that

629
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,080
you're not comfortable saying publicly. But I would say some of the work that was done in animals

630
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:18,880
definitely suggested that glucose could go lower, even lower, and that, uh, you could really

631
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:28,880
transition your metabolic physiology to be fueled off fats and ketones and, and that, that was

632
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,520
against what we knew. These were remarkable observations that changed the whole context

633
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,240
of what we knew about metabolic physiology and brain energy metabolism. Do we know today if the

634
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,360
brain can use lactate directly as a fuel without it having to go through the Corey cycle? Yeah,

635
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,560
most certainly can. I think, I think lactate's a actually a great fuel. Okay. And that's one of

636
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,720
the first fuels I got interested in when I was studying hypoxia and then later even, uh, hyperoxia

637
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:02,000
was thinking about using lactate, uh, different forms of orally available lactate like polyl

638
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,400
lactate. You know, I think it's in the product CytoMax. If you remember for cycling,

639
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,520
I used to use CytoMax. Yeah. So, uh, so I was actually interested in that. And that actually

640
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,200
led me to ketones. And then once I got more into studying ketones and discovered somehow it slipped

641
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,120
past me all the years, I thought I knew what a ketogenic diet was, but then when I read about

642
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:27,120
the history of the ketogenic diet being used for almost a century, and I realized that it was like

643
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,720
the standard of care for seizures. And then understanding that these ketones can largely

644
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,440
replace glucose as the energy source. And then they have these signaling properties that are

645
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:45,120
even independent of metabolism that are remarkable over the last five years. A lot of these big labs

646
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,800
are looking at the epigenetic effects of ketones functioning as class one, class two histone,

647
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:58,320
histone laser, the functioning as a suppressor of the NLRP3 and phlammasome, producing less

648
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:05,760
inflammation in a metabolic independent way. So you obviously pretty quickly come to this idea

649
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,800
that these ketones are interesting molecules and they're interesting for a couple of reasons. At the

650
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,800
very least, what you just said, which is they have signaling properties that make them kind of unique

651
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,760
outside of the exogenous ketones though, you have to also undergo a pretty extreme

652
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,440
physiologic change, at least in a Western culture, to make enough of these to matter. And you have to

653
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,520
restrict carbohydrates and protein to get there. So did you first personally get interested in this

654
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,880
from a nutritional standpoint, and then eventually through this exogenous pathway or vice versa?

655
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:44,400
Yeah, so ketone esters to my knowledge in 2008 didn't exist. They actually did, but I didn't know

656
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:51,040
of them. I discovered them on a DARPA website as some work that was being funded in developing of

657
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:58,400
the ketone esters for warfighter performance. But at the time, when I decided to go down the route

658
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,120
of the ketogenic diet, I reached out to Johns Hopkins and the crew there. Which is where the

659
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:08,160
anti-seizure therapy was pioneered, right? Yeah, Mayo Clinic first, and then they worked together

660
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,400
with Hopkins. I would say the bulk of the work that was done to develop the protocols for the

661
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,760
ketogenic diet, which are in use today, was developed at Johns Hopkins. And I got Eric

662
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,360
Kosoff books, his book published with John Freeman, which was I just went out and did the

663
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:31,840
classical ketogenic diet, the four to one ratio. So four parts fat and one part being protein and

664
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:40,560
carbohydrates. It equates out to 87 to upwards of 90% fat, maybe 10% protein and like one or

665
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:47,760
two percent carbohydrates. So I mean, it's like basically eating super low carb and then adding

666
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,120
mountains of fat on top of that plate, making like a super low carb meal with protein restrict,

667
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,600
and then add some butter and a couple cups of heavy cream with that. And that's, I started

668
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,320
weighing everything out. And I wonder, what year did you start that? 2008, I think in nine, I think

669
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:10,560
it was 2008 or nine that Eric Kosoff published the modified ketogenic diet, which was more liberal

670
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:20,080
in protein and increasing protein from 10% to 25 and 30% or 25% is a huge difference. Like you can,

671
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,760
that's actually a diet that I mostly adhere to now. And I followed the ketogenic diet and I

672
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,560
bought the strips were very expensive at the time. There was a couple different kits that I got

673
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,280
to measure my own ketones. And you know, I immersed myself in it, I got obsessed with it,

674
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,120
and I wanted to know what it felt like to have a brain that ran on ketones. And how high did your

675
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,080
levels get measured in the blood? I kind of struggled to get up there, even with the classical

676
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,480
ketogenic diets, two and 2.5, I would typically with the classical ketogenic. And this is before

677
01:01:52,480 --> 01:02:00,480
MCTs. So I wasn't quite using MCTs yet. In 2009, I started incorporate the same time I discovered

678
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:07,440
the modified ketogenic diet was the same time I started using MCTs. And a modified ketogenic

679
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:14,320
diet with MCTs got my ketone levels up probably higher than the classical ketogenic diet,

680
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:20,000
which was just mostly, you know, a dairy based long chain fat sort of derived diet.

681
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So let's tell everybody how we make ketones, and then we'll tell them what an MCT is for those.

682
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,120
Yeah. So let's talk about starvation ketosis. And then if there's differences between that that are

683
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,440
worth highlighting with nutritional, that would be great. But evolutionarily, I'm going to deprive

684
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,080
you from eating for a few days. How do you survive? Well, you start burning up your liver glycogen.

685
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,000
Okay, so 24 hours later, you've got that down to about half of its half to let about a quarter of

686
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:52,160
its supply. Through the suppression of the hormone insulin, we start mobilizing fat from adipose

687
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:57,600
tissue, which are cells pretty much all cells in the body, especially muscle and heart cells,

688
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,480
burned fat like a superior energy source. Long chain fatty acids don't effectively cross the

689
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,880
blood brain barrier. So through accelerated fat oxidation, beta oxidation fats in the liver,

690
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:18,240
that stimulates the accumulation of acetyl CoA, which forms acetoacetate and ultimately beta

691
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:24,320
hydroxybutyrate. So you start spilling these ketone bodies through accelerated fat oxidation

692
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,680
in the liver. The liver lacks succinyl CoA transferase, so does not actually use the ketone

693
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,200
bodies for fuel. And they become available for your brain, the central nervous system and peripheral.

694
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,560
So the liver is secreting beta hydroxybutyrate. Yeah. And acetoacetate to some extent.

695
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:45,920
Okay. So is the BHB being made and then being converted into acetoacetate or is the liver

696
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,920
making both? Acetoacetate first and then beta hydroxybutyrate. And it's interesting that some

697
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,360
people have a ratio of beta hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate of two to one and some people five

698
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:04,640
to one, generally speaking about four to one. So acetoacetate is unstable in that it can

699
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,320
spontaneously decarboxylate to acetone, which is volatile and we blow it off in our breath.

700
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,480
Does it have metabolic activity? Can we...

701
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,120
It was thought that it didn't, but more recent work is suggesting that the carbons of acetone

702
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:26,160
do find their way into sort of lipid biosynthesis and some other things, but it's kind of rare for

703
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:32,800
that to happen. But it's not a great ATP source. No, no, not really. It has some effect on neurons.

704
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,800
So it has an anti-convulsion effect through, I believe, opening a potassium channel, which

705
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,240
could hyperpolarize a membrane potential and actually help attenuate some hyper-excitability

706
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:52,400
in the brain. So there are people that study the effects of acetone as a sub-narcotic levels of

707
01:04:52,400 --> 01:05:00,880
acetone. Acetone can be pretty narcotic and be problematic, but acetone levels that are 0.5

708
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:06,880
millimolar and even upwards of one millimolar can have a neuroprotective effect. Once you get above

709
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,200
one millimolar, you start to dissolve some of the membranes and you can have sort of...

710
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,080
That doesn't sound...

711
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:18,320
Yeah, you have problematic. Acetone is a pretty powerful solvent. It's a nail polish remover,

712
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,720
but small levels of acetone are neuroprotective and that's actually something that we study.

713
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,760
So how do acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate enter the Krebs cycle? In other words,

714
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,280
where do we get ATP from them?

715
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,720
It depends on the cells. So different cells have different... We're looking at this now,

716
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:41,040
different ketolytic enzymes. So they can feed in through a number of different pathways.

717
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:48,080
Like I said, the liver is the production site of beta-hydroxybutyrate. And when it comes to

718
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:55,200
skeletal muscle, they have a range of ketolytic enzymes that can allow them to enter the Krebs

719
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:03,120
cycle at different areas. So succinate, for example. So you can replenish TCA cycle intermediates

720
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:09,600
with succinate. Acetyl acetate can break down and provide acetyl CoA for the Krebs cycle.

721
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:15,840
So what we're finding is that the Krebs cycle is not the simple cycle that we thought it was,

722
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:21,200
especially as it relates to cancer cells. So it's almost like we can't even look at

723
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:29,280
the biochemistry book and kind of pinpoint different pathways. With substrate level

724
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:35,360
phosphorylation, there are a number of different pathways like the malate, aspartate, shuttle,

725
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,240
that are associated with cancer cells if we go back to those pathways.

726
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,200
Did you see that paper that came out in Nature two days ago about aspartate being a rate-limiting

727
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,560
step in cancer metabolism in the mitochondria? I didn't see that.

728
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,520
Bob and I were just talking about it today. It's interesting because the paper was...

729
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,360
Part of it was written through a lens of, hey, this might be how metformin can exert some of

730
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,720
its anti-cancer benefits by interfering with aspartate. I think it was interfering with

731
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,280
degradation of aspartate, but again, I haven't read the paper yet, just sort of the abstract,

732
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:13,520
but was yet another, like, I didn't know that. Wow. Every day I feel like I'm getting dumber

733
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,320
because the rate at which I'm being exposed to new information is exceeding the rate at which I'm

734
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,640
assimilating it. So it's just, it feels like I'm on a downward spiral to stupidity.

735
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,280
There are textbook pathways that I used to just rattle off and it all seems so simple.

736
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:33,600
And then, you know, I read three or four papers and I realized that I probably shouldn't talk

737
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,000
about it in some simplistic terms like that. I mean, we're kind of going down the rabbit hole

738
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:47,040
of glutamine lysis, right? So glutamine is the fermentable fuels. So ketones are a non-fermentable

739
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:53,600
fuel, whereas cancer cells, we use glucose and glutamine as the two primary fermentable fuels.

740
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,040
You know, it's funny. I mean, I know that biochemically. I'd never thought of it in

741
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,800
those terms though. Yeah. Yeah. It's not fermentable. That's interesting.

742
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:06,640
So that's kind of what I'm thinking about, you know, in terms of ketone metabolism with glutamate.

743
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:14,320
So, or glutamine, glutamine can make glutamate, right? And alanine and aspartate and lactate

744
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:21,280
and glutamine lysis is kind of driven by the malate-aspartate shuttle. And that has become

745
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:28,320
a major focus now of many cancer researchers are looking to target glutamine and it's not easy.

746
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:33,200
I mean, because if you have a glutaminase inhibitor, that has tremendous side effects.

747
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:33,920
Huge toxicity.

748
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,760
Right. Yeah. So we need to approach this in a very nuanced sort of way when it comes to targeting

749
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:44,320
glutamine. Yeah. So let's go back to the MCT. So you talked about how you started out on a

750
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,960
four to one ratio, which is interesting. I started out four to one. I spent three years on just four

751
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,040
to one. I never deviated from four to one, but then you mentioned you went to two to one, which

752
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,640
is obviously much easier to do, but you augmented with MCT. So MCT of course stands for medium

753
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,080
chain triglyceride. They're a type of saturated fat and they're of a certain length. And I don't

754
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:09,440
even remember anymore. Is it eight to 14 carbons is what we define as MCT? Yeah. Eight to 10,

755
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,560
I think eight to 14 from in that. But when we talk about the ketogenic ones, the, uh,

756
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,640
they're more close, they're closer to caprylic acid, which is the C8s. Yep. So why does,

757
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:26,400
why does taking those make this process easier? When you consume them orally, they are transported

758
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,280
to the liver via hepatic portal circulation and they're not packaged into kylo microns.

759
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,120
And you know, long chain fatty acids, when we eat them, they're packaged into kylo microns and

760
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,920
then they go through, essentially enter the lymphatic system and have a different route

761
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,360
of entry. They're metabolized totally differently. Whereas medium chain fats go directly to the

762
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,600
liver through a paddock portal circulation. It's like a bolus of fat going to the liver.

763
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,720
And it's a type of fat that's rapidly oxidized, right? The liver is chock full of

764
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,080
mitochondria. So if I want to study mitochondria, I'll take out a chunk of the liver and isolate

765
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:07,680
it from that. Cause that's the easiest thing to do. So the mitochondria really burn up medium

766
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,760
chain triglycerides very quickly. And, uh, there's very high rates of fat oxidation in the liver from

767
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:19,040
an oral bolus of medium chain triglycerides. So they're much less likely to be stored as fat.

768
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:26,800
They're a source of calories and they can be incorporated into meals and into foods to further

769
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,360
enhance and boost the ketone levels of the ketogenic diet. Or even if you're not on a

770
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,480
ketogenic diet, they can be consumed with a high carbohydrate diet and actually elevate ketones in

771
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,560
the blood. Yeah. I mean, I've heard that, but I've never actually measured it probably because I've

772
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,240
only done this with liquid MCT, which you end up getting to sort of GI tolerance becomes an issue

773
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,200
probably before you get a high enough level. But if you're on a high carb diet and you consume,

774
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:59,200
I don't know, two to three tablespoons of MCT, how high could you reasonably expect your BHB to get?

775
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,360
Depending on your absorption anywhere between 0.5 to one millimolar.

776
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,080
That high.

777
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:10,080
I would say. Yeah. Even on a high. Yeah. If it's pure C8, maybe, uh, so with C8, you get about a

778
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:17,280
20, maybe 30% elevation above like a mix of the C10 C8, which is generic. There's some work being

779
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,960
done that C10 may actually have some beneficial effects. I mean, that's kind of the idea behind

780
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,800
the product Exona that was on the market, you know, a while back. I don't know if it's still

781
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,600
in the market. I don't know. I don't know what it is. Yeah. It's a basically C8 it's powdered C8.

782
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,880
I used to just order pure C8. Yeah, you can order it. I ordered like from Sigma or something like

783
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,520
that. Yeah. Well, I Dave asked for these brain octane as is caprylic triglyceride and perillo

784
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:50,960
nutrition makes cap tree, which is a C8 oil. So if you buy pure C8, not in triglyceride form,

785
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,320
caprylic, if you just, uh, yeah, just straight acrylic acid. Yes. That'll kill you. I mean,

786
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:02,240
you, you consume that. I bought, I made the mistake early on and bought from Sigma caprylic acid,

787
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:07,280
but not yet. You need to buy it. How did you catch that mistake before ingesting it?

788
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,640
I bought it from Sigma and I think I was going to use it in experiments and we were going to mix it,

789
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,040
you know, with our rat chow and I wanted to go through a legitimate source and, uh, I put a

790
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,400
little bit on my finger and it kind of burnt my tongue off and I realized, wait a second. I think

791
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,120
I need to try glyceride form of caprylic acid. I need the caprylic triglyceride. Yeah. I almost

792
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,560
killed myself. I almost won a Darwin award. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I never looked at any

793
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,680
of the research. Someone probably did that before accidentally, uh, kills himself. Yeah.

794
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:46,640
Have you had any experience with the powdered MCTs? Yeah. Yeah. So powdered MCTs allow me to

795
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:52,240
increase my ketone levels higher than, uh, and I use the Quest powdered MCT formula. There's a

796
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:57,760
couple on the market now, maybe. Yeah. I have vats of this stuff at home because I feel like

797
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,000
anyone who's ever made a ketone product just somehow figures out my address and sends them to

798
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,560
me. So I have a pantry full of every type of ketone you can imagine. I do too. But I haven't,

799
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,600
yeah, you probably get more than me. I just haven't got around to trying any of the MCT powder,

800
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,720
but I'm getting ready to do a long fast in a couple of weeks. And I was thinking I really

801
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,600
ought to get, make sure I'm back in ketosis the week before I deprived myself of food for a week.

802
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,840
Yeah. So I was actually just thinking about this last week, which is I got to fire up those

803
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,240
powdered MCT and kickstart this thing. Cause I don't have like a couple of months to get fully

804
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:38,320
adapted. Yeah, they are great. I mean, MCTs are kind of like the poor man's ketone ester, right?

805
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,480
So they are, they're, they're found in nature. They're versatile. You can incorporate them in

806
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,600
the middle classes, man. Yeah. Given how expensive ketone esters are now.

807
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,920
That's right. That's right. Yeah. So I tinkered a lot with MCTs early on and increased my tolerability

808
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:02,720
from maybe 30 milliliters a day to 150 milliliters a day. Hang on a second. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

809
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:09,680
Yeah. When anytime I went to 30 in one sitting, 10 tablespoons full. Yeah. Yeah. That's hard to

810
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,880
fathom. You need to incorporate it with food. So I was spreading it. What I found I needed to do

811
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,920
was instead of doing intermittent fasting now, which I pretty much do now, I, I spread it out

812
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:27,440
over like four meals and maybe would have a little bit of MCT in the coffee too, and not including

813
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,800
that in a meal. So I was eating a modified ketogenic diet, but spreading that MCT out

814
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,360
with salad dressings, putting it on vegetables and things like that. And I was able to,

815
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,240
because if anybody's listening to this and is trying to, like they're just sitting there

816
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,520
thinking how, what could I do to do it to have a bowel prep? Like the answer is just, just, just

817
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,040
drink MCT. It's, you know, it's, it's better than Fleets Phosphasoda. You will, you will spend the

818
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,360
day in the bathroom and you'll, you'll have a great colonoscopy. But you can work your way up to it.

819
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:02,880
So there's a number of transporters obviously that are upregulated and you are enhancing the breakdown

820
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,320
and transport of these fat and MCTs actually do cross the blood brain barrier. So we did studies

821
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,600
in rats where we took out the hippocampus. But if they're getting absorbed portally,

822
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,880
how do we know? Oh, okay. Some of them, I forget the percentage, but I think, and some people say

823
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:23,760
it's like 50% of MCTs converted to ketones, but I think it's something like about 20% of MCTs.

824
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,600
And it depends on the energetic state of the liver, you know, which is the master regulator

825
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:34,080
and your, your physiology in general, but you have a fairly significant portion of the MCTs

826
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,640
being converted to ketones, but the MCTs do enter the blood and they can cross the blood

827
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,160
brain barrier unlike the long chain fats. And they, for example, if you take out the

828
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:50,000
hippocampi of rats that are eating an MCT based ketogenic diet, you'll find MCT levels are

829
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,560
significantly elevated. So they're crossing, they're getting into the brain and the brain is utilizing

830
01:15:54,560 --> 01:16:00,160
MCTs as fuel. And do we know if that has any anti-seizure effect independent of the ketone

831
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,920
that might be produced alongside it? That's a big area of research right now that MCTs is functional

832
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,760
fats. So, and I've never heard that term before, functional fats. Yeah. Like, well, fats with drug

833
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,440
like properties. So I think there's a number of patents around the C10 actually that I know they

834
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:23,760
have in the UK. I think it might be a pharmaceutical now. So C10 actually has anti-seizure properties.

835
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,240
So there's some people argue that the effects of the ketogenic diet, at least with MCTs,

836
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:35,680
is not due to ketones, but actually due to the MCTs and not the ketones. So there's a little bit,

837
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:41,280
there's a couple of groups out there that are sort of arguing that. And I think they have a case,

838
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:48,240
but I think it's probably a common, definitely a combination of the ketones and the MCTs. So MCTs

839
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:53,440
do have interesting properties. Do you know Elizabeth Teal at Boston Children's? Yeah. So I

840
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:59,760
remember having breakfast with her about six years ago and asking her a question that at the time,

841
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,240
I don't think she knew the answer to, and she was gracious enough to explain that. And she was there

842
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:09,040
with someone else in her lab. So it was a very spirited, awesome discussion. But I wonder if

843
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,320
the answer is known today. The question was basically, do you believe that the anti-seizure

844
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:21,360
properties of a ketogenic diet are more the result of the brain having another fuel to

845
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:29,120
displace glucose or due to the reduction in glucose that invariably accompanies ketogenesis?

846
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,480
And at the time she shared with me very compelling data that could argue either of those points,

847
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,800
potentially suggesting it was the combination of them. Do you have a point of view on this or is

848
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,880
there more information today that steers you one way or the other? Well, I know she's done some

849
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,320
work with the low glycemic index diet. So carbohydrate reduction, but without the production

850
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:58,080
of ketones. Yeah. So a reduction, it's carbohydrate restriction, but only to the effect of maybe 20 or

851
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:04,400
25%, you know, and then carbohydrates that are low glycemic index. And what are the results of that

852
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,200
intervention? For different types of seizures, it can have a positive effect and for certain

853
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,040
types of seizures. That's not the first line of therapy for, you know, very powerful tonic,

854
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,520
clonic seizures and pediatrics. You want to go right to the classical ketogenic diet,

855
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,880
but it does have a number of applications for different types of seizure disorders.

856
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,400
And what about if you take someone on a fully-carbed diet who's having recalcitrant seizures and you

857
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:38,640
give them ketone, exogenous ketone? Does that have anti-seizure benefit? Yeah. So those studies have

858
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,920
not been done yet. And there's a study being recruiting right now for something called

859
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,000
Angelman syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that has seizures where the exogenous

860
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,200
ketones are the therapy independent of the diet. So they're just being added on top of the diet.

861
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:00,160
There are people out there because exogenous ketones are commercially available that are using

862
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:07,120
this in place of the ketogenic diet, because the families are either unwilling or for various

863
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,280
reasons unable to use the ketogenic diet. And they, you know, argue using exogenous ketones.

864
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,760
And the feedback that I'm getting could be biased, but it does seem to have an effect.

865
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,160
It obviously has an effect in animal models. The animal models that we work with,

866
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:28,560
we give exogenous ketones on top of a standard rat chow, which is high carbohydrate chow. And it

867
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:36,320
works very well for CNS oxygen toxicity, but also for things like phenylentetrazole seizures,

868
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:42,720
PZT seizures, even for absence seizures, we use a particular animal model with absence seizures

869
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:48,000
or absence seizures, which are works for that. So it works for a variety of different seizure

870
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,600
models independent. We are circumventing sort of the dietary restriction that's typically associated

871
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:59,840
with getting into therapeutic ketosis and just simply giving exogenous ketones and elevating

872
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:06,000
exogenous ketones. But a consideration is that exogenous ketones lower blood glucose.

873
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:11,680
So you have, and in some cases it lowers it really low, like the high dose ketone esters

874
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:18,240
that we do in our rat models, it pushes and rats typically maintain a glucose of around 140 to 150,

875
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:23,920
and it'll push it down to 40. So milligrams per deciliter. Yeah. And that's approaching

876
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:29,840
the maximum tolerable dose of the ketone ester. And it's interesting when we go above the maximum

877
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,880
tolerable dose, we actually see glucose levels spike up. And this is a phenomenon that we see.

878
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,880
It's almost like it's stressing out the liver or just regulating the liver in some way.

879
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:45,760
It's the data we're trying to figure out. But if you titrate in ketone salts or ketone salt MCT

880
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:52,880
combination or various ketone esters, it's inversely proportional to, as you elevate ketones,

881
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:59,280
you have a very predictable, reliable decrease in blood glucose that's above and beyond

882
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,760
the decrease in blood glucose that you'd observe with something like metformin.

883
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:09,200
And we use metformin for many, many studies in a lab. And we have a lot of experience with that.

884
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,240
So what do we think? You know, it's funny, I was up in San Francisco, like a month ago,

885
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,320
and I was talking with Steve Finney, who, you know, at the outset, I said, you're one of the people

886
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,960
who I would say knows more about ketosis than anyone alive. And certainly Steve would have to

887
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,080
be in that category. So I would, if I were going to just guess, I would say, between you and Steve

888
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:32,080
Finney, if the answer isn't really known on ketosis, the answer might not be known. Yeah.

889
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,360
So but and Steve and I were having this really fun discussion with a few other folks about

890
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:44,080
why is it that the ketones are driving down the glucose levels? And conversely, and maybe this is

891
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,320
a different question, of course, but why is it that when we do these experiments of you take somebody

892
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:53,440
in nutritional ketosis, and you make them do really, really aggressive exercise, you know, do a two

893
01:21:53,440 --> 01:22:00,240
minute all out effort on the rowing machine, that the ketones go way down and the glucose goes way up?

894
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:05,760
Is it solely a consumption and hepatic glucose output issue? Is there something else going on?

895
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,960
You know, and I was like, while I kind of always assumed that we knew the answer to that, and that

896
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,040
it was the explanation I had, but you know, it wasn't at the end of that discussion, I was like,

897
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,080
actually, I pretty much now don't think I know the answer to this question.

898
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,040
I don't think we do. I have three potential explanations. One could be an exogenous ketone

899
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:31,520
induced release and insulin that facilitates glucose disposal. So we're that happens. You do

900
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,840
get I mean, it's not like consuming a protein bolus or a carbohydrate bolus, but you do get

901
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,080
an elevation of ketones. That's right. That's how we moderate our ketone levels, right? So as our

902
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:47,440
ketone levels, if we're on the ketogenic diet, and our ketones become elevated, there's ketone

903
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:53,440
urea, we pee out some ketones, and there's a number of products, but one is a ketone induced

904
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,200
release of insulin, which then feeds back on the liver to like a rheostat really, and lowering

905
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,640
beta oxidation, which totally makes sense, because that's the reason that someone with

906
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:09,520
type one diabetes can get ketoacidosis. They lose the checkpoint. Yep. Yep. And other researchers,

907
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:15,680
like if you asked Richard V, she'll tell you that insulin sensitivity is increased. So the insulin

908
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:21,440
that you have available and associated signaling is being enhanced in the presence of ketones.

909
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,720
Is that an immediate change? Or is that a change that takes place over a long period of time? That

910
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,920
sounds like a long standing issue. I think there's a number of regulatory things that happen. I know

911
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:39,520
in his study where rats were fed standard rodent chow, but 30 to 20% ketone ester, I think within

912
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:47,040
that chow, their baseline insulin levels went down like 50%. So that's just simply by, you know,

913
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:53,040
just the addition of the ketone, just the addition of the ketone over time, over, I think it was like

914
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:59,440
maybe a three week. I got to look to see the study, but it was, it was consuming ketone ester that was

915
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:05,760
integrated into the rat chow over a number of weeks, decreased baseline levels of insulin

916
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,640
significantly. I mean, it was like a huge effect and the implications of that, you know, as a rat

917
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:16,560
study, you know, you can argue rat study, but I can tell you experimentally that are just, you know,

918
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,200
testing on myself that the same observation happens. I can actually, if I get a significant

919
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:26,960
amount of my calories from exogenous ketones, and I do that over several weeks and I measure my

920
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:34,560
insulin, it gets below the reference range. Whereas if I get back to a regular ketogenic diet,

921
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:40,560
I'm always on the low end of the reference range, but I did find if I consume the maximum tolerable

922
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,160
dose of a ketone ester or ketone salt, and then I measure insulin, you know, an hour or two after

923
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:51,920
that, I do get a little bump up in insulin, but it's nowhere near the bump I would get up if I

924
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,800
ate an equivalent amount of calories from protein or carbohydrates, which would shoot me up to like,

925
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,400
you know, eight or 10 or something like that, you know, with a big dose, but it's usually somewhere

926
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:06,400
around, I bump it up from like 1.5 to like 2.5 or three or something like that. Those are still

927
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,920
super low. Yeah. And that's my baseline is usually between one and two.

928
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,800
So what has your IGF level changed in the years that you've been on ketosis? Have you tracked it

929
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,960
much? I have not. I've gotten it measured a few times, but not reliably. Like I do insulin

930
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,920
quite often, like every two months or so, like I'm doing that. And if I'm doing an experiment,

931
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:31,200
I may do multiple measurements of insulin like throughout the week, but I haven't measured IGF-1

932
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:36,080
recently. I did it a while back and I was just in the normal range, but I wasn't fasting. I didn't,

933
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,720
that's the one variable I wish I would have tried. Insulin was low, so I can assume IGF-1 might have

934
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,000
been a little bit low. Yeah. So just for listeners and stuff, how do we measure ketones? I mean,

935
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,480
people talk about urine strips versus blood. What are you measuring in each and breath for that

936
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,480
matter? You've got three ways to theoretically measure these things. Which one do we prefer and

937
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:59,600
why? For a newbie getting into this, I think the urine ketone strips will at least tell you if

938
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,360
you're in ketosis or not in ketosis. What is it measuring? A urine strip? It's measuring. If you're

939
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:08,560
peeing on it, what does it tell you? Urine acetoacetate is measured. And now there's a urine

940
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:15,040
beta-hydroxybutyrate kits that are available, so you could do that. So the Abbott Labs Precision

941
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:24,400
Extra and the Keto-Mojo are two devices that will measure basically a home assay kit for beta-hydroxybutyrate.

942
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:31,760
And we have used both of those things and kind of measured it against various assays in the lab and

943
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,440
blood that we send out for analysis. And it's pretty close. Pretty close, plus or minus,

944
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:43,600
maybe 10% or 15%. What does the urinary level, even though it's a qualitative assay, but everybody

945
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:50,480
says, hey, my urinary ketone thing lit up bright purple, can we infer anything from that about the

946
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:56,720
blood level of BHB or acetoacetate? Usually, unless you're running kind of dehydrated,

947
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:03,680
if you have a normal hydration state and your urine acetoacetate is 40 milligrams per deciliter

948
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:12,160
or above, you are probably hitting one millimolar or above. If you're anywhere between 40 and 80 to,

949
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:17,680
I think, 160 milligrams per deciliter, so you're in a state of ketosis. If you're at 15,

950
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,960
that's like light pink or something, you're usually probably not in a state,

951
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:28,160
what I would say, keto. That might be a normal state if you wake up in the morning in sort of

952
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,240
a facet state, you might be hitting that. But generally speaking, you need to be at about 80

953
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:38,320
milligrams per deciliter on the urine ketone strip. And the one thing I didn't do rather when I was

954
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:43,840
doing my sort of long foray into ketosis is I didn't use the urine meters at all. I was just,

955
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,640
you know, I was, I was keeping Abbott in business basically with how many of those precision extra

956
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:56,240
strips I was going through. So I don't know if my urinary excretion actually declined over time

957
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:01,760
when my body became better and better at retaining this potentially preferred fuel.

958
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,480
Have you done anything on that either personally or in the lab?

959
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:12,960
So what we use in the lab is the Clinitex Status device. And that device takes the Siemens 10SG kit,

960
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:20,480
so the multi-stick. So you can buy for a similar cost as the keto stick, you could buy the Siemens

961
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:27,760
10SG multi-stick and that measures 10 things, including urine acetoacetate. And you could take

962
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:33,200
that urine strip and stick that in a device that will give you more of a quantified number.

963
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:37,440
I see. So that's how you were giving me quantitative information on the urine.

964
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,680
Because I've only seen the qualitative stuff.

965
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,800
Well, it's a color change on the strip that's measured in the device.

966
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,600
Yeah, the device tells me.

967
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:52,640
Yeah. So over the years, I rejected urine ketone strips as something that just wasn't very accurate.

968
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,280
And the more I use them, making hundreds, if not thousands of measurements, the more I gain an

969
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:04,240
appreciation that it can be a pretty useful device. But I think it's, it's kind of useful for the

970
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:09,040
individual. Your hydration status definitely changes it. I mean, it's been in situations where

971
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:14,480
I'm dehydrated, where I've come out of the water after like a six hour dive, and I've

972
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:19,440
peed on those things. And it's like, it's like screaming. And I knew, I mean, I did some dives

973
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,360
where I purposely wasn't in ketosis for some of the research that we do. And I was deep into

974
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,480
into keto. It's just because I was, you know, very, very dehydrated.

975
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,640
I didn't know someone could dive for six hours.

976
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:35,920
I was on the NASA Nemo Extreme Environment Mission Operations trip. So I was a crew member

977
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,360
on that where I maintained I would lived in saturation for 10 days in a hyperbaric environment.

978
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:48,960
And that involves like an 18, 19 hour decompression to come out. So it's a NASA sort of a Mars analog

979
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:55,360
mission, where you work with astronauts underneath the sea. And I maintained a state of ketosis

980
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:00,720
throughout that whole mission and, and did lots and lots of measurements on myself down there.

981
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:07,440
And I saw really, when I one time I got out after maybe it was a six hour EVA. So essentially,

982
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:13,440
you're in a hyperbaric habitat on the bottom of the ocean. And then you go out into the water,

983
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,520
and then you come back inside the hyperbaric habitat. But when you're out in the water,

984
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,080
even though you're down in the Keys, the water water pools heat from you like 200 times faster

985
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,080
than air. So even though it's like, you know, upper 80s, I come out of that hypothermic and

986
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:36,000
dehydrated my blood glucose always was in like the 30s, sometimes in the 40s. When I was on the

987
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,520
key to I was testing some of the ketone supplements. Wow. Yeah, what were the other people experiencing

988
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:48,000
under those circumstances? Well, we'll find out with this my wife actually is was selected as a

989
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:56,800
crew member for NASA Nemo 23. I was on 22. And I did not get the IRB protocol approved to do all

990
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,240
the metabolic studies that I wanted to do. But I became an end of one on that and I collected a

991
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:10,960
lot of data on myself. So with this new mission, we have the Nemo NASA Nemo 23, we'll be able to make

992
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,800
some pretty comprehensive metabolic measurements, including things like hemoglobin h1c, we're going

993
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:23,200
to measure inflammation, hscrp, glucose ketones, all these things on all the crew members.

994
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,080
Interestingly, this year, it's a it's an all female crew. So you have like Samantha Christopher

995
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:36,000
ready, the famous European Tracy Caldwell Dyson, who I've known at NASA and my wife and it's all

996
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,040
female. So we'll have love some female data to go along with this. What surprised you the most in

997
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:48,240
your end of one? What did you see that you least expected? I saw why predicted that the habitat

998
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:54,720
would really trigger inflammation that was probably from the elevated co2 levels and the

999
01:31:54,720 --> 01:32:00,960
elevated oxidative stress, I chose to stay in a state of ketosis with the idea that that was my

1000
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,080
baseline state. We're doing studies on sleep, we're using the oral ring, you're probably familiar

1001
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:13,200
with that on sleep and also the polar v800 to collect heart rate variability data, gut microbiome,

1002
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:20,800
we're doing body composition measurements, we're doing stress. So we use the NIH toolbox and

1003
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:27,600
juggle to look at cognitive psych parameters. So that data has not been shared to me. So I don't

1004
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,920
know my wife collected some of that data and that's being analyzed, you know, later on for

1005
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,200
publication. But from a metabolic perspective, from a hormone perspective, some of the things

1006
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:43,680
living in that environment for 10 days decreased my testosterone. How much? I had a 25% decrease in

1007
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:50,080
testosterone from the time and so we're fairly, maybe fairly sleep deprived. I average about six

1008
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,200
hours of sleep per night, but I was getting like two and a half hours of deep sleep, which is more

1009
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:59,280
deep sleep than I typically, yeah, I was like, I don't know if it's something in the environment.

1010
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,080
It might be an artifact of how the sleep is being estimated. In other words, you know,

1011
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,280
if you think you're assuming you're giving that off the aura ring, right? Yeah, that was the aura

1012
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:14,320
ring. So the aura ring is measuring. But I usually get about 90 minutes sometimes like last last night,

1013
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:19,040
I got one hour and 53 minutes of deep sleep, but I usually get about one hour, one and a half hours

1014
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,360
of deep sleep, but I got over two hours every night. And instead of seven hours sleep at night,

1015
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:27,600
I was getting consistently just, you know, five to six hours sleep at night. So where are you

1016
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,600
getting mostly shortchanged on REM? Yeah, on REM, but my REM was even not that bad. Usually I was

1017
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,880
getting about an hour, you know, an hour around, which is not as much as that. Yeah, that's too

1018
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,000
low. Usually two is optimal for me, I think. So yeah, we measured sleep. The things that really

1019
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:52,560
stood out were being in the water really pushes my body into and being hypothermic really turns

1020
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,120
me into a fat burning machine. My ketones go off the chart and my glucose goes way down. It almost

1021
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,960
looks like a six hour EVA when I came back into the habitat, it looked like I fasted for a week.

1022
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,920
So I have all that data for that too, that I need to compile and analyze. Should we be looking at

1023
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:15,360
that, we meaning people as a potential way to replicate fast under a more stressful state?

1024
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,440
Looking at what, just underwater immersion? Yeah, do you think it was a combination of

1025
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:24,800
temperature and pressure primarily that was driving that effect? So over the holidays,

1026
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:31,280
we went to Thailand and we did, I did a lot of nitrox dives, something like 30 nitrox dives.

1027
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:37,360
And I made these measurements too. And I did see trends for decreased glucose and nitrox dives,

1028
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,160
we're doing like an hour, maybe hour, hour and a half dives at the most. And I saw trends,

1029
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:47,600
but nothing like the trends I saw in the saturation environment when we did these long EVAs.

1030
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,400
So do you think that the temperature was the difference or the duration?

1031
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:56,000
The temperature really has to have a difference because you come out and you're kind of shaky,

1032
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,160
even though you feel very comfy when you're down there the first two or three hours.

1033
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:08,160
And then by the end, the last four, five, six hours for a longer EVA, you start shaking a little bit

1034
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,960
uncontrollably. But it's kind of subtle, even though the water is kind of warm, like it feels

1035
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,800
warm, but it's just your body temperature is going down. And they were on the days, maybe I wasn't

1036
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:26,000
getting as much calories as I needed. I came out of that mission lighter than I've ever been before.

1037
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:32,480
I came out when we got back to mainland and I stepped on the scale, I was 207, which is super

1038
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:38,080
low for me. I ended up losing about maybe, I went in kind of late because I was training for it.

1039
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,880
I'm not a very good swimmer like you. I had to really train to meet, like you, it would be like

1040
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:48,320
a total day in the park for you to meet all the criteria for that. But I had to train really hard

1041
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,960
to meet the swim requirements. So I ended up losing a little bit of weight. But when I came out,

1042
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:59,280
I would definitely did the whole mission. I lost nine pounds and I came out seven. So I went in

1043
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:05,920
216. So I went in pretty late. I'm like 221 now. So last year I entered the mission at 216 and I

1044
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:12,000
came out like 207, which was like, I thought the scale was wrong. So even though I ate a lot of

1045
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,040
calories during that mission, my metabolic rate was really high, you know, and that was a consequence.

1046
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:23,760
That is so interesting because those are two completely contradictory concepts to me. On the

1047
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,200
one hand, you're saying, hey, my glucose levels went down. My ketone levels went up. It looked like

1048
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,440
I had fasted for a week. But of course, if you fasted for a week, your metabolic rate would be

1049
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:40,080
going down and not up. In fact, you would expect to see autophagy skyrocket. Whereas I'm sitting

1050
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,920
here as I'm listening to you thinking, would autophagy have increased during that period of

1051
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:50,880
time or decreased? I think anything that pushes glucose that low and ketones that high, and I

1052
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,240
think not really without knowing it, we're pretty task loaded. So you don't have all the time, you

1053
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:01,200
know, that much time to eat. I mean, part of the mission is that they're training. This is part of

1054
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:05,760
it's the only NASA analog where astronauts are actually part of the crew members. Like other

1055
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,440
things like high seas mission or NASA hero mission actually uses everyday folks and they push them to

1056
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:15,840
the limits and see how they can break them. But the NASA Nemo mission is actually training

1057
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,040
sort of astronauts. So they task load you to see what you're doing. And you don't have a whole lot

1058
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:27,840
of time to eat, but I was consuming what my normal calories would be, but I underestimated

1059
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,440
my calories for this. And I think it put me in a calorie deficit, which probably decreased my

1060
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:38,480
testosterone may have, my cortisol level increased, but it was still within the normal range.

1061
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:44,800
And you're away from the light. So your circadian is probably a bit screwed up too,

1062
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:50,000
being in the other side of the path. What depth are you at? You're only at like 60 feet. So you do see

1063
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:56,240
some of the light come down in, but it's probably a little bit different than I'm a very light sort

1064
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:00,880
of sun worshiper. Like I always try to get some light in the middle, you know, in the beginning of

1065
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,760
the day. And that that's part of something that I always do. So it was a bit disruptive in that

1066
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,320
sense. So let's talk about ketone, esters, salts, et cetera. So to your knowledge, what's the first

1067
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:16,960
exogenous ketone that was ever manufactured? Is that Vitaly one or exogenous ketone manufactured?

1068
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:23,440
So one three butane dial has been around a long time since the 1950s. Actually MIT did some

1069
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:32,000
research as a space fuel. So that got, there was a publication in 1975 where they were trying to

1070
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:38,000
identify an alternative energy fuel for long duration space flight. And the best candidate

1071
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,120
was one three butane dial, which is sort of a synthetic compound that breaks down completely

1072
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:51,360
to beta hydroxybutyrate. Meaning the liver is not required to transform it into BHB. The liver

1073
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:59,040
is required through a couple simple steps. So sodium beta hydroxybutyrate would be the first

1074
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,840
sort of ketone, exogenous ketone that was used clinically. And that there was a number of papers

1075
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:09,600
that utilized that for rare metabolic disorders actually. So that would be the first one and a

1076
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:16,560
lot of the IP and sort of patterns that came out were sodium beta hydroxybutyrate. And then

1077
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,880
maybe explain for people what the difference is between a salt and an ester. So we'll leave

1078
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,120
acetoacetate out of that for a moment. Yeah. But if you talk about beta hydroxybutyrate,

1079
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,880
but you can have a CO acetate salt too. So I can mention that. So I didn't know that. I

1080
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,880
thought it was only a di ester. So that's, we'll definitely want to hear about that. So on the BHB

1081
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:38,320
front, people are sort of inundated with ketone salts, ketone esters, and then a whole bunch of

1082
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,880
complete like weird stuff like raspberry ketones and stuff. But let's just leave the nonsense off

1083
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,840
the table. Yeah. But if you just talk about comparing a ketone, a BHB ester to a BHB salt,

1084
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:54,000
what's the chemical difference? Yeah. So a salt is just an ionic bond, right? Between the ketone

1085
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:00,960
molecule, beta hydroxybutyrate, a monovalent or a divalent cation, or an alkaline amino acid,

1086
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:08,080
like arginine, citrulline, histidine, lysine. So you can literally ionically bond beta hydroxybutyrate

1087
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:14,320
to a number of different things. The easiest thing to do is to bond it with sodium, potassium,

1088
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:19,760
calcium, and magnesium. Now calcium and magnesium have two positive charges. You could put two

1089
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:26,320
BHBs on them. That's the advantage, sort of an advantage. A disadvantage, I guess, with magnesium

1090
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:32,480
BHB, which is actually is very bioavailable magnesium. I measured my magnesium after taking

1091
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:39,040
it. It went up quite high. Disadvantage is that your GI tolerability to something like magnesium

1092
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:46,800
beta hydroxybutyrate may be only somewhere between one to three grams. Three grams max per dose.

1093
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:54,320
Wow, which is not that much. One gram, three times a day, at least for me, has no issues. I could

1094
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:58,560
probably tolerate two or three grams per day. So it's nice. I mean, it's something that's

1095
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,920
contributing, but ideally what you want to do with a ketone salt is, because salt has a stigma,

1096
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:10,320
I call them ketone electrolyte formulations, is to spread the beta hydroxybutyrate out across

1097
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,760
monovalent and divalent cations. And they're the four that have the most utility.

1098
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,400
And then an ester, of course, is a covalent bond, not an ionic bond, right?

1099
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:28,480
Yeah. So you can take one three butane dial and you could create a mono ester with beta hydroxybutyrate

1100
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,560
and just add it, do a trans esterification reaction and combine that beta hydroxybutyrate

1101
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:40,080
to one three butane dial or acetoacetate. You can combine with one three butane, or you could

1102
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:46,240
take glycerol. So with glycerol, you can come up with a triester of glycerol, which we have.

1103
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:51,200
Basically, you're creating a triglyceride that is instead of three fatty acids, you put three BHBs.

1104
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:55,280
It's pretty cool molecule, yeah. So we have some experience using that.

1105
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,320
I told a story like many, many years ago, probably four or five years ago on Tim Ferriss' podcast

1106
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:05,040
about how I drank this jet fuel and almost thought I was going to go blind. Of course,

1107
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,280
what I may or may not have omitted from that story was that you gave it to me.

1108
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:16,240
The ketones today taste a heck of a lot better than that earlier Gen stuff. Even when I told you

1109
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:22,160
that I just took the 50 ml vial you sent and chugged it in one sitting, even you were horrified.

1110
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,720
You're like, wait, wait, wait. You didn't read the note I wrote you explaining how to dilute it and

1111
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:31,520
mix it. I thought we had talked about it. We had assuredly talked about it. I know you're very

1112
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,640
enthusiastic about getting started. Yeah, I couldn't resist. I was too. That stuff's

1113
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:43,040
unbearably bad. Whereas the ketone salts actually don't taste bad. They obviously be strong.

1114
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,960
They could formulate it. It tastes awesome. Yeah, yeah. So why does the ester... Is there

1115
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,360
an obvious reason from an olfactory slash taste perspective why they are so staggeringly horrible?

1116
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:57,200
Or at least they were. I mean, I'm told they're better today.

1117
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:03,120
Yeah, I would say the ketogenic potency is inversely proportional to taste.

1118
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:11,440
So it just seems like the more potent these compounds get, even the triester beta-hydroxybutyrate

1119
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,400
is pretty nasty stuff. Meaning that glycerol, triglyceride.

1120
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:22,080
Yeah, it's a great molecule. I mean, it has lots of tremendous utility. Well,

1121
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:27,040
making a ketone ester with 1,3-butane diol is really cool because the 1,3-butane diol itself...

1122
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,080
You get some more substrate.

1123
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,480
... gets broken down. Yeah. So that goes into another question, the whole enantiomer. So if

1124
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:38,480
you use the R-beta-hydroxybutyrate with the R-1,3-butane diol, then you can really get ketone

1125
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:44,880
levels up pretty high. And that would be sort of the delta G or the human ketone ester that's out

1126
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:52,320
there. It's the R enantiomer? That would be the R. Yeah, the R. So you can get racemic 1,3-butane

1127
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:58,560
diol, but that's the R enantiomer of 1,3-butane diol with the R-beta-hydroxybutyrate. Can we

1128
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:03,200
explain to everybody what R versus L means in the enantiomer world?

1129
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:10,080
So beta-hydroxybutyrate, not acetoacetate, but beta-hydroxybutyrate has a stereoisomer. So if

1130
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:16,960
you put your hands together, the R-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or let's do D and L, let's do that. So the D

1131
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:24,080
would be equivalent to the R-beta-hydroxybutyrate would be the mirror image of the L-beta-hydroxybutyrate.

1132
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:31,840
And the predominant form of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the body is D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. We do have

1133
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:38,000
a racemase enzyme in various tissues that can convert the D to the L.

1134
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,360
So but when you're in nutritional ketosis or starvation ketosis, you are making D an

1135
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,120
enantiomer of the BHB?

1136
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:51,440
Predominantly, yeah. So we do have the capacity to make the L, but it's pretty minimal. So that

1137
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:58,880
brings up the question. I think 99% of all the ketone salts being sold right now are racemic.

1138
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,240
So they are the D and the L.

1139
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:00,880
Equal.

1140
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:01,360
When you give-

1141
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:01,680
Equal.

1142
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:09,760
Yeah, yeah. They're equal amount. And there may be a concern there, but we don't know. So most of my

1143
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:14,160
research has actually been with the racemic compounds and they work great therapeutically.

1144
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:18,000
In pharmacology, there's a sordid history of getting the enantiomer wrong. I mean,

1145
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,840
one of the most famous stories I know of is fenfen.

1146
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:27,120
Oh, thalidomide as well. Yeah. So that's right. Thalidomide and fenfen were both examples of

1147
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,800
using the wrong enantiomer.

1148
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:35,840
Many pharmaceuticals like I think ibuprofen and I know like ephedrine is racemic and many of the

1149
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,400
drugs out there. So and things like ringers lactate, I think lactate is-

1150
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,520
It's usually D.

1151
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,520
Is it D now? It used to be racemic.

1152
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,000
Oh, really?

1153
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,560
I think, yeah.

1154
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,160
I think you can get both.

1155
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:46,640
Okay.

1156
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:53,040
So you're saying, look, physiologically exist at 90, 10 D to L and then you're buying something

1157
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:58,240
racemic. You at least have to entertain the question, hey, am I ingesting something that

1158
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:00,560
might have a negative side effect?

1159
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:00,880
Yeah.

1160
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,120
And so the ketone esters, they're mirroring the physiology or they're just going mostly

1161
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,000
D presumably.

1162
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,720
Well, the human ketone ester, from my understanding, is completely D. So it's produced the D beta

1163
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:16,320
hydroxybutyrate. Interestingly, elevating just beta hydroxybutyrate in our seizure models,

1164
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:22,480
even with the D, does not have an anti-seizure effect. So that's actually why we went to the

1165
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,480
1,3-butane diol.

1166
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,520
Sorry, say that again.

1167
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:25,760
Yeah.

1168
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,080
Did you say that if you use a pure D salt?

1169
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,560
D salt or D ester?

1170
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,360
Pure D salt or pure D ester, no anti-seizure benefit.

1171
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:39,040
No anti-seizure effect with beta hydroxybutyrate. We need it. And the animal models even suggest

1172
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:45,040
if you just look even studies beyond our study is that you need to elevate acetoacetate has the

1173
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:51,920
anti-seizure effect. And we don't know exactly why that happens. The ketone ester that we work with,

1174
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:57,600
which is 1,3-butane diol acetoacetate diester, elevates beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate

1175
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,280
in approximately a one-to-one ratio.

1176
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,840
Is that what you used to give me or was I just getting?

1177
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,280
I gave you a bunch of things.

1178
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:08,480
What was the one in the capsule that tasted even worse than the BHB?

1179
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,760
Ester.

1180
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:15,120
Actually, that was the diester of acetoacetate. And that's really potent.

1181
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,480
And it was bound to what?

1182
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,920
It 1,3-butane diol.

1183
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,240
That shit was from another planet of bad. I still have some because...

1184
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,440
I've done shots of that.

1185
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,800
I like to just give it to people.

1186
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:31,600
I put many gallons of that through me and done quite a bit of blood work and know,

1187
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,640
pretty reliably, at least in my body, that it's not toxic. And pretty much all the

1188
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,880
biomarkers go in a remarkably positive direction.

1189
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,560
But even though I know that, it's not enough for me to consume it.

1190
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,320
Even though it has that. And that's no matter how great a substance can be,

1191
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:53,520
if it doesn't taste good, even me, I'm not going to take it. Even in a capsule.

1192
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,640
I just think it's an aftertaste.

1193
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:58,560
Exactly. Well, I also remember you telling me, because you sent them and I was like,

1194
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,080
oh, sweet. It'll be capsules. Because I had seen your animal data and I was like,

1195
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,440
I want that. And then you said, okay, well, I'll send it to you in capsules because you

1196
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:09,200
can't drink it. It's too bad. And I was like, perfect situation resolved. And you said,

1197
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:14,960
nah, not entirely. You'll still taste it through the capsule. And I actually find it to be a great

1198
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:21,280
dinner party trick. Who's the biggest tough guy here that just wants to show me how much of this

1199
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:26,080
stuff they can ingest? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've done a lot of work with that, Esther,

1200
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:34,080
and it has remarkable effects, but we think it's probably more suited for a medical food and

1201
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,000
something that could be sort of a parenteral, you know, IV therapy.

1202
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
So who first synthesized that?

1203
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:47,920
So I reached out to Henri Bruningrabber at Case Western, who was the director of the

1204
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:55,120
Metabolomics NIH funded, I think Metabolomics Core at Case Western. And I reached out to everybody,

1205
01:48:55,120 --> 01:49:00,480
but I, who, who had any experience, you know, either researching with ketone esters or

1206
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:06,800
synthesizing them. And he kindly gave me the recipe on how to synthesize it that was above

1207
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:12,640
and beyond the patent. It was actually a detailed recipe on how to use a Kugelro distillation

1208
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:16,560
apparatus, where to get the vacuum pressure. You didn't already know how to do that?

1209
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,000
I knew it was short past it.

1210
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:25,680
Well, actually, so Patrick Arnold, as you know, kind of helped me with the art. So an organic

1211
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,320
chemistry really is an art, you know, to be able to do this.

1212
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,080
And Patrick is an artist.

1213
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:34,720
Patrick is an artist. And he was, he thought this was like shady stuff in the beginning. And I kept

1214
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:40,080
sending him papers. And, and then he realized that this could be something big, you know,

1215
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:44,960
he realized that the science was there. And there was a lot of big players in this field,

1216
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,360
who had done remarkable research, but this didn't really have what it took to like,

1217
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,680
actually make it a product, like synthesize it in the stuff that you actually consume.

1218
01:49:54,320 --> 01:50:00,400
I became obsessed with Patrick after this stuff happened. And he actually introduced him to Tim.

1219
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:06,720
And in the show notes to this, I'll make sure that we link to Tim's podcast with Patrick,

1220
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:11,680
which I'd love to have Patrick on the show at some point to to talk about this should this

1221
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:18,560
show end up persisting. But that episode with Tim and Patrick is so interesting. It's like if you

1222
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:24,960
have any interest in endocrinology, in sort of like how the hormones work, how steroids work,

1223
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:30,480
it's yeah, yeah, it's just what I care. I owe a lot to Patrick, I don't think I probably wouldn't

1224
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:36,080
have gotten tenure without Pat, I owe so much to him. So I need to acknowledge him for that, that

1225
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:43,520
there were academic icons out there who could not do what Patrick did for me. And he was pretty

1226
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:49,520
persistent in doing it too. So he synthesized first the mono ester. And then it was a mixed of

1227
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:56,400
mono ester and diester, but he nailed it down to, you know, ultimately getting the art of the organic

1228
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:01,200
chemistry to where it's pretty much pure diester. He's such a he's such a wonderful human being.

1229
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,240
Anytime I email Patrick a question, which invariably I do have like clinically I'll have a question

1230
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,160
about a hormone or they'll be like, there's no textbook that knows the answer. There's no paper

1231
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:15,040
that knows the answer. I'm like Patrick, I got a crazy question for you. And it's like, even if

1232
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,840
he doesn't know the answer, I mean, he'll have a more thoughtful insight than you can get anywhere.

1233
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,400
And it's yeah, it speaks to his capabilities. So first of all, you shared with me something I

1234
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:29,200
didn't actually know today that's really interesting, which is this notion that if you are purely using

1235
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:34,480
the D and antimer, you do not get any of the anti seizure benefits. Whereas if you're at 9010,

1236
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,920
presumably you're getting them. So you don't need a lot of the L but you need some of the L.

1237
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:43,680
Yeah, I don't think there's any studies that show using an exogenous ketone in the form of pure

1238
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:50,960
beta hydroxybutyrate is beneficial. So what we do know is that when you deliver exogenous ketones

1239
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:58,480
in a beta hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio of one to one, that that has pretty remarkable

1240
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:03,520
anti seizure effects. And there was some studies that were done with acetoacetate and also some

1241
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,560
studies that were done with acetone showing anti seizure effects. So I do think it's

1242
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:20,720
acetoacetate is necessary. So what we don't know, I don't think that racemic salts or racemic

1243
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:28,720
esters or esters that produce both D and L beta hydroxybutyrate are a concern. I have not seen

1244
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:34,080
data to suggest that these would be a health concern. There are companies out there that are

1245
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:42,000
selling 8 million sort of doses per month of salts that are racemic in nature. And there have been

1246
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,320
sort of no consequences from that that have been reported. So how are so many companies able to do

1247
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:52,400
this? Is there no IP in the salt world anymore? I don't think there is IP for the key. I think

1248
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:57,280
some of the early patents may expired. So I don't think there's actually there's there's some

1249
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:04,240
intellectual property with formulations of a ketone salt and a ketogenic fat and MCT. And that's

1250
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:08,640
some of the stuff that my university has. And there's some composition matter patents and maybe

1251
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:15,360
some use patents around the D salts, I think, and maybe the D ketone esters. So at this point in

1252
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:20,240
time, do you think that the ketone salts have more physiologic benefit than the ketone esters,

1253
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:27,200
just as a function of having a higher amount of the L enantiomer? So I think when it comes

1254
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:33,760
to purely a metabolic fuel, I think the D beta hydroxybutyrate has some advantages, right? So

1255
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:41,440
we also know that in regards to some of the signaling effects, especially the inflammation,

1256
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:48,800
the NLRP3 and phlammasome is suppressed by beta hydroxybutyrate, both the D and the L form. And

1257
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:56,080
we know that when we consume racemic ketone salts in the D and L form, the L form tends to stick

1258
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:01,920
around longer and gets metabolized slower. So conceivably, that could be having a stronger

1259
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:08,960
anti-inflammatory effect because you have a ketone body and endogenous metabolite that's functioning

1260
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:16,000
as a very powerful signaling molecule that's suppressing an inflammatory pathway. So the

1261
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,320
concentration just tends to get higher. That's my view of it. So we haven't really studied that in

1262
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:28,960
detail, but the lab that did some of the work on showing the Nature Medicine paper that showed

1263
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:35,280
the NLRP3 and phlammasome was suppressed by beta hydroxybutyrate. It occurred both in the D and

1264
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:41,360
the L form. We do know that the L form gets metabolized slower, so the concentrations in

1265
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:47,280
the tissue may actually reach higher levels. So what we have observed is that the racemic

1266
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,960
beta hydroxybutyrate has a glucose lowering effect. So we're trying to figure out.

1267
01:54:52,960 --> 01:55:01,120
But we also see that in the pure D and antimer. I've seen that with the human product, which is

1268
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:06,480
obviously a pure D BHB. I think they're seeing about a 20 to 30% reduction in glucose. Do you

1269
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:14,720
see more in the racemic? It tends to be the case, especially with 1,3-butane diol. You see it? And

1270
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:19,360
maybe it's a redox shift in the liver. That's what Henri Brueninger-Grabber thought,

1271
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:24,880
but it's pretty remarkable. And when we compare, so I have some products in my bag, I'll give you,

1272
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:29,680
I have been doing a lot of work with D salts. So I've been consuming D salts and pretty high

1273
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:35,920
levels that bring my ketone levels up pretty close to an ester. So you can formulate sort of.

1274
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,600
Which in you is how high?

1275
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:43,760
If the elevation of my ketones gets more than 3 millimolar, I just start feeling a little bit weird.

1276
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,040
Which is interesting because you've experienced naturally occurring ketones at much higher than

1277
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:49,760
that level.

1278
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:55,680
Yeah, but I don't actually, I'm a pretty good ketone burner. So you could do a glucose tolerance

1279
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:00,320
test. I do a ketone tolerance test. The ketone tolerance test is consuming a known amount of

1280
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,880
ketones and looking at that pharmacokinetic curve.

1281
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:09,520
So you measure, so you'll do fasting level of BHB glucose insulin for your fatty acid,

1282
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,240
ingest your ketone and then measure at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes.

1283
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:19,280
And athletes have, when you challenge them with a ketone tolerance test, I'm creating

1284
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:26,000
like a new test here, they actually dispose of ketones and utilize it remarkably effectively.

1285
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
When you take a couch potato, and this is the same as the couch potato rats,

1286
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,760
you could push a couch potato rat into ketoacidosis if they're older. Their tissues are

1287
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,880
not effectively utilizing the ketones for fuel. And I've seen that in some individuals and some

1288
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:46,720
people, I get hundreds of emails and people show me their data. And one packet of even a

1289
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,800
commercial ketone product on the market can shoot some people up to like five or six,

1290
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,760
which is like that never gets clear.

1291
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:57,120
And just to be clear, in that ketone tolerance test, which by the way, I freaking love this idea,

1292
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:01,120
how have you not told me that until today? Holding out on your best stuff.

1293
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,600
It's just materialized in my brain. What am I going to call it?

1294
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:08,000
I don't know, but next time you get one of these ideas, just pick up the phone, you know my number,

1295
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,960
you call me and you tell me this stuff. It's like you're holding out on me.

1296
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:14,720
Just kidding. I want to make sure I understand something. Is this independent of whether or not

1297
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:18,480
that athlete was in ketosis before or after? In other words, how much of that utilization

1298
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:24,800
is a function of the metabolic machinery in the muscle to utilize ketone versus,

1299
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,640
hey, athletes are just better at oxidation to begin with.

1300
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:34,800
Fat adapted athletes are very good ketone utilizers and have a hard time elevating their

1301
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,800
ketone levels with the ketogenic diet sometimes.

1302
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,840
If you take a high carb athlete who's still fit as a fiddle and you do this test,

1303
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,680
how do they behave?

1304
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:49,680
Not as well. And I do think that high performing athletes probably are bouncing in and out of

1305
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:55,360
ketosis, right? You have post-exercise ketosis just from the energy depletion that you get

1306
01:57:55,360 --> 01:58:01,120
during exercise. So their bodies are probably used to seeing ketones, using them as fuel.

1307
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:07,920
But if you take someone who's a real keto adapted fat burning ketone machine and you hit them with

1308
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,880
high doses of ketones, they tend to dispose of them very quickly. So they've up-regulated

1309
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:18,560
ketone transport across membranes, across the blood brain barrier through the MCT transporters,

1310
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,600
which are up-regulated.

1311
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:23,120
And this of course is not the same MCT that we talked about earlier.

1312
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:28,240
No. These are monocarboxylic acid transporters. It also transport things like lactate and pyruvate.

1313
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:34,560
And because the MCT transporters are much higher and more dense in the membrane, you could probably

1314
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:41,680
clear lactate faster. So I think that may contribute in part to why keto adapted athletes produce less

1315
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,240
lactate.

1316
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:46,160
It's funny you say that. I hadn't thought of that actually. I didn't realize that in ketosis,

1317
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:51,040
you up-regulate MCT. I've always suspected that that might play a role in the genetic

1318
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:57,440
differences between athletes. Why do some athletes seem virtually un-paralyzed

1319
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:02,720
by anaerobic activity? And it's like, look, if you can shut a lactate out of the cell quick enough,

1320
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:09,200
you can recycle it and reuse it. We actually tried to get an IRB of an N of 1,

1321
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,760
a guy named Ryan Flaherty, who I don't know if you know Ryan.

1322
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,040
Yeah. I know the name.

1323
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:18,080
You'll know of him. Yeah. So Ryan and I and a couple of other guys tried to get an N of 1 IRB

1324
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:26,160
at UCSD to do muscle biopsies on ourselves pre and post a certain type of nutrition exercise routine

1325
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:32,080
we wanted to implement that Ryan has pioneered with a number of endurance athletes. And that

1326
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:38,480
was one of our endpoints was could we see an up-regulation of MCT because the hypothesis was

1327
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:43,040
the certain type of training stress was going to lead to that, which would obviously increase our

1328
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:47,680
performance at a certain level of output. But super interesting to think about that through

1329
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:50,880
the level of the ketone potentially enhancing that signaling.

1330
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,200
Yeah, it is. A lot of things to think about there.

1331
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:57,840
So I'm going to caveat my next question with a really serious caveat, but it's also a very

1332
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:01,200
serious question. And I was sort of on the fence about whether I'd ask you this or not, but I

1333
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,600
I'm going to say, screw it. I'm going to ask you anyway. I'm going to caveat this by giving the

1334
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:11,680
disclaimer, which is your PhD scientist, you do basic research. You are not an MD,

1335
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:16,160
you are not an oncologist and nothing you say is going to be construed as medical advice.

1336
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:21,840
So with that said, I still have to ask you a question, which is if tomorrow you,

1337
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:26,480
your wife, someone you cared about deeply was diagnosed with cancer and it was a cancer for

1338
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:32,720
which all standard therapies had been exhausted and you are now left to the best insights you

1339
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:39,840
have with respect to your knowledge of cancer metabolism. Tell me what pulling out all the stops

1340
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,640
looks like. And again, what I'm this is in the context of you've taken and you are complying

1341
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:48,800
with all chemotherapeutic radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, surgical therapy, etc.

1342
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:54,640
But you're losing, right? So something else needs to be done. What is that combination of that

1343
02:00:54,640 --> 02:01:00,000
something look like? So I guess, I mean, when we think about the worst cancer, worst case scenario,

1344
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,960
who'd have pancreatic is pretty bad, but probably glioblastoma would top the list of things, right?

1345
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:11,920
And would your answer be different if I was asking you about pancreatic adenocarcinoma versus GBM?

1346
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,800
I think, you know, it would be there's things like with pancreatic cancer can make it hard

1347
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:22,320
for someone to follow the ketogenic diet, right? Because and liver cancer and things like that. So

1348
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:27,040
they need to approach it a little bit different and you can have a lot of unexpected consequences,

1349
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:32,000
metabolic consequences by someone with liver cancer if they have heavy liver Mets or

1350
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,040
let's make it simpler. Brain cancers. Let's talk about GBM and metastatic breast cancer.

1351
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:44,480
Okay. Okay. So start with GBM your loved one or you have GBM. Yeah, I would say it would be useful,

1352
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:50,720
not necessarily, you know, absolutely necessary to ask for an FDG PET scan, do a PET CT. And

1353
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:54,640
especially, I mean, with GBM, it's going to light up like there's no tomorrow. Right. So just for

1354
02:01:54,640 --> 02:02:02,000
the listener. So FDG PET means you take glucose, you label glucose with a molecule. Yeah. And then

1355
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:08,160
when you do the PET scan shows by lighting up anything that absorbs that and the most rapidly

1356
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:13,840
metabolizing tissues of glucose light that up, which is almost always any cancer. And then a brain

1357
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:18,320
normally lights up. So a brain with cancer takes that to another level. Yeah. So you're doing that

1358
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:24,400
to document that this is a high glycolytic tumor. Yeah. Okay. So even now there's a lot of experimental

1359
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:29,360
things going on for GBM, but pretty much the standard of care is not offering any survival

1360
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:35,920
advantage when it comes to this. So we did GBM is uniformly fatal. I believe the five, the five year

1361
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:45,200
survival is almost zero. Yeah. Yep. And the mutation rate in GBM is they're very, very heterogeneous

1362
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:51,200
in regards to the number of mutations. So many of the standard of care therapies that target specific

1363
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:59,520
pathways just are not efficacious because you have a grossly mutated cells throughout the tumor. So

1364
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:06,880
I'd probably, my answer would default back to this press pulse idea that we published in

1365
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:16,400
nutrition and metabolism. Is that the one in 2017? No, actually. So the, the 2017 paper was in seminars

1366
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:22,400
and cancer. And that was with oncologists at the Moffitt cancer center, where we discuss how the

1367
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:30,080
ketogenic diet essentially targets the warburg effect and in doing so really targets all the

1368
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:35,280
hallmarks of cancer. So any cancer biologist, you know, is writing a review on paper, like, you know,

1369
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:40,960
you talk about the hallmarks of cancer. There's enhanced proliferation, evasion of immune system,

1370
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:47,520
angiogenesis, all these different things, evasion of apoptosis, the ketogenic diet, nutritional

1371
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,200
ketosis actually targets all those things and even the aberrant metabolism and the increase

1372
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:59,920
in inflammation that's, you know, is now a hallmark of cancer. So from the press pulse, the simplest

1373
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,800
way to describe it, at least its implementation, which I think is probably most important for the

1374
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:12,240
listeners is to achieve a glucose ketone index. So press essentially means you were providing

1375
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:18,160
metabolic stress to the cancer cells that can stop their rapid growth and proliferation. It's

1376
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:23,600
like taking the, your foot off the gas pedal of cancer cell growth. And there's a number of things

1377
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:30,560
that we could do to slow down cancer growth and proliferation and metabolically stress those cancer

1378
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:39,280
cells. And that can be done continuously. And pulse protocols, you have a wide expanding toolbox of

1379
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:45,680
modalities that can be used in an intermittent fashion that can be sort of tactically used at

1380
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:54,960
different time points to kill off the cancer cells that you have applied the press stress to. So press

1381
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:01,360
protocols, which are done continuously would be something like a calorie restricted ketogenic

1382
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:08,800
diet, perhaps with intermittent fasting, perhaps a low dose metformin. And what was the ketone to

1383
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:15,680
glucose ratio that you want to see? I would want to see anywhere between a maintenance of one to two.

1384
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:21,120
Meaning that's the glucose to ketone ratio. A daily maintenance of one to two. Yeah. So glucose should

1385
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:26,640
never be more than twice the ketone level when both are measured in millimolar. Yeah. Ideally,

1386
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:31,760
in a perfect scenario, three millimolar ketones, three millimolar glucose. So that's kind of hard

1387
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:37,280
to achieve, but not with a number of tools. So there's a number of tools that you can use to

1388
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,720
achieve that. And that needs to, and there are things that we could talk about too. So the fastest

1389
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:50,480
way to get to a glucose ketone index of, and maintain that of one to two would be what I would call

1390
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:56,400
supplemented ketogenic intermittent fasting. Right. So, uh, when you eat within a restricted

1391
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:02,160
time window, say of like six hours a day, you start eating at, you know, 2 PM and finish at

1392
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:10,640
8 PM seems relatively easy to do. And within that fasting window, if needed, you could consume

1393
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:17,280
calories in the form of perhaps exogenous ketones. And that would further lower glucose and elevate

1394
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:23,200
ketone levels like within a range. And they are commercially available ketone products on the

1395
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:28,960
market. Millions are being consumed and there's no kind of adverse effects. You know, when you

1396
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,400
compare it to something like a Red Bull, which you'll find lots of adverse effects. So there's

1397
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,640
fairly good safety data, but this needs to be studied. But the difference is Red Bull sponsors

1398
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:41,120
a formula one team. So it's, it's gotta be better. Yeah. Yeah. So these things are relatively safe

1399
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:46,800
and their utility are that, you know, they can help you achieve a glucose ketone index.

1400
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:54,000
And when you do have a glucose ketone index of one to two, you are limiting fermentable fuels

1401
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:59,680
to the cancer cells and also most likely suppressing the hormone insulin tremendously

1402
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:04,320
to get there. And, and because I'm sure you'll be asked or I'll be asked, is the reason you are

1403
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:09,680
applying an intermittent or time restricted feeding algorithm to this because during the

1404
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:15,600
fasted time you increase ketogenesis or because there was something specific about having complete

1405
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:20,320
liver and gut rest. In other words, is there a reason that an individual should or should not

1406
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:26,960
consume exogenous ketones and or MCT during the fasting window? Yeah. I think if it's difficult

1407
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:33,440
for them to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two, one of the tools in the toolbox could be

1408
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:38,720
to consume exogenous ketones during that fasting period. I think it can be helped. And you can also

1409
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:44,000
consume them during the feeding period too. And they provide an extra source of calories. That's

1410
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:50,160
a nonfermentable fuel. And I think have a benefits in and of itself. You could just talk about the

1411
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:55,200
anti-inflammatory benefits. You know, I think there are a number of different benefits. So that

1412
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:01,280
press protocol is pretty aggressive. Yeah. And, and it could also include things like meditation

1413
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:07,520
and yoga, I mean, and exercise of course, low intensity exercise, I think. But the most important

1414
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:12,800
thing from my perspective of the press. So we're just talking about the press is to get that

1415
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:19,760
glucose ketone index to one to two or better or one to two or better. And then once that is

1416
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:25,680
achieved or concurrently, so you could think about different modalities for the pulse protocol.

1417
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:34,400
So changing your metabolic physiology with what we just described will have a huge effect on

1418
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,760
targeting the Warburg effect. And also we'll be already targeting all the hallmarks of cancer.

1419
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:45,120
So you have a different person. You have just changed that person's metabolism. You know,

1420
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:49,680
I mean, the glucose ketone index of the average Joe out on the street is probably something

1421
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:55,840
like 25 or 50. It's like nowhere near that. Right. So you are literally changing the metabolic

1422
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:03,440
physiology of that person. So modalities that they may be resistant to or completely failed

1423
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:08,880
may have an effect now. So chemo radiation, maybe immune based therapies may be working now.

1424
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:14,320
But an important point, right? We view this as an as an agile. So you could do a neo-agivant,

1425
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:19,680
concurrent or adjuvant approach. So and I think that what I just described can be used as a

1426
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:26,160
neo-agivant concurrent and an adjuvant approach. Yeah. So people talk about cancer approaches as

1427
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:31,360
look, you want to think about the legs of a stool. So you take a chemo therapeutic approach,

1428
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:35,600
you take a radiation approach, you take an immune based approach and you take a surgical approach.

1429
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:40,000
Those are really the four pillars of cancer treatment today. Yeah. You're basically saying,

1430
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,240
look, there needs to be a new type of oncologist, which is the metabolic oncologist. So you have a

1431
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:48,640
surgical oncologist, you have a radiation oncologist, you have a medical oncologist,

1432
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:53,840
you now have an immuno oncologist. Why don't we have a metabolic oncologist? Yeah. Things will

1433
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:59,360
lead that way. And just by the research that's being done now, the huge amount of research being

1434
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:06,240
done, even on onco metabolites and all the genetics people are now focusing on the how

1435
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:13,040
metabolism is influencing genetics. Metabolism is a driver for our biology and influencing

1436
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:18,800
epigenetic expression. So, you know, the work I'd like to also point to the work of a friend of

1437
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:24,080
mine and colleague, Adrian check, who was, did her work at the Barrow neurological Institute,

1438
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:32,960
which demonstrated in a mouse model, GL two 61, I think model of glial blastoma that using

1439
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:38,720
temozolomide and also radiation with really focusing on radiation, that being in a state

1440
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:46,880
of nutritional ketosis made radiation therapy many, many times more efficacious in that mouse

1441
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:54,080
model, which is kind of a gold standard model for GBM. It actually cured the GBM in that mouse model

1442
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:00,480
using the ketogenic diet combined with whole brain radiation. So that was a pretty significant

1443
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:05,200
finding that actually spearheaded some of the ketogenic diet clinical research.

1444
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:10,800
In her research, this was done with dietary or nutritional ketosis, not exogenous supplementation.

1445
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:17,440
Not does she went on to do some work with exogenous ketones and looking at how ketones

1446
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:24,640
can reprogram the metabolism and ketones can actually have, they are like Cox two inhibitors.

1447
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:30,400
They inhibit reactive oxygen species, which is driving growth and proliferation. So that work

1448
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:35,680
spawned research just on ketones by themselves in her animal model.

1449
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,920
So what is in your pulse protocol then?

1450
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:41,360
Pulse protocol can be varied. So hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

1451
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,720
At what frequency?

1452
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:49,600
Three, generally speaking. So with the GBM you have to, so a consequence of a GBM could be seizures,

1453
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:54,480
right? So getting hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a GBM is tricky.

1454
02:11:54,480 --> 02:12:01,920
So yes, you have to start very low, probably like somewhere around 1.5 ATA and then work

1455
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:08,480
up gradually from there based on the individual person. But generally speaking, the research that

1456
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:14,000
we did showed that not five days a week, which is typically used for wound healing, but I do think

1457
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:21,840
there needs to be a day off for adaptive effects to happen. So three days a week, 2.5 atmospheres

1458
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:30,240
for 60 minutes, three times a week. And that produces, well, reverse tumor hypoxia for one

1459
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:38,800
thing. So hyperbaric oxygen increases tissue oxygenation, not by hyper oxygenating hemoglobin,

1460
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:44,000
but it actually gets oxygen into the plasma. And that's a very important thing because

1461
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,120
meaning you solubilize oxygen within the plasma.

1462
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:47,600
Yes.

1463
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,280
Because you can't really supersaturate the hemoglobin that much more here at the top of

1464
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:51,760
the curve.

1465
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:56,960
Yeah. You and I are sitting here. I don't know what this air here, but your hemoglobin is

1466
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:04,160
essentially saturated, probably 96, 98%. But the hyper oxygenation that occurs with hyperbaric

1467
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:09,680
oxygen therapy, and this is why oxygen therapy does not work independent of an increase in

1468
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:15,600
pressure, right? So the increase in pressure is needed to drive the oxygen into the plasma.

1469
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:20,800
And once it's in the plasma, tumors have erratic vasculature, right? And then the

1470
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:27,120
red blood cells get caught inside the capillaries and the oxygen doesn't get into the tissue inside

1471
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:34,320
the tumor. But if the oxygen is in the plasma, it can get past and all into the nooks and crannies

1472
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:40,480
of the tumor and then reverse tumor hypoxia, which is tumor hypoxia is driving HIF1 alpha

1473
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,560
and VEGF and causing oncogenic activation.

1474
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,000
Oh, that's so interesting.

1475
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,200
So ironically, you're taking something that is initially a deficit of cancer, which is

1476
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:54,400
its hypoxia, but then it utilizes it as it's an advantage by saying, Hey, I'm going to work

1477
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:58,400
around this. It's going to make me more resilient. It's going to allow me to increase my vasculature.

1478
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:02,560
And you're saying, Hey buddy, that little advantage you had that was a disadvantage,

1479
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:06,240
we're going to reverse it. We're going to hyper oxygenate you now. We're going to take away your

1480
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,360
hypoxia. And you also increase free radicals.

1481
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:15,280
Yes. So you have a dual effect, right? So you are silencing the oncogenes, you're turning off

1482
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:24,800
some of the oncogenes and also by hyper oxygenating a tumor, which its baseline is to be in a,

1483
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:31,040
in a state of hypoxia by super saturating the tumor with oxygen. And that tumor tissue has

1484
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:36,320
damaged mitochondria because hypoxia damages the mitochondria. So basically you're hyper oxygenating

1485
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:40,880
a whole bunch of damaged mitochondria. And essentially what that does is skyrockets

1486
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:47,520
superoxide anion, which then through Fenton chemistry. So when you have a lot of free iron

1487
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:51,200
and all that, you got a whole bunch of heme and stuff that's being broken down the tumor.

1488
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:56,080
So you have a lot of free iron driving the Fenton reaction and which is producing hydroxyl

1489
02:14:56,080 --> 02:15:03,360
radicals. And that causes a massive oxidative stress specifically to the tumor. And you're

1490
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:11,120
delivering a massive oxidative stress to the tumor while it's relatively non-toxic to healthy

1491
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:16,720
cells that have normal metabolism, right? Because the tumor is thriving in a low oxygen environment

1492
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:21,760
and you're reversing tumor hypoxia and hyper oxygenating it. And you have this environment,

1493
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:28,160
which is just fueling redox stress, you can then trigger apoptosis and necrosis really driving

1494
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:35,200
necrosis in these tumor cells. So hyperbaric oxygen delivered at the maximum tolerable dose

1495
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:42,000
three times per week. And you could further enhance the oxidative stress of the tumor

1496
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,800
by something that's a lot of people haven't heard of this, but IV vitamin C. So vitamin C,

1497
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:52,640
if given intravenously at about... You could give up to about a hundred grams at that.

1498
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:59,040
You could, yeah, 25 to a hundred grams is kind of pushing it, but vitamin C ascorbic acid also

1499
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:04,160
functions as a glucose antagonist. So you got to make sure you have dextrose on hand if patients.

1500
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:08,640
Yeah, but not if you're in a state of ketosis, right? So if you're in a state of ketosis,

1501
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:14,080
so I did a pretty high dose vitamin C, but being in a state of ketosis, you can tolerate

1502
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:19,920
higher amounts, right? Do you know what your glucose dropped to? So when you measure your glucose,

1503
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,760
when you're getting vitamin C, you get a false positive on the meter.

1504
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:25,520
Falsely high?

1505
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:28,480
You get falsely high. Well, at least the Abbott precision extra.

1506
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:37,360
When you measure that meter, that assay on the meter is also sensitive to the pH of your blood,

1507
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:42,880
too, and there's a redox shift. And acorbic acid is a powerful reducing agent, and that might be

1508
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:47,760
altering the assay. So it's not able to get my glucose like skyrocket. I know I went into it

1509
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:54,240
hypoglycemic, but my ketones were elevated, and I took a pretty big hit of vitamin C.

1510
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:57,440
And I was just doing it just for the self experimentation.

1511
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:00,800
Right. So but what's the thought here? So lots of people have talked about-

1512
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:06,880
Oxidative stress. So vitamin C driving the Fenton reaction to produce more oxidative stress. So

1513
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:12,960
vitamin C is a pro-oxidant. When you get blood levels of vitamin C in the millimolar concentration,

1514
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:18,720
then it becomes a pro-oxidant. It's not an antioxidant. So we're not using antioxidants,

1515
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:21,680
or definitely you don't want to use antioxidants. Yeah, I was going to come back to that. But the

1516
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:25,040
next thing is, I'm sure somebody listening to this is going to say, well, I don't have access to

1517
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,600
IV vitamin C if I wanted to do that. You can't do it orally. You can't do it orally because of what?

1518
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,120
It's not orally good. You can't get it out of the gut enough. Yeah, you can't. You can only get

1519
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:38,800
like a very small amounts, and then, you know, your gut auto regulates it, too. So you just let's

1520
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:43,120
get to the next thing you said, which is, again, highly counterintuitive to most people. We're

1521
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:48,480
hardwired to think that there's nothing better for you than antioxidants. But paradoxically,

1522
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:54,000
once you have cancer, that might not be the case. Yeah, so I think antioxidants may be blocking

1523
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:59,680
some of the efficacy of some of the some of the therapies, too, right? Because many chemotherapeutic

1524
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:04,960
drugs, their function works through enhancing oxidative stress, radiation sure does.

1525
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:12,560
So radiation, maybe 20% of the cancer killing effects of radiation are due to damaging the DNA

1526
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:19,200
with double, you know, double strand nicks. But 80% of the tumor killing effect of radiation is by

1527
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:23,280
the generation of reactive oxygen species. Now, does that mean you can't have blueberries and

1528
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:29,440
things that have low levels of antioxidants? I would say no, but you don't want to kind of

1529
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:36,640
saturate your body with a cocktail of antioxidants. Like you don't want to do a glutathione push,

1530
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:42,160
right after you do same with any C, so you wouldn't have any C, I personally would not I don't I don't

1531
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:48,640
think that none of the cancer studies and animal models or humans are supportive of the use of

1532
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:55,040
antioxidants. And that was a big focus of me. I mean, when during my PhD, I want to do a postdoc

1533
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,120
research in antioxidant cocktails that we're going to save the world. And

1534
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:04,800
none of the research on antioxidants really panned out in my mind. There's a couple things,

1535
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:10,480
you know, maybe for mitochondrial antioxidants for like Friedrich's ataxia, and maybe ALS and

1536
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:15,840
some research there, but it's pretty subtle benefits. But in the context of cancer, no,

1537
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:20,000
I don't I don't think antioxidants should be avoided. Anything else in your pulse protocol?

1538
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you could add. So with the press protocol,

1539
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:30,560
I think a low dose of metformin could be helpful too. So that will activate amp kinase, maybe

1540
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:37,200
decrease insulin a little bit, maybe increase ketones a little bit too. And it's just a readily

1541
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:45,760
available cheap drug that has a very good safety profile 500 milligrams to 2000 milligrams a day

1542
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:50,720
are usually well tolerated, probably starting with 500 milligrams and working up. But when it comes

1543
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:56,880
to the pulse protocol, hyperbaric oxygen, IV vitamin C, and there are a number of drugs that

1544
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:03,920
we're working with now, one would be 2d oxyglucose, which in and of itself from a seizure world, and

1545
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:10,240
I've, I've been a reviewer in for the government for different grants and stuff. And this is in

1546
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:17,520
the context of epilepsy, 2dG is sort of like the ketogenic diet in a drug. So by inhibiting

1547
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:22,560
glycolysis, it has this gets back to the question, right? You have no ketones, but you inhibit

1548
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:29,120
glycolytic pathways, perhaps even like reduce sort of mTOR signaling or some glycolytic

1549
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:35,440
signal, and that may have anti seizure effects. So 2dG is something that we're working with now,

1550
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:40,800
I think it was 2dG originally developed for pharmacologically. It's been around for a long

1551
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:46,240
time for a long time. I think maybe it was just in the realm of experimental compound. But I know

1552
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:55,680
there's phase two trials in cancer. The problem is it becomes cardiotoxic above say 50 milligrams

1553
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:01,440
per kilogram. I know can be, I know there's some evidence that cardiotoxicity, but at 25 milligrams

1554
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:06,640
per kilogram, at least on some of the grants that I reviewed, that was had a pretty good safety

1555
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:12,880
profile for epilepsy. So, you know, not making any recommendations out there, but I think 25

1556
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:19,040
milligrams per kilogram seems to be within the realm of therapeutic efficacy and safety.

1557
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:23,600
And this is being studied in humans and you're, they're out of phase one. So this, you have phase

1558
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:24,800
one data to support that.

1559
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:29,520
Epilepsy world. Yeah. And I think there's some cancer trials going on too. And I do think that

1560
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:36,080
synergizes really well. Once you create the environment where you put the press protocol

1561
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:42,720
into action, then the cancer cells become even very selectively vulnerable to other things like

1562
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:49,680
2DG will inhibit a glycolytic pathway that drives the pentophosphate pathway. And that

1563
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:56,960
pentophosphate pathway is responsible for enhancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity of cells.

1564
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:03,600
So it makes the cancer cells even more vulnerable to oxidative stress. The more you can inhibit the

1565
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:10,960
glycolytic pathways. So 2DG, 2-dichloroacetate is something that we've worked with. 2-inhibits

1566
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:13,200
PDH complex. And that can also...

1567
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,080
Is DCA a drug that's been on the market for a long time?

1568
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:19,520
It's a small molecule. Yeah. It's been on the market for a very long time.

1569
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,040
And what's its normal use?

1570
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:29,040
Its normal use is lactic acidosis, actually. So one of the side effects of metformin, right,

1571
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:36,320
is once you start increasing the dose of metformin and escalating the dose, the problem that you run

1572
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:42,640
into, it's still... It's a very powerful activator of amkinase. Its effects are primarily through

1573
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:49,280
the liver, inhibiting gluconeogenesis, and it's a mitochondrial toxin. We published a paper that

1574
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:54,960
it increases Ross production from the complex one of the mitochondria.

1575
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,800
So it's inhibiting complex one, correct?

1576
02:22:56,800 --> 02:23:02,320
It's inhibiting. Yeah, mildly inhibiting complex one. And it's triggering what the cell

1577
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:08,240
experiences as an energetic crisis, and that it has an activation of amkinase too.

1578
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:13,920
So you are creating a scenario where that's putting a lot of persistent metabolic stress

1579
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:20,320
on the tumor cells. And then you come in here with different modalities that have overlapping,

1580
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:26,000
but independent mechanisms at producing oxidative stress. So hyperbaric oxygen, IV vitamin C,

1581
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:34,720
and then cancer-specific glycolytic inhibitors, 2D oxyglucose, 3-bromopyrurvate, and loninamine.

1582
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:39,520
Loninamine is also a hexokinase 2 inhibitor. And those three drugs that I mentioned right there,

1583
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:46,400
they are very powerful, and they need to probably be used in two weeks on, two weeks off.

1584
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,560
If somebody's listening to this and they're thinking, well, how the heck could I ever do this?

1585
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:59,920
Are there physicians out there who are obviously doing this under the full and legal umbrella of

1586
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:03,920
ethical medical practice? Is everything you're talking about purely theoretical, or are there

1587
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:09,520
ways to actually have these things implemented? I think there are some physicians out there that

1588
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:16,960
are probably not making it public, but I think they are getting success with doing 25% of what

1589
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:23,280
I just talked about. They're not doing all these things, but everything that I just mentioned is

1590
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:31,040
readily available. Most of the compounds in IV vitamin C, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, can be

1591
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:36,480
costly if you don't have a hardshell chamber. But I like that with radiation, if you're giving

1592
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:41,760
radiation to your body, it's like going in there with a flame thrower, and you have a lot of

1593
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:49,040
collateral damage. Whereas hyperbaric oxygen naturally elevates the precursor for oxygen-free

1594
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:55,760
radicals, and the cancer cells selectively produce more oxygen-free radicals. It's a very gentle

1595
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:02,560
approach. Instead of thinking that we should just go in there and eradicate the tumor, I think it's

1596
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:09,600
more appropriate to give a gentle stress to the tumor. The therapy that I'm describing, if the

1597
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:14,160
patient goes into it, they're going to come out of it stronger than they were going into it.

1598
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:19,760
When you fat-adapt and keto-adapt your body, so many metabolic biomarkers start to go in the right

1599
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:26,240
direction. When you go in for chemotherapy and radiation, and you measure things after, your

1600
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:32,640
body's a big inflammatory mess. I mean, you're metabolically deranged, you're insulin resistant,

1601
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:37,680
you are pushing things, and you have chemo-brain on top of that that may not be reversible.

1602
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:42,240
The suppression of your immune system with chemo is setting you up for more cancers,

1603
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:49,040
potentially other cancers. The scenario that we envision is a comprehensive metabolic-based

1604
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:54,800
therapy where you go into it, and it's a more gradual approach, and you start adding these

1605
02:25:54,800 --> 02:26:01,280
modalities as you go. Get the patient acclimated with that glucose-ketone index of one to two,

1606
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,560
and then start utilizing some of these other therapies. You could potentially put someone

1607
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:16,720
on an IV and pulse a low dose of insulin to make them hypoglycemic, even one or two millimolar,

1608
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:22,720
and then deliver some of these agents where you've really restricted the fermentable fuels.

1609
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:30,080
I'm a reviewer on different manuscripts that are coming in, and some of these academic

1610
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:36,320
and clinical oncologists are actually suggesting this in medical hypothesis papers now.

1611
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:40,560
That's counterintuitive because you'd think, well, the last thing you want to do for a tumor is give

1612
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:47,040
it insulin because this is pulsatile. It's acute, and the amount of insulin, it's not like 20 I use,

1613
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:52,640
it's something like one or two I use. The patient comes in fasted, and you give them just a little

1614
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:59,680
bit, and that's mostly facilitating glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle, so making it less available

1615
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:08,000
for the tumor. That creates a scenario where you produce severe, what would typically be fatal,

1616
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:14,880
hypoglycemia, and you could deliver ketones as an insurance, and also deliver some of these agents

1617
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:21,200
that would... You'd probably dramatically sensitize that tumor tissue to the other modalities.

1618
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:29,600
What I didn't talk about when I did this seven-day fast years ago, I brought my glucose level

1619
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:35,280
down really low, and I got to a glucose-ketone index of one, or maybe even a little bit lower

1620
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:39,520
than one. You were about, what, three to four on each of them? Yeah, well, my ketones were about

1621
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:46,720
four or five, and my glucose got down to three, so that was the lowest I ever captured. That was

1622
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:54,320
just a seven-day fast? Yeah, after a brisk walk at the end. I never got ketones seven or eight,

1623
02:27:54,320 --> 02:28:02,000
I got it four after a long fast. But then I did, inspired by the Cahill study, I used various

1624
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:09,120
strategies to bring my glucose level down, pharmacological strategies, and I did it slowly.

1625
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:17,120
Just do me a favor, Dom. I really would be pissed off if you offed yourself doing dumb shit, because

1626
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:23,520
I think the world needs you to stick around. See if you can just maybe get an IRB to do this in the

1627
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:28,160
mice or something. Nothing that would break my heart more than getting a call from your wife

1628
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:35,440
saying, yeah, Dom died of some freak hypoglycemic crazy accident. What's the longest fast you've

1629
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:40,960
ever done? Well, that was it, actually. Seven days? Yeah, and I was pretty adapted, and the point I

1630
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:45,680
was kind of getting to that, I brought my glucose down to where it was not even measurable, but with

1631
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:53,120
exogenous ketones, the meter didn't even read it. So that, to me, and I did that years ago,

1632
02:28:53,680 --> 02:29:01,200
that motivated me more to basically focus on this area of research as sort of like my life

1633
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:06,080
research, because it validated to me that this should not be happening, and ketones are an

1634
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:12,320
alternative energy source that can be utilized in these metabolic-based therapies that can be

1635
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:17,520
game changers for better. And we also studied glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome,

1636
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:24,000
which is the inability, and people who have glut-1D don't get cancer, to my knowledge. I've talked to

1637
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,520
the doctors, and they've never came across anyone with glucose transporter. So that's kind of

1638
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:36,720
motivating too, that you can create a therapy for that that could sort of be a magic bullet.

1639
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:40,800
Well, what's interesting is this is sort of, in many ways, old-school science,

1640
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:44,720
where scientists would begin by sort of experimenting on themselves,

1641
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:50,800
identifying unnatural or extreme physiologic conditions that are not predicted by the current

1642
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:56,480
understanding. And then that sort of provokes further investigation. Remind me again, at the

1643
02:29:56,480 --> 02:30:03,200
end of that seven-day fast, how much did you deadlift? Yeah, I did 500 pounds for 10, and then I did

1644
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:12,160
sort of a one-repper at the end was six plates or 585, but that's below my normal. But it was amazing

1645
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:17,760
to me that I didn't want to push my body too hard, but it was amazing that that amount of fasting

1646
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:22,320
does not really impact your strength. How much of a verdict? So what was your max at that time?

1647
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:26,880
At that time, well, I was tinkering around with like, you know, ketogenic diet and fasting a lot,

1648
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:33,840
but within a year of that time, I forget if it was before or after, I did 675 for 5, and maybe 5,

1649
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:43,440
I did 555 for an eight to 10. So I did, you know, an extra plate for eight to 10. But I went into this,

1650
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:48,480
basically, I felt like I did more, I could have done more, but I just wanted to stop. I didn't

1651
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:53,840
want to hurt myself because I knew I was pushing the limits at that point. And I didn't get sore

1652
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:59,440
at all. So I did that. And it wasn't like my body was broken down and sort of in a depleted state

1653
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:03,520
where I was wasted the next day. I felt I didn't even have to recover from that. Like I had no lower

1654
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:08,080
back soreness the next day after that. So I probably was like, I probably could have went heavier.

1655
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:15,680
But it was just validation to me that if you're in a keto adapted state, your body is very resilient.

1656
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,800
And from a military standpoint, too, which we work pretty closely with the military,

1657
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:28,400
I'm trying to sort of get them to understand this idea that if you are fat and keto adapted,

1658
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:34,000
and you're faced in austere conditions with limited food availability, you could maintain

1659
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,800
your physical and cognitive resilience in those conditions, which is pretty clear to me. I was

1660
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:44,320
pretty much obsessed with eating like six meals a day for many years. And it was very liberating

1661
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:49,520
not to have to do that now. And I'm amazed at how little I can eat once you're keto adapted and

1662
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:54,880
maintain, you know, your size and your strength. I'm not trying to be big anymore or anything,

1663
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:59,760
or try to do any records in the gym. But it's amazing how easy it is to maintain

1664
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,760
once your body is adapted. You've been so generous with your time. I want to sort of

1665
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:07,120
let you get on your way. I know you've got a long drive potentially tonight. But

1666
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:12,800
I want to ask you a question or the couple maybe what do you believe today to be true

1667
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:17,200
that five years ago, you did not believe to be true? Let's keep it within the purview of your

1668
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:23,520
ketogenic life. What today do you think things that really I would say when I got into this

1669
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:31,520
field, I was really fascinated and immersed in this idea as ketones as an alternative energy

1670
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:38,240
source. So is even like space food, you know, and we're still working on that front. But then over

1671
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:46,080
the last five years, the observation that beta hydroxybutyrate is a powerful endogenous

1672
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:52,640
metabolite that's also a signaling molecule through its HDAC activity, histone deacetylase activity,

1673
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:58,560
more recently, we've been working with an organization that the name of the organization

1674
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:04,400
is called all things Kabuki. So there's a there's a rare genetic disease called Kabuki syndrome,

1675
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:13,600
which is a gene defect in the KMT2D, which is essentially an acetylase enzyme and a defect in

1676
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:19,440
that gene or that protein creates an imbalance between gene expression and gene repression.

1677
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:27,120
Right. And in the mouse model of Kabuki syndrome, two things have worked in this mouse model. One

1678
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:35,360
is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor called AR42, which restores neurons in the dentate

1679
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:41,200
gyrus and kind of silences the pathological features in this mouse model. And another thing

1680
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:46,880
is nutritional ketosis. So nutritional ketosis functioning as a histone deacetylase inhibitor

1681
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:56,960
basically salvages or rescues the phenotype of this and circumvents this gene mutation, the KMT2D

1682
02:33:56,960 --> 02:34:04,560
mutation. The animals have a normal neuronal density in the dentate gyrus, and even from a

1683
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:12,400
behavioral characteristic, it enhances sort of learning and memory. So this idea that an endogenous

1684
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:21,120
metabolite can epigenetically sort of control gene transcription. So I believe it's probably not

1685
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:27,680
unique to beta hydroxybutyrate. I think metabolites, we know that's true for acetyl-CoA and other things,

1686
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:33,760
are epigenetic drivers. And I think they are really, they call the shots. So you can even

1687
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:38,800
take a step back and say the mitochondria kind of call the shots too, right? Because I think

1688
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:44,640
mitochondrial health and mitochondrial vitality would be the ultimate tumor suppressor. So if the

1689
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:52,320
bioenergetic capacity of a cell in tissues are maintained to a high degree, that bioenergetic

1690
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:58,240
efficiency is going to preserve genome stability and be far less likely to trigger oncogenes at

1691
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:05,840
the level of the DNA. So when it comes to something like Kabuki syndrome, you have a persistent

1692
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:13,120
molecular genetic pathology that's silenced by the elevation of beta hydroxybutyrate functioning

1693
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:20,560
in an inpendant way. Yeah, it's H-stac activity. So that to me is like mind-blowing. And I think

1694
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:26,000
that's the direction kind of our lab is going into now. I'm always fascinated with developing

1695
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:31,440
alternative energy substrates and alternative fuels as a form of nutrition for tactical

1696
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:38,400
applications, space applications maybe. But this idea that you could develop and even engineer

1697
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:45,920
nutrition to have powerful effects on gene transcription and epigenetic regulation

1698
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:52,080
is something I would have never predicted. That's an amazing answer actually, because,

1699
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:56,080
and I know that was probably a little hard for some people to follow. So what you're basically

1700
02:35:56,080 --> 02:36:01,280
saying is, look, five years ago, you were completely intrigued and blown away by the

1701
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:07,440
metabolic properties of these ketones, primarily as an alternative energy source. And with that

1702
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:12,480
comes a lot of interesting stuff we've talked about. But at this H-dac pathway, this inhibition

1703
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:17,680
of something that can result in epigenetic change or activation of in this case, you can basically

1704
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:26,960
take a germline acquired mutation and silence it with an epigenetic overlay that seems to be

1705
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:34,160
signaled by something as simple as ketones. And Dr. Verdin at the Buck Institute has spoken quite

1706
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:40,320
a bit about this as well. I mean, this really is one of those moments where you think, holy cow,

1707
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:45,360
we are really at the, just at the cusp of learning about this stuff. And if there's one reason to make

1708
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:49,920
sure we don't off ourselves with self experiments, it's to make sure we can stick around long enough

1709
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:56,400
to do this. Don, where can people follow you socially and then maybe more importantly,

1710
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:02,240
see what you're doing from a research perspective? Sure. So the site I maintain for informational

1711
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:12,800
purposes would be ketonutrition.org. It's a dot org, not.com. And on that website, I have a list of,

1712
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:18,240
podcasts, there's nutrition consultants, resources like the Charlie Foundation,

1713
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:23,520
which is an incredible resource that I've helped them do some educational work. And Jim Abrams of

1714
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:28,640
the Charlie Foundation has really created an amazing resource there. I have a blog and we

1715
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:34,560
test various ketone supplements, ketogenic foods. I'm self experimenting and I've collected a lot

1716
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:39,840
of data and we'll be putting some of that data in the blog. So I think that would be sort of like

1717
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:45,440
the one-stop shop website for anyone interested in hearing more about what I talked about.

1718
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:50,880
I'd also like to mention that our lab in collaboration with Epigenics Foundation

1719
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:58,640
is sponsoring the metabolic health summit that's occurring in January 30th to February 3rd

1720
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:06,640
in Long Beach, California. And it's going to have an amazing array of basic scientists. For example,

1721
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:11,680
like Lou Cantley will be there, be a keynote speaker, Thomas Safrid. There's going to be

1722
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:19,200
clinicians there, influencers there, and a lot of entrepreneurial people will be there representing

1723
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:25,200
companies that are really changing the shape of this industry. So I'm very interested in

1724
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:32,000
technologies and foods and supplements that can make nutritional ketosis accessible for people

1725
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,600
that want to use it, not only therapeutically for metabolic management of a disorder,

1726
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:43,440
but maybe also for prevention or longevity or just as a lifestyle. So you're going to find

1727
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:49,600
there's something for everybody at the metabolic health summit from basic science will be sort of

1728
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:56,480
what our lab is focused on, but from clinical application to moving the science into human

1729
02:38:56,480 --> 02:39:00,880
application is really the theme of that. And can people register for that already?

1730
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,960
Yes, I think you can go to the website and register if you want to be a sponsor. I think

1731
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:10,560
you can sort of download the sponsorship package. There's going to be a lot of high profile

1732
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:17,760
representation there that would bring sort of more awareness and more reach to your product if you

1733
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:22,560
have a product there. So we're looking for sponsors. And I think we've nailed down most of our speakers,

1734
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:26,480
but if you're interested in speaking to it might be good to contact us through the website.

1735
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:29,920
Got it. And on Twitter, you're pretty active. What's your handle?

1736
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:35,600
Yeah, before I realize how important it is to have a handle you can remember, it's Dominic

1737
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:39,120
Dagosti 2. We'll link to it.

1738
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:43,840
Yeah, we'll link to it. It's not the easiest to remember. And also Facebook, I'm fairly active.

1739
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:50,720
Dominic Dagostino 1, I think that's my handle on Facebook too. So I kind of cross post on each and

1740
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:55,440
try to use Instagram a little bit more because they tell me I got to use it more, but not too

1741
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:59,120
active on that. But all right. Well, we'll make sure we link to all of those things. I want to

1742
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:02,800
thank you again. I owe a lot of what I know in this space to you.

1743
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,880
I can say the same thank you. Yeah, incredible blogs. It's been a great resource for many.

1744
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:12,640
You were arguably one of the most generous people I've ever met when it comes to his insights.

1745
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:17,200
Dom, I don't know that you get enough credit for not only the work you've done, but for how much

1746
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:21,920
work you do behind the scenes as far as sharing your knowledge with people. I'll just share one

1747
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:26,240
very quick anecdote. Personally, one of my best friends from medical school, his wife has breast

1748
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:32,400
cancer and without any hesitation, you were more than happy to speak with them about some of these

1749
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:38,080
things that they could do above and beyond what she was already doing, which was participating in

1750
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:44,800
a clinical trial where, by the way, she is the only woman to still be alive in this clinical trial.

1751
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:50,480
So the trial has closed. That agent will likely not be approved though. She will have a compassionate

1752
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:55,360
exemption, but she is someone who has been on a ketogenic diet now for six years and has

1753
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:02,160
and remains incredibly indebted to the work that you've done. And her oncologist in Boston are

1754
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:08,720
sort of amazed that she's alive. Interestingly, next year, Lou Cantley will be explaining a very

1755
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:13,280
plausible mechanism for why she is still alive. It's a paper that I'm sure you're aware of that

1756
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:19,200
was just approved and will be out in nature very soon. So anyway, I could sit here and spend another

1757
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:22,960
hour thanking you for everything, but I know nobody really wants to hear that. So I'll be

1758
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:28,160
quick about it and just tell you again that, Dom, you're an amazing guy. You really are one of those

1759
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:32,640
people that I think fits in the category of just being kind of a treasure. And so on behalf of many

1760
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:36,880
people, I want to thank you. And thank you. Thank you for giving me this platform. I know your

1761
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:40,960
podcast will be an amazing resource for so many people. Always great to catch up with you.

1762
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:46,000
Always very stimulating in so many ways. So thank you, Peter, for having me. Appreciate it.
