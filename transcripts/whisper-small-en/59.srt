00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia. The drive

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,000
is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,360
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,560
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,720
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
with this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,680
is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,560
lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,100
podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,240
is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,960
this information with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,600
In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,560
feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know, the tried and true way

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
to do this is to sell ads, but after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,800
feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,980
ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,720
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,300
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,580
ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,660
that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship

30
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,760
with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,880
support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,840
and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,380
matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more than you give.

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,940
So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including

35
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,260
other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode.

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,260
These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,980
of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

38
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,280
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,620
that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,640
like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,180
already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast

44
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,780
will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one,

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,820
the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members to support us

46
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,480
at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,540
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,800
I guess this week is Dr. Jason Fung. Jason is a nephrologist in Toronto, Canada. Many

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,000
of you listening to this podcast probably already are at least familiar with him just

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,520
if for another reason through social media or other channels. He's quite a vocal critic

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,600
of the conventional approach to treating type two diabetes. And he also has, in my experience,

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,100
at least one of the most significant clinical practices that utilizes fasting as a treatment

54
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,300
for metabolic disease. Known Jason relatively informally for quite a while, but I've gotten

55
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,940
to know him better in the past year and was really looking forward to doing this interview

56
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,540
because I certainly get asked a lot of questions that I think Jason would have great insight

57
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,200
into. He's the author of several books, including The Obesity Code, The Diabetes Code, The Complete

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,360
Guide to Fasting, and The Longevity Solution. He's the co-founder of the Intensive Dietary

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,740
Management Program. Jason graduated from the University of Toronto and completed his residency

60
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,700
at UCLA. In this episode, we talk about a lot. We actually kick it off with a discussion

61
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
I didn't plan to get into, but I thought it was really interesting and I hope you do as

62
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,480
well about evidence-based medicine and the difference between taking two scientific disciplines,

63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,620
one of medicine biology, the other of physics and comparing and contrasting some of the differences.

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,380
I sort of make an argument around theoretical versus experimentalist and things like that.

65
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm going to talk a little bit about nephrology. What took Jason into that field and why is

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,560
being a nephrologist, a doctor who specializes in kidney disease, why does that give him

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,520
a quite unique insight into kind of the early indications of metabolic disease? Then we

68
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,920
get into the meat of this thing, which honestly, I think this is one of the most interesting

69
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,280
discussions I've ever had on insulin resistance. You'll listen to this podcast. You've heard

70
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,020
me talk about that a lot. I think Jason's take on this quite frankly is probably the

71
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,420
smartest thing I've heard. Now, that doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with everything

72
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,020
and that doesn't mean that there aren't holes in these arguments, but his explanation for

73
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,140
why a concept of insulin resistance, which is very difficult to explain when you try

74
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,280
to parse it out into tissue specific effects of insulin, he has a much better explanation

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,180
for this that clinically makes more sense and ultimately results in a much more logical

76
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,900
treatment plan.

77
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,580
Once we go through this discussion of what people call insulin resistance and come away

78
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,140
with this idea of hyperinsulinemia, for which by the way, he has a great example using a

79
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,580
suitcase that I'd never heard before, but I took the liberty of bolting onto it as much

80
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,140
as possible. By the end of this, you might be sick of hearing about suitcases. We talk

81
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,060
a little bit about NAFLD and then we close the discussion. If there's sort of a final

82
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,420
part of this, it's getting into the clinical stuff, the use of dietary restriction, including

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,520
ketogenic diets, carbohydrate restriction, but most of what we talk about pertains to

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,560
fasting. I think that that's where a lot of people are going to be kind of interested.

85
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Jason has a very different approach to fasting than I do in my practice. I think that probably

86
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,320
stems from the fact that I'm not treating patients who are nearly as sick as Jason.

87
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,880
In that sense, he has to be a little bit more extreme out of the gate and to listen to some

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,260
of the clinical wisdom that he brings to this is even for me quite informative. I hope

89
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,100
you enjoy this discussion with Jason half as much as I did.

90
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,000
There are so many things I want to talk about with you. I would say that you are among the

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,840
three people, top three certainly, that on social people are always saying, when are

92
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
you going to interview Jason? When are you going to interview Jason? Of course, we had

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,140
planned to do this in December in person. That's when I had my whole dental calamity

94
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,620
that required tooth extraction after secondary tooth extraction. I never made it up. Anyway,

95
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,640
I'm glad we could do this and I appreciate everyone's patience with this. I guess the

96
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,540
broader point is I think people are so interested in speaking because of all the work you've

97
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,900
done around fasting, insulin resistance, and just overall, you're a clinician on the front

98
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,140
lines. It's one thing to pontificate on Twitter. It's quite another thing when you actually

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,460
have to show up in clinic and see hundreds of patients as you do.

100
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,140
Thanks. I think that's one of the things that I think distinguishes me from some of

101
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,540
the other people that are out there is that the stuff's got to work. Otherwise, it just

102
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,860
ain't worth it. You can talk all you want about this and that, but if it doesn't change

103
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,500
management, then it doesn't interest me particularly because that's where I come from. I think

104
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,020
this is where a lot of people get sort of, they see these academics and they say, okay,

105
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,980
well, they know everything about this. It's like, well, they might know everything, but

106
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,020
if it doesn't work on the front lines, it's not worth anything. I think this is an attitude

107
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,980
I see in physics, which is, I know you really look up to Richard Feynman as do I, but I

108
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,460
actually love the whole story of Einstein and Niels Bohr and all that because physics

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:08,500
to me is sort of like, I love that because the way they do science is so much better

110
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,460
than we do in medicine. That is to say for in this specific instance, for example, if

111
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,980
you have all these theories, they're great, but if they don't agree with experimental

112
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,420
evidence, it ain't worth anything. They say this in physics, but they don't say this in

113
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:32,060
medicine where it's like, okay, you think that eating lots of carbs is really good for

114
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,820
you. You have this hypothesis that eating less fat and tons and tons of refined carbs

115
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,300
is good for you. That's a great theory. It all makes sense. The same thing with calories.

116
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,580
It sounds like if you just cut calories, it makes sense, but if your theory doesn't work,

117
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,180
then it's not a good theory. This is what they say in physics, which they don't say

118
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,980
in medicine. In medicine, it always boggles my mind how these bad theories go round and

119
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,340
round and round because they make sense, but nobody's actually put them to the test or

120
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,540
nobody's pointing out these things. It's the same with insulin resistance. I think actually,

121
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,220
to me, the most important topic is insulin resistance because, again, that's what I deal

122
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,460
with as a nephrologist. I see a lot of type 2 diabetes. That, to me, is completely misunderstood,

123
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,580
and the way we think about insulin resistance is totally wrong, and that's why we have the

124
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,740
mess that we have, I think. Well, we're going to get to that for certain.

125
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,340
I'd definitely like to build on what you've said. Yeah, there's a beautiful demonstration

126
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,140
of what you described. It's a video from either Caltech or Cornell, I can't recall.

127
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,380
It was either right before he had left Cornell or after he had arrived at Caltech, where

128
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,940
Feynman is at a blackboard, and he is explaining the scientific method in about as elegant

129
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,540
a way as you can, which is to basically say what you did, which is this is the scientific

130
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,940
method. You make a guess. You design an experiment to test the consequences of that guess. You

131
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,140
do the experiment, and if the output of that experiment aligns with your guess, the hypothesis

132
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,900
turns out to be likely correct or more likely to be correct, and if it doesn't, you go back

133
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,620
to the drawing board. The simplicity with which one of the most brilliant physicists

134
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,380
of the 20th century explains that is not lost on anyone who watches it. I would agree with

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,460
you completely. I've gotten into trouble by saying this before, but I guess on your podcast

136
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,260
you can sort of say what you want. I'm generally suspect of people who have very, very strong

137
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,780
points of view on things in biology or medicine who no longer interact with patients. It doesn't

138
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,940
mean that they're wrong, but I'm generally suspect because of that, because the other

139
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,700
thing is biology is harder than physics. The reality of it is just a lot messier, and sometimes

140
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,820
people ask me, do you think you'll always see patients? The answer is yes, I think so,

141
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,300
and I hope so, because they are kind of a humbling tool. Every time I think I've really

142
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,340
got it figured out, I'll always meet a patient who proves me wrong, and they're obviously

143
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,500
right and I'm wrong.

144
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,660
I think the other part about physics, which I love, is that the way they think about it

145
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,900
is that there's a theory, like Newton has a theory, for example, and it explains a lot.

146
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,140
There's a great theory and everything, but then there's these anomalies, and the anomalies

147
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,380
are what drives science forward because you have to come up with a better theory that

148
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,220
explains the anomalies. If you come up with a better theory, they make these wild predictions,

149
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,100
and if these wild predictions are true, you know this new theory can sort of supplant

150
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,100
it, so the way Niels Bohr and the Qantas supplanted Einstein, even though he was brilliant.

151
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,580
The point is that that doesn't happen in medicine. In medicine, we have this super laborious

152
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,900
process of evidence-based medicine, where instead of saying, hey, here's a theory that

153
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,300
makes more sense because it explains everything, what they do is they say every single point,

154
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,960
they go, where's the evidence? Where's the evidence? Where's the evidence? That's why

155
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,820
nothing ever moves forward. I do the same thing in nephrology that I did 20 years ago

156
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,820
when I was doing my training. It's like, what was the last advance we had? It's like

157
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,580
so from so long a word. Most of the advances in medicine, for example, come from aspirin.

158
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,940
It counts for like 50% of the progress we've made. It's sort of ridiculous, whereas physics

159
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,300
sort of moves at light speed because they don't demand this sort of evidence-based.

160
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,840
I always say that evidence-based medicine is good if you know how to apply it, because

161
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,720
the whole point of evidence-based medicine is that it's not a search for truth, it's

162
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,520
a search for consensus. It may or may not be true, but if you have a crazy theory and

163
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,680
then you send it out to five people and they say, well, it's crazy, it gets killed. If

164
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,720
you have a theory, hey, the Earth goes around the sun, not the sun goes around the Earth.

165
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,040
You send it to a consensus of peers, they say, no, no, no, no. Clearly the sun revolves

166
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,060
around the Earth, that would never have made it through. The evidence-based medicine is

167
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,740
not everything. You have to understand where to apply it. This is where I think we've gotten

168
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:07,900
into so much trouble is that every sort of advance moves glacially because we sort of

169
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,020
demand that things have to have evidence. Something like fasting, for example, which

170
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,220
I always get into trouble a lot too. I get into tons of trouble for calories, everybody

171
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,660
tax me for all kinds of stuff, but fasting five years ago was the dumbest thing you could

172
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:30,580
do. I'm like, why? It doesn't make any sense that it should be so bad. I thought about

173
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,300
it and I went through it and then I just brought it immediately to patients. Just treated hundreds

174
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,820
and hundreds and hundreds of patients and the results, amazing. Of course, if you don't

175
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,620
eat, you're going to lose weight. If you don't eat, your diabetes is going to get better.

176
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,900
It worked and that was the point. You got to get to that point where it's like, and

177
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,540
then everybody says to me, oh, where's the evidence? I'm like, why do I need evidence?

178
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,580
People are getting better. I'm not a researcher. You can come up with the research, but just

179
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,540
try it on people. Look at it. All these people were saying, oh, there's no evidence. There's

180
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,300
no evidence. Clearly it's bad. That's where everything just sort of bogs down. You get

181
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,540
all these people who sort of demand that every sort of little step has to be based

182
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,860
on consensus. The consensus moves so slowly that you can't move. You can't move like Einstein

183
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,860
moved. You can't make those sort of intuitive leaps forward. That always bothers me a lot.

184
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,820
Well, it's sort of a problem. There is a distinction, right? In physics, I think broadly speaking,

185
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,420
and again, physicists will sort of bristle at the simplicity with which I'm saying this,

186
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,220
but you can generally divide the field into the experimentalists and the theorists. That's

187
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,420
what I think allows the step function changes and understanding. Einstein's advances were

188
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,100
theoretical. The experimental evidence to support these things came after, but yes,

189
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,340
many times the big steps forward come on the basis of theoretical propositions. We don't

190
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,660
really have that in medicine and biology. We don't have experimentalists and theorists.

191
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,460
I've thought a lot about this actually, and I didn't intend to go down that rabbit hole,

192
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,660
but there's a whole separate podcast, by the way, on this topic of how could you change

193
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,780
biological research to take some of the advantages that we see in the physical sciences where you

194
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,380
can create a symbiosis between the theorists and the experimentalists. The last thing I'll say on

195
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,540
this point, by the way, that I agree with you is the real challenge of exclusively relying on

196
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,260
evidence-based medicine is that framework is very good for certain problems. It's actually quite

197
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:42,020
good for problems that are rather acute, for which the interventions to address them are rather simple,

198
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:48,700
and for which you will get an answer quickly. So in many ways, the pillar of evidence-based

199
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,620
medicine is infectious disease. If you think about how much we have learned through evidence-based

200
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,580
medicine with respect to the treatment of HIV and frankly, most infections, it's remarkable. I mean,

201
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,860
we've really got that dialed in. But again, if you take a step back and look at those criteria,

202
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,820
well, infections are quite acute typically, very easy and binary to measure progression. The

203
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,220
interventions are simple. Take this medication, don't take this medication. That's much more

204
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,900
complicated than, well, I want you to exercise a certain way for this period of time or I want

205
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,100
you to eat a certain diet for a certain period of time. And then the resolution can be to whatever

206
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,300
metric it is, whether it be T cell count or amelioration of the clinical infection. That

207
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,820
occurs really quickly. So you're right. I mean, I think evidence-informed medicine is probably a

208
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,420
better way to think about it. But yeah, someone like you is, you know, you're really on the forefront

209
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:47,180
of using your best ethical judgment to say, look, I'm going to bring something to a patient population.

210
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,860
The other thing I want to add, by the way, while I'm on my soapbox that you helped me stand up on

211
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:58,020
to is people are very quick to say, well, you don't have the evidence to support fasting for a patient

212
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,580
with type 2 diabetes. And you can say, okay, that's true. So there is a risk that if this patient with

213
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,460
type 2 diabetes goes on a fasting protocol, something bad could happen. But what people in

214
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,340
medicine I find are very, I wouldn't even say quick to forget, I don't even think it registers,

215
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,060
is what's the risk of not doing something? The risk of doing something is usually more in our

216
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,900
forefront. It's that risk of not doing something that people often forget. And if the risk of not

217
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,940
doing something is stay the course, slowly, slowly increase the amount of insulin this patient

218
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,100
requires, slowly, slowly watch the micro and macroscopic vascular disease progress. Well,

219
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,580
that risk's actually, that's a pretty bad risk. Well, that's absolutely true. And it's like,

220
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,500
this is the point that I always made to patients is like, if you keep on doing what it is that most

221
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,380
doctors do, including myself, right? I used to just give people tons and tons of insulin. I know

222
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,060
what is going to happen. And everybody acknowledges that you'll just get worse over time. And it was

223
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,020
just sort of accepted as like, there's the risk of not doing anything, right? But if you suddenly

224
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,980
change, you know, bring an intervention like fasting or low carbohydrate diets, ketogenic diets,

225
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,620
or whatever, there's a risk of doing it. Sure, we don't know what the risks are. But you know,

226
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,220
the risk of not doing something, and that's the virtual certainty that you're going to in 10 years,

227
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,100
go on dialysis or something like that, right? And that's not an insignificant risk. It's actually

228
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,820
a huge risk compared to doing fasting, which has been done for thousands of years. And I always say

229
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,540
like, look, like the problem with evidence based medicine and consensus and stuff, look at look at

230
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,380
what happened with the low carb guidelines. So as you know, a couple days ago, the American Diabetes

231
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,580
Association came out with sort of new guidelines, and they said, Hey, low carbohydrates pretty

232
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,460
reasonable. It has the most evidence behind it. It's like five years ago, they're persecuting

233
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,140
dieticians for giving low carb advice, right? It's like, you know, our human body hasn't changed in

234
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,260
the five years that it took for you to realize that, right? And that's where you're doing patients

235
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:06,660
a real disservice by having these sort of expert opinions, guidelines, right, where people can't

236
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,780
decide for themselves. Like as a dietician, you can't decide for yourself that you want to be low

237
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,580
carb because five years ago, they would have run you out and persecuted you, right? Taking away

238
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:23,460
your license. And today, like as of sort of two days ago, you're actually falling completely within

239
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,500
American Diabetes Association guidelines, right? So it's like, this is a big problem.

240
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,020
The flip side, I guess that's progress. And we'll take it right. You know, I've said this before.

241
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,860
It's sort of one of my little tongue in cheek comments. But you know, all facts have a half

242
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,260
life and some of those half lives can be quite short. But it is interesting to see this because

243
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,100
it's been about 10 years that I've been paying attention to this. And these things typically do

244
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,820
occur on five year cycles, both through the ADA, the AHA, and then in the United States, obviously,

245
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,020
the USDA also, I guess, in fact, gosh, it's hard to believe we're coming up to 2020. This time next

246
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,700
year, we'll be dealing with a new set of dietary guidelines, which I don't want to think about.

247
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,060
So let's change gears for a moment. You're a nephrologist. So for people listening,

248
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,860
that means you specialized after doing your training in internal medicine, you then

249
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,380
subspecialized to double down on one particular organ, a beautiful organ called the kidney,

250
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,700
which give us a little bit of a sense of like, what is it about the kidney that is

251
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,180
so special because it is a pretty special organ.

252
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:27,300
You know, in internal medicine, everybody sort of divides themselves into types, right? So in medical

253
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,100
school, it's interesting because you have the jocks who go into orthopedics, right? And then you

254
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,460
have the really sort of touchy feely people and they go into family medicine and pediatrics and

255
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,980
internal medicine generally attracts a lot of people who sort of like to think about things.

256
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,100
And then within internal medicine, you have the sort of subdivision into the different types.

257
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,420
And generally, when at least when where I was going to school at the University of Toronto,

258
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,100
the nephrologists were always the ones who like to think about things because that's all we could do.

259
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,380
We can do it couldn't do a lot about it. Like, you know, you stick people on dialysis and so on,

260
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,980
but they like to think about problems like puzzles, like electrolyte problems and stuff.

261
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,620
So you have this low sodiums and low potassiums and what's happening in the kidneys because the

262
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,060
kidneys do a lot in terms of homeostasis. They keep track of, you know, they keep the sodium in

263
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,820
check and you keep the proper amount of water and salt and potassium and calcium in the body.

264
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,020
So it's fairly complex, but it's a specialty where people like to think as opposed to like GI,

265
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,740
which was towards the sort of action oriented people who like to scope and, you know,

266
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:41,860
snare things out and stuff. So that was really what attracted me to nephrology really was that

267
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,780
that's sort of my personality is I like to think about stuff. I like to work out puzzles. I'm

268
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,540
addicted to Sudoku. It's just something I love to do. And it's just the way I am. So that's sort of

269
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,260
why I chose nephrology and I wound up doing it at UCLA. I do enjoy it. And when I say there's not

270
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,340
a lot we can do, what I mean is that up to a certain point, kidney disease, you can treat them,

271
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,820
but there's really like two treatments, right? There's prednisone and then dialysis. And the

272
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,820
last time we had a drug that actually slowed down progression of kidney disease was like the ACE

273
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,260
inhibitors in the eighties, right? It's been a long time since things changed. And just now we

274
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,620
have the SGLT2 for diabetic kidney disease. Before that, it's like nothing. So there wasn't a lot to

275
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,420
do, but there's a lot to think about. So that's sort of what I liked about it. And the kidney,

276
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,140
I mean, every organ is unique in its own way. But one of the things that I recall being sort of

277
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,420
blown away by in medical school was how smart the kidney was. You don't think of it as a

278
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,660
particularly intelligent organ. You think of it as well as just a filter. But there was a very

279
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:57,140
clever design in evolution, which said rather than the kidney learning what is bad and figuring out

280
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,740
a way to always get rid of things that are bad, it was the opposite. It was learn what is good.

281
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,500
And when you throw everything out during the first pass of filtration, just learn to pull back the

282
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,140
good because the probability that the good things are going to change is low. The probability that

283
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,700
you'll see new bad things is high. And so I remember the nephrologist sort of standing there

284
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,460
saying, look, it would be tempting to think that the kidney would operate like it's going into your

285
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,820
sock drawer to pull out just the right sock, but it doesn't. It pulls out all of the socks and puts

286
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,700
back the right ones. And that always sort of stuck with me. One is a pretty interesting

287
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,500
statement of just how important it is to have that system working. And the second thing is

288
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,820
how small the organ is. And yet what a high fraction of our circulating blood volume passes

289
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,580
through it. And as you build on that, which gets to some of the stuff we're going to talk about today,

290
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:58,100
why the kidney is such an early warning indicator of disease either through high blood pressure or

291
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,620
high glucose. I mean, is it safe to say that some would argue that the eyes are generally the first

292
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,100
place you can see evidence of that disease of either high blood pressure, high glucose, but the

293
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,060
kidneys would probably come in pretty close as well, wouldn't they? Oh, yeah, absolutely. So the thing

294
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,260
about the kidney is that they get like 20 percent of the entire circulation of the body. So it's a

295
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,060
huge amount of blood that goes through. And then the amount that comes out through the glomerulus,

296
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,660
which is the sort of functional unit of the kidney is huge. So basically they take everything out and

297
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,300
then sort of put it back in. So that's why they can fine tune it so well. But there's a huge amount

298
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,060
of fluid that goes through the kidneys sort of all the time, even though a trickle comes out as urine,

299
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,220
like it's filtering like 10 times more than that. So you might have a liter of urine a day,

300
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,260
but you're filtering way more than that every single minute truthfully. So it's an incredible

301
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,420
system. And the reason that the eyes and the kidneys are such early warning indicators is that

302
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,460
the eyes is the best because you can actually directly visualize. It's the only place you can

303
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,260
directly visualize the blood vessel. But the glomerulus, which is, you know, you have about a

304
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:12,900
million of these glomeruli in the body, but they're basically a big bag of blood vessels.

305
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,660
So if you're going to have diseases of the blood vessel, which turns out to be where these metabolic

306
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,860
diseases impact each other. So the heart disease and kidney disease, that comes later on.

307
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,300
But there's so many blood vessels in the kidney that it gives you this sort of early warning.

308
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,020
So the first thing you generally see in terms of diabetes or high blood pressure, you start to see

309
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,900
this protein that appears in the urine. So you can measure it, something called the albumin

310
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,820
to creatinine ratio, and you can actually see it. So when you start to get increased urinary albumin

311
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,780
excretion, what you know is that there is damage to the vascular system, just because the vascular

312
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,900
treat is like so, so big there, and you can directly measure it. So if you were to go to your liver,

313
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,420
for example, there's nothing you can measure, right? So it's got a big vascular, so the lungs

314
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,260
have a big vascular system, but you can't measure anything. Whereas the urine, you can actually

315
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,300
directly measure it, and the eyes, you can directly see it. So that's why they come out so early. So

316
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,740
increased urine albumin excretion, actually a very, very strong correlation to heart disease, not

317
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,860
because having a bit of urine is so bad, but it tells you that there's something bad going on in

318
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,580
the blood vessels of the kidney, which tells you that something bad is going on in the blood vessels

319
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,340
of the body. So that's why looking directly into the eyes is useful and measuring the urine is very

320
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,380
useful. Yeah, and because my skills for looking into patients' eyes are not good enough that I

321
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,140
can reliably do that, I have in the past three years really started to pay much closer attention

322
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,420
to cystatin C creatinine along with microalbumin for exactly this reason, because it sort of

323
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,860
occurred to me in a momentary insight that if my interest is in longevity, which means trying to

324
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:58,180
figure out a way to get people to outlive what their expected time course is, well, one of the

325
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,500
most important organs that gets neglected is the kidney. And if you are in your 40s, but you

326
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,900
already have a glomerular filtration rate at 80% of what would be predicted, you have to fast

327
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,980
forward a little bit and say, well, what's that going to look like when you're 80? The net

328
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,980
implication to me has been a much greater focus on blood pressure, even sort of stage one, so

329
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,580
slightly elevated blood pressure that I think many physicians until recently probably just weren't

330
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,540
thinking of as a significant enough problem. But once you do start looking at that microalbumin

331
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,900
and that cystatin C, as a non-nephrologist, we get a little bit of a window of insight

332
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,260
into your world. And there are a lot of people walking around, I mean, a staggering amount of

333
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,060
people walking around who on the surface, just based on their creatinine, look pretty normal,

334
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,180
but a slightly deeper look says, no, actually, they're not normal, they are compromised. And it

335
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,780
won't be clinically relevant for 30 or 40 years, but that's going to be relevant. The thing is that

336
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:03,700
there are no symptoms. So I see people all the time with diseases like IgA nephritis, which is

337
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:10,020
the most common sort of primary kidney disease in the world. And they will not know it. And they

338
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,540
will have lost sort of like 95% of their kidney function by the time I see them just because they

339
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,580
never knew they had a problem because they never checked it. It's very silent in that way. You

340
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,980
just don't know you have a problem unless you start looking for these things. And that's why

341
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,100
it's important to sort of keep an eye on the urine. And it's so easy too, right? It's non-invasive.

342
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,340
Anybody can do it. Well, let's talk about this thing called insulin resistance because there's

343
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,420
two broad, broad topics I want to explore with you today. And I can see no better way to approach

344
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,820
them than in this order. Let's start with the problem statement, and then let's start to talk

345
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,780
about the treatment. So I will confess at the outset, Jason, that as it's been nine or 10 years

346
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:00,180
that I've thought about this problem, I still have a hard time explaining to somebody, certainly if

347
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:06,820
I only have the duration of an elevator ride, what insulin resistance is, because I get tempted to

348
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,660
get into, well, it means this thing in this type of tissue, but this thing in this type of tissue,

349
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,380
blah, blah, blah. So let's not hold you to the standard if you've only got an elevator ride to

350
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,620
explain it, but how would you explain it both to maybe a layperson, but then even at the level of

351
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,140
nuance that we could sort of have a rigorous discussion about it? This is really what I think

352
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,500
is the sort of most important problem in medicine, which is the metabolic syndrome and insulin

353
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,660
resistance. And the whole way that we sort of think about it, I think is completely wrong.

354
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,500
I'll kind of step back and say, let's start with what we think is insulin resistance and taking

355
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,780
this physics approach, what's wrong with it? What parts of it don't fit the sort of experimental

356
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,900
evidence, if you will. So when we talk about insulin resistance and sort of, I'll just step

357
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,340
back a bit and say, okay, what do we think about insulin resistance the way I was taught about

358
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,420
insulin resistance, which I'll tell you I think is completely wrong. And probably you were taught

359
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,980
the same thing, right? So the way we think about insulin resistance is we think about it only in

360
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:18,100
terms of the glucose, right? So insulin is a hormone. And when insulin goes up, it allows glucose

361
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,220
from the blood to go into the cells. So we know that we know that for receptors go, it goes into

362
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,580
the cell membrane glucose codes in, and now the cell can use it. So the reason we call it insulin

363
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,340
resistance is because we know that there are normal levels of insulin, as opposed to type one,

364
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,100
where there are low levels of it's that there's normal levels of insulin, but the glucose is not

365
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,820
going into the cell for some reason. And when you measure the blood glucose, for example,

366
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,580
it's very high and there's insulin around. So if insulin is around, why can't the glucose

367
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:55,060
go into the cell? And this is why we say, Hey, if there's insulin, then the cell must be resistant

368
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:01,220
to the insulin. This is insulin resistance. This is the sort of lock and key paradigm that we talk

369
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:07,300
about. So insulin is a hormone. It acts on the insulin receptor, which is on the cell surface.

370
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,300
And the insulin receptor is like a gate. So there's a door, there's a lock, insulin is like

371
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,540
the key. So it opens the door and therefore the glucose can go from the blood into the cell. The

372
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:25,620
cell has energy to use. So we can measure insulin. We can also look at insulin receptors. You can

373
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,780
sequence it and you can tell there's actually nothing wrong with them. So insulin receptors

374
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,180
are completely normal. Insulin is completely normal. So what you say is that, well, there must

375
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,700
be something that's gumming up the system. So like a piece of gum that's sort of stuck in that lock,

376
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,820
it's gumming up the things you have a normal key, you have a normal lock, but when you put the key

377
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,860
in the lock, it doesn't really work. And then therefore the glucose can't get into the cell.

378
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:57,220
And the cell is now facing a internal starvation and the internal starvation is why we give insulin

379
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,580
to move the glucose into the cell. And that's our current thinking, or at least what I was taught,

380
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,580
and what most people still think about insulin resistance, but it's almost completely incorrect.

381
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,660
And there's no possible way it can be correct because there's a central paradox of insulin

382
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:23,380
resistance, which is that insulin has actually many, many different functions, only one of which is

383
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:30,180
letting glucose into the cell. So for example, we know in the liver that insulin is responsible for

384
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:38,260
de novo lipogenesis. That is, if you have a lot of carbohydrates, glucose, it will build it into

385
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,820
glycogen and that is working fine. If there's too much glucose after the glycogen is full,

386
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,060
it's going to turn it into triglycerides or fat, and that is working fine. So de novo lipogenesis

387
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,580
is working fine. Let's take a state of type two diabetes, which is we acknowledge is a high

388
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,260
insulin resistance. How can it be that you have a liver cell which can't let in the glucose,

389
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,940
so it's resistant to the insulin, yet the other effect of insulin, which is de novo lipogenesis,

390
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,820
is not only working fine, it's actually going overtime, right? You can measure de novo lipogenesis

391
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:23,700
and type two diabetes. It's super, super high. And what about the mitogenic effects of insulin?

392
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,540
So insulin is a growth factor. You can measure it, for example, with large for gestational age babies.

393
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,100
And you say that a woman is insulin resistant, yet insulin is actually doing what it's supposed to do.

394
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:40,260
It's actually stimulating a lot of growth. So there again, insulin is super sensitive,

395
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,740
or say testosterone. We know insulin has effect on testosterone and PCOS. And there it's working,

396
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:53,380
again, not just normally, like super high. So in the liver, you have this sort of central paradox

397
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:00,980
where you say in the same tissue to the same levels of insulin, you have both resistance

398
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,780
and super sensitivity. That's not really possible. It's the same cell, same thing,

399
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:14,420
but people call it selective insulin resistance. So that's sort of the central paradox of insulin

400
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:20,020
resistance. And it doesn't really make any sense that this can be the way.

401
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,500
And Jason, I would just add an even simpler observation to that, which I've always struggled

402
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:31,140
with, which is a very common phenotype of insulin resistance is adiposity, obesity, meaning obesity,

403
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,380
which of course means the accumulation of fat in a fat cell. So a fat cell is getting bigger.

404
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,540
Well, for a fat cell to get larger, it needs to incorporate triglyceride. To incorporate

405
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:48,340
triglyceride requires insulin. And to keep insulin in the fat cell requires insulin to

406
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,780
prevent lipolysis. And so on the one hand, you say, well, this patient is insulin resistant.

407
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,780
We'll talk about which cells, you know, maybe the muscle is insulin resistant,

408
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,500
but at the very least, looking at the fat cell, it appears to be quite well insensitive to insulin,

409
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:08,020
right? Exactly. And it's the same thing with de novo lipogenesis. And that this is why I say,

410
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,860
we know that de novo lipogenesis in this state of insulin resistance is taking sort of glucose

411
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:21,220
and turning it into fat. And then the liver sort of exports this fat as VLDL and triglycerides.

412
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,100
Well, the thing is that if you have internal starvation of this liver cell, that is the

413
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,460
glucose cannot get into this liver cell. How on earth is this liver going to package glucose

414
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,460
and turn it into fat? Because we know that is happening. But where's this glucose? Like it's

415
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,060
taking glucose making it into fat. But you're telling me if that with this paradigm, that no

416
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,300
glucose is getting in, you're facing internal starvation. I mean, it's like making a brick wall

417
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,460
with no bricks. It's just impossible. But yet this is the paradigm that we we face this internal

418
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,420
starvation paradigm. And you look at the the person like you look at a type one untreated type

419
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,860
one diabetic where there actually is no insulin. And they're like a stick. So if you've ever seen

420
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,700
some pictures, these type one diabetics could not gain fat no matter how much they ate. Then they

421
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,500
you know, they peed out all their glucose, then they died. That's not what it looks like in type

422
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,140
two diabetes in insulin resistance, because type two diabetes is a disease of too much insulin

423
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,540
resistance. So there's no way that is possibly true. So what you have to come up with is a different

424
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,180
sort of a new paradigm of thinking about what insulin resistance actually is. And this is one

425
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:39,460
of the things that you know, why I say physics always appeals to me, because that's where you

426
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:45,060
can come up with a new theory, which explains all these sort of paradoxes much better. And that is

427
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:52,900
that it's not a sort of underfill problem. It's an overflow problem, because there's two possible

428
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,300
ways. So we say they're insulin resistant, because the glucose does not go into the cell. That's the

429
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,900
whole reason we say it's insulin resistance, locking key paradigm, the gate is closed. But there's

430
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:11,780
actually two reasons why that glucose might not go into the cell, because either the door is closed,

431
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:18,580
or it's already too full. That is, if you have a cell that is already bursting to the seams with

432
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:26,340
glucose, that glucose from the blood simply can't get in. So this is a totally different paradigm

433
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,460
than this sort of internal starvation paradigm, because it's an overflow paradigm. But it solves

434
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:40,260
the problem of the central paradox. That is, why is this liver cell making so much new fat from

435
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:46,820
glucose? Because it's jammed full of fat. The glucose from the outside cannot go in. But the

436
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:52,740
liver cell is so busy trying to make new fat, de novo lipogenesis, that is just shoving it out

437
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,900
the door. But there's too much going in. So the problem is not insulin resistance, per se. The

438
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,340
problem is hyperinsulinemia. That is, in the first place, it was all this insulin that put all this

439
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:10,980
glucose into the cell. But you're putting so much into the cell that it's too full. I use an analogy,

440
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,540
like suppose you have a suitcase, and you're putting your shirts in your suitcase, which is

441
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,180
fine. And your wife says here, put these shirts in, you put it in, that's fine. And then at some point,

442
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,460
your wife says here, put these two shirts into your suitcase, but you don't put them in.

443
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,940
Well, why don't you put those two t shirts, last two t shirts into your suitcase, either the

444
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,180
suitcase doesn't open, or it's just full. There's two possibilities. And they're completely different.

445
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,660
Or to extend on that analogy, you could say, well, you're just not listening to your wife.

446
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,620
What you're basically saying is, look, the conventional view here is, when your wife said,

447
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,460
put these two shirts in your suitcase, the last two times, you just decided, I don't want to,

448
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,860
you know, I don't want to do that. But what if there's another approach? What if you're

449
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,020
fully well and willing to put those last two t shirts in the suitcase, but when you open up

450
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,980
the suitcase, there is simply no more room, the output looks the same, excess shirts outside of

451
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,820
the suitcase, right? But the reason could be entirely different. Exactly. But the implications

452
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,500
are huge. Because the thing is that if it's just the fact that you're not listening to your wife,

453
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,380
and you're not putting the t shirts in, then the solution is for somebody to grab those two t

454
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,900
shirts and just shove them in. Right? And that's what we did with type two diabetes, because we

455
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,060
said the glucose can't get into the cell, what we need to do is give you exogenous insulin,

456
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:42,580
sometimes huge doses of exogenous insulin, so that we can shove the glucose, ram it down the throats

457
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:48,660
of the cell, that's for some reason not listening to us, right? But if it's an overflow paradigm,

458
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:55,300
the implication is completely different. Because the solution is to get rid of the some of the stuff

459
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,140
that's in your suitcase, right? So if you bring it back to insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia,

460
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:08,580
then the solution to trying to get rid of this so called insulin resistance is not giving more

461
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,900
insulin, because that was the problem in the first place, putting those shirts in the suitcase,

462
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,380
that was the problem in the first place. So putting more in is not the solution. The solution

463
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:24,900
is to get rid of it. So the solution is to empty that cell of glucose. That's the whole solution,

464
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,780
which is a totally different paradigm than what we've been taught, right? Because we use sulfonylureas,

465
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:37,060
we use insulin based on just trying to shove more glucose into this already filled cell.

466
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,260
And it solves the problem, it explains the paradox of, I'll tell you the whole thing,

467
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,580
it actually goes much further. But it solves the problem of the central paradox of why

468
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,180
it's making testosterone, why the insulin effect that the so high, right? Why do you get PCOS? Why

469
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,980
do you get the mitogenic effects of insulin, the growth effects of insulin, because you know that

470
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,460
insulin is a growth factor, it has huge implications for cancer, for example. So breast

471
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,460
cancer, colon cancer, very insulin sensitive, much higher rates in type 2 diabetes and obesity.

472
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,020
So you're getting the cancer causing effects of the insulin, but yet you're saying people are

473
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,460
insulin resistance, the fat, and the whole thing. It solves the problem of why you're having continued

474
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,740
de novo lipogenesis, even in the face of this so-called resistance, because you actually have

475
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,420
too much. It's not just a theoretical thing. It actually has huge implications for the treatment,

476
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,460
because your treatment now has to be getting rid of the sugar, getting the insulin down.

477
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,460
So let's pause for a moment and talk about the treatment. So I want to just sort of synthesize

478
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,940
this for the listener, because what you're suggesting is quite radical. Let's be honest,

479
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,140
right? The conventional view is going back to your analogy, which I love, by the way,

480
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,500
is that after your wife asking you enough times to put more t-shirts in, you stop doing it. And the

481
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,300
consensus view is you just stop doing it for some reason. You're not sensitive enough to her

482
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,700
request. You're being an insensitive guy. Look, that's an easy thing to understand. You're just

483
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:11,780
an insensitive guy. Well, the current approach is your wife walks over and opens the suitcase and

484
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,300
gets a few of her friends and your friends to help jam those t-shirts in there, because if you had

485
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,460
enough people and you could put enough weight on the t-shirts, you could probably sneak a few more

486
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,260
in, right? In other words, if you had more insulin or another analogy would be she yells louder is

487
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:32,420
probably a better analogy, right? So if her polite request is insulin, then raising her voice is more

488
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,740
insulin, then yelling and screaming. And then by the end, she's going to like take your favorite

489
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,140
football and throw it at your head. And at that point, you're mainlining insulin into the patient.

490
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,820
Let's talk a little bit about some of the other drugs, because most of the approaches to type 2

491
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:53,860
diabetes pharmacologically are not actually aimed at reducing glucose. Metformin is one of the very

492
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,500
few drugs you mentioned the SGLT2 inhibitors, which I want to come back to. So we'll carve out

493
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,540
the ones that actually lower glucose, but most of them are trying to amplify the noise. So walk us

494
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,980
through the classes of those drugs. So we have the sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin, and

495
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:19,220
there's insulin, which stimulates insulin and the DPP4s, for example, which are also similar in terms

496
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,260
of the increased insulin. This is more than incretins, but they increase insulin, basically.

497
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:31,620
So the classic response of the older class of medication, so I'm going to leave. So metformin,

498
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,100
I'm going to leave aside because that's actually a totally different thing. SGLT2s is the sort of

499
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,860
newest class, but the old ones are all about increasing insulin. So that's your wife screaming

500
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,620
louder at you to shove more shirts in. And this is the thing. So if you do that, so say you give

501
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,180
somebody a sulfonylurea and you start shoving more, you know, your wife starts yelling at you.

502
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,860
So you start shoving more t-shirts. And at first you can do it. But as you keep doing that,

503
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,100
the problem just keeps getting worse and worse because at first it's a little full, then it's

504
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:10,180
a lot too full. And then what happens? Well, even if she's yelling at you really loud,

505
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,980
you still can't put any more. And because you've now you're just way over the limit. So this is

506
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,900
what happened in the body because look, if we look at the way we treat a type 2 diabetes sort of 20

507
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,100
years ago, it was to give sulfonylureas, then insulin, then more insulin, then more insulin,

508
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,380
you're just shoving more shirts into that suitcase. And the cell is getting more and more glucose,

509
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,540
and it's getting more and more full. As it gets more and more full, the insulin resistance gets

510
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,540
worse and worse. So what do you do? You keep going up, you keep going up. And guess what? That's

511
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:49,300
exactly what happened. But if you think about it, if you have a patient who 10 years ago was on

512
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,820
one drug, and now they're on huge doses of insulin, that diabetes never got better. The sugars might

513
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:02,340
have gotten better, right? But the actual disease itself of type 2 diabetes never got better. It

514
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:07,700
only got worse. And that's the reason we say it's chronic and progressive because the treatment

515
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,100
was completely incorrect. We did the wrong thing. We kept putting more shirts in when we should have

516
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,380
been taking shirts out. We kept putting more glucose into the liver, which is what insulin does,

517
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,540
right? Instead of taking all that glucose out of the liver. It was the wrong thing. That's why

518
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:32,100
people got worse. That's why we could never show any benefit to type glucose control in type 2

519
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:38,660
diabetes. That's why the Accord, the Advance, the VADT, and all those trials failed because

520
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:45,140
they're working on this incorrect paradigm of insulin resistance. This is the lock and key

521
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,900
paradigm. So now we have a drug class, which is something completely different. So this is the

522
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,100
SGLT2. Before you go to that, Jason, I'll just add another point to this because I know I discussed

523
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,260
this with Jake Kushner several months ago, but it's important to revisit this in case

524
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,060
folks have either forgotten that or didn't listen to it. I want to emphasize what you just said a

525
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,300
second ago, because you said it sort of like, yeah, we all know this, but it's such an important point.

526
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:18,340
Right. When diabetes trials are using glycemia as their endpoint, meaning how low can you get

527
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:24,740
the hemoglobin A1C? How quote unquote tightly can you control the glucose? They do seem to have some

528
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:32,660
benefits. Anything that is macrovascular does seem to get a little bit better. So where glucose

529
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:40,340
at high levels causes problems, those things seem to get a little bit better. But where glucose at

530
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:46,260
modest levels in the presence of high insulin, sorry, at the micro, I said macro, I meant

531
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,860
microvascular, but the opposite is not true. So by taking someone's average glucose from 200 down

532
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,740
to 150, that would be considered a huge win in a diabetes trial if you took their glucose from 200

533
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:02,740
down to 150. And that benefit might show up in their kidneys. But if you had to double the amount

534
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:09,060
of insulin you gave them to do that, it turns out at the macrovascular level, for example, heart and

535
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:14,980
brain, they don't get any better. In fact, they might get worse. I remember the first time I sort

536
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:21,620
of saw that about three years ago, it was a big aha moment, which is, why aren't they getting

537
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:26,420
better? And that's sort of when I began to think about hyperinsulinemia itself. I mean, maybe it

538
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,860
was longer than that, but not that long ago, right? It was like hyperinsulinemia itself is problematic

539
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:39,860
if you normalize for glycemic levels. Yeah, because this is the thing that is not the blood glucose

540
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:46,100
per se, it's the whole body glucose. Because if you think about this overflow paradigm now,

541
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,660
if you take the glucose that's in the blood and simply shove it into the liver, have you done

542
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:58,660
anything good for this patient? The answer is no, because you're just covering up the problem. So

543
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,260
you take insulin and your sugars are amazing, right? They're normal, but you shoved all this sugar

544
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,300
into your liver. What happens when you stop taking the insulin? All the sugar comes rushing back out

545
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,620
of your liver and your sugar goes high. So you actually have to keep taking it to keep it bottled

546
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,540
up. All you've done is you've covered up the problem. You never made it better because it's

547
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:22,580
like taking garbage and throwing it under your sink. You can pretend that your kitchen is nice

548
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,980
and clean, but it's going to start to smell. And that's the problem. It's the whole body glucose,

549
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:34,820
moving the glucose from one compartment of the body, which is the blood, to another compartment,

550
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,540
which is the liver. So you move the glucose from where you could see it into somewhere where you

551
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,540
couldn't see it. That doesn't do your body any good. And that was the real lesson of the accord

552
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,580
advance VADT. That was 2008. Those were actually the trials that started me down this whole thinking

553
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:56,180
that what we're doing is actually completely incorrect. Because if you remember for 2008,

554
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:02,180
I've been doing this for like 18 years or 17 years. And that was what we always thought,

555
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:08,500
right? You get the blood glucose low enough or normalize it, you're going to see huge benefits.

556
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,340
But we didn't, we didn't see any benefits at all. And that was a huge paradigm shift because these

557
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:23,060
all came in 2008. And yet, nobody wanted to propose a new theory of what is insulin resistance and how

558
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,780
we're treating it and why are we so wrong? We just kept doing what we kept doing. We just said, well,

559
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,620
maybe it's the hypoglycemia. It's like, come on, that's stupid. They weren't getting a lot of

560
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:37,620
hypoglycemia. But what they had to understand at that point, which nobody ever did, was that this

561
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:44,580
paradigm of lock and key internal starvation is completely the wrong way to think about it.

562
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,260
Therefore, you're using the wrong treatments, you're using treatments that are actually going to make

563
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,340
it worse, not better. And when you actually get rid of the glucose, so this is gets me back to

564
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:01,940
SGLT2s. So the SGLT2s are a new class of drug. And what they do is they actually make you pee out

565
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:08,260
the sugar. So it blocks the receptor on the kidneys, where you're actually absorbing the glucose, and

566
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,660
you actually pee out the sugar. So you get side effects, you get tons of side effects, you get like

567
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:19,300
urine infections and yeast infections, and for some reason, you get ketoacidosis too. But the point is

568
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,260
that if you look at the trials, they're actually quite consistent, you actually get a huge,

569
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:32,740
huge protective effect from the SGLT2s. That is, for the first time in like decades, we have a drug

570
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,940
that actually protects against kidney disease. So reduce the risk of kidney disease by about 25%,

571
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:44,820
and reduce the risk of heart disease, which we've never seen before in any class of

572
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,980
anti-diabetic drug. Because what we're doing now is we're actually getting rid of the garbage,

573
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,820
we're getting rid of the glucose, we're emptying out that suitcase. So the amount of lowering of

574
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:02,420
blood sugar was super unimpressive in all of these trials. So there's like five or six trials now.

575
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,620
Every single one of these trials shows end organ protection with almost no benefit to your blood

576
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,860
sugar. Like A1c would drop like 0.3 or 0.4, like nothing, it was terrible for the blood sugar,

577
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:22,900
but the end points were incredible. Why? Because you're actually getting rid of the actual problem.

578
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:28,180
You're emptying out the body of this glucose, which is what was making them sick in the first place,

579
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:35,940
as opposed to simply moving it around. And that I think is the explanation as to why SGLT2s are so,

580
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,820
so effective for organ protection, which we never saw before. Because now you're actually treating

581
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:50,180
the underlying problem of too much whole body glucose, as opposed to too much glucose in the

582
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:56,500
blood. You know, it's a totally different dynamic. Like if your whole body has too much sodium versus

583
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,580
just the blood has too much sodium, it's a totally different problem, right? If your whole body has

584
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,700
too much sodium, you get edema. If your just your blood has too much sodium, you have hypernatremia,

585
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:12,260
totally separate problems. Same thing here. If your blood glucose is high and your whole body

586
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,860
glucose is high, totally separate problems. Now we're actually addressing the underlying reason.

587
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,820
Let's consider, we're going to go to this in detail so we don't have to go deep now on it, but

588
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:30,980
just listening to the way you're describing it, it seems that another way to provide benefit,

589
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:37,540
which clinically seems to work quite well, is exercise. Because the more one would exercise,

590
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:44,580
the more one would increase a different reservoir outside of the liver, which is actually a larger

591
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:49,860
reservoir, and one that can't put its glucose back into circulation, which is the muscle.

592
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:56,580
So as I listened to you describe this, it's not inconsistent with this clinical observation,

593
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,660
which is you take a person with type 2 diabetes who is not exercising at all, who is sedentary,

594
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:09,460
and even if you make no change to their nutrition, exercising them quite vigorously for an hour a day

595
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,700
is actually going to have a benefit independent of anything else. Now the idea here would be how

596
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,220
many of these things can you combine them? Now, so what is the magnitude of that benefit?

597
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,780
There is a benefit for sure. I mean, all the studies we've done on exercise are beneficial,

598
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:27,860
but it's much less efficient than attacking the diet, just because the liver is really the key to

599
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,740
type 2 diabetes, the fatty liver and all that sort of thing, and you really can't exercise your liver.

600
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,460
You can burn off a lot of this glucose with exercise, but compared to the amount that you

601
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,060
put in on a daily basis, it's a lot more work than to simply not eat, for example. So in terms of

602
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,780
efficiency, it's just less efficient, but clearly there is a benefit to exercise, and it's the same

603
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:53,140
thing. You're really just trying to empty out all this glucose from the system. The other thing is

604
00:54:53,140 --> 00:55:00,260
that what always strikes me as sort of funny is that it's not really just about the diabetes.

605
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:06,180
It actually affects more than that because it actually goes into the entire metabolic syndrome,

606
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:12,340
because if you think about it, metabolic syndrome is a constellation of five things. If you take the

607
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,780
ATP definition, it's the increased blood glucose, which we've talked about, but also abdominal

608
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:24,100
obesity, high triglycerides, low HDL, and high blood pressure. And if you think about it,

609
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,220
hyperinsulinemia plays a role in the same thing, because what happens, of course, is that if you

610
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:37,300
have this overflow paradigm, this liver is now busy exporting out tons and tons of the fat,

611
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,300
right? It's got too much glucose because of too much insulin. So it's too much glucose,

612
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:47,940
too much insulin. So therefore the liver is jam-packed, and it wants to get rid of all this

613
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,500
extra fat. So it's actually putting out tons of triglycerides. So that's why you get hyper

614
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:00,100
triglyceridemia. And then, of course, as triglycerides go up, we know that HDL goes down. So HDL goes

615
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:06,660
down. As you're exporting out all of this fat, this fat goes into all kinds of places where it's

616
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:13,140
not supposed to go, into the pancreas, into the omenital fat, and you get this abdominal obesity,

617
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:19,460
not because of dietary fat, because remember, dietary fat doesn't go into the liver. It goes

618
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,740
into the chylomicrons, which goes into the blood vessels, which is taken out by the adipocytes,

619
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,300
right? It never goes into the liver. It's the fact that the liver is pouring out all this new fat

620
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,580
that gets taken up in all the organs around it. So you get fatty pancreas, for example, which I

621
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:40,100
wanted to talk about in a second. But that's abdominal obesity. And we know that insulin has

622
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:47,220
an effect on blood pressure, because insulin causes reabsorption of sodium at the site of

623
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:55,540
the proximal tubule. So now, hyperinsulinemia, too much insulin, is really what is behind

624
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:02,340
abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high blood pressure, low HDL, and hypertriglyceridemia.

625
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,780
That's the metabolic syndrome. The whole syndrome is not a syndrome of insulin resistance.

626
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:14,020
It's a syndrome of hyperinsulinemia. And that's a way better way to think about it,

627
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:20,660
because if the problem is hyperinsulinemia, then the solution is completely obvious. Insulin's

628
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:26,260
high. How are we going to lower it? It's no different than, hey, if your thyroid is too high,

629
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,140
you want to lower it. If your thyroid is too low, you want to give some. Well, that's not so hard

630
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:37,780
to understand. But think about type 2 diabetes for a second. Type 2 diabetes, we know that insulin

631
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:44,180
levels are high. So why did we think it would get better? By giving more insulin. We totally

632
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:49,940
misunderstand the problem. Yeah, I had a mentor who trained as an endocrinologist, but now focuses

633
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:57,140
exclusively on type 2 diabetes and obesity. He said the exact same thing, which is we have to,

634
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,500
he doesn't like the term insulin resistance for the same reason you don't, which is he says it's not

635
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:07,220
consistent with the way we think about endocrinology. In endocrinology, we think about

636
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:13,780
hyper and hypo fill in the blank. And yeah, he uses example thyroid. And he's like, look,

637
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:19,380
if you have too little thyroid hormone, we give you more. If you hypothyroid, we give you more. And

638
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:27,060
type 1 diabetes is that analogy. If you have too much thyroid hormone, we don't give you more of it.

639
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,620
We treat you in a way that reduces the effect of it. And sometimes that means taking out part of

640
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,420
the thyroid and all these other things. It's funny, I think part of the reason I think people

641
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:42,340
struggle with this is the endocrine system is easier to replace than to shut down. Hyper

642
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:48,980
cortisol is another great example. When you have patients whose cortisol levels are unmeasurable,

643
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:54,100
an extreme example of that would be someone in an Addisonian crisis. We're pretty good at giving

644
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,940
more cortisol. But when you have people with hypercorticillemia, which unfortunately comes

645
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:06,980
hand in hand with hyperinsulinemia, there's no pill to lower hypercorticillemia. Exactly. And

646
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:11,860
this is the same problem we had. That is type 1 diabetes, which is too little insulin. Hey,

647
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:16,980
it was great. Just give more insulin. But when you had type 2 diabetes, which is too much insulin,

648
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:24,020
there's no drug like SGLD2 for a little bit. But before that, there's no drug. So then we just gave

649
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,980
the same thing. It's so ridiculous, just like giving a hyperthyroid patient, hey, give them

650
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,780
some L-thyroxine. It's like, that's going to make it worse. But we did the same thing. And we watched

651
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:39,380
these people get worse. We gave them insulin and what happened? They all gained like 30 pounds.

652
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:46,500
Every single study showed that. The DCCT showed that. They just gained weight and they became

653
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:53,780
hyperinsulinemia. We have type ones who actually became hyperinsulinemia. You start out taking 20

654
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:00,020
units, 15 units a day when you're a kid. And then by the time you're 45, you're taking like 60 units

655
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:06,420
a day. Why? You developed insulin resistance. And yet you had no insulin in your body in the first

656
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:12,020
place 20 years ago, right? Because we thought that giving more insulin was good, but we didn't realize

657
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:18,740
that, hey, too much insulin is just as bad as too little insulin or worse in this case. And the

658
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:25,220
funny part about it is that we actually know a lot about biochemically how this sort of overflow

659
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,900
paradigm works. So if you look at the glycolytic cycle and the TCA cycle, for example, you have

660
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:38,100
glucose, which undergoes glycolysis to pyruvate. And pyruvate goes through pyruvate oxidation

661
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:44,820
into acetyl CoA, which undergoes the citric acid cycle, which gives you citrate and gives you ATP,

662
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:52,900
which again, we know feeds back and blocks glycolysis. Like, okay, well, that's you have

663
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:59,540
glucose. It goes into the cell, goes undergoes citric acid cycle. You get lots of ATP, you get

664
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:07,540
lots of citric acid, feeds back, blocks glycolysis, which means that glucose can't go in. It's like,

665
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,980
okay, we worked out the whole biochemistry of how this is overflow paradigm is supposed to work.

666
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:18,900
We actually teach it to like high school students that, hey, if you're feeding in way too much of

667
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:25,700
this stuff into the TCA cycle, there's a feedback. There's a negative feedback loop. And almost every

668
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:32,820
biochemical reaction does this, right? In biology, if you start stimulating stuff, you actually have

669
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:39,140
something that's going to block it. TCA cycles, no different. ATP is going to block glycolysis,

670
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:44,500
which is going to block that glucose. So you don't overload the system. That's what's happening.

671
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,140
Glucose can't go in anymore. This is such an important point because then you can say, okay,

672
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:56,180
hyperinsulinemia, which is actually too much glucose, too much insulin is going to feed back

673
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,220
and not let the glucose into the cell, which is why the glucose stays outside and you have the

674
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:06,020
so-called insulin resistance. But the key is to empty out the cell of glucose. How are you going

675
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:12,100
to do that? Well, low carbohydrate diets, intermittent fast. There's no more potent way

676
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:17,620
to lower insulin than to fast. I mean, we're going to come to this in a moment, but I get such a kick

677
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:22,980
out of watching people argue back and forth about whether carbohydrate restriction versus fat

678
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,500
restriction is better at lowering insulin. My experience is that carbohydrate restriction does

679
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,460
a better job than fat restriction, but I feel like sitting on the sidelines saying, hey guys,

680
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:38,580
there's another tool over here you've both sort of forgotten that's like infinitely more potent.

681
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:44,340
Eat nothing and watch what happens to insulin levels. And this is what we did. We just said,

682
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:49,140
okay, don't eat anything. You got to clear out this glucose. You got too much glucose in your

683
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,780
cell. Clear it out. The easiest way to do that is eat nothing. Then you're going to force your body

684
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:58,180
to start using some of this fuel, right? And the first place is going to pull it out of is this

685
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:03,620
fatty liver. Oh, by the way, the fatty liver. So of course is driven by this de novo lipogenesis,

686
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:09,860
which is why again, we see this huge correlation between fatty liver, which is a huge problem,

687
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:15,940
by the way, it's actually causing a ton of cirrhosis these days and type two diabetes, because

688
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,900
it's actually part of the same problem. But exactly, you're, you're, you're completely ignoring

689
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,420
your most effective tool, which is intermittent fasting. As soon as we did that, we saw tons of

690
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,900
people just reverse their type two diabetes, which gets me to my next point, which is the type

691
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,620
two diabetes. And everybody forgets that this is actually a two step process, right? You don't

692
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:41,700
develop type two diabetes just with insulin resistance. It's actually is two things you need.

693
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,180
One is insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia, which is a much better name. And then two,

694
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:52,740
you need beta cell failure, because what happens is, and this is where the old paradigm was

695
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:58,100
completely wrong again. So we said, okay, well, you have insulin resistance, your body responds

696
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,380
by increasing the amount of insulin. So we know that that happens. So you get hyperinsulinemia.

697
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:11,460
And then eventually, the pancreas is just so tired of making all this insulin that it atrophies,

698
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:17,780
and it fails. And that's beta cell failure. That's when you actually see the blood glucose go way up.

699
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:24,740
And this whole process takes like 10 years or so. So the rising insulin resistance is met with

700
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:29,940
hyperinsulinemia, which keeps the blood glucose normal. And it keeps it normal for a long time

701
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:36,820
at the expense of hyperinsulinemia. And this is precisely what Kraft said, you can figure it out

702
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:44,100
much earlier if you look at insulin levels, as opposed to blood glucose levels. But the point is

703
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:50,260
that now you have to hypothesize that there's two completely separate things going on. One is

704
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:56,900
insulin resistance, and two is beta cell failure. And they're totally separate. And again, it doesn't

705
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:02,900
make any sense. There's too many experimental points that don't line up. One, we know that if

706
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:08,900
you're going to say type two diabetics, their beta cells have failed. Well, we know that's not true,

707
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:14,020
because virtually all type two diabetics are reversible. If you do bariatric surgery,

708
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:19,860
if you look at the studies, like 80%, 90% of those type two diabetics, they actually get off all their

709
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:25,140
meds, they actually reverse their type two diabetes. So if you said that the beta cell just failed,

710
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:30,980
then you're wrong. Because even the most severe type two diabetics reverse, we have three year

711
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,980
old, so the youngest person in the world to get type two diabetes was three years old, you're going

712
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:42,260
to hypothesize that this three year old pancreas has failed, has atrophied, like that's clearly

713
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:47,380
wrong. And the other thing is that you have to say if these two things go hand in hand,

714
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:53,700
why is it that you only see beta cell failure in this case of insulin resistance,

715
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,700
and never anywhere else? Like, how does that even work? Like they go together, one goes with the

716
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:05,300
other all the time and exclusively with each other. So this is the point that you'd have to

717
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:10,340
say that there's two separate things going on. But if you think about the sort of overflow paradigm,

718
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:16,980
again, explains this paradox very easily. Because what happens is that, and this is where, you know,

719
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:22,660
if you look at a lot of the work on the twin cycles hypothesis fits in, is that you're filling up your

720
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:28,420
liver with all this glucose, hyperinsulinemia, you got too much glucose in your liver, your liver

721
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:35,220
starts making fat and pumping it out. Then one of the organs that it accumulates in is the

722
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:42,580
pancreas. So now you've got fatty pancreas. And that is the problem is that your pancreas is not

723
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:49,220
failed. Your pancreas is just clogged with fat. And you can measure these in an MRI and whatever,

724
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:55,300
and you can see that all these people who have type two diabetes actually have big fatty pancreases

725
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:01,220
as well. And as you simply get them to fast, so the counterpoint study, which was done by Royce

726
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:06,580
Taylor and so on, they showed that the type two diabetes was reversible because you simply unclog

727
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:12,660
the fat. But now the fatty liver is responsible for the insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia.

728
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:17,780
And the fatty pancreas is responsible for the beta failure. So they're both manifestations of the same

729
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:24,900
thing. They're both manifestations of hyperinsulinemia. And that explains why it's not two defects of type

730
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:30,260
two diabetes. It's actually a single defect and why it's a reversible problem. So again, this

731
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:40,020
hypothesis fits the anomalies so much better than everything else. And if you look at fructose,

732
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,620
for example, it's like, why is fructose so bad? And it's like, well, it doesn't have any

733
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:50,660
glycemic effect. It really doesn't have that much of an insulin effect, but causes a lot of this

734
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:57,060
fatty liver. All that fructose goes into the liver, gets turned into fat through pneumocytoplagrogenesis.

735
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:02,020
And now that's all part of the same pathogenesis, the fatty liver, the hyperinsulinemia. So it

736
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:09,220
explains everything about how this disease of type two diabetes, more than just hyperinsulinemia

737
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:15,300
or insulin resistance, it explains how that all kind of comes about. It sort of fits a lot better.

738
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,900
And this is what I mean. That's why I like the physics model, which is like, okay, we have a

739
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:27,140
theory now, which now fits the facts so much better than the old lock and key model. And

740
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,180
therefore you have to adopt it and say, what are the treatments that come out of this that are going

741
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:36,020
to be more effective? There are actually two separate things I want to ask about. The first one is,

742
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:47,860
do you see a way that naphyl D is causal towards hyperinsulinemia and separately where hyperinsulinemia

743
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:53,220
is causal to naphyl D? The literature is really not clear on this. And you could just say, well,

744
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:58,660
let's just dismiss the literature out of hand. But clinically, these things are so tightly wound.

745
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:05,620
And I've never really done the clinical experiment to tackle one without the other. So it's a very

746
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:11,940
common presentation is hyperinsulinemia that you describe. And I also am a big fan of Joseph Kraft.

747
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:16,740
And actually I would credit it to Najit Orbeh, who was one of my mentors, the endocrinologist I

748
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:22,100
referred to who really got me to think of it as hyperinsulinemia as the endocrine condition.

749
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:28,100
And his view was, look, the oral glucose tolerance test with frequent sampling is our best tool,

750
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:34,980
because long before glucose levels get out of whack, you're going to see inappropriate amounts

751
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:41,540
of hyperinsulinemia early on. But nevertheless, the common presentation is patient has hyperinsulinemia

752
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,780
with or without normal glucose levels. Their hemoglobin A1c is often completely normal.

753
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:52,900
Their ALT is high, much higher than we would like it to see, though not so high that people would get

754
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:58,260
alarmed by it. And if you really felt like doing it and you were resource unconstrained, you could

755
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,980
get an ultrasound of the liver and you would almost assuredly see the accumulation of fat.

756
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:12,180
Well, with that patient, we take a treatment plan that addresses both. The NAFLD resolved, the LFTs

757
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:17,700
within a very short period of time normalize, and so too does the hyperinsulinemia. And so I've

758
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:24,020
never tried to disentangle if the high level of insulin is really pushing the fat accumulation

759
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:28,100
in the liver or the other way around. Although, of course, you could argue that there's different

760
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,660
scenarios, right? If you put somebody on a very high fructose diet that wasn't necessarily

761
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:38,500
overly abundant in glucose, it might actually be that the NAFLD drives the hyperinsulinemia

762
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:45,380
versus a diet that is too high in carbohydrates for the individual such that it's the hyperinsulinemia

763
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:52,180
that ultimately leads to what? Help me think through the arrow of causation in the other

764
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:58,820
direction. Well, I think it does both, right? So you have those studies by Havel from 2009 where

765
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:04,020
he took people and gave them a lot of fructose, right? So the experiment was great. They took

766
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,740
people, two groups of people. One they gave sort of Kool-Aid that was sweetened with glucose and

767
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:13,460
one that they gave Kool-Aid sweetened with fructose. And then they actually looked for insulin

768
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:19,780
resistance and so on. And what they found was that when you gave a lot of fructose, people got type

769
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:25,060
two diabetes. You could measure the oral glucose tolerance test and they actually became diabetic.

770
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:30,820
So what you see is that the fructose, which is metabolized in the liver, is causing this fat

771
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:37,860
accumulation specifically in the liver. And that is going to cause a hyperinsulinemia, right? Because

772
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:44,980
the liver is full of all this excess fat. Now you're trying to shove all this glucose into this

773
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,380
fatty liver cell and the liver is like, no, I can't take anymore. So I'm going to be

774
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:55,300
resistant to this. So as it gets resistant, the blood glucose goes up and the body starts to

775
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:00,020
have to make more insulin to sort of get rid of this other situation, which is, hey,

776
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,460
there's too much glucose in the body. So I think the arrow of causation goes both ways, which means

777
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:11,060
it's sort of a vicious cycle. Each is making the other worse. So you have to take care of the

778
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,620
problem. So when you take care of one, you sort of take care of both. And I always say that what's

779
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,580
interesting is to look at this way of thinking. And then if you think about it, if you take it

780
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:26,740
sort of one step further, what you see is that the obesity, the insulin resistance and the type

781
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:31,060
two diabetes, which is the fatty pancreas as well, is they're actually not detrimental. They're

782
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:38,020
actually protective. They're actually mechanisms of protection against the problem. So for example,

783
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:44,100
let's take obesity. So I say, okay, so let's think about this one step at a time. Suppose you have

784
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:51,620
houses on a street and insulin every day, you take a little bit of sugar, so a bit of glucose,

785
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:57,220
and insulin comes by and knocks on the door and gives you a little bit of glucose. And you say,

786
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:01,620
thank you, and you use it for energy and everything's great. Now, all of a sudden, you start taking a

787
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:07,060
lot of glucose. So insulin comes by and instead of giving you a little cup of glucose, it gives you

788
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:12,020
a big barrel of glucose. And it's sort of like too much, right? But you take it because you're

789
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:20,740
supposed to. But eventually, your house fills up with all this glucose. So after a while, the glucose

790
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:26,820
keeps coming in and insulin keeps giving you a big barrel full that you can't use every single

791
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:31,460
day. And now your house is full. So what are you going to do? Well, you're going to stop taking that

792
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:36,980
glucose. So that's insulin resistance. So that's not actually, that's protective. It's protecting

793
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:42,340
itself from the effect of too much glucose. That's what the fatty liver is doing. It's protecting

794
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:47,540
itself from too much glucose. It says, hey, hey, hey, I can't take any more of this. So what happens,

795
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:51,060
of course, is the insulin is like, oh, I got to get rid of this glucose, right? I can't have it

796
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,100
hanging around. I'm going to lose my job. So it gets more insulin and starts battering down the

797
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,780
door and just shoving in all this glucose. Not that glucose is bad, but there's just too much of it.

798
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:08,100
So it just keeps shoveling in it. So then you're overcoming that protective response. The obesity,

799
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:13,140
which is the filling up of your house, was actually trying to protect yourself against this

800
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,260
excessive insulin resistance. And we see actually evidence of that in the lipodistrophes.

801
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:24,180
So I don't know if you saw that paper a few years ago about lipodistrophes. So you had these people

802
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:29,540
that actually had no fat and you think, okay, if they're so thin, if they're so skinny, they must

803
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:33,780
have no insulin resistance. They had the worst insulin resistance you've ever seen, like off

804
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,700
the charts. They wrote about it in the New York time. Yeah. This is the thing that sort of explains

805
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:44,500
that paradigm, which is if you are truly insulin resistant and you at least buy the argument that

806
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:50,020
that's a global term, meaning one cell is insulin resistant, they all are. Well then, yes, you should

807
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:57,380
be the leanest individual on the face of the earth because your adipose tissue does not have the

808
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:04,900
ability to integrate or assimilate the signal that says, one, bring triglyceride in and two,

809
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:10,340
halt the process of lipolysis. The problem is not insulin resistance per se, it's actually

810
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:16,660
hyperinsulinemia. So what your body is doing is taking all this fat and sort of storing it away.

811
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,860
So it doesn't cause a problem, right? So these people with the lipodistrophy, they couldn't store

812
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:26,660
the fat. So what happened is that the fat stored up in their liver and they had the highest insulin

813
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:32,580
resistance you've ever measured because it's really a protective mechanism. The fat is trying to suck

814
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:38,660
away all this glucose so that it doesn't cause a problem. This is why obesity itself is actually a

815
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:43,540
protective mechanism against hyperinsulinemia, against too much sugar. So the ultimate problem

816
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:51,620
is too much glucose and too much insulin. So then the next step is, okay, so now insulin sort of is

817
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:56,260
way too much. The insulin's got all his cousins out, you know, battering down your door, throwing in

818
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,180
all this stuff and you can't take it anymore. So then what do you do? Well, you start to take some

819
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:05,300
of these barrels and you try and give it to like your friends and your family and so on, right? So

820
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,780
this is what the liver does, right? It's got way too much fat sitting around. So it takes this fat

821
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:17,300
and shovels it out the door as VLDL and it goes into the other organs. So it goes into the pancreas,

822
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,940
it goes into the liver, it goes into your omentum. That's how you get the obesity,

823
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:26,980
the abdominal obesity that you see. So now you've got obesity as a protective mechanism

824
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:32,100
and insulin resistance itself is a protective mechanism because the cell is trying to protect

825
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:37,860
itself from too much insulin, too much sugar. The last part is that you're throwing out all this

826
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:42,020
glucose into your pancreas, all this fat into your pancreas. Your pancreas stops,

827
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,740
it makes a lot of insulin, makes a lot of insulin, makes a lot of insulin up onto a certain point.

828
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:51,860
Now it's all clogged up and it can't make the insulin. So what happens? Well, you start to

829
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:59,300
pee out all this sugar, right? You get the polyuria, polydipsia, glycosuria. Your body

830
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:05,860
is actually trying to protect itself by peeing out all this sugar. So it's like you have to look

831
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:10,500
at it the other way. We think of all these responses, obesity, insulin resistance, and

832
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:18,980
the beta cell failure as pathologic. They're actually protective. It's a totally different

833
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,060
thing. Your body is actually trying to protect yourself against the root cause of the problem,

834
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:30,420
which is too much insulin, too much glucose. So when you enhance that glycosuria with SGLT2s,

835
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:36,100
guess what? You actually have a protective, like a hugely protective effect because that's the

836
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:41,700
protective mechanism against the root cause. When you actually give people more insulin,

837
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:46,180
you actually keep all that inside, then what happens? Again, we, and clinically you see this,

838
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,980
clinically the patients know it because you give them insulin, their blood sugars are better,

839
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,220
but then they gain weight. And as they gain weight, their diabetes gets worse. So you give

840
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:59,140
them more insulin and as you give them more insulin, they gain more weight. Do you think that

841
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:07,700
adiposity per se, all things equal, is also driving the hyperinsulinemia? And if so,

842
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:13,700
what is the mechanism? Or do you believe that the adiposity is a bystander of it? Because this is

843
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:20,260
also an enormously difficult problem to tease out in clinical trials because virtually any

844
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:27,140
clinical trial that demonstrates an improvement in quote insulin resistance or more accurately

845
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:33,780
a reduction in hyperinsulinemia is without exception to my knowledge accompanied by weight

846
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:41,460
loss and a reduction in adiposity. And this too then drives a causal question, which is,

847
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:47,940
is the adiposity driving the hyperinsulinemia? So let's for a moment, pos it that hyperinsulinemia

848
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:52,340
is the way we will refer to this. And we won't talk about insulin resistance because that term

849
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:57,300
has really lost meaning in this context, that the adiposity is driving the insulin resistance

850
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,020
or the insulin resistance is driving the adiposity. I think it's more likely that the

851
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:08,820
hyperinsulinemia is driving the obesity rather than the other way around. I mean,

852
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,940
it's always hard to tease out, but you can look at, to me, it's always like, let's take

853
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:19,220
sort of an experiment and see. So there is a great experiment a few years ago where they

854
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:24,100
took people who were type 2 diabetic, and this is in the 90s, and they gave them a lot of insulin.

855
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:30,500
So from time zero to six months, they went from zero units of insulin to like a hundred units of

856
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:36,420
insulin, the blood sugars were great. And what happened? Well, they gained like 20 pounds. And

857
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:41,140
if you look at the number of calories that they were eating per day, it actually dropped by about

858
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:46,980
two, 300 calories per day. So what you see is that the only difference, because this was a randomized

859
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:51,860
sort of trial, the only difference was the hyperinsulinemia. That's what we changed.

860
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,460
When we changed experimentally, the amount of insulin people were getting because we're giving

861
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:04,340
it to them, they gained weight. So to me, that is clearly a causal relationship. We see this all

862
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,900
the time, right? You prescribe insulin, people gain weight. You give sulfonylureas, which increase

863
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:14,420
insulin, people gain weight, right? You give them SGLT2s, which make insulin drop, then you lose

864
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:19,780
weight. And type 1 diabetics know it too, like they lose weight. So the arrow of causality is very

865
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:26,820
easy to establish going from hyperinsulinemia to obesity. And forgetting all the mechanism,

866
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:30,900
all I'm saying is that when you give insulin, people gain weight. Every single time you give

867
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:37,140
insulin or raise it by sulfonylureas, or when you lower insulin with type 1 diabetes, they lose

868
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:41,460
weight. And it doesn't forget about what you eat or whatever. Like people always say, oh, let's put

869
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:48,340
equal calories in the liquid. All I'm changing is the insulin. Then obesity goes up or down,

870
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:53,940
depending on what happens to the insulin. It's much harder to establish that causality the other way

871
01:20:53,940 --> 01:21:00,980
around, right? You can, and they've done this with liposuction. So if you take a situation where

872
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:08,100
you remove 20 pounds of fat, what happens? And the answer is nothing. Right. Now that study,

873
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,780
if you're referring to the one that Sam Klein published in the New England Journal of Medicine,

874
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:17,620
I love that because it's a great example. Of course, the pushback is yes, but that was only

875
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:23,700
subcutaneous fat that was removed. We don't do liposuction on visceral fat. You know, on some

876
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,540
level, I think this is a great theoretical question. It might not matter. In other words,

877
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:32,420
it doesn't change the clinical decision. It's an important question as we think mechanistically

878
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:38,260
about what's happening, but it doesn't change what you do with a patient, which in the final analysis

879
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:45,540
matters more than anything. But yes, until we can really do liposuction on visceral fat,

880
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:50,260
which I personally think would just pose too much risk to justify, it's going to be very difficult

881
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:55,460
to tease out the other direction. But what about the role of inflammation? Because the other thing

882
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:01,700
that seems to go hand in hand with hyperinsulinemia in patients is they also tend to be quite

883
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:08,100
inflamed. And we can measure this non-specifically with things like C-reactive protein, fibrinogen,

884
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:14,980
interleukins. We can even see cardiac specific forms of inflammation. So for me, this is just

885
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:19,460
a very non-scientific clinical observation, but I'm curious as to whether you've seen it.

886
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:25,300
Yeah. In terms of inflammation, again, I look at it from an experimental standpoint. So if I think

887
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:32,180
inflammation causes obesity, for example, then what happens when you decrease inflammation? Because

888
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:37,700
we have anti-inflammatory medications. What happens to obesity? Well, you can give NSAIDs,

889
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:42,020
and people don't lose weight. You can give prednisone, which is probably our most powerful

890
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:48,580
anti-inflammatory. People don't lose weight. If you give all these antibodies, this antibody,

891
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:54,660
that end, there's all kinds of inflammatory IL-2 and TNF. And you have all these things,

892
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:59,940
other than if they get super nauseated, they lose weight. But if they don't get super nauseated,

893
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:05,300
then they don't really lose weight. So to me, that whole story, there might be a kernel of truth in

894
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:11,620
that. But to me, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. Like if you get a really bad infection,

895
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:18,500
some kind of inflammatory state, so inflammation goes way up, rheumatoid arthritis, do you gain a

896
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:25,140
lot of weight? It's like, yeah, I don't really see it. As opposed to the consistency where you give

897
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,700
insulin, people gain weight. You take away insulin, people lose weight. To me, that's a consistent

898
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,500
causal relationship. Whereas inflammation, it's much less. I don't deny that there's a lot of

899
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:40,420
important inflammatory mediators and stuff, but it's just not so simple that you can say

900
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:45,140
more inflammation causes weight gain, less inflammation causes weight loss. Therefore,

901
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,540
treat everybody with Advil or something like that. Yeah, where I was going to go was actually

902
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:52,740
slightly more nuanced, which is again, getting a little bit ahead of where we're going to go,

903
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:58,340
because I want to start talking about some treatment ideas. But you take a hyperinsulinemic

904
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:05,460
patient with no inflammation. In my limited experience, they tend to respond quite well to

905
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:13,620
carbohydrate restriction and exercise. When I take patients who have significant hyperinsulinemia,

906
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:22,180
but it's also coupled with inflammation, I don't find that they are as impacted by what I just said.

907
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:29,220
And I find that those are the patients that initially got me to start exploring significant

908
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:35,380
periods of fasting, either significant 500 calories a day for five days, that type of fasting, or

909
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:40,100
water only for three days, five days, that sort of thing. And again, not a very scientific

910
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:44,900
organization or observation rather, these are small and clinical things that I see.

911
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:53,300
But I wonder if A, you've seen that and B, if it suggests that inflammation can have a negative

912
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:58,900
synergy with hyperinsulinemia. I think that there probably is something to that because there is,

913
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:04,820
I mean, for sure other hormones are involved. Like we know for sure there are other hormones

914
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:09,780
involved. So look at cortisol, for example, inflammation is difficult because there's so

915
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:14,340
many different mediators, right? You can have TNF, you can have IL-2, you can have all kinds of

916
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:20,020
inflammatory mediators, endotoxin and stuff. But there are for sure other hormones that

917
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:25,460
make it really are very important, like cortisol. So you give cortisol, people gain weight, right?

918
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:31,060
It's not as much as with insulin, but you give prednisone and we've all done it. You give

919
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:35,220
prednisone, you gain weight. When you take away the prednisone, like they finish their course of

920
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:40,980
prednisone, that weight kind of goes back down. So we know that cortisol, for example, has a huge

921
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:48,420
impact on body fatness. For example, we know the studies from sleep. If you get good sleep,

922
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:53,380
you're more likely to be a good weight. If you are sleep deprived, for example,

923
01:25:54,100 --> 01:26:00,340
it's a stressful situation where cortisol is going to go up, then you're more likely to gain weight.

924
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:04,900
So that's not an insulin thing, it's a cortisol thing. And we know for sure that sex hormones

925
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:10,740
have to play a role somewhere in there as well, because there are women who develop gestational

926
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:16,660
diabetes and their insulin, their diets, they don't change. The difference is they got pregnant,

927
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:21,540
right? And that's a difference in sex hormones. And somehow that impacts, and I actually don't

928
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:27,940
know how this works, but somehow it does impact the response of, I'm not sure they're hyperinsulinemic

929
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:33,300
either. I think there must be something completely different about that entire thing, but it's not as

930
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:39,300
common. So I don't think about it as much. Or girls and boys at puberty, for example, the difference

931
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:46,180
of girls and boys is testosterone versus estrogen for the most part. It's not an insulin difference,

932
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:51,300
yet girls who go through puberty have way more fat than boys who get more muscle. So we know

933
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:57,700
that there are other hormones that clearly impact. So it's not just about insulin, but it's about

934
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:02,980
cortisol, it's about sex hormones. And I think inflammation probably comes in there somewhere,

935
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:07,940
but what to do about it? And it's a lot messier. Inflammation is a lot messier than thinking about

936
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:12,020
cortisol, for example, right? Where you can measure levels and you can think about up or down,

937
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:18,580
you know, cortisol, for example, you have the too much, which is Cushing's disease, and what's the

938
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:23,220
sort of hallmark? Well, obesity, and then you can get too little, too little cortisol is Addison's

939
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,860
disease. And what's the hallmark? Weight loss, right? So again, very, very clear. It's easy to

940
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:32,580
measure inflammation. It's just so hard. It's just too many moving parts for me.

941
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:38,900
I think this whole thing is too hard for me, but let's talk a little bit also about the role of

942
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:46,100
hyperinsulinemia specifically on the vascular system. What is it about hyperinsulinemia

943
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:53,380
and the endothelium or the capillaries that seems to wreak havoc beyond what tends to

944
01:27:53,380 --> 01:28:01,380
accompany late stages of it, which is hyperglycemia, which of course has significant damage mechanically

945
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:07,620
on the microvascular system. But what about, like for example, why would hyperinsulinemia

946
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:15,060
exacerbate coronary artery disease, absent abnormal glucose levels, or even once corrected

947
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,700
for lipid levels, which I, you know, that observation exists, right? You can take patients

948
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:25,540
that have the same lipid levels, the same glucose levels, but the hyperinsulinemic patient is going

949
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:32,340
to have worse cardiovascular disease. Why is that? For that specifically, I don't know. I think that

950
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,180
there's a lot more work because a lot of people still don't think about it as a disease of

951
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:41,780
hyperinsulinemia. But I think of it generally in terms of two things. So I think about two things,

952
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:45,940
like cardiovascular disease a lot and cancer, because those are actually the two top killers

953
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:52,820
of Americans is CVE disease and cancer. And they're both to me diseases of too much growth.

954
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:58,340
That is, everybody thinks growth is good, but growth in adults is generally bad. Like you don't

955
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:04,660
want to grow. Once you reach adult size, your liver doesn't grow, your kidney doesn't grow,

956
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:09,620
you shouldn't be growing. And if you are growing, it's generally bad. So if you gain weight,

957
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:13,300
you're obesity gain fat, that's a disease of too much growth. If you have a big fat liver,

958
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:17,780
that's too much growth. If you have all this excess protein in your brain that's blocking

959
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:22,340
your signals, and that's Alzheimer's disease, that's bad. And it's the same thing, cancer,

960
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:29,460
disease of excessive growth. In the blood vessels, we know that there's excessive growth, right? It's

961
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:35,940
not a matter. And this whole idea of fat or cholesterol clogging your arteries like a pipe,

962
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:40,340
it's super like even when I was in medical school, we knew that was not the case.

963
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:46,820
We know it's a response to injury. That's why you get it at bifurcation points, for example,

964
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:52,500
and you get smooth muscle proliferation. And then the foam cells which go in and it's not clear

965
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,300
whether the foam cells and all that is a response to the injury. But it's because of that whole

966
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:04,260
cascade, the atherogenic cascade, it's a response to injury, but you get excess proliferation of

967
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:09,940
certain things including smooth muscle cells and so on. But to me, it's just the disease of too

968
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:16,500
much growth that's eventually building and collapsed and closing off that artery. And this

969
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:24,820
is where diseases of too much growth is linked very tightly to insulin, because insulin is a

970
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:30,340
growth factor. I mean, this is one of the things that is super exciting in cancer, I'll tell you,

971
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:38,340
like the whole PI3K thing, because it directly links insulin, which we all think about in terms

972
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:46,820
of metabolism, to growth. Every single time that you have a nutrient sensor like insulin like mTOR

973
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:54,260
like AMPK, it's the same insulin, the pathway that it goes through, which goes through PI3K and then

974
01:30:54,500 --> 01:31:04,340
MAPK and AKT, is it influences growth, increases growth. And that to me is one of the big problems

975
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:09,380
with insulin all the time, is that you're telling your body to grow all the time when it really

976
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:14,420
shouldn't be growing all the time. So you actually have to decrease growth if the problem is too

977
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:20,660
much growth, you want less growth. And one of the things that you want to influence is insulin and

978
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:26,340
mTOR. mTOR, I know you talk a lot about mTOR, it's the same, exactly the same. It's a nutrient

979
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:34,020
sensor at heart, it's very sensitive to dietary protein. And what it does is if there's a lot of

980
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:41,380
protein, you turn on all these cell proliferation signals, when you have very little protein, what

981
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:49,380
happens? It's ophagy. It's like, oh, okay, so you have to realize that metabolism and growth are

982
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:54,980
exactly the same thing and it has even more implication for cancer, which is a disease of

983
01:31:54,980 --> 01:32:01,060
too much growth. So being obese, for example, it doesn't give you cancer, but it certainly

984
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:07,380
increases your risk of breast and colon cancer by a whole lot. There are 13 cancers that are listed

985
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:12,260
as obesity related. And we know that there's a very strong relationship between type 2 diabetes,

986
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:18,100
even without the obesity, but because they're hyperinsulinemic, there's a very strong relationship

987
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:23,300
between type 2 diabetes and breast cancer, for example. So to me, those are all diseases of

988
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:29,540
excessive growth. And therefore, you have to start looking at growth pathways, which actually are the

989
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:38,100
exact same as metabolic pathways, which is insulin, mTOR, AMPK, which is important, of course, for

990
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:44,660
metformin. And then all of a sudden you see, hey, all of these times that you can decrease nutrient

991
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:52,340
sensors, that is, decrease mTOR, decrease insulin, increase AMPK, you're getting good effects for

992
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:57,460
longevity. This is fascinating. Yeah, yeah. And it's so funny you say this, Jason. So this past

993
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:02,420
week I was in Boston and I was meeting with a number of folks. And one of the folks I was meeting

994
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:07,300
with wrote a paper, a very interesting paper in 2006. I was not aware of it at the time.

995
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:13,780
He wrote a theoretical paper. So it was a paper that got rejected by virtually every journal out

996
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:20,580
there. But in 2006, he proposed theoretically that rapamycin would be a great longevity drug.

997
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:26,900
Now, today we'd say, well, that's obvious, but it's important to note that the first trial

998
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:33,140
demonstrating the immense power of rapamycin to promote longevity was not published until 2009,

999
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:39,700
three years after this paper was written. And what he said was, based on all of the evidence

1000
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:47,300
he had examined to date of the use of rapamycin, even in patients with transplant, it's anti-proliferative

1001
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:53,060
properties alone speak to this. And it's so funny to hear you say what you just said, because he said

1002
01:33:53,060 --> 01:34:00,820
the exact same thing. He said, think about it, Peter, every chronic disease is some amount of

1003
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:09,140
hyperproliferation, hypergrowth. And you have a drug here that in the most elegant way, in the least

1004
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:15,460
toxic way, in the most specific way, targets one of the most important regulators of growth.

1005
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:20,100
His prediction was this is going to be the most important longevity drug there is. And

1006
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:26,420
I would agree with that. In 2019, I think that there is no more promising agent than rapamycin

1007
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:30,980
for longevity. But again, it comes back to this growth thing. And to put another bow on what you

1008
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:37,860
said, it was certainly lost on me in medical school, how anabolic insulin is. In fact, I remember

1009
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:42,900
learning many years later that bodybuilders used insulin. And I remember thinking,

1010
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:47,460
oh, that's odd. I wonder why. And of course, after speaking to some bodybuilders,

1011
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:53,300
you know, I got to learn, well, look, testosterone is anabolic, but insulin is even more anabolic.

1012
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:59,060
Now, you can't go overboard. And this is where these hormones are very sophisticated, because

1013
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:06,980
testosterone is very anabolic to muscle, which insulin is as well. But testosterone is catabolic

1014
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:15,940
to fat, whereas insulin is anabolic to fat and anabolic to muscle. Cortisol, just to bring it

1015
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:21,780
full circle, is the worst of both worlds. Hypercortoselemia is catabolic to muscle,

1016
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:27,140
while anabolic to fat. I usually end up drawing this picture for patients on the whiteboard,

1017
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:32,660
showing estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, insulin, and then, you know, you draw a muscle cell,

1018
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:38,420
a fat cell. And it very quickly starts to paint the picture that says, this whole thing is just

1019
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:44,340
endocrinology. I mean, all of this comes down to how can you manipulate these hormones to the

1020
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:49,780
desired outcome, nutrition being one tool, but exercise, the use of hormones themselves,

1021
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:54,340
of course, in cases where there's deficiencies being another way to do it. So it's a very

1022
01:35:54,340 --> 01:36:00,100
interesting way to sort of frame this as the things that we care most about avoiding,

1023
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:06,340
if you really look closely involve some measure of hyperproliferation and growth.

1024
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:11,540
Yeah, because that's the chronic diseases today, because there's been a huge shift in the diseases

1025
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:16,260
that we treat. So if you go back 50 years, 100 years, you're talking about treatment of infectious

1026
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:21,140
diseases, right? Hepatitis virus and pneumonia and diarrhea and all this sort of stuff.

1027
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:27,380
And we did great. We developed all these great drugs, antibiotics, antivirals, like,

1028
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:32,660
like really, really good stuff. And they haven't been as big a problem. Now we have a problem with

1029
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:38,020
resistance, of course, which is actually the same thing. Interestingly enough, I think there's a huge

1030
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:45,460
parallel between antibiotic resistance and insulin resistance. And in that they're the same thing.

1031
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:52,020
Antibiotic resistance is not caused by some phantom things caused by using too much antibiotic.

1032
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:58,020
Insulin resistance is the same thing. It's caused by too much insulin. So you have almost the same

1033
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,500
thing where antibiotic resistance is caused by too much antibiotics. And we try and treat it by using

1034
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,740
even more antibiotics, right, to overcome that resistance, which is the dumbest thing you can do.

1035
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,780
In insulin, we have insulin resistance, we treat it with more insulin, which is what caused in the

1036
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,860
first place. And then things get worse. And we don't understand why. So you know that treating

1037
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:21,220
antibiotic resistance is about using less same with insulin, you got to use less. But anyway,

1038
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:26,420
we shifted from using from treating these diseases, which are infectious diseases to

1039
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:32,020
these chronic diseases, but we never changed our paradigm of medicine, which is the paradigm was

1040
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:36,180
you come into me as a doctor, I give you a pill and antibiotic and you get better.

1041
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:41,620
Then people came in with these diseases like diabetes and obesity and the related diseases

1042
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:47,940
of hyperproliferation, or I call them diseases of too much growth, cardiovascular disease and cancer,

1043
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:52,500
and all this other stuff, too. Like it's all about fibrosis, right, which in the end is just

1044
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:58,260
about you revving the system too hard. But it's basically hyperproliferation. And then we said,

1045
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:04,020
let me give you a pill. It's like, that's totally the wrong thing. Because you don't have that pill

1046
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:11,620
to decrease proliferation. Rapamycin might be one, but rapamycin to me is limited because you've got

1047
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:17,940
not one problem. You don't have one nutrient sensor, you have three nutrient sensors, you have

1048
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:25,460
insulin, you have mTOR, and you have AMPK. It's a very sophisticated system. Look, insulin responds

1049
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:32,100
to dietary carbohydrates and dietary proteins. mTOR responds mostly to dietary protein. AMPK

1050
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:38,420
is actually like a, you know, measures the ATP, the AMP ATP ratio. So it actually doesn't care

1051
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:44,980
what you eat, it just cares about the cellular energy availability. So they're all three measuring

1052
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:50,340
different sort of things. And they all work on different timescales. So insulin goes up and down

1053
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:57,300
within minutes, it's gone within hours. mTOR is sort of up and down between 18 and 30 hours. And

1054
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:02,340
AMPK is sort of days to weeks. So you have such a sophisticated system because you have three

1055
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,340
nutrient sensors that are giving you different information based on your diet and also based on

1056
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:12,900
your time scale. So your body actually gets such incredible information just by integrating which

1057
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:17,780
one is up and which one is down. But rapamycin only affects the one. Whereas some things like

1058
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:24,660
intermittent fasting is going to decrease your insulin, it's going to decrease your mTOR and

1059
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:31,700
increase your AMPK, which is all three things that you need to do in order to sort of decrease

1060
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:37,940
proliferation. Because you know that all three of them, insulin feeds into mTOR and AMPK also feeds

1061
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:44,020
in, they're all part of that same thing. You're affecting three different parts of that pathway

1062
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:48,820
as opposed to one. And that is going to give you the best bang for your buck. And it's free and

1063
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:55,220
you can do it anytime you want. And it's like, oh, hey, they told people this 2000 years ago, right,

1064
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:59,540
when all the religion said, oh, you should fast and you should do this and you should do that,

1065
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:05,860
which is to me, this sort of just incredible that it all comes sort of back to what we knew

1066
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:12,100
2000 years ago, which is that, hey, fasting every so often has incredible benefits because you're

1067
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:18,100
going to be able to affect those diseases of excessive growth. Let's pivot to this now. Let's

1068
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:24,020
talk about fasting. You and I are certainly two folks that are no strangers to this. Anyone who's

1069
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:29,140
been cared for by you or anyone who's been cared for by me pretty much is used to the same drum beat,

1070
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:32,820
which is, I mean, I don't actually, I'd like to hear about how you do it in our practice.

1071
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:36,500
You know, generally for the first year, we don't push too hard on the fasting thread,

1072
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:40,900
but boy, by the end of that first year and into their second year with us,

1073
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:45,940
we're really having a hard discussion about this in some cases for patients that are resistant. Now,

1074
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:49,620
I have this sort of framework that I think about for fasting, which is you start out on this sort

1075
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:54,740
of crappy standard American diet. And how do you escape that gravitational pull of that horrible

1076
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:59,460
thing? I'll be sensitive and call it the standard crappy diet, the Canadian crappy diet or whatever

1077
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:06,420
as well. They're comparable. To me, the two easiest ways to help patients escape the gravitational

1078
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:13,460
pull of pure garbage is time restricted feeding and or some measure of dietary restriction. So

1079
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:19,700
the way that I explain that is time restricted feeding says ostensibly you don't restrict what

1080
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:24,980
a person eats. You just restrict when they eat and nor do you restrict how much for that matter,

1081
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:29,620
but you just put a feeding window on and you say, look for 16 or 18 hours a day, you'll consume

1082
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:35,220
nothing and you will eat ad libitum in the remainder of that period of time. And you contrast

1083
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:39,780
that with dietary restriction, which we've already alluded to carbohydrate restriction as a form of

1084
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:44,820
dietary restriction. And it can come with and without caloric restriction, but the simplest

1085
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:49,140
way to execute it would be to say, look, no restriction on when you eat, no restriction

1086
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:53,140
on how much you eat. You just can't eat these foods. And that's sort of where the majority of

1087
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:57,940
the diet wars live is, are you a vegetarian? Are you vegan? Are you on a low fat diet, a

1088
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:03,060
Mediterranean diet, a paleo diet, a low carb diet, a ketogenic diet? They're all forms of dietary

1089
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:09,060
restriction. And to my knowledge, I'm not aware of one of them that is not significantly better than

1090
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:14,980
just being on the standard American diet. So that speaks probably less to their individual efficacy

1091
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:22,580
and more to the abject misery, metabolically, that is being exerted on people. Before we get

1092
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:26,980
into fasting, let's get everybody really dialed in on those two things, time restricted feeding,

1093
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:34,420
plus or minus dietary restriction. How do you visit those two things before we get into fasting?

1094
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:41,540
I focus a lot more on the fasting. So I've always said, yeah, it comes down to the when you eat and

1095
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:46,820
what you eat. And this was the thing that I sort of pointed out years ago, like three,

1096
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:53,780
four years ago, which the everybody focuses so hard on the what to eat. And nobody talks like

1097
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:59,940
ever about the when to eat. That is, there is a sort of consensus. It was never intentional

1098
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:03,540
that we should eat all the time, right? You should eat six or eight times a day, you should grace

1099
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:08,740
throughout the day. And you know, there's all sorts of reasons that were made up to suggest why we

1100
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:14,100
should be eating six times a day. But there was never any science, right? So, you know, if you ever

1101
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,660
look back and say, Hey, where did we get this idea that we should eat six or eight times a day,

1102
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:22,820
it's like from nowhere, somebody made it up, it stuck. And that was about it, right? It didn't,

1103
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:26,900
there was no studies, there was no randomized control trials, there's nothing. Somebody just

1104
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:31,540
thought it was a great idea. And a few years ago, I said the same thing, which is that, hey,

1105
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:36,980
we're sort of missing half of the problem. Because if it's two problems, when to eat and what to eat,

1106
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:40,980
and you're nobody's talking about when to eat, then you're not going to succeed, no matter what

1107
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:46,180
you do. And that this is why there's this sort of diet wars. I wasn't that interested in getting

1108
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:52,260
into that. I was like, more, hey, let's look at this whole other problem. So what we do generally

1109
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:59,540
is start with that, because it's a lot easier to change the frequency, as opposed to what it is

1110
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:04,020
they're actually eating. And this just comes from experience. So the first thing I did when I started

1111
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:08,900
really focusing in on diet was try and change people's diet. But I did it from a clinical

1112
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:14,340
standpoint, that is, I'm not seeing one person sort of for an hour every week, I have a clinical

1113
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:19,860
practice, which means you get like 10 minutes, like every three months. So it has to be something

1114
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:27,620
that is sort of easy to understand, and super effective, as opposed to sort of counting

1115
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:33,300
carbohydrates or something, which takes a long time to explain to somebody and then explain

1116
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:39,540
why eating fat's not that bad for you and so on. I needed something that was sort of much more

1117
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:45,060
efficient in that way. And that's why we started using fasting quite a lot, because it's something

1118
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:49,940
that people sort of understood. You can explain it within the 10 minutes, and then you can follow

1119
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:56,340
up with them and see if they're eating and they know sort of what it means to be fasting, as opposed

1120
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,580
to some of these people who really didn't have any idea what a low carb diet really meant. And that

1121
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:05,700
was the issue. Tell the story again. I remember last year you were telling me a funny story about,

1122
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:10,580
and I don't remember what the ethnicity was, and the point was not to poke fun at one ethnicity or

1123
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:16,980
other. It was just like within this culture to say don't eat carbs meant, oh, okay, well, I won't eat

1124
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:21,220
bread or pasta, but I'm still going to eat lots of noodles and lots of this and lots of that. And

1125
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,420
they came back in and you said, how is the carbohydrate restriction going? And they said,

1126
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:29,940
oh, it's fantastic, Dr. Fung. I'm doing so well. Great. What are you eating? And it was like all

1127
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:34,740
carbs. It was just different carbs. And that was, I remember you describing that being sort of an aha

1128
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:41,300
moment of culturally, it can be very difficult to get people to restrict carbohydrates.

1129
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,580
Yeah, because it's their traditional food. So I get half a lot of Asians, so both East Asians and

1130
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:53,060
South Asians. And of course the diet is based on rice and rice noodles. And for the South Asians,

1131
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:58,340
it's rice again. So there's a lot of cultural difficulty, which is why it was very difficult

1132
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:04,500
to sort of push too hard on it. You can if you make enough of an effort. And I think that message

1133
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:09,780
anyway is getting across that eating all these carbs are not great for you. These refined carbs.

1134
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:14,260
But the point was that you have to still come up with something. And this is where the practical

1135
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:19,940
experience sort of comes in. Like you can't just say, okay, well, I'm just going to stick with carb

1136
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:26,660
restriction, right? I'm going to put these Chinese and Filipino and South Asian Sri Lankan people on

1137
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:32,740
no rice, no noodles, ketogenic diet. They might say yes, but they actually won't do anything to

1138
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:36,740
you know, to follow it because it's just so difficult, right? Their culture is like that.

1139
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:41,700
They've been eating this way for 70 years, and it's very hard for them to change. And their family

1140
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:48,020
eats like this. So it's like, what are you going to do as opposed to fasting, which to me was a much

1141
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:53,700
simpler idea that was already embedded in every culture. So you talk to Muslims about and they're

1142
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:58,820
all like, ah, I know what you're talking about. And you talk to Catholics and you talk to, you know,

1143
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:02,340
Jewish people like they will go, ah, this is a Greek Orthodox or whatever. And they're all like,

1144
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:08,820
ah, and the Buddhists were like, ah, so it was way easier just from a practical standpoint. That was

1145
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:14,500
where I started using it. And then I saw like these crazy, like crazy good, like results. It was like

1146
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:21,380
insane. So we wrote a case report that was published in BMJ case reports. It was three patients who

1147
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:27,620
had like sort of 20 to 25 years of type two diabetes and like five years of insulin on big,

1148
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:32,740
big doses of insulin. We told them about low carb diets, but you know, we don't spend a lot of time,

1149
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:37,540
but we put on 24 hours of fasting three times a week, which is like a one meal a day, right?

1150
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:43,860
Nothing too strenuous or anything. We got off all their insulin like between five and 18 days. It

1151
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:48,900
was ridiculous how quickly they responded. And years later, we still have people who are like

1152
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:53,860
non diabetic. They went from 20 years of diabetes to non-diabetic and have maintained it for the

1153
01:47:53,860 --> 01:48:00,500
last six years. It was ridiculous how good like, I just couldn't believe the results that we're

1154
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,300
getting. And that's when we were like, okay, let's tell people and let's start writing about it and

1155
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:10,100
all this sort of stuff. And it took ages to get that. It took like two, three years to get that

1156
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:16,180
case series published. You alluded to bariatric surgery earlier. And about five years ago,

1157
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:24,740
I was involved in an effort to do a clinical trial to try to tease apart the observation you

1158
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:32,260
alluded to, which was that when you take a patient with type two diabetes, who undergoes bariatric

1159
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:37,060
surgery at the time, I believe this was true primarily for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

1160
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:43,220
So for the listener, that's a surgical procedure where the part of the bowel that comes out of the

1161
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:48,660
stomach, which is called the jejunum is the first part after the duodenum. You cut a piece and then

1162
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:55,620
reattach it as a piece of a Y and then bring it up such that you are basically bypassing not just

1163
01:48:55,620 --> 01:49:00,820
significant parts of the volume of the stomach as a reservoir, but also the initial part of the

1164
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:06,820
duodenum and the jejunum. The observation was the following. You do this operation on a patient

1165
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:12,260
within about 10 days. They haven't lost a meaningful amount of weight, but all of a sudden

1166
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:17,620
they don't need insulin anymore. And very quickly, their diabetes resolves. In fact,

1167
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:25,620
I believe we are still at a point, although this may be changing, where the only treatment that is

1168
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:32,820
viewed by an insurance company to actually reverse type two diabetes is bariatric surgery.

1169
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:38,180
So the question we were trying to ask was how would you design a clinical trial to parse out

1170
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:44,420
how much of that is due to the change in the internal architecture? Is there something

1171
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:51,700
problematic about the duodenum of that patient? How much of that is due to the change in the

1172
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:56,580
nutrition of the patient? Because a patient who undergoes a gastric bypass has to make significant

1173
01:49:56,580 --> 01:50:03,620
changes in their nutrition. And how much of that is due to the perioperative period of caloric

1174
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:11,060
restriction? So what's your take on those patients, which again, pretty profound results.

1175
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:14,740
Again, not that profound. I think when you consider them in the context of what we now talk

1176
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:20,340
about with what fasting can do, but what's your take on that? My take is that the fasting does

1177
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:26,740
everything. So you can actually get, I think exactly the same results if you simply didn't

1178
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:31,940
feed them for 14 days or something like that. Because the thing is that when we do this for

1179
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:37,620
people, when you put people on a seven or 14 day fast, we see this, we don't do it a lot because

1180
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:43,460
generally they're older. So we want to be a little bit more sort of regimented. And there's also

1181
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:48,980
these cases of latent onset type one and so on. But you actually see exactly the same thing where

1182
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:54,420
the diabetes complete results. And the thing about it is that you can understand it perfectly

1183
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:59,700
by understanding this sort of overflow paradigm. Because what you're doing, of course, is dropping

1184
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:06,180
insulin levels very low. And then you're forcing the body after the first 24 hours, glycogen runs

1185
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:13,540
out. So now you're going into a period where your body is going to have to metabolize fat for energy.

1186
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:19,140
So the first place it's going to start pulling it out of is going to be the internal organs,

1187
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:23,060
because it's right there. The liver is going to be the first place that it's going to start pulling

1188
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:29,140
the fat out of. And if you look at Royce Taylor's data, what you see is that the liver fat starts

1189
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:33,700
to go down right away. The insulin resistance starts to go down right away because that's the

1190
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:38,340
problem, right? It's this big fatty liver, which you can't shove any more glucose in. That's what

1191
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:44,020
insulin resistance is. As this big fatty liver goes down, just like emptying your suitcase,

1192
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:50,660
the insulin resistance starts to melt away. And slower, because he showed this incredible data,

1193
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:57,220
which looked at pancreatic function with ultra low diet. It wasn't fasting, but it is an ultra low

1194
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:02,740
calorie diet. You can start to see that the pancreatic fat starts to go down because the

1195
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:08,100
body's not pumping out. Your liver's not pumping out fat and dumping it in your pancreas. And as

1196
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:14,100
you get rid of that pancreatic fat, you're unclogging the pancreas and you're producing enough insulin

1197
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:19,380
that you don't get the hyperglycemia anymore. Your glucose isn't that high because now you're

1198
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:24,740
at a stage where insulin production is going to go up because they measured that in Royce Taylor's

1199
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:30,420
Counterpoint Study, the one from UK. And you can see that the first phase insulin response starts

1200
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:35,300
to go up. It takes a few weeks, but that's exactly what you see clinically. That is, before you lose

1201
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:41,460
the weight, which is all a lot of sort of subcutaneous fat, you're getting rid of the visceral fat,

1202
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:46,660
the fat around the organs, which is the heart of the matter. The insulin resistance is fatty liver,

1203
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:51,860
the beta cell failure is fatty pancreas. You're getting rid of that first. And that's why that

1204
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:59,060
diabetes goes away so quickly before you see significant weight loss. So the whole pathophysiology

1205
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:04,180
makes sense to me. And to me, I call it medical bariatrics. Fasting is what I call medical

1206
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:08,340
bariatrics. You get all the benefits of bariatric surgery without doing any surgery because you can

1207
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:13,940
get almost everything the same. Like obviously, it's a lot more, you know, you have to do it.

1208
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:19,620
The compliance with bariatric surgery is easier than the compliance with fasting. I guess for me,

1209
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:24,500
I don't know, I still entertain the notion that there may be more than one way to skin this cat,

1210
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:29,780
and that I think bariatric surgery is probably a great example of putting three things in place.

1211
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:36,180
I've actually seen data that look at making no change to a patient other than altering the

1212
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:44,100
morphology of the duodenum, and that improves type 2 diabetes, which again, if you bypass the duodenum,

1213
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:48,580
you would bypass what that problem is there. So because, you know, the thing with the bariatric

1214
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:54,900
surgery patients is they're not fasting for that long, right? They're going to have fasted for

1215
01:53:55,780 --> 01:54:03,540
12 to 18 hours before surgery. And nowadays, those patients are dripping in liquids that are

1216
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:09,700
caloric, even the day of or the day after surgery. So they might have a 24 hour fast,

1217
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:16,100
but there's no question that their caloric intake is lower during that first three or four days.

1218
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:21,780
But remember that you've got the malabsorption too, right? So the Roux-en-Y is both restrictive

1219
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:27,780
and malabsorptive, right? That is not only do you restrict how much they can eat, the amount they

1220
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:32,420
eat doesn't all get absorbed. And that's why I get dumping syndrome and so on. I agree with you.

1221
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:36,020
That's a good point. It's hard to do it based on just how much they're eating. I mean,

1222
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:40,580
technically, we don't know how much they're absorbing. I like your term, right? Which is,

1223
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:44,340
look, let's just refer to this as medical bariatrics, and it's super potent.

1224
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:50,340
When you have purely restrictive things like the lap band, it's like, boy, those things didn't

1225
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:55,620
work at all, right? We thought they'd be great lap bands, purely restrictive, easy to put in,

1226
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:01,380
and so on. And it's like, yeah, you look at the numbers of people and they're just dropping.

1227
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:07,300
My friend who is a surgeon says, yeah, he used to put in lots of lap bands. He says, now,

1228
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:12,260
the most common procedure I do is removal of lap bands because everybody wants to get rid of them

1229
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:16,500
because the pure restriction didn't work because they're dripping in. They're drinking sodas and

1230
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:20,820
they're drinking milkshakes and stuff, and they're not getting the malabsorptive part, which is that

1231
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:25,380
rue on Y, and therefore that was the problem. But I agree with you. I'm not against bariatric

1232
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:32,020
surgery. I just think that as a sort of solution for everybody, it's a much more difficult problem

1233
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:37,780
because there's a lot of expenses. There's a lot of expertise as opposed to the sort of easy thing,

1234
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:43,780
which is, hey, everybody can do fasting. It's just a matter of spreading knowledge and making

1235
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:49,540
it easy, right? It's not that people can't fast. It's that people tell them they shouldn't fast,

1236
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:55,140
right? Like if you go and look at Ramadan or something like that, right? People can fast.

1237
01:55:55,140 --> 01:56:02,740
If it's the norm or Lent or the orthodox, if you look at what the norm is, people can follow that.

1238
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:06,900
It's just that the norm is so far off. We tell our kids, oh, hey, you got to have a snack. You got to

1239
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:11,940
have a, you know, you have kids, right? It's like after school, it's a snack. Like you get a,

1240
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:16,420
you know, the other day I got a thing home saying, oh, your son is going on a trip,

1241
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:20,580
but don't worry. We're going to give him lots of snacks. I'm like, oh, like, why,

1242
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:26,180
why did you need to do that? Right? Or, you know, you send your kids to play soccer,

1243
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:32,180
which I do, right? I did net they don't anymore. And it's like, somehow, everybody thinks that

1244
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:37,060
between the halves of soccer, the parents were taking turns bringing snacks. It's like,

1245
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:42,340
you don't need to give them juice and cookies in between halves of soccer. Just let them play the

1246
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,620
game. The game is fun, right? But it's, it's this culture where it says you must eat all the time.

1247
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:53,300
This skipping breakfast is perfect example. Oh, as soon as you get up, you got to start putting

1248
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:58,020
muffins in your mouth. Otherwise you're going to die, right? You're going to die of heart attack.

1249
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:03,780
Like what the hell? Did you see the publication a couple of weeks ago that suggested that

1250
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:09,140
people who skipped breakfast had a higher cardiac mortality? Yeah, that's what I was referring to.

1251
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:13,220
It's like, Oh my God, what's your explanation for that study? I'm sure you've been asked about it a

1252
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:18,980
dozen times. Because these nutritional epidemiology studies are so dangerous, right? It's because

1253
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:24,740
those people, if you tell everybody that you have to eat breakfast, then you're going to select a

1254
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:28,500
group of people who don't listen to you, right? And they're going to be unhealthier. They're

1255
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,420
unhealthier in a lot of ways you can't measure. You can measure smoking, you can measure this,

1256
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:37,380
but there's so many things that you can't measure that are going to influence why those people who

1257
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:43,460
skip breakfast are more likely to have heart attacks. That association may exist, but it's

1258
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:47,700
not causal. And that's, that's the thing, right? It's a correlation, not a causation. And it's a

1259
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:53,060
very dangerous assumption to say that, Hey, you can eat breakfast and now prevent heart attacks,

1260
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:57,940
because that's what gets out into the press. Put a muffin in your mouth as soon as you wake up and

1261
01:57:57,940 --> 01:58:02,260
you'll have less heart disease. That's not what the study shows, but that's the implication that

1262
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:07,460
always comes out in the press. My issue with these studies, some of yours, I suppose, is that

1263
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:12,500
there's a non-healthy user bias to a lot of these. So the, one of the more obvious examples of the

1264
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:17,940
studies that suggest that diet sodas are, you know, worse for you than sodas. But of course,

1265
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,260
it misses a very obvious or clear thing that, you know, might be missing, which is who are the

1266
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:26,660
patients who are going to disproportionately consume diet sodas. You know, certainly a subset

1267
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:30,020
of them might be people who are more health conscious and say, well, if I want a soda,

1268
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:35,460
I'd rather it be diet than not. But it's more often that people who are being told, look,

1269
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:40,100
you can't have a regular soda. And so therefore you're selecting for less healthy patients.

1270
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:44,260
That is my interpretation of that study. Now, while we're on that topic,

1271
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:51,620
do you think there are clinical benefits from a 16-8, just to use that example,

1272
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:55,540
time restricted feeding pattern? So if you, if you said to a patient who came in to see you,

1273
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:02,100
I want you to only eat between noon and 8 p.m., nothing outside of that,

1274
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:07,220
but you don't make any other change. Do you see them get better?

1275
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:13,860
We do. So I think that you would do better if you fix what they eat inside that eight hours too.

1276
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:20,180
But if you take their diet and just squish it into eight hours, I think that, like we see people

1277
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:25,140
get better. Like we see people change a lot because as I said, we did sort of one meal a day

1278
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:29,780
where we squish it even further. And those people basically, they didn't even change their diet that

1279
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,700
much. We talked to them about it, but we didn't focus a lot on it. And if you actually probably

1280
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:39,060
were to ask them, my guess is their diet didn't change a huge amount. But just by squishing the

1281
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:44,900
time that you're eating, you're sort of forcing people away. And I think part of the issue is that

1282
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:52,100
in the old days, like in the seventies, what you had was a fairly lengthy fasting period anyway.

1283
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:56,740
That's why you have the term breakfast, right? So you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and you eat breakfast at

1284
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:02,180
8 a.m. It's 14 hours of fasting as your baseline, right? And that's every day without even thinking

1285
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:07,060
about it. Now it's kind of spread, right? Sachin Panda has done all these studies about how long

1286
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,380
people actually eat. And it's like, you know, constantly the minute they wake up to the

1287
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:16,180
mini gutter bed, it's almost 15 hours a day that people are eating. I think that's gotten so bad

1288
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:22,340
that when you squish it back to a normal sort of 16, eight sort of thing, because 14 hours and 16

1289
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:27,380
hours, like 14 hours was sort of baseline in the seventies and 16 is just a little bit. But because

1290
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:31,780
it's gotten so bad when you squish it back into that, we do see a lot of people who benefit just

1291
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:37,300
from that one intervention alone. And, you know, to me, it's always about practicalities. That is,

1292
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:42,420
is it easier? So if you have people, for example, say two strategies, one is counting carbs,

1293
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:47,700
which I think can work versus counting the number of hours that you don't eat. It's like, it's so

1294
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:53,540
much easier to tell people between 12 and eight, as you're eating window, everything else don't eat,

1295
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:59,620
versus look at everything that you eat in the day, try and calculate how many carbs it is,

1296
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:05,860
and add it up so that you have some arbitrary less than, right? Less than 120, less than 50,

1297
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:10,260
less than 20. It's so difficult, whether you're counting calories or whether you're counting

1298
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:16,740
carbohydrates or doing macros, right? It's just so difficult to do. It's so much easier to say

1299
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:22,260
things like only eat between this hour and this hour, and don't eat anything that came in a box

1300
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:27,860
kind of thing, right? Those, to me, that's practical, useful advice, as opposed to say,

1301
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:36,900
let's get your carbs from 55% to 40%. It's like, it's so difficult. It's just, and I'm not saying

1302
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:41,060
that it can't work. I think it can work. I just think it's so hard to implement when you're

1303
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:46,820
seeing patients sort of every few minutes, right? Like, how are you going to do that from a practical

1304
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:51,620
standpoint, right? It's not feasible. I completely agree. I mean, I think there is no simpler

1305
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:56,180
instruction than when to eat and when not to eat. And yeah, I think, you know, combining these things

1306
02:01:56,180 --> 02:02:00,980
can often be incredibly potent. I don't know. I've seen mixed results on 16.8, truthfully.

1307
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:06,900
I've seen some patients who have really significant improvement. I've seen other patients

1308
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:13,780
experience no improvement whatsoever. We typically will push that window tighter, 18.6, 22.2. Again,

1309
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:18,740
the tighter you push it, the more benefits you see, but I've really seen no substitute for

1310
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:25,460
what I call intermittent fasting. We use that terminology very distinctly. We reserve the term

1311
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:31,540
time restricted feeding for up to 24 hours of restriction, but we use the term intermittent

1312
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:38,020
fasting to describe what I think that term means, which is you intermittently, periodically, i.e.,

1313
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:46,980
fast. And fasting can be a complete reduction of calories or it can be a hypocaloric fast. So you

1314
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:54,740
can consume somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of your normal caloric requirement for a period of

1315
02:02:54,740 --> 02:03:00,900
time. Typically, look at three to seven days and you repeat that cycle. What type of protocols do

1316
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:06,660
you use for intermittent fasting with your patients? We use all of them. So because we're

1317
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:13,060
predominantly clinical, we'll individualize. So the things we take into account is one,

1318
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:19,700
how severe is it? So severe type 2 diabetic on a huge amount of insulin. We're going to give a

1319
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:25,620
more stringent schedule than somebody who's just sort of pre-diabetic and wants to sort of prevent

1320
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:30,820
it from getting into diabetes. So the other thing is how old they are and how willing they are to do

1321
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,820
it. So we see a lot of people who are in their 80s. We have people in the 80s doing like, you know,

1322
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:40,100
we had a lady who was like, I think she did 61 days, right? And she's not young, right? And we

1323
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:45,220
have people in the 80s, nothing. Yeah, that's what she said. Although sometimes when you actually go

1324
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:51,380
into it, sometimes they have little things here and there. But she said she did 61. We have lots

1325
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:55,780
of people who do long fast like that and they don't have any problems. We monitor them very

1326
02:03:55,780 --> 02:04:00,580
closely though, but generally we don't do that. There's no point taking that much risk a lot of

1327
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:05,940
times. She actually just felt good on it. So that's why she did it. But we don't usually push it long

1328
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:11,220
like that, but we will if we need to. But it depends on how quickly. So it's how severe is it,

1329
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:16,500
how old the patient is and how urgent it is because we have people who have a ton of disease,

1330
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:20,500
right? And we're like, if you don't get this diabetes fixed, like right now, you're going to

1331
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:25,860
be in a world of trouble. So we had this guy, he was actually in his 40s. He had a non-healing

1332
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:31,140
diabetic foot ulcer for like a year followed by a plastic surgeon. So he actually came into the

1333
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:36,820
hospital and I saw him because I was seeing him for his diabetic foot infection, gave him antibiotics.

1334
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:42,900
I said, you know, your problem is not your foot. Your problem is your diabetes, right? Because

1335
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:48,500
you know, the reason you have this foot ulcer is because of diabetes. You don't get foot ulcers

1336
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:53,620
if you're not diabetic, right? Unless you have severe PVD or something, right? But the point is

1337
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:58,340
that if it's diabetes was just causing your foot ulcer, you got to get rid of your diabetes. So I

1338
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:03,140
talked to his dad because this guy was like in his 40s and the dad was Greek Orthodox. So his dad was

1339
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:08,340
like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do this. So we put them on and we put them on fairly strict

1340
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:14,660
restriction. We started from, I think on a week of fasting and then 36 hours, three times a week.

1341
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:19,780
And that ulcer healed like within three weeks. It was like ridiculous how quick that thing

1342
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:26,660
just healed up. You led with a single week of fasting before cycling 36 hours weekly, or did

1343
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:32,340
you lead with the 36 hours? No, I started with the seven days and then we did like 36 hours because

1344
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:36,500
it was severe. Honestly, he was going to get his foot chopped off at some point.

1345
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:40,020
You're definitely more aggressive than I am because you're seeing much sicker patients.

1346
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:47,460
I never lead off with water only fasting for patients. Usually what we do is we go,

1347
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:52,020
we push the windows of time restriction, which as I said a moment ago, I'm not convinced there's

1348
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:56,580
huge benefit in time restriction. I think there's some benefit. I think the biggest benefit of time

1349
02:05:56,580 --> 02:06:01,700
restricted feeding is the psychological one. It's breaking the cycle you just described

1350
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:07,460
earlier, which is people think intravenous access to food is essential for life. If they

1351
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:11,940
go more than two hours without a meal, the sky is going to fall. And so in many ways,

1352
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:16,180
time restricted feeding is just a way to prove to them that that is total nonsense.

1353
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:19,220
I actually think that the long fasts do exactly the same thing.

1354
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:24,180
Well, yes, yes, yes, but you can't lead. I mean, at least for me, I haven't tried leading off with

1355
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:29,700
that. Talk me through that particular patient. So first of all, let's grant it that he now has

1356
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:35,620
agreed to try this. This is a patient who is not entering a fast the way I would enter a fast,

1357
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:41,060
which is I usually spend a week in ketosis before the fast, which means I'm showing up in a fast

1358
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:47,140
with a ketone level of somewhere between 0.5 and one millimolar of beta hydroxybutyrate.

1359
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:50,820
I sail generally pretty easily into these fasts, not all the time.

1360
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:57,620
This is a guy who's got a respiratory quotient of one. He is a completely

1361
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:05,700
obligate glycogen consumer. He's probably not oxidized a fatty acid since Guns and Roses were

1362
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:12,100
popular. This is a guy who's going to be in for a world of hurt when you strip food away from him,

1363
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:18,980
because within a few hours he's going to sense his liver will sense glycogen levels are low.

1364
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:22,980
It's time to eat. So how are you getting him through that?

1365
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:28,500
There's no easy way. We just tell him this is going to suck for a week because you're not going

1366
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:33,540
to feel that great. You're going to be hungry and all this sort of stuff. It was the urgency.

1367
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:38,980
I'll tell you that people actually can do it. Quite a lot of people have. We've done it on a

1368
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:44,420
number of people. Most of the people, as long as you warn them ahead of time that it's going to

1369
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:49,060
be tough, they get through it. But the thing is, the psychological, if you've done a week,

1370
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:55,460
you know that 24 hours is like nothing and you get into ketosis so fast because that's the fastest

1371
02:07:55,460 --> 02:08:00,820
way to get into ketosis. It's just too fast. There's no faster way you can do it than that.

1372
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:05,700
So it's not easy, but there's reasons why. That's why I say it's important that everything is

1373
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:11,940
individualized because I'd never do this to somebody who's like 40 and has an A1c of like 6.0.

1374
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:17,780
It's like, why put yourself through that? Do it gradually. You have no time restrictions.

1375
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:22,980
This is a guy who's actually coming into the hospital with diabetic foot ulcers that were

1376
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:29,380
getting close to osteomyelitis. It's a much different situation than not. I'm trying to

1377
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:34,020
make sure that somebody doesn't wind up getting a bad infection and somebody wind up chopping

1378
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:38,980
his foot off, which is why I was super aggressive in that case. I've heard stories of other people

1379
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:46,100
who have put patients on starting 10-day fast and so on. So they don't all do well. They don't all

1380
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:51,380
get through it, but it's an option. That's all I'll say. I hate to be prescriptive like,

1381
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:55,060
oh, you have to do this. You have to do this. This is what seeing patients does to you.

1382
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:59,860
I find that the people who are super dogmatic are the people who never see patients.

1383
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:02,580
Yeah, I can't agree with you more.

1384
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:07,780
Yeah, because patients always prove you're wrong. You think your stuff works. Well,

1385
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:14,180
like 40% of your patients it doesn't work in. So then I'm never like, oh, you have to do this.

1386
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:18,660
You have to do this because it's like, yeah, I know it doesn't work. Like carb restriction,

1387
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:23,780
like some people it really does work well. And some people it really doesn't work that well.

1388
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:27,700
And the study show the same thing, right? Chris Gardner's study. If you look at the splay between

1389
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:33,380
low fat and low carbs, some people do great on a low fat diet and some people do terribly on a

1390
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:38,820
low fat diet. It's the same diet. Same with the low carb. In general, the low carb people do better.

1391
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:43,380
But when you look at the individual differences, and that's why people get on,

1392
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:49,300
get on Twitter and they start talking about, Oh, it's all about this, or it's all this, all this.

1393
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:54,100
Then it's like, I know you don't treat people because if you actually treated people,

1394
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:59,220
you'd never say stuff like that. You'd never get on somebody about taking the opposite position

1395
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:03,780
because you've been proven wrong. So many like every day I'm proven wrong, like something doesn't

1396
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:07,700
work. And that's why I'm always like, let's do this. See if it works. If it doesn't work, we're

1397
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:11,460
going to adjust it. And then if it works better, then we're going to keep doing that and we'll

1398
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:16,020
adjust it. Right. And that's, that's where the kind of art of medicine comes in. So you can start,

1399
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:20,660
but to me, I always tell people like there's two options when you do fasting. You, it's like going

1400
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:28,260
into a pool you can wait in or you can cannonball and both are acceptable. One's a big shock to the

1401
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:33,140
system, but it works. And the other is not as big a shock and it still works for this particular

1402
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:38,180
patient. You know, that was one of the few few times because most of the time it's not that urgent

1403
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:42,900
that I did recommend, Oh, you just got to do this. And his father was on board and he was on board

1404
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:47,620
and we monitored him super closely. We actually started him in hospital because he happened to

1405
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:52,740
be in the hospital anyway. So I put him on clear fluids, right? And then just told him, don't take

1406
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:57,460
anything with sugar, just, just water. And, and, and he did very, very well. And I've done it to

1407
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:02,500
a few other people with diabetic foot ulcers as well, because I consider that one of the,

1408
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:06,660
the more difficult, like that's, that's something that you really have to take care of. And I always

1409
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:11,140
think diabetic foot ulcers to me is fascinating because it's like, if you think about this

1410
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:17,140
overflow paradigm, it's like, why do diabetics get these infections that nobody else gets? Why do you

1411
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:23,940
get mucomycosis? Why do you get osteomyelitis? Why do you get diabetic foot ulcers? You don't get like

1412
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:30,260
foot ulcers from ischemic cardiomyopathy foot ulcer, right? You don't get that ischemic cardiomyopathy

1413
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:35,540
or mycosis. It's like, it's because what you're doing is you're putting all this sugar into the

1414
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:41,940
body. Then when the blood glucose goes up, you give them insulin to really jam that sugar into

1415
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:46,900
the body, right? And the body takes it and your liver gets all this sugar and starts sending it

1416
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:52,500
all over the place. Pretty soon, your whole body is so full of sugar that everything just starts

1417
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:56,660
rotting. And that's why you get the kidney disease. That's why I get the eye disease. And that's why

1418
02:11:56,660 --> 02:12:02,340
the bugs just love it because there's so much sugar and nutrients everywhere. So they get in

1419
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:08,500
your foot and they never go away. Those foot ulcers never heal. You get these weird infections that

1420
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:13,140
you never see anywhere else. You get the, you know, the rashes, the anacanthosis and all that.

1421
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:18,180
It's just, you've got way too much sugar. It's all about the whole body sugar and not just the blood

1422
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:23,540
sugar. That's the real shift in thinking in paradigm that to me makes a lot of sense. And as

1423
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:28,740
soon as we're able to empty out all that sort of sugar, and I always use the analogy of a sugar

1424
02:12:28,740 --> 02:12:32,500
bowl, we're just filling up the sugar bowl, you got to empty that sugar bowl and then the sugar

1425
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:37,460
won't spill out. And that's why it works. And the fast thing is the same thing. So we'll individualize

1426
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:43,540
it. So based on all those sort of factors, like including what they want to do, right? You got to

1427
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:48,100
talk to people and say, what are you willing to do? Right? And a lot of people aren't willing to

1428
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:53,220
do a long fast, but a lot of people are actually, it's striking. What percentage of your patients

1429
02:12:53,860 --> 02:13:00,180
are willing to do a water only fast for at least a period of three days? Right off the bat, because

1430
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:05,380
we offer this as a treatment to everybody. We don't say, okay, well, if you've never heard of it,

1431
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:10,980
we'll still recommend it. And like 50% right off the bat won't do it. Any fasting at all, right?

1432
02:13:10,980 --> 02:13:17,060
They're so like ingrained. And I had this discussion yesterday with a fellow. I told him, oh, he needs

1433
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:22,260
to fast. He was, he was developing, you know, pro-nuria and he was going into renal failure. And

1434
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:26,420
I said, really, you need to fast. And he says, my endocrinologist says, I can't fast. No way.

1435
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:32,020
So it's like, okay, that's it right there. So 50% of people won't fast for any period of time

1436
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:38,500
at all. Like not even like five hours, right? So it's changing. I think views on fasting are

1437
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:43,620
changing, but you can see like, you know, did you read that whole thing with Jack Dorsey? He gets on

1438
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:52,020
CNBC or whatever. And everybody goes like crazy that, oh, he doesn't eat for 24 hours.

1439
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:56,500
It's like, what's the big deal? Like, why do you think we carry body fat? Right? And it's like,

1440
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:00,580
look, he's looking good. He feels good. What's the big deal? Why are you getting on him? Right?

1441
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:06,740
But the idea is so ingrained that we have to eat, have to eat, have to eat, even to lose weight,

1442
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:12,180
we have to eat that they won't do it. So if you take away the 50% who won't do it right off the bat,

1443
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:17,060
then you have people who will do it for short periods of time. And probably only about 20% might

1444
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:23,540
agree to like a longer fast mostly. And it's not the physical side that actually gets them. It's

1445
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:30,020
always the psychological side. The physical stuff is super easy to deal with. It's the psychological

1446
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:34,740
part. That's really hard. That is, when you're looking at somebody who's eating and you're

1447
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:39,380
trying to fast, it's like really hard, right? And yeah, you can do it once in a while. But if you do

1448
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:43,620
it sort of breakfast, lunch, dinner, breakfast, lunch, that's the hard part. And that's where

1449
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:48,660
we focus a lot of our attention working on the psychological how to set your environment up for

1450
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:55,380
success and coming up with different strategies for success and creating a supportive community

1451
02:14:55,380 --> 02:15:00,900
that's going to help your success. That's the hard part. Because think about religions like Ramadan,

1452
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:04,660
how do they all fast? Because people say, Oh, I could never fast. It's like, but you know,

1453
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:10,660
that literally hundreds of millions of Muslims fast, it's like it's because the environment

1454
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:16,820
is supportive. If all your friends are doing it and all your family, it's not fun, but it's not

1455
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:21,780
that difficult to actually do it. And that's the difference. And now we're recommending it for

1456
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:26,420
people who have no community. And that's what we're trying to create community of people who are

1457
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:31,700
accepting. And also, that's part of the point of bringing it into the mainstream. I wrote a couple

1458
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:37,220
of books about this, of course. And that's the point. If I wrote a couple of articles that I sent

1459
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:43,460
to JAMA or something to get peer reviewed, first of all, the peer review would kill it. And then

1460
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:48,500
second of all, you'd get no traction whatsoever. And then you're not doing anybody any good, because

1461
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:54,100
by making it sort of more out there, you make it more acceptable for people to talk about it and

1462
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:59,940
to accept it as a viable treatment. So let's go through some of the stuff. So that, let's say that

1463
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:04,180
40-year-old patient, first of all, appreciates the severity of what you've shared with him and his dad,

1464
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:08,820
which is, look, it's one thing to have diabetes, which you do, but you're actually in quite a late

1465
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:14,820
stage of this. If you're, I mean, I don't remember the literature on this, but from my days in surgical

1466
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:22,420
training, the five-year mortality once you have an amputation with type 2 diabetes is staggering. So

1467
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:28,260
I don't remember what it was, but it was so high that the point was once you're getting a toe

1468
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:33,300
amputated or a foot amputated or something like that, the probability you're going to be alive in

1469
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:37,860
five years is incredibly low. So I could be wrong on this, but I feel like the five-year mortality

1470
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:43,300
was something like 70%. So if you're in your 40s and you're already getting a diabetic ulcer that's

1471
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:47,700
not healing, there's a non-zero chance. There's actually a significant chance you're not going to

1472
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:53,940
make it to your 50th birthday. So he says, I'm in, you mentioned something that I think can't be

1473
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:58,740
overstated, which is you have to be in a supportive environment. So if a patient tries to fast and

1474
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:04,980
they are surrounded by people, both their friends and family, and also their other medical practitioners

1475
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:09,700
who are telling them this is a horrible idea, well, that's a recipe for failure. So now let's

1476
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:16,100
posit that we've also got the support of the medical team and the friends and family. What are

1477
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:19,860
some of the other tricks and trades? I mean, one of the things that I hear a lot about is, Peter,

1478
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:25,540
my sleep is really hard when I'm fasting. How do you address that? Yeah, that's a tough one because

1479
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:34,580
they all can't sleep. There's not that much to do. We tell them one to expect it. So it's one of the

1480
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:40,660
things is that if they know about it ahead of time, then they're much more accepting. So we say, look,

1481
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:45,540
you may have a lot of trouble going to sleep because people get so people don't understand,

1482
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:49,700
but the whole sympathetic nervous system and everything that's revved up, right, nor adrenaline,

1483
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:53,780
all that stuff gets revved up. And a lot of people actually can't sleep. And we say, well,

1484
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:59,140
you know what, if you find that, then, you know, stay up, do some work and so on. And don't worry

1485
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:03,460
about it, right? This is a temporary situation. It's not going to last forever. We just want to

1486
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:08,580
make sure that everything gets better. And that patient, I don't think he had any sleep trouble,

1487
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:13,220
but we did warn him. So one of the things we do is we warn him ahead of time of all the potential

1488
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:17,860
problems. So it's like the book, what to expect when expecting, right? So it's not like it makes

1489
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:22,820
the symptoms any better, but it makes dealing with it a lot better. So we tell him, Hey, look,

1490
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:27,380
you can have headaches. Those will go away. You can have cramps. This is what to do. You can have

1491
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:32,420
diarrhea. This is what to do. You can have constipation. This is what to do. Sleep is,

1492
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:37,140
you know, you can expect this and you need to watch this in terms of your blood sugars and,

1493
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:41,300
and so on. And this is what to do with your medications. And that patient, we actually,

1494
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:47,300
I think his last A1C that we saw was like 5.9, which here is actually classified as non-diabetic,

1495
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:53,140
not even pre-diabetic. So we took him from a couple of medications and a non-healing diabetic

1496
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:59,940
ulcer to non-diabetic, like within a couple of months. Yeah. It took a little bit longer than,

1497
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:04,500
than somebody else. And everybody responds differently. And even a couple of years later,

1498
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:07,940
he's like non-diabetic, right? So it's like, that was the whole point we missed,

1499
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:14,020
you know, in medicine, it's so difficult because we're so ingrained into these patterns of thinking.

1500
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:20,420
That is you have obesity, which causes type two diabetes, which causes a foot ulcer. So we get the

1501
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:28,260
plastic surgeon to, to bribe the ulcer. It's like, that's the least important part. You need to get

1502
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:35,060
rid of the diabetes and get rid of the obesity. And then he will actually get better. So warning

1503
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:40,180
people ahead of time is one thing that we do and it doesn't make the problem any better, but it makes

1504
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:45,620
them deal with it. One, they, they trust you because they go, Oh, Hey, I got a headache for

1505
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:50,020
three days. And then it went away. So they, they know, you know what you're doing. And that gives

1506
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:55,860
them confidence. And then just having that support. So he had his, his father of course, who was going

1507
02:19:55,860 --> 02:20:01,060
yes, yes, yes, you need to do this. And that was, that came from his religion. So it was a good set

1508
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:05,540
up for that. Many times we'll actually get the opposite, which is what you're saying is that

1509
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:10,740
I'll get that patient. I'll say, this is what you need to do. The family says, Oh man, that's crazy.

1510
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:15,540
And the family doctor says, Oh man, that's crazy. And the endocrinologist says, you must never do

1511
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:22,740
this. Then nothing changes, right? They have this and so on. My tip on this one, Jason is that in

1512
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:29,300
anticipation of that sympathetic outflow, we recommend that patients take phosphatidylserine

1513
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:36,420
with the fast in the evening. And that sort of calms down the adrenal glands. And then even just

1514
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:42,420
an oral over the counter GABA, unfortunately it's becoming harder to get centrally penetrating GABA

1515
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:47,860
over the counter, but even just peripheral GABA will, will sort of take down some of that

1516
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:54,660
sympathetic tone. So that coupled with some other sort of sleep supplements actually not only tends

1517
02:20:54,660 --> 02:21:00,100
to help people sleep, but a number of people note that you can have some of the best sleep imaginable

1518
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:04,420
with those lower levels of glucose, higher levels of ketones. Now, what about electrolytes? How do

1519
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:09,140
you manage the electrolytes in particular sodium and magnesium during these longer fasts?

1520
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:15,060
There's nothing specifically we do actually. So we monitor it very closely of course. Magnesium is

1521
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:19,860
the one, so everybody worries about sodium and you can get some people who do get a bit sodium

1522
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:23,940
depleted, but if you're otherwise healthy, your kidneys should never get to that state because

1523
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:29,780
there are people from the intersalt study, there are people that actually barely eat any salt at

1524
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:35,460
all and still survive fine. So your body should be able to reabsorb all the sodium it needs.

1525
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:40,900
Magnesium is a bit more difficult because a lot of type 2 diabetics are depleted of magnesium to

1526
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:45,060
start. So we'll often recommend magnesium supplements and that's where a lot of the

1527
02:21:45,060 --> 02:21:49,940
cramps and so on kick in. Some people do get a little dizzy and so on. So that's when we use

1528
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:56,180
the bone broth, which is technically not a fast, but it's got calories and amino acids and stuff.

1529
02:21:56,180 --> 02:22:01,060
But that's where we'll use bone broth for example, where you can put a decent amount of salt in

1530
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:07,140
and take it and still feel well. We monitor the electrolytes more just because we want to make

1531
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:11,780
sure that nobody's getting into trouble. But I'll tell you that the number of times that I've

1532
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:18,340
actually had to intervene or tell somebody to stop a fast because of electrolytes is like zero,

1533
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:22,020
I think. I don't think I've ever had a case where the blood work came back and said,

1534
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:28,660
oh my god, they have to stop. There are some other things like if they get diarrhea, for example,

1535
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:34,580
it can be fairly significant, then that might play a role. But when they get those, we tell them stop.

1536
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:40,820
We're always super cautious because we monitor them very closely. These are relatively sick

1537
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:45,700
patients, right? So they generally have a lot of medical issues, but we monitor them very closely

1538
02:22:45,700 --> 02:22:50,980
and we give them very careful instructions that, hey, if you don't feel well, you need to stop

1539
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:57,700
right away. Don't even tell me. Stop it. And then tell me, right? Because the point is that you can,

1540
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:05,140
let's figure out what's going on. Then if it's a solvable problem, then we can do it starting

1541
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:11,700
tomorrow or we can do a totally different regimen, shorter, fast, more frequently. We're not stuck to

1542
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:17,140
this one thing or we can do ketogenic diets or we can do something else, right? There's all kinds

1543
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:22,180
of things that we can do without doing a long fast. And some people actually hate the long fast and

1544
02:23:22,180 --> 02:23:27,220
some people actually love the long fast. So we always say, don't get so rigid in your thinking

1545
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:33,140
that you have to push through. The one thing we tell people more than, don't just push through

1546
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:36,820
because that's when you're going to get yourself into trouble. There's always tomorrow to start

1547
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:41,620
another fast if we figure out what's going on with this. Don't you find it's helpful to explain what

1548
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:47,460
you're pushing through? I mean, for example, even if I fast for seven days, there is no day during

1549
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:52,660
that seven when I am not at least at one point quite hungry. Oh yeah, the hunger for sure. We

1550
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:56,820
always say you can be hungry, but make sure you're not like lethargic or something. I think it's

1551
02:23:56,820 --> 02:24:02,660
important for patients to understand even seasoned fasters still get hungry. But what I find

1552
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:08,180
interesting in my wife who doesn't fast but is sort of interested in why I do it, she can't

1553
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:13,460
believe it, right? She can't believe that I'll work long hard days and exercise and do all that stuff

1554
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:17,540
while fasting. And she's like, aren't you just starving? And I said truthfully, yes, every single

1555
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:23,220
day I feel quite hungry at some point in the day, but it's never more hungry than on a regular day

1556
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:29,220
if I'm getting really hungry. Being hungry on the seventh day of a fast is not a more profound

1557
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:35,460
hunger. It's the anticipation of that that becomes problematic, which really speaks to the Shakespeare

1558
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:40,580
quote about nothing is either good or bad, but thinking simply makes it so. The anticipation

1559
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:45,780
of that hunger seems to be a bigger problem. Maybe for your patients, it's less of a concern

1560
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:50,740
because the highest priority is the amelioration of the diabetes. But do you spend much time

1561
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:57,860
thinking about how they can minimize muscle mass loss with the obvious loss of protein intake? Or

1562
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:02,580
do you just say, look, it's so intermittent that we do this fasting that we're going to take whatever

1563
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:07,060
we have to take in the most catabolic sense and then deal with it on the back end? Or do you do

1564
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:11,780
anything specifically with respect to exercise? Nothing specifically, because again, I'm treating

1565
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:17,620
different population. Like I'm not treating bodybuilders, right? I'm treating 65 year old women.

1566
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:22,900
For them, it's like they don't even know how much muscle mass they have. And honestly, I'm not even

1567
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:28,100
sure. Like there is some protein loss and I'm not sure that's a bad thing. I mean, I think that

1568
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:33,700
most people actually don't get a lot of muscle loss. Like you can get protein loss, which is

1569
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:37,780
connective tissue and skin. And this is one of the things that people always rag on me about,

1570
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:43,540
but it's, this is clinical medicine, right? So I've treated thousands of people with fasting and

1571
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:47,540
some have lost a lot of weight, like hundreds of pounds. And I've, I've documented a few case

1572
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:53,060
studies in my blog and stuff. And one of the things that's very unusual about fasting for

1573
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:57,300
weight loss as opposed to weight loss for other things is that we don't see the skin problems

1574
02:25:57,300 --> 02:26:01,780
because skin is protein. Like it's not fat, right? Skin connective tissue, it's protein.

1575
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:06,020
And you do go, when you do the intermittent fasting, you do go through that period where

1576
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:09,940
you have gluconeogenesis and you're breaking down protein. That's the whole point of autophagy,

1577
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:14,820
for example, is breaking down protein. It's not fat. And I'm not sure that it's bad thing.

1578
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:20,180
So we actually get much less. I've never referred a patient for skin removal surgery. And some people

1579
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:26,260
have lost like 150 pounds for like years, right? And they actually don't notice the problem. A couple

1580
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:32,100
of my colleagues who I work with and they, they've noticed the same thing that you don't have as many

1581
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:38,020
of the problems that you do with regular sort of weight loss, which is chronic calorie restriction,

1582
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:43,220
where you get these big flaps of skin that you have to go in surgically and take out. The question

1583
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:48,660
is why doesn't your body get rid of them? Because it's superfluous. Your body shouldn't be keeping

1584
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:52,980
it around. Your body should be getting rid of it. And it doesn't because you never went through

1585
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:58,500
this period where you're undergoing gluconeogenesis, where you actually are breaking down protein.

1586
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:03,620
So do you get more muscle loss? There's been a couple of studies on alternate daily fasting,

1587
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:09,620
which really haven't shown increased muscle loss or lean loss. I think that the protein loss is

1588
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:17,460
often confused and called muscle loss. To me, it makes no sense. Like your body has a system. And

1589
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:21,860
I'm not talking the situation where you have 4% body fat, right? I'm talking about a situation

1590
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:30,340
where you have 30% or more body fat. It makes no sense that the body should store food energy

1591
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:35,940
as glycogen and body fat. But the minute you need to use it, you start burning muscle.

1592
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:42,020
Do we think our bodies are really just that stupid that they're going to do that? It's like

1593
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:47,540
storing firewood for the winter. And then as soon as you need to use it, you chop up your sofa and

1594
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:53,380
throw it in the fire. Like who would do that? But we think that our bodies are just that stupid.

1595
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:58,180
Like I don't think their bodies are that stupid. I think that there's a period which is fairly

1596
02:27:58,180 --> 02:28:04,420
limited during the fasting where you have gluconeogenesis. Then you can see fat oxidation goes

1597
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:08,740
way up. And Kevin Hall, I think did some of these studies on what happens. And

1598
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:14,100
Cahill of course did all those studies on what happens during actual starvation. You got to

1599
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:22,020
remember that he was no wimp. These are like 60 days of fasting, not like 16 hours. It was huge.

1600
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:27,300
And these people were not even overweight. There are some studies that you just think,

1601
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:31,460
wow, how did they get away with that? It was before the days of the IRB.

1602
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:36,900
I know. There is a great study. I don't know if you've seen this. There's two studies where they

1603
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:43,060
took people who were not even overweight. They fasted them for 60 days and gave them a big slug

1604
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:47,300
of insulin. It's like, why? It's like just to see what would happen.

1605
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:52,580
Well, no, no. I mean, that study was to actually see if the ketones were protective in the presence

1606
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:58,500
of hypoglycemia. They injected those patients with insulin, took their glucose down to below

1607
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:02,020
one millimolar. These people were walking around with it. Yeah, they did totally fine,

1608
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:06,820
provided they had enough BHB. That's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible. But you'd never get that

1609
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:11,300
study done today. You'd get thrown out, like you'd get laughed at right by the IRB. You're going to

1610
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:16,820
drop people's glucose to less than one. Are you serious? Everybody now thinks if you don't eat for

1611
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:21,700
24 hours, you can get seizures, right? But the point is that, yes, it was for the ketones and

1612
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:26,900
stuff. But it's a great study, stuff that you just couldn't do these days. But the amount of protein,

1613
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:30,900
so when you look at all the Cahill studies and all the classic studies of fasting,

1614
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:36,340
that's a relatively limited period that you're actually burning. You've got the gluconeogenesis

1615
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:40,740
in your burning protein, which I actually think is a beneficial thing in the right situation where

1616
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:48,100
you have somebody with obesity and so on. And if you look at studies like Natal did a bunch of

1617
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:53,860
these studies and he tried to estimate how much excess protein somebody who is overweight has,

1618
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:59,940
it's like 20 to 50% more protein than a regular person. There's more skin, there's more muscle,

1619
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:05,060
there's more connective tissue, there's blood vessels, there's all kinds of extra protein that

1620
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:10,980
goes along with being overweight. And that all needs to go if you're going to do it. So I'm not

1621
02:30:10,980 --> 02:30:16,900
actually worried. So again, I've treated a few thousands of patients with type 2 diabetes.

1622
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:23,620
Remember, I'm not talking about the guy who has 4% body fat and is a body builder and can

1623
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:28,260
tell how much muscle he has based on how much he can live. I'm talking about the 65-year-old

1624
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:34,500
person with a lot of body fat and generally excess protein. In that case, the question is,

1625
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:40,500
how many patients have I had to stop because I was worried about muscle loss? That would be

1626
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:46,900
like zero in six years. And because I use it in a therapeutic manner, that is, I'm not treating one

1627
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:50,900
person a week sort of thing. It's like every person who comes in every 10 minutes, I'll say,

1628
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:55,540
this is what you need to do. This is what you need to do. So it's just part of my clinical practice.

1629
02:30:55,540 --> 02:31:00,900
So it's like hundreds of patients a year and over six years, it's like thousands of patients,

1630
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:07,060
like zero people had to stop because I was worried about muscle loss. So it's like, okay,

1631
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:11,780
tell me how that is going to be a big concern to me. And this is where, again, it's like

1632
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:18,020
people who don't fast and people rag on me all the time about this. It's like, oh,

1633
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:21,700
what about this? What about this? I'm like, okay, how many thousands of patients have you done this

1634
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:27,300
for? Try it on several thousand patients and then come back to me and tell me if muscle loss is the

1635
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:33,620
most important thing for this 65-year-old 300-pound man on 150 units of insulin.

1636
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:37,860
It's a totally different situation. Last question, because I know you've got to get back to clinic.

1637
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:43,220
We've taken you away from it. Do you think there's a role for this type of fasting in people who

1638
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:50,500
are actually healthy but looking to get benefit that goes beyond getting rid of a disease they

1639
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:56,420
don't have? In other words, if you take a person who's not hyperinsulinemic, i.e. insulin sensitive

1640
02:31:56,420 --> 02:32:00,660
by these definitions, though, we made a pretty good case that everybody's insulin sensitive

1641
02:32:00,660 --> 02:32:07,140
without a lepidistrophy, but you take a non-obese, non-diabetic, non-naphal, the insulin sensitive,

1642
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:14,420
non-hyperinsulinemic individual who's asking the question, will periodic fasts reduce my odds of

1643
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:19,300
chronic disease down the line? How do you feel about that? Absolutely, yes, because look,

1644
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:25,540
the point of fasting is to lower insulin levels. If you fast and you're healthy and you're not

1645
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:31,220
hyperinsulinemic, well, if you do periodic fasting, it doesn't have to be a long time or

1646
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:38,980
even that frequent. If you look at the 70s, a typical person who is eating three meals a day,

1647
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:45,700
14 hours of fasting every day, and then once a year maybe on Yom Kippur or during Lent or

1648
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:50,420
during Ramadan, he'll have a little bit longer fast. But there are times he's eating a lot too,

1649
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:55,780
Christmas and all this sort of time. That's just the balance. It's all about balance.

1650
02:32:56,340 --> 02:33:00,900
This is the whole point is that you have to balance periods where you have going to take

1651
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:04,340
a lot of food like Christmas. You're eating, you're eating, you're eating, you're eating.

1652
02:33:04,340 --> 02:33:09,380
Now you want to balance that with Lent where you're just not going to eat a lot because that's what

1653
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:15,300
they told you to do. This is what's going to happen is that you're going to drop your insulin

1654
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:20,260
levels periodically, which will prevent you. It's going to clear out all that sugar every once in a

1655
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:25,700
while and then prevent you from getting diseases of hyperinsulinemia. So if you drop your insulin

1656
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:30,100
every so often, you're going to prevent yourself or lower your chance of getting diseases of

1657
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:38,340
hyperinsulinemia, which are heart disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes,

1658
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:44,340
obesity. Well, that's the major risk of our current population. So you want to lower your risk of

1659
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:48,260
getting those? Great. Like you're not going to lower your risk of getting pneumonia. Like you're

1660
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:52,820
going to lower your risk of these diseases of hyperinsulinemia. So for a healthy person,

1661
02:33:52,820 --> 02:34:00,260
yes, I think fasting is very beneficial, but you don't have to do five days of fasting every month

1662
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:05,220
or something like that, right? You could do a little bit longer fasting once in a while and maybe

1663
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:10,580
not do some bedtime snacks and stuff. But you don't buy the argument then that, for example,

1664
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:16,180
of Altralongo's FMD, which is a type of intermittent fast. I know you know what it is, but a listener

1665
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:22,420
might not. So this is one of literally 100 different ways you could fast, but he would

1666
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:27,540
suggest that based on a certain set of macronutrients, you're consuming about 1,000 calories,

1667
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:33,700
followed by 750 calories for four days. And that gives you a five-day cycle. And he talks about

1668
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:40,740
doing that quarterly and would argue that there are actual longevity benefits, even in the non-diabetic

1669
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:45,380
or non-metabolically ill person. Again, I think for some people, that sounds really extreme.

1670
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:50,100
Personally, I don't think it's that extreme. In your patients, that doesn't seem extreme.

1671
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:54,980
It's actually fairly routine for a lot of people that we talk to. But again,

1672
02:34:54,980 --> 02:35:01,300
it's a different patient population. For healthy people, I think that the data is just not there.

1673
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:09,380
So prevention of Alzheimer's, prevention of cancer, treatment of autoimmune diseases, for example,

1674
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:14,740
of Altralongo's talking about sometimes. I don't think that there's enough data to say yes or no.

1675
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:19,060
Could it work? Absolutely, it could work. I actually think that there's a good reason to

1676
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:24,340
think that these things will work to prevent a lot of those diseases. Not necessarily. So of course,

1677
02:35:24,340 --> 02:35:30,180
to me, all the diseases of excessive growth and hyperinsulinemia, to me, clearly are going to

1678
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:35,380
reduce your risk. But now you're talking about other diseases like autoimmune diseases. And I

1679
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:40,420
think that there's good reason to think why they might work. But is there data to show it? Not

1680
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:45,700
really. Yeah, this gets back to the first point of will we ever have evidence-based guidelines

1681
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:52,340
to support this? I think it's impossible, not improbable. And therefore, we are stuck thinking

1682
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:56,740
about this through mechanistic lenses. Yeah, but see, the thing is that, again,

1683
02:35:56,740 --> 02:36:02,260
people have it all wrong because people say, okay, so say they're talking about a five-day fast once

1684
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:06,260
a quarter or something like that. Whether you do fasting mimicking or regular fasting,

1685
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:11,380
let's say somebody says you should do five days of fasting once a quarter or once a year.

1686
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:16,660
Okay, so the evidence-based medicine people are always way off because they say there is no

1687
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:22,740
evidence to suggest that five days of fasting once a year is beneficial. They're right, but they're

1688
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:27,620
completely wrong from a clinical perspective. Because there's also no evidence that five days

1689
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:33,940
of fasting a year and a person who's normal weight and otherwise healthy is harmful to you. So now

1690
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:40,500
you have to say, what is the risk of doing that five days of fasting? So five days, so in a year,

1691
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:44,660
you will eat three meals a day. One year, you'll eat a thousand meals. For five days,

1692
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:50,100
you're going to make 15 meals out of a thousand. That's it. That's the extent of what you're doing.

1693
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:55,220
What is the risk of that? I'll tell you it's just about zero. Like, yeah, you're going to be hungry

1694
02:36:55,220 --> 02:37:00,180
and stuff. But if you're otherwise healthy, the risk is very, very, very low. And then you say,

1695
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:05,060
what is the benefit? Well, there's not really any great evidence of benefit either, but because

1696
02:37:05,060 --> 02:37:12,260
your risk is so low, your risk to reward ratio is pretty reasonable. Why wouldn't you do it? That's

1697
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:17,380
the question because the risk is so low. Maybe there's no benefit. Maybe there is a benefit.

1698
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:21,540
I can't tell you, right? And it's the same for all drugs. You know that there's a certain number

1699
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:27,860
needed to treat. So a number needed to treat a 50 means that 49 out of 50 people simply do not

1700
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:31,940
benefit from that drug that you gave them. And it's going to be the same for fasting. There's

1701
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:37,300
going to be one person who benefits and 50 people who don't benefit. But the risk to reward, because

1702
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:43,300
when you give a drug, the risk starts getting so high that the risk, the reward ratios, they don't

1703
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:51,140
make sense. But for something like fasting, missing 15 meals out of a thousand. Yeah, it can make sense.

1704
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:55,860
And that's why, you know, all these sort of EBM zealots are all like, oh, there's no evidence.

1705
02:37:55,860 --> 02:38:00,580
There's no evidence. It's like you don't need evidence. It's assessing the risk and the reward

1706
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:06,980
and what clinically makes sense. To me, if I had, for example, some kind of autoimmune disease,

1707
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:10,340
so let's take this disease, rheumatoid arthritis, that there's no evidence that

1708
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:15,860
fasting is going to do anything for. And Dr. Longo says, well, you know, you can reset your

1709
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:22,100
immune system if you do seven days of fasting. What would I do? I would absolutely do it,

1710
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:26,900
as opposed to taking a bunch of toxic drugs like prednisone. Like you've seen what prednisone does

1711
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:31,780
to people. Why wouldn't I do seven days of fasting? The risk of that is zero. Say I don't get any

1712
02:38:31,780 --> 02:38:37,060
benefit from that. Then I don't have to do it ever again. But what happens if things get a lot better?

1713
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:44,900
I've just treated my own disease. The reward can be so high, but you don't have to guess at it.

1714
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:51,140
You can just do it. Speaking of risk, there's some, in my opinion, kind of weak epidemiology

1715
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:56,260
suggesting that skipping breakfast will increase your risk of gallstones. How often are you seeing

1716
02:38:56,260 --> 02:39:01,300
that in your practice? A lot of people have gallstones. So I don't see an increased risk,

1717
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:06,180
but on the other hand, it's going to be tough because the problem is that people who follow

1718
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:11,620
a low fat diet, of course, their gallbladder, you don't need bile, right? You need bile to emulsify

1719
02:39:11,620 --> 02:39:16,100
the fat. So therefore your gallbladder just sits around with all this stuff and you get sludge and

1720
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:20,580
so on. So I think the low fat diet can certainly predispose you to stones. Then you start eating a

1721
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:25,460
higher fat diet and then it's squeezing out and you're getting stones. I don't see it clinically

1722
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:30,340
as a problem. I think what caused a lot of the problems was probably the lower fat diet because

1723
02:39:30,340 --> 02:39:34,740
you're simply not getting the flow, the enterorhepatic flow. Like the bile is supposed to come out.

1724
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:39,220
It's not supposed to sit there, but when you get rid of all the fat, it just sits there.

1725
02:39:39,220 --> 02:39:44,900
That's just the balance. Our body makes it, sticks it in the gallbladder so that when you eat fat,

1726
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:50,260
you can squirt a little bit of it out. Now we think we're so much smarter than our body,

1727
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:55,700
which has survived for millions of years, that we're going to eat zero fat and just have all this

1728
02:39:56,260 --> 02:40:00,980
stuff, the sludge just sit in the gallbladder because you never took it out.

1729
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:03,780
Like how does that make sense? To me, it makes no sense.

1730
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:09,940
Well, on that note, we are at exactly the time when I know you need to get back to clinic.

1731
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:18,260
So I want to thank you greatly for your insights, both at the, what I would say are hugely paradigm

1732
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:22,500
challenging level, especially as it pertains to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

1733
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:27,940
And then also at the boots on the ground clinical level, I know that very few people have the

1734
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:32,900
experience treating patients with fasting protocols for type 2 diabetes. And I think

1735
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:35,860
you're doing fantastic work. So I want to thank you very much for that.

1736
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:36,260
Thank you.
