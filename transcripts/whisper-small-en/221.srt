Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,000
today's episode. Welcome to another episode of the Drive. As we've released so many episodes over

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,960
the past four years, we realized we've covered a lot of topics in detail. Sometimes it can be

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,000
hard to keep up and try to piece it together. We also realized that there are listeners today who

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,720
weren't exactly listeners a year ago or three years ago or four years ago. We did a test of

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,520
this idea back in May of 2022 where we did an episode that pulled a variety of clips from

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,560
previous podcasts, but all on one topic, which was exercise. The feedback we received from that

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,600
episode was overwhelmingly positive and people asked for more. This week, we're going to do it

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
again. Of course, we're going to pick a different topic. This topic is going to be sleep, probably

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,680
something we get just as many questions on as frankly anything else. We put these clips in the

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,920
order of what we think is the best way to listen from top to bottom, but in between some of the

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
clips, I'm going to provide a little bit of commentary to set the stage. Our hope is that

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,200
this will not only allow you to understand the topic of sleep better, but also help identify

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,080
some of the previous episodes in case you actually want to go back and listen to those in more detail.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,960
In each of these clips, I'm going to be joined by sleep expert Matt Walker. Matt has been on the

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,360
podcast several times, including three AMAs. One thing to note is that some of these clips

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,200
are from AMAs. So if you're not a subscriber, you'll actually get a sense of what we cover

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,880
during those episodes. This is still a new concept and this is only our second time doing this. So

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
we really do want the feedback. If you like this, tell us we'll keep doing it. If you don't,

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,880
we'll scrap it. So without further delay, I hope you'll enjoy this special episode of The Drive.

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:25,120
Firstly, it took Mother Nature 3.6 million years to put this eight hour thing called a

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,920
night of sleep in place. And within the space of 70 years, if you look at the data, we've

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,440
lopped off almost 20 to 25% of that. Imagine coming along and saying, in the next hundred years,

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I think what I'm going to do is for the entirety of human society, I'm going to reduce that.

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,720
Oxygen saturation by about 20 to 25%. Do you think that's a good idea? And the answer is no.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,400
No, it's such a great example. I'll pause for a moment just to tell a funny story that you and

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,760
I have talked about off mic, which is up until about 2012, I was in the I'll sleep when I'm

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,320
dead camp. And I know what led to that. It wasn't that there was a very deliberate decision at the

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,160
end of medical school when a good friend of mine with all the best intentions who was a year ahead

37
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,840
of me. So he was now in at the end of his internship as I was about to begin my he said,

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,880
and this is in the days when we didn't have the 80 hour work week requirement in residency. So we

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,160
averaged, I think about 114 hours a week in the hospital. So he said to me, look, Peter, you're

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,920
signing up for, you know, whatever five, seven years of this thing. If you spent every moment

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,140
outside of the hospital sleeping, you would still be tired. The only difference is you wouldn't

42
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:50,060
have any fun. So make sure you live every moment that you're not in the hospital to the fullest.

43
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,020
And so for me, that basically meant if I wasn't in the hospital, I was swimming, I was going out

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,860
with my friends, I was trying to meet girls like and I was doing anything, everything, such that

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,460
during that period of my life, I, I just know because I was pretty adamant about recording how

46
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,460
much time like I was very wed to this idea. There's 168 hours in a week, if I'm spending,

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,020
you know, 114 of them here, and I spend this many driving, I spend this many getting groceries,

48
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,900
and I spend this many swimming and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think I was about 28 hours a week

49
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,660
of sleep. So it wasn't for every night because you'd have none, and then six, and then three,

50
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,860
and then eight, like you could binge sleep from time to time. But it was pretty much 28 a week.

51
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,500
I'll come back to some of the implications of that. But fast forward a few years, I'm talking

52
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,580
to a good friend of mine who's a physician who like you is adamant about, you know, the importance

53
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,020
of sleep. And we're having dinner one night. And he says, he's challenging me on this. And he says,

54
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,580
so let me get this straight. You've just decided that you're going to sleep half of what is

55
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:57,420
evolutionarily programmed. And I said, yeah. Because does it strike you as odd that evolution

56
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,780
would have designed us to spend a third of our life not mating, not watching out for predators,

57
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,780
not hunting for food, but doing this thing for some other purpose? Do you think that thing must

58
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,540
have been important? And it was such an obvious argument, but it really overnight changed the way

59
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:23,460
I thought about this, which was evolution went to great lengths to do this. And superficially at

60
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,460
great cost to us, right? I mean, you could argue, well, imagine you didn't need to sleep and you

61
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,580
could spend 24 hours a day foraging for food or a mate or some other thing, but it didn't.

62
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,940
So it's sort of, it's sort of like, there's probably a reason we are not anaerobic.

63
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,220
To your point about reducing oxygen saturation by 25%.

64
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,540
You know, if you were to think about that, you know, during sleep, just as you said,

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,220
you're not eating, you're not finding food, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing,

66
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,300
you're not caring for your young, you're vulnerable to predation on any one of those grounds,

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,780
but especially all of them put together as a collective, completely anti evolutionary.

68
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,660
It sounds like the dumbest thing. And, you know, often said, and it has been said before,

69
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,300
if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital set of functions, it's the biggest mistake that the

70
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,340
evolutionary process has ever made. And we now realize from this constellation of evidence that

71
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,780
mother nature did not make a spectacular blunder in putting this thing called an eight hour

72
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,300
sort of need of sleep in place. It is the greatest life support system that you could

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,900
ever wish for. It is a remarkable health insurance policy. And what's great is that

74
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,820
it's largely democratic. It's mostly free. And in terms of a prescription from a doctor,

75
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,140
it's largely painless. So I almost wanted to title the book, consciousness is overrated,

76
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,860
or just sometimes dot dot dot consciousness is overrated. But when you really look at the

77
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,740
evidence in terms of risk derisking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed

78
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,300
world, it's very hard to look no further than sleep. And that's why I don't want to trivialize

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,620
diet. And I don't want to trivialize movement and activity. But what I would say is that if you want

80
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,740
to put sleep up against either one of those two and kind of play the whole head to head game,

81
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,540
which I don't think we need to do here, I would simply say that sleep is the foundation on which

82
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,860
those two other things sit. It's not the third pillar of good health. I think it is the foundation.

83
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,220
That's a really interesting way to think about it, because I typically describe four pillars,

84
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,020
or five, if you include all of the exogenous molecules that you could lump together. But

85
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,780
another way to think about it, which again, I don't think is necessarily the right way to

86
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,820
think about it. But sometimes it makes the point. If you deprive yourself of food, how long can you

87
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,660
survive? Well, we have one person up to 382 days, even someone who's as lean as you could survive

88
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,700
30 days with no food. How long could you survive without water depends greatly on the temperature,

89
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:12,020
etc. But you could make the case that deprivation of sleep would result in the quickest reduction of

90
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,380
health, certainly more than not eating or not exercising for a period of time.

91
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,980
And those studies have been done in rats.

92
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,660
Yeah. And actually, we know some of this from humans who have been trying to... In fact,

93
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,660
didn't the Guinness Book of World Records, I can't remember if I read this in your work,

94
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,220
they've actually banned attempts at longest period of sleep deprivation.

95
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,260
So I mentioned this. Yeah.

96
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,620
Yeah, you might leave it in the book.

97
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,820
But there was a time when you could still try and beat the world record of sleep deprivation,

98
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,060
and it got up to about sort of, I think the last true effort was about 24 days.

99
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,580
But I think it was debatable, that one. But based on the weight of the scientific data,

100
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,660
the relationship between sleep loss and mental health, sleep loss and cancer,

101
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,300
sleep loss, cardiovascular disease, sleep loss and metabolic syndrome, Guinness started to feel

102
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,340
very, very uncomfortable. And then when suicide came on the table, it pulled it.

103
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,940
So in other words, think about this, there was a gentleman, Felix Baumgardner, I think his name was,

104
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,660
who sponsored by Red Bull, went up in a capsule in a hot air balloon to the outer surface of our

105
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,180
planet. This was about four years ago.

106
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,420
Four years ago.

107
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,460
This was remarkable.

108
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:31,540
He opened the door and then he jumped out and he fell back down to earth at over a thousand

109
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,940
kilometers an hour using his body alone. He broke the sound barrier and he successfully

110
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:47,780
came back. And now Guinness says for that, just fine. However, to sleep deprive yourself, no,

111
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,220
much more unsafe. We're not going to let it happen.

112
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,300
You are allowed just to put it in context.

113
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,580
You're allowed up to 12 jumps off Niagara Falls.

114
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,860
Basically.

115
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,340
But that's okay. But no, no, you're not going to. That's such a great point.

116
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:11,700
So let's shift gears just a little bit and go back to the polysom. Let's explain to people,

117
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,620
because we're going to eventually have to talk about tracking these things. And I want to bring

118
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,660
up some of the sort of commercially available ways that people do that, which I think by definition

119
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,820
are still not accurate enough for people to compare them to their polysom. But if I came

120
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,340
into your lab tonight and I was willing to go to sleep there and you would hook me up to an EEG,

121
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,180
what are the different patterns of brainwaves and how would you morphologically describe them and

122
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,860
then bucket them by these stages you've already sort of touched on a little bit as deep REM,

123
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,340
deep REM, deep non-REM, et cetera.

124
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,500
Yeah. So upon falling asleep, human beings and in fact, all mammals will experience two different

125
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,380
stages of sleep. One of them is called non-rapid eye movement sleep. The other is rapid eye movement

126
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,500
sleep. Non-REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages, which are unimaginatively

127
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,780
called stages one through four. Thank God. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I think that's all that the sleep

128
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,620
deprived people who are, you know, experimenting could come up at that time. So increasing in their

129
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,700
depth of sleep sleep. So stages three and four of non-REM sleep are the really deep restorative

130
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,900
stages of sleep. Stages one and two are the lighter stages of sleep. And then on the other

131
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,340
hand, we have rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep, which is named not after the popular Michael

132
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,460
Stipe pop band, but because of these bizarre horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur

133
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,300
during this stage of sleep, these rapid eye movements. So you have these two different types

134
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,620
of sleep and they will essentially, as you fall asleep here in at the sleep center at Berkeley,

135
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,420
they will go into essentially a battle for brain domination throughout the night.

136
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:06,420
And that cerebral war between non-REM and REM is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes and then

137
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,460
replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep,

138
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,060
or what we call a hypnogram of sleep. And so what you will see is that upon falling asleep,

139
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,300
you'll go into the light stages of non-REM stages one and two.

140
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,620
Before we do that, let's say before I fall asleep, when I'm just laying in the bed,

141
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,300
how would you describe my brainwaves under the wakeful condition?

142
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,300
So at that point, what we typically see is that when you close your eyes,

143
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,980
the back of the brain goes into what's called an alpha rhythm. So when you're awake, your brain

144
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,460
shows this remarkably frenetic, high frequency electrical activity. In other words, your brain

145
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,660
is going in terms of its brainwaves, it's going up and down many, many times a second. And

146
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,900
the amplitude is?

147
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,900
And the amplitude is very small, which kind of is paradoxically to think,

148
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,340
if I'm awake, then my brain is active. And so the size of those brainwaves should be big.

149
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,100
It's not, it's actually very small. And here's the reason. Different parts of your brain are

150
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,820
doing different things at different times. So those brainwaves sort of are all canceling each

151
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,140
other out. So the analogy would be, if I were to dangle a microphone above a sports stadium,

152
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,500
what I'm picking up is the signal from the crowd of a hundred thousand individual neurons that sit

153
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,780
underneath it. That's how an EEG electrode is. Now, before the game starts, that's wakefulness.

154
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,700
And at that point, the hundred thousand people in the stadium, the hundred thousand brain cells,

155
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,980
they're all speaking to each other at different moments in time.

156
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,340
So there's a lot of cancellation.

157
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,740
So there's a lot of cancellation. They're not all coordinated, but it's very fast and

158
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:57,300
frenetic. So I just get this signal that is very desynchronized and it's not synchronous.

159
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,220
So they're not summing their power together. So the size of that brainwave is not very big,

160
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:11,380
but the frequency is high, meaning that you're sort of going up and down maybe 50, 60 times per

161
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,540
second. Now, as you start to fall asleep or actually even before you start to fall asleep,

162
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,900
as you're lying in bed awake, the back of the brain is the first part of the brain that really

163
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,900
starts to settle down. It goes into what we call alpha rhythm when you close your eyes.

164
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,820
And I assume that's just because the occipital cortex is in the back and you've closed your eyes.

165
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,100
Brilliant. So the back of the brain, visual brain, if you close your eyes, that part of the brain

166
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,260
essentially stops processing the outside world and it goes into its sort of default state. When it's

167
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:49,700
awake of slow frequency, it drops down from maybe 50 times per second down to about, let's say,

168
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,060
10 cycles per second. But still relatively low amplitude? But still relatively low amplitude.

169
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,660
Then once you start to actually transition, when you make that bridge from the world of wakefulness

170
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,820
to sleep, as you sort of cross through that window from one of those worlds to the next,

171
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,780
something bizarre happens. And if anyone out there is lucky enough to be listening to this

172
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,860
and they have a bed partner, you can actually see this. Just look at their eyelids as they're

173
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,300
falling asleep. And what you'll see is that their eyeballs start to roll in their sockets

174
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,580
and they're called slow rolling eye movements. Now we don't know why the eyes roll in the sockets

175
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,620
like that, but it's the first sign that you're making the transition from the world of wakefulness

176
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,820
into sleep. We use it as almost an indicator of the transition into sleep. Now, by the way,

177
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,780
if your partner wakes up, sometimes people will wake up from that state and they see you just

178
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,780
looking over them in bed, staring at their eyelids. If you're in early in a relationship,

179
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,500
it's usually the end of the relationship. Just a point of note, please don't blame me. Usually

180
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,460
wait till you're married and then start to do that one. The divorce usually is harder to come by.

181
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,500
Then you start to go down into the light stages of non-REM sleep, stages one and two. Then after

182
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,300
about 20 or so minutes, you'll go down deep into stages three and four non-REM sleep.

183
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,460
And in one and two, have we transitioned out of that alpha wave? Where do we start to see the

184
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,220
thetas and... Theta already happening in stage one. In stage two, you actually go into theta

185
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:36,420
activity, which is now down from 50 cycles per second, maybe down to just six or seven cycles

186
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,540
per second. The amplitude's getting a bit bigger, is it? It is getting a bit bigger, yeah. Then every

187
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,820
now and again during stage two, the way that I know that you're in this lighter stage of non-REM

188
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,780
sleep, stage two, is that you'll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity that

189
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,460
we call sleep spindles. That's the K-spindle. That's where you get this... Actually, you get

190
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,060
a nice big slow wave, almost like a single slow wave, and then you get this burst of a sleep

191
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,260
spindle. We actually did this great project here at the Sleep Center where we did the sonification

192
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:15,940
of sleep. We extracted brainwaves from human beings, and then we smoothed them a little bit

193
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,980
with some audio software, and then you can play them back. It's beautiful because when you hear

194
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,100
these sleep spindles, they are these short synchronous bursts of electrical activity that

195
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,340
last for about a second and a half, and they go up to about 10 or 15 cycles per second.

196
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,700
It's almost like that beautiful rolling R in the Hindi language, like a cat pairing.

197
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,100
You get these big slow waves, and then you get this ripple of a spindle. When you hear it on the

198
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,140
speakers, it's just sensational. You get this...

199
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,900
Every time I hear it, this is spine-tingling stuff when you realize this is going on right now,

200
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,740
physiologically, in someone's brain. Then from there, you start to go down to the really deep

201
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,940
stages of non-rheum sleep, stages 3 and 4. At that point, the brain goes into this incredible

202
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:26,100
synchronous mantra chant of these slow waves. The brainwaves slow down. You go down to maybe just

203
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,220
one or two cycles per second. Very, very slow brainwave activity, but the size of those waves,

204
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,140
crashing on the beach of the cortex, as it were, they are huge. The reason is this. Go back to the

205
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,740
sports stadium analogy. Let's say that we're here at Berkeley and we're playing Stanford arch rivals.

206
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,380
Hopefully, you're going to kick their butt. Fingers crossed.

207
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,780
Just make sure there's no band anywhere to be found.

208
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,620
It always does. It's a terrible disservice. At that point, they're chanting in unison.

209
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,700
They're all chanting in unison. It's louder, but they're now making the same sound together.

210
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,540
You can actually hear what's being said. Exactly. Now, in that single microphone,

211
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:16,020
you can hear Stanford sucks. Stanford sucks. All of a sudden, for reasons that we are only now

212
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:23,860
starting to understand, the brain coordinates hundreds of thousands of neurons, unlike it does

213
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,740
at any moment elsewhere in the 24-hour period. Hundreds of thousands of brain cells all decide

214
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,180
to join hands, as it were, physiologically, metaphorically. They all fire together,

215
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,980
and then they all go silent. They all fire together, and then they all go silent.

216
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,220
What I find amazing about that, by the way, is how slow that frequency is. This could be only

217
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,140
happening once a second, right? That's right. That's why it got a terrible rap for 20 or 30

218
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,220
years, because it actually looked not dissimilar to some aspects of coma. That's how slow those

219
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,140
brainwaves were. Sleep scientists were understandably fooled into thinking that deep

220
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,860
sleep was a time when the brain essentially was just doing nothing. Now, we realize the exact

221
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:18,340
opposite is true, because it's during that deep sleep that you get, essentially, information

222
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,660
transfer within the brain. It's a file transfer mechanism. The way to think about this is,

223
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,860
let's say it's like longwave radio. If you're in the city, you tune into FM, which is shortwave

224
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,540
radio. You can pick up a bunch of signals. Then the further you drive out into the desert,

225
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,060
let's say here in California, you just lose those channels, because the range from the tower

226
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,540
is so short that you just lose that range. But if you go onto the longwave radio stations,

227
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:51,220
you can still pick up stations for hundreds of miles. Why? Because the carrier frequency

228
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,980
of those radio waves is much slower. The distance over which you can transfer information

229
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:06,660
is much further. Deep sleep is a brain state of long distance information transfer.

230
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,540
ALICE Is there morphologically a difference

231
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,340
that you can see between stages three and four, which are obviously both delta waves,

232
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
but how do you distinguish those two?

233
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,540
JONATHAN Technically, no. The way it's defined is that what proportion of a 30-second period of time,

234
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,420
and that's the way that we score sleep, I'll have you sleep for eight hours, then I'll chop up that

235
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,180
eight hours into 30-second bits of information. For each 30 seconds, you'll get a sleep score,

236
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:41,300
and then we add them all up. What differentiates stage three of deep non-REM sleep from the very

237
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:48,100
deeper stage, which is stage four non-REM sleep, is simply what proportion of that 30 seconds

238
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:56,900
is consumed by that deep slow brainwave activity. If it's less than 50%, then it's stage three. If

239
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:06,820
it's more than 50%, stage four. Morphologically, no. Although, if you really look at it morphologically,

240
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:15,620
on average, yes. The waves are typically larger in amplitude and slower in frequency in stage four

241
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,220
than they are in stage three.

242
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,780
ALICE Do people always progress

243
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,140
monotonically through these, or do sometimes people go one, two, four, three REM, for example?

244
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,100
You have to go through three to get to four.

245
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,500
ALICE You have to go to three to get to four. You have to go from two to get to three to get to four.

246
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,260
With the exception of probably, let's see, two examples. One is pathological. If you suffer from

247
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,780
narcolepsy, one of the things that typically happens is that you go from being awake straight

248
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,980
into REM sleep. To finish the 90-minute cycle, and this will make sense, you go stage one to stage

249
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,700
two, stage two, three, three, four. Then after about 70 minutes, you'll rise back up into stage

250
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,540
two, and then finally you'll pop up into REM sleep. Then you'll have a short REM sleep period,

251
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,820
and then you'll go back down again, down into non-REM sleep, up into REM, down into non-REM sleep,

252
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:20,420
up into REM. You do that, as I said, every 90 minutes. However, what changes is the ratio

253
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:27,780
of non-REM to REM within that 90-minute period as you move across the night, such that in the

254
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,700
first half of the night, the majority of your 90-minute sleep cycles are comprised of lots of deep

255
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,780
non-REM sleep and very little REM sleep. But as you push through to the second half of the night,

256
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,220
now the seesaw balance changes, and the majority of those sleep cycles are comprised much more of

257
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,980
rapid eye movement sleep and almost no deep sleep. That's why it's always dangerous when

258
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,340
people say, I'm one of those who survives on six, six and a half hours of sleep at night. I wake up

259
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,820
five, five, 30 to get a jumpstart on the day. You can ask, well, let's say you're getting six hours

260
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,580
of sleep. How much sleep are you losing? They will say, well, according to your definition of eight

261
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,500
hours of sleep, well, I'm 25% off because I lose two hours at the end of an eight-hour night of

262
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:25,620
sleep, so I'm losing 25%. Yes and no, because yes, you're losing 25% of total sleep, but you could

263
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:32,500
be losing up to 70% of all of your REM sleep because it's the REM sleep rich phase that you

264
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,260
are shortchanging to get a jumpstart on the day. So you've got to be very careful when you try to

265
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,500
think of your sleep dynamics. But to come back to your point, sorry, yes, you always have to go

266
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,220
through that linear progression. Norecolepsy is a standout case there. You'll usually go from

267
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,900
wakefulness sometimes immediately into REM sleep. Very frightening. Most people don't experience

268
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,980
logical, rational waking consciousness and then go immediately into irrational,

269
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,620
hallucinogenic consciousness, which is what REM sleep is. It's very disturbing when you speak to

270
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,620
these patients. The other is if you are horrifically REM sleep deprived or chronically sleep deprived,

271
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,700
occasionally you can make the transition straight into REM sleep. We see this in people who are

272
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,460
abusing alcohol heavily, who are alcoholics. Alcohol will come onto this, blocks your REM sleep.

273
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,220
You can build up such a hunger for REM sleep that the brain says, well, tonight I'm going to forego

274
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,620
the non-REM sleep. I'm just going to go and feast on REM sleep straight away. There's hysteresis in

275
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,980
the system, maladaptively so. That's a bad sign when you get hysteresis like that, that type of pressure.

276
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:47,860
Matt, last time we sat down, you talked briefly about the sleep chronotypes. I've found this

277
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,140
interesting for basically two reasons. One is just observing probably a migration in my own

278
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:59,780
daughter's chronotype, which is she's getting older. She's sleeping in longer in the mornings

279
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,820
and going to bed later and later. I know that as she gets closer and closer to being a teenager,

280
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,540
that's probably going to increase. But also just more cognizant, I think, of other people.

281
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,700
You've alluded to it briefly earlier, which is like there are just people who are going to go to

282
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,340
bed later and wake up later. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with that or there's

283
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,460
anything wrong with the reverse, which is people who go to bed early and wake up really early.

284
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:28,020
Kind of wondering if there's a way to actually know what chronotype you are

285
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:36,580
beyond just observation because is it possible that the observation is not your optimal state?

286
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,780
In other words, if you have somebody who's sleeping a certain way because their job is

287
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,660
imposing it, but it's not the way that they're ideally meant to do it. Let me give a better

288
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:54,100
example. A student in college could easily drift into a later chronotype because everybody in their

289
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,260
dorm room is, even though they may actually be more suited to be earlier. How can one figure

290
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,620
this out? There are genetic tests that will give you a stronger sense of your chronotype.

291
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,140
Chronotype simply means, yeah, are you a morning person? Are you an evening person or are you

292
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,220
somewhere in between? Somewhere between 25 to 30 percent of the population are morning types,

293
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,180
25 to 30 percent are evening types, and then the rest of us are somewhere in between.

294
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,260
Sleep science has then gone a little bit further. We split it into five categories sometimes,

295
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:36,180
which is extreme morning types, morning types, middle evening types, and extreme evening types.

296
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:44,900
We know that it is under strong genetic control for two reasons. First, there is a significant

297
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,580
degree of heritability. If you are a morning type, it's more than likely that one or both of your

298
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,860
parents were morning types. Secondly, we now know that there are a collection of genes that will

299
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:05,620
determine to a degree your chronotype. This is why companies like 23andMe will tell you what type you

300
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,180
are or they will give you a probabilistic estimation of what type you are. Last count, I think, from

301
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,500
data from 23andMe and this data from the UK Biobank, there are about nine different genes that

302
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,340
we know of right now that will contribute to your chronotype. Most of them are what we call

303
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:32,340
clock genes. This refers to the fact that these genes control the rhythm of your circadian cycle.

304
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,860
Those genes don't control necessarily the size of your circadian rhythm, in other words, how

305
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:47,060
it's kind of strongly active and awake you are during the day and how deeply down you go at night.

306
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,060
These genes do something different. These genes control when that sinusoidal wave of your circadian

307
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:02,260
cycle arrives on the clock face. What I mean by that is, if you have a certain type of gene

308
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:10,500
complement that makes you a morning type, your activation peak, your peak alertness, is going to

309
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,220
arrive earlier in the day and your awesome downstroke of your circadian rhythm will arrive

310
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:24,580
earlier in the evening. Whereas if you have a different combination of these gene composites,

311
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,500
then you could be an evening type. In other words, your circadian rhythm looks very similar in its

312
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,060
sinusoidal pattern, but when the peak and the trough of that circadian rhythm arrive on the

313
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:45,860
24-hour clock face is very different to a morning type. We know that there is a complement of genes

314
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,780
that you are given at birth that will determine on average once you're an adult, are you a morning

315
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,060
type or are you an evening type? What you alluded to, however, for your daughter was something

316
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:04,580
different, which is that no matter what chronotype you are, that innate chronotype rhythm that you

317
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:12,980
have gifted by your genes will change as you develop from a young child to an adolescent teen

318
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,060
to an adult to an older adult. In other words, you go from being much more of a morning type when

319
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,060
you're a kid, even though you want to stay awake longer, you're found on the couch and you're

320
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,820
carried to bed and you're fast asleep, to then being a teen where your chronotype fast forwards

321
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,060
in time. This is a problem for early school start times where you're putting kids to bed at 9pm and

322
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,460
saying you've got to go to bed because you have to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning to catch a 530

323
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,260
bus for a 715 start time. Well, there's no point in saying that. It's not their fault that they're

324
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,740
now in bed and it's 1030 an hour and a half later and they can't fall asleep as a 15-year-old

325
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,180
because their chronotype has moved forward in time. They want to go to bed later and wake up later.

326
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:04,020
Nothing they can do about it. It's biology. And then once they become an adult, it starts to

327
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,300
shuttle back a little bit once they become sort of, you know, moderate age 30 or 40. And then as we

328
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,900
start to get older, we regress. That's why in Florida there's something called the early bird

329
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:21,620
special where people are going out for dinner at, you know, 4pm or 5pm because their chronotype has

330
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:28,180
regressed back and they're in bed by, you know, 8pm. So there are genetic tests to come back to

331
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,700
your question. However, you don't need to do a genetic test to get close to understanding what

332
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,340
you are. There is a pencil and paper method that sleep scientists have developed and you can Google

333
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,700
it. It's called the MEQ test and maybe I'll send you the link and we can put it in the show notes.

334
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.

335
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,740
And it's a very simple link that you just click and it's a test. It probably takes about five or

336
00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:00,020
six minutes to fill out. And it's called the MEQ test, the morning eveningness questioner test.

337
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,380
And you go through, you answer a list of questions and at the end you add up your score and it will

338
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:11,140
tell you what flavor of chronotype you are. And what's nice is that then they've pattern matched

339
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,860
this test and validated it against these genes, these genetic tests. And there's a pretty good

340
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:24,100
correlation. It's not too far off. So this is the poor man's version of the 23andMe test if you want

341
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,620
it. And we'll do a link in the show notes and you can take it. And that's a cheaper way,

342
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,700
pencil and paper method or an online method. So the bigger question is, Matt, what do we do with

343
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,220
this information? I mean, you've, I think we did talk about this previously at one point that

344
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,020
you have a couple who have different chronotypes that can be really difficult. They're going to

345
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,660
bed and waking up at different times. You've already alluded to the problem of children who

346
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,780
are, I think being subjected to potentially too much early school when in reality they probably

347
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,740
would do better with later school. Is this the kind of thing that should factor into decisions

348
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,220
people make about when they pick classes in college? Like, I mean, it seems like there seems

349
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,180
to be, this seems to be one of those things where there might be a bunch of people that

350
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,300
go through life kind of miserable when they don't have control over their schedule,

351
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,780
as opposed to knowing this. And so would knowing this by itself provide a benefit to folks?

352
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:24,740
I think it would. I think it would explain a lot about why you struggle so much where other people

353
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,940
seem to be just these energizer bunnies and they've even got time to go to the gym for an hour before

354
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,740
they sit down at their office desk at 7am in the morning. And you're still on your fourth cup of

355
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,780
coffee desperately trying to wake up and you're struggling to make it in by 7.15, having woken up

356
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:49,460
20 minutes before. And I think the second thing that it helps with is realizing that you're not

357
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,340
culpable. It's sort of non-mere culpa. It's not your fault. You can understand that this is

358
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,860
genetic because a lot of night hours have gone throughout life being chastised and thinking,

359
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,940
well, if only I could get my act together and get to bed earlier and stop being what people tell me

360
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:15,780
I am, which is slothful or lazy. I could hold down a better job. And again, I think society

361
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:23,460
needs to be much more understanding of it and also then modifying itself in response to

362
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:31,380
accommodate it. And neither of those things I see in full serving scoop sizes in society right now.

363
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,580
That should change. And I think COVID is interesting because if there's some positive

364
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,500
upside to it, it may have given us the chance for people to understand how much better they can

365
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,660
sleep when they're closer in harmony with their own chronotype rather than trying to work against

366
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,780
it. Because when you fight biology, you normally lose. And the way you know you've lost is often

367
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,380
through disease and sickness. And I think there is a version of that going on here.

368
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:07,780
I also think it can sometimes explain incorrect insomnia. Often I'll hear someone tell me if I'm

369
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,860
sort of out in the public, they'll say, well, I suffer from insomnia, I get into bed, and I can't

370
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,700
fall asleep. And I'm wide awake for the first hour and a half. And I need to take some sleeping pills.

371
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,740
And then I'll, I'll say, you know, first thing, I'm not a doctor. But let me just ask you a question.

372
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,340
If you were on a desert island with no responsibilities, nobody to wake up for,

373
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,300
nothing to do. And you could just sleep whenever you want to get up whenever you want. What time

374
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,940
would you normally go to bed? And they would say, well, I would actually like to go to bed at

375
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,140
midnight and wake up around eight o'clock in the morning in truth. But I have to get up for my job,

376
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,420
I have to wake up at six, I'm getting in bed at 10. But I still have this terrible insomnia.

377
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,020
And I say, well, you know, I don't know this, but it's possible that what you could have is not

378
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:02,180
insomnia, but a mismatch between your chronotype and your working life schedule. And you may want

379
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,500
to explore some of this. And there's a test and meq test and I tell them about this, and then go

380
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,460
and speak to your doctor. So that's the second implication that I think comes from the question

381
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,900
that you asked about how it impacts society. Once you know it, what do we do about it? And what

382
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:26,900
should we be doing about it? Those are some of the ramifications, I think. I forgot to say in

383
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:34,020
the episodes before, and I'd love to say it now is about sleep opportunity versus duration. We've

384
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,420
constantly been speaking about in our discussions, how much sleep does a person need? What's the

385
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,780
optimal amount? And we're speaking about somewhere between seven to nine hours. When I say that,

386
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:51,380
I'm talking about seven to nine hours of sleep. Not time in bed where you might lose 10 to 15%

387
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,140
of it. Right. And this is the reason that when I think people who say, well, surely you can get by

388
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,460
on six and a half hours of sleep or seven hours of sleep, you've got to be very careful because

389
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,020
that's a dangerous statement. This comes to something that we call sleep efficiency. Now,

390
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,060
if you are in your forties, you will probably have, if you're healthy, you'll probably have

391
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,740
a sleep efficiency of what we call 90%. In other words, of the time that you're in bed,

392
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:23,940
90% of that time is asleep and 10% of the time is awake. So let's take an eight hour sleep period

393
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,700
and you think, well, I'm in bed for eight hours, so I'm good. I'm getting my eight hours of sleep.

394
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:36,180
That's not true. Eight hours of sleep is what? That's 480 minutes if my math is correct.

395
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,500
If you get a 10% loss of efficiency, it's like a heating system, you lose 10% of it.

396
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,940
You're down to 712.

397
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,940
You're down to 712. So in other words, for you as a 40 year old with a healthy sleep efficiency of

398
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,180
90% for you to get eight hours of sleep, you need to be in bed for eight hours and 48 minutes.

399
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,540
Even a bit longer, actually.

400
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,420
Yeah, or even a bit longer. So you've got to be very careful. That's why I constantly speak about

401
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,500
a sleep opportunity of eight to nine hours in bed to get your seven to eight hours of

402
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,180
total sleep, if that makes sense.

403
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,620
And this is where I think devices like the Oura Ring are very helpful because

404
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,100
that's where they're very good. They're very good at telling you you were in bed this long,

405
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,660
but you're actually only asleep this long. And that's the number we want the patients to fixate

406
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,220
on. We don't even look at time in bed when we give our patients feedback. We're talking about

407
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,060
total sleep time and efficiency. So if there's a problem with total sleep time and efficiency

408
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:39,140
is low, you have to improve the quality. If total sleep time is low and efficiency is high,

409
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,580
you need more time in bed. And it's getting people to understand that distinction. That's

410
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,380
very important.

411
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:49,940
And the caveat that comes for people with insomnia, though, that I'm here saying you need to increase

412
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,740
your time in bed, your sleep opportunity, as I call it, to make sure that you get the right

413
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,820
total amount of sleep and you have to accept there is inefficiency in the system and you need

414
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,820
to extend your time in bed to overcome that slight inefficiency. So again, sort of eight

415
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,860
hours and 15 minutes to get your eight hours total sleep. The only time I would say that you should

416
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:17,300
not be thinking about longer time in bed is if you're someone who is struggling with insomnia

417
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,860
and you're lying in bed awake a lot of the time.

418
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,820
Reprogramming.

419
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,780
We actually do the opposite, which is we actually shorten your sleep opportunity.

420
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,060
We crunch that down. It's one of the tools that we have in the CBTI toolbox.

421
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,060
That's right. So you want to drive the efficiency up by taking the denominator out.

422
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,340
People have lost their confidence in going into the bedroom and sleeping constantly soundly

423
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,140
throughout the night. So what we end up doing is actually constraining them maybe down to just six

424
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,820
hours of sleep opportunity. We put them on a diet of sleep opportunity rather than an extension.

425
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,100
And very quickly what happens. So it's ironic. You come to me and you say, I'm not sleeping well.

426
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,300
And I say, great, I'm going to have you sleep less. And you say ridiculous. It's not what you

427
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,860
do is by compressing that window down, you're sleeping less and you're building up more of

428
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,420
that sleep pressure because as a consequence of the reduction of sleep opportunity time,

429
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,300
you're going to be awake during the day longer, the longer that you're awake, the more of that

430
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,300
sleep pressure you build up. So firstly, you're coming into the following night with even more

431
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,100
sort of sleepiness on your shoulders. And then secondly, I'm teaching the brain,

432
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:34,820
unlike it's been given luxury time to just be awake as long as it wants to at night and maybe

433
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:41,140
sleep some. And that's that phenotype of insomnia, awake time at night. By constraining that time,

434
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,900
I start to force your brain to realize, I'm sorry, you no longer have the luxury of having

435
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,780
all of this time to sort of be awake and be asleep. And very quickly, the brain starts to realize and

436
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,140
learn that in fact, it only has this tiny opportunity at the dinner table called sleep that is six hours.

437
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,100
And now you start to brute force efficiency. The brain starts to realize, my goodness,

438
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,860
I've only got six hours. I need to get my sleep into that six hours. So efficiency markedly

439
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:23,220
increases when you constrain total amount of time in bed. So it's this ironic way that we help treat

440
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:30,260
insomnia. We constrain total sleep time, you brute force efficiency and a brute force response from

441
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:40,740
the brain. And all of a sudden, something magical happens. Now that we've set the stage for what

442
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,020
sleep is and why it's so important, the next set of clips will really look at ways in which we can

443
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,300
improve sleep. These clips will look at the pros and cons of napping, proper sleep hygiene, and an

444
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,940
ideal wind down routine, optimal temperature for sleep and how Matt changed his thinking on blue

445
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:06,820
light. The question now comes down to one of napping, which we did touch on in our previous

446
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:13,220
episode, but I want to revisit it. Lots of times patients come to me and say, Peter, you have no

447
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:20,340
idea what a 20 minute nap does for me between two and four o'clock in the afternoon. And my

448
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,940
historical response to that has been, gosh, you really shouldn't need a nap. I mean, if you're

449
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,740
sleeping correctly, isn't that actually a negative thing because it's depleting some of that

450
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,860
adenosine based pressure and wouldn't you be better off letting the pressure cook or cook,

451
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:43,860
driving you into a deeper sleep when you first take your sleep? So what are your thoughts on

452
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:50,500
that type of a nap? That sort of short 20 minute, late afternoon, pre-dinner nap?

453
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:58,500
Naps really are a double edged sword. And we've done lots of studies where we use naps to study

454
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,500
the functions of sleep and we see benefits from naps. Even naps as short as 17 minutes can produce

455
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,420
learning and memory benefits. So there does seem to be some enhancement that you get. And you can

456
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:19,620
see that from cardiovascular benefits as well. The downside of naps is that it can take away just

457
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,340
what you described, which is sleep pressure. And so the typical recommendation that we have

458
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:32,420
is the following. If you are struggling with sleep at night, avoid naps during the day. Because what

459
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,620
you want to do if you are already having problems either falling asleep, which is what we call sleep

460
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,620
onset insomnia, or you can fall asleep but you can't stay asleep, which is what we call sleep

461
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:51,700
maintenance insomnia. You want to build up as much sleep pressure, as much sleepiness as you possibly

462
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,220
can during the day. If you are struggling with your sleep at night, do not nap during the day.

463
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,660
And the pressure cooker analogy is beautiful. Keep building up all of that healthy sleepiness

464
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,540
pressure. Because when you nap, it's like having the valve on the cooker open up and you just

465
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,380
release some of that healthy sleepiness. And now when it comes time to go to bed, you're not going

466
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:20,180
to feel as sleepy anymore. However, on the flip side, if you are not struggling with your sleep

467
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:27,460
and you can nap regularly during the day, the advice is naps can be just fine. Because in fact,

468
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,100
if you take a step back from an evolutionary perspective and you study hunter gatherer tribes

469
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,780
whose way of life hasn't changed for thousands of years, they don't necessarily sleep the way that

470
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,820
we do in modernity. In fact, particularly during the summer months, they will typically have an

471
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:48,420
afternoon nap right in the time zone that you just described. And this is the very much the

472
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:55,140
Mediterranean siesta like behavior. And in fact, if I stick an electrode on both of our heads

473
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,740
throughout the day, and I monitor our physiological brainwave activity, it'll stick much better to my

474
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:06,100
head, by the way, than you. Well, yeah, right now, especially because I've got this terrible COVID

475
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,980
hairdo, which I look like I should be out of book Rogers and anybody who remembers that

476
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:16,500
television show. But anyway, what we will see is that somewhere between about two to four p.m.,

477
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,980
both you and I will have this kind of drop in our physiological alertness, in our physiological

478
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:29,620
level of brain activity. In other words, as if as a species, we're almost pre-programmed

479
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:36,500
to have this enforced dip in our alertness. And so many people see this, you know, in the afternoon

480
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,300
meetings around the boardroom table or wherever you sort of get these ugly head nods that start

481
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,180
to happen. It's not people listening to good music. It's just that people have this sort of

482
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:52,900
they're falling asleep, the falling prey to this what seems to be a genetically hardwired pre-programmed

483
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:59,540
drop in our alertness, as if maybe we should be what's called biphasically sleeping as a species

484
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,900
at times during the year, rather than monophasically sleeping, which is how we do in most

485
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:11,540
first world nations. In other words, one single bout of sleep at night versus two bouts of sleep,

486
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,620
which is how those hunt together a tribe sleep, especially during the summer.

487
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:21,380
And so Matt, would they sleep long enough in that two to four window that they would get a full 90

488
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,900
minutes, say, and get through a full cycle? And then if so, did that mean when they did their

489
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,660
nighttime sleep, presumably they would stay up later and get maybe six hours in the evening

490
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,580
instead of, you know, because people always talk about how well hunter gatherer studies have always

491
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:42,660
suggested that, you know, seven and a half to nine is the species required amount of sleep on average.

492
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,420
But you're saying it was potentially broken into two chunks. Was that afternoon daytime chunk

493
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,140
or daylight chunk call it about 90 minutes?

494
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:57,460
No, it wasn't. It was actually typically shorter than that on that basis. But you're right. They

495
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,700
typically are not sleeping. What we currently recommend for monophasic sleep, which is the

496
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:09,220
average adult should get somewhere between seven to nine hours. That's the recommended range that

497
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:16,020
we all provide. But what they would typically do is they would maybe sleep just six, six and a half

498
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,940
hours at night. And then they would make the rest up and they would get into that exact same sort

499
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:28,820
of territory by way of the nap. So they would take it in these two chunks. Now, I should note,

500
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,980
this is very different to something else that's been described in the literature, which is first

501
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:40,740
sleep and second sleep. That activity does seem to have occurred during our historical past. It

502
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:46,580
seemed to have emerged in the sort of Dickensian era. That was different, though. That was where

503
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,500
people would sleep for the first four hours. Then they would wake up in the middle of the night.

504
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,460
They would write. They would drink. They would play music. They would make love. And then they

505
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:01,220
would go back for another four hours of sleep. Did that happen? Yes, it seems to have based on

506
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:07,700
historical writings. But is that the way our physiology and our circadian rhythms are designed?

507
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,900
No, it doesn't seem to be. There's usually one study that's cited that suggests maybe we should

508
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,420
do that. But overall, the physiology that we know of for human beings doesn't seem to suggest that

509
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:25,700
that was more sociologically driven rather than biologically driven. Biologically, we may be

510
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,380
biphasic, but very differently, according to this Hunt Together, a sort of tri-pipothesis. By the

511
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,460
way, the other thing that's interesting in those Hunt Together is, and it comes on to what I think

512
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,540
we described before, which is this concept of midnight. Most of us don't think of what the term

513
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:48,820
means. But in those individuals, it means what the word states, which is, it's the middle of the

514
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:56,180
night for them, midnight, because they usually go to bed maybe two hours after sundown. And they're

515
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:04,180
asleep by, let's say, 9pm in the evening or 8.30. And then they're awake just a little bit before

516
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,460
dawn. In fact, what's interesting, and maybe we'll get on to this in later discussions, but

517
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:15,460
what seems to wake them up is not necessarily daylight. It's the change in temperature,

518
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:23,620
because there's a rise in temperature that seems to happen before daylight starts to break. And it

519
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,940
seems to be it's the temperature change that they are much more buckled to in terms of regulation

520
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:36,660
of their sleep weight rhythm. And so the way in which the structure of their sleep by phasing is

521
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:44,020
different to ours in modernity. And the timing of their sleep is different to some of our timing.

522
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,100
For many people, midnight is the time that you think, well, I should just check Facebook one

523
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:54,980
last time, or send my last text. That's what midnight means. But normally for a couple of

524
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,780
thousand years, or hundreds of thousands of years, it probably meant that was the middle

525
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,420
of your solar cycle, and it was the middle of your sleep cycle.

526
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,380
I'm glad I'm closer to our ancestors. If I could go to bed at eight o'clock every

527
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,420
night and wake up at four, that is a perfect night of sleep for me.

528
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,940
Matt, and on previous episodes, obviously, we went into some pretty good depth on

529
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:30,260
tricks, tips, etc. Inside our practice, we have a whole sleep hygiene protocol. And

530
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,780
we sort of run patients through it relatively early, especially if they're having any sleep issues. But

531
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,380
do you mind just sort of going through where you are now and how you think about this? And again,

532
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,820
I'll caveat this by saying, you're not a sleep physician. So it is not your practice to be out

533
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,900
there treating any one individual with respect to their sleep. But also, you're infinitely more

534
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,420
qualified than virtually anybody to help people start to think through what the parameters are

535
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,660
that factor into sleep. And that's the way we kind of explain it, which is, look, here are these five

536
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,420
or six levers of sleep. And here's how you could move each of them in your control. But I kind of

537
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,780
want to hear how you think of it. Yeah, so I think in our past episodes, we've gone through

538
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:20,180
sort of the fine five main sort of sleep hygiene tips. And I'll just quickly go through them here,

539
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,420
because we've dealt with them before, which is regularity going to bed at the same time,

540
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,660
waking up at the same time, getting lots of darkness at night, because we are a dark deprived

541
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,780
society. And I actually think I've done a bad job of describing to the public the importance

542
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,340
of the opposite, which is making sure you get daylight during the first half of the day,

543
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,740
I think that's just as important. Then temperature, we've spoken about that a little bit,

544
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,500
you need to get cool to get to sleep. And it's the reason that you will always find it easier to

545
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,900
fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. You shouldn't stay in bed awake. That trains

546
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:02,180
your brain to be triggered by your bed and force you awake because you have a learned association.

547
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,140
So if you've been awake for 20 minutes, then get up, go and do something else, and only come back

548
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:14,420
to bed when you're sleepy is the general rule. And then finally, you know, trying to avoid alcohol

549
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:20,100
and caffeine in the afternoon and for alcohol in the evenings, as we've said. So those are the

550
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:26,980
sort of typical tips. But I think if I were to add a few others, the other one that's absolutely

551
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:33,780
critical that I probably haven't espoused enough is a wind down routine. Because many people in

552
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:39,780
society expect sleep to be like a light switch, that we should just jump into bed, and we should

553
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,500
just turn off the light and the brain should do something similar and go straight into sleep.

554
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:51,380
Sleep as a physiological process, if you study it, it's just not like that. Sleep is much more like

555
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:59,540
trying to land a plane. It takes time to gradually descend down onto that hard foundation of this

556
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:05,620
thing that we call a stable night of sleep. So give yourself some wind down, opportunity time,

557
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:11,220
build it into your routine. For some people, it's 15 minutes, others, it's 30 minutes. Light

558
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,740
stretches, meditation, putting all of your phones and your gadgets away, staying clear of any

559
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,820
inbound in the last 30 minutes, whatever it takes, set it up, and then maintain it. Because

560
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,700
if you have kids, you'll know all about this, you know, you have a routine for the kids, and

561
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,260
you've got to try and stick to it. If you break the routine, bad things usually happen with sleep.

562
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:37,540
We're the same as adults, there's no difference. So I think that's the first thing I would say.

563
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:46,260
The second, probably, tweak is, if you are struggling with sleep, remove all clock faces

564
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:54,020
from your bedroom. It's not going to help you to know that it's now 2.35am in the morning,

565
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,420
and you've still not been able to fall asleep. It's only going to trigger more anxiety.

566
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,740
And there's been a nice study here from UC Berkeley, not from my center, but from another

567
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:08,180
sleep researcher, Alison Harvey, who looked at this in people who were poor sleepers with insomnia.

568
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:14,020
Removing clock faces can certainly help. The next thing I would say is that try to keep,

569
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:20,660
of course, all of your technology outside of the bedroom. And if you can, don't make it the first

570
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,380
thing that you check in the morning. Because for most of us, the first thing that we do when we

571
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:31,620
wake up is that we swipe right, and this flood of anxiety just washes onto us like a tsunami.

572
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,220
And that's problematic, not just because it's a bad way to start your day, but because you train

573
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,900
your brain in this Pavlovian way that every morning, as you're taking yourself into bed at

574
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:50,020
night, every morning, what's coming to you when you wake up is this jag of what we call anticipatory

575
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:56,900
anxiety. And it lightens your sleep throughout the night because of that expectation. So try to

576
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:03,060
avoid that. If you absolutely have to, and again, trying not to be puritanical, take your phone into

577
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,020
the bedroom. One of the other problems is that it causes what we call sleep procrastination,

578
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,900
which is that you're sitting there in bed, you've got your device and you think, well,

579
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:16,660
I'll just check Amazon and order that thing. I'll just check Facebook and I'll send that last email

580
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,940
and you look up and now it's 40 minutes later. The rule of thumb that a friend, a colleague of

581
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:27,460
mine, Michael Gradner said, I love this. If you're going to have your phone in your bedroom,

582
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:33,460
the rule is that you can only use it if you're standing up. And after standing up for about five

583
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,340
or 10 minutes of phone use, you just think, I just want to sit down. I just want to get into bed.

584
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,300
And at that point, the rule is you've got to put your phone away. So those would be sort of three

585
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,180
additional things that I would advise that can really help. I like that a lot. I would actually

586
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:54,740
add just from a personal standpoint, I've maybe three months ago instituted a little policy for

587
00:55:54,740 --> 00:56:01,220
myself that I've really enjoyed, which is not looking at my phone for an hour when I wake up.

588
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,220
Yes. Luckily, I don't sleep with my phone in my room. So that's not an issue, but it used to

589
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:13,540
certainly be the first thing I'd go and grab when I got up. And if I get up at five, I won't look at

590
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:19,460
it till usually after 6am. And that's interesting. I didn't realize that the effect that that could

591
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:25,700
have on my brain as I'm coming into consciousness, knowing that I'm not going to be flooded with

592
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,300
information, especially the type of information I don't like, which is generally all the information

593
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,820
on my phone. Yeah, I'll just take two additional pins in that. The first is, I think any

594
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:40,260
everyone has had this experience in the extremities, where you know you've got to wake up the next day

595
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,460
for an interview, or you've got to wake up for a flight that you have to catch. You know for a fact

596
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,940
that firstly, your sleep is going to be shallow, it's not going to be particularly deep. And

597
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:55,540
secondly, you almost wake up two minutes before the alarm because you're that on edge. Well, imagine

598
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,660
a diluted version of that. But every single day, that's what bringing your phone into the bedroom

599
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:06,580
and opening it up first thing is all about. The second thing I would say is you're right,

600
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:12,420
and set manageable goals, I really enjoy the work of a guy called BJ Fogg, who's a researcher at

601
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,220
Stanford who looks at behavioral change. And it's all about incremental. So if you're trying to get

602
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:22,740
someone to floss their teeth for the first time for dental hygiene, don't say, okay, here's how you

603
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:28,020
floss, you need to floss before you go to bed. You say all you're allowed to do for the first week is

604
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:35,300
floss your front two teeth, and you cannot do any more. That's it. And then we say then's the

605
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:41,460
next, then add two more teeth for the next week, and then two more. The same with sleep. If you are

606
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:46,100
accustomed to doing this with your phone, which is so understandable for all of the pressures that

607
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:52,500
we understand from society and social media, start by saying, I'm going to give myself five minutes,

608
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:57,380
I'm going to firstly not check my phone, I'm just going to wake up, brush my teeth, and make whatever

609
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:03,060
drink that I have in the morning. And when I sit down, that's when I am gifted the opportunity to

610
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:08,580
look at my phone, and then try to push it to 10 minutes, and then try to see if you can get

611
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,060
changed, have your shower, wash yourself up, whatever you do in the morning, and only then

612
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:18,100
open up your phone and keep pushing it longer and longer, make it a manageable goal. Otherwise,

613
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:23,460
don't set yourself up for failure, do it for success. Yeah, I think the same advice is great

614
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:29,140
for something like meditation, where for many people saying, hey, why don't you commit to 20

615
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,420
minutes of meditation a day? I mean, that's almost impossible out of the gate. But if it's,

616
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:39,140
hey, meditate every day, and if you do a three-minute meditation, you're better off doing three

617
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,860
minutes a day than 20 minutes once a week. I think it's the same sort of idea, which I agree,

618
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:49,220
I think it becomes a lot easier. The last thing I would say is that none of these tips that we've

619
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,860
spoken about, which are typically sleep hygiene tips, are going to work if you actually have a

620
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:00,020
sleep disorder. So the analogy here, again, from a colleague, if I'm an athletic sports coach,

621
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:05,300
and I'm giving you all of these tips for improving your performance, but you've got a broken ankle,

622
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,140
none of them are going to make any difference to your performance until we actually get you to a

623
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:15,060
doctor and fix the broken ankle. It's the same with a sleep disorder. If you have insomnia,

624
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,700
or if you have sleep apnea, none of these things that I've been talking about are going to help

625
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,340
you. If you suspect that you have either one of those, definitely go and see your doctor,

626
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:35,620
see if you can get some kind of sleep intervention. Okay, let's shift on to temperature. We have a

627
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:41,700
ton of questions on this, including one of my patients who has specifically asked me to ask

628
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,500
you a bunch of questions on this. So I'm looking at all these questions, of which there are so

629
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,820
many, and I want to start at the top rather than... So I'm going to kind of mix up the order a little

630
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,300
bit on these. And this question in particular, I think is a great foray into the discussion.

631
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:01,300
The question is, did our ancestors get better quality sleep during certain times of the year

632
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:07,540
and or in certain climates? So for example, Death Valley in the summer, and I don't know how many of

633
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,620
our ancestors were spending that much time there, hopefully not too many, but presumably there are

634
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:18,100
hot places, cold places, et cetera. So I think what this question is obviously getting at is there's

635
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:23,460
a general belief that we sleep better when we're colder. There must have been a number of times

636
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,980
when our ancestors were either in places that were not cold or in places where at least during

637
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,580
a season it was warm. What can we infer or impute about sleep quality and temperature from that?

638
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,660
So the best taste that we have right now, again, comes back to some of these hunter-gatherer tribes.

639
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:44,660
Some of them live at different latitudes. And the best data that we have are folks who are very

640
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,740
close to the equator. And at that point you think, well, how is this going to answer the question?

641
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:55,380
Temperature variation where they're at is still quite significant from summer to winter. It turns

642
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:00,260
out it's just more about sort of, yes, rainy season and dry season, but the temperature does

643
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,180
fluctuate by some degrees too. And you can look at other communities that are a little bit further

644
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:09,140
out. But here's what we find in the summer. Typically, yes, they actually sleep less when

645
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,420
it's hotter, which is going against what needs to happen to your core body temperature to get good

646
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:19,380
sleep. It needs to drop and it needs to get cold. During the hotter seasons, they typically sleep

647
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:26,900
less at night. And then they seem to try and do some recovery by doing a short afternoon siesta.

648
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,380
But when they switch over to the winter season where it's cooler, it's a little bit darker,

649
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:36,740
but not that much. But it's really the temperature when they get cooler, then they sleep longer at

650
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:42,900
night. And the frequency with which they have daytime naps actually decreases. So I think that's

651
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:49,300
the best evidence that we have right now from just sort of going back to basics, homo sapiens,

652
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,660
what was going on in terms of temperature, the seasons give us the experiment, and the data

653
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:00,900
favors coldness for longer sleep. When you now bring that question to a laboratory,

654
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,700
where presumably you can take and someone has done this, I'm sure where they've taken subjects

655
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:12,500
and basically develop the optimization curve of all things equal but temperature,

656
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:18,580
there must be an optimization. There's probably temperatures at which you reduce latency. So

657
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:24,660
it's easier to get to bed, but maybe temperatures where it's harder to stay asleep. For example,

658
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:31,220
using myself as an example, I actually like to be really cold when I get in bed. And if I am,

659
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,820
it might take me a little longer to fall asleep a minute or two, but it almost guarantees I'll

660
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:42,580
sleep in a more uninterrupted fashion throughout the evening. There are times when I get into bed,

661
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,660
and this is again, not true at home because I can control the temperature in my home, I have

662
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,180
more difficulty controlling it here, for example, like we're in Bakersfield, it's hot as Hades,

663
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:56,100
the last two nights, and again, it could be the excitement of racing. But I also feel like I've

664
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,020
been waking up a little warm and I don't have my chili pad, I don't have that little cooling pad

665
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,940
on my blanket. I've had no issues with latency, but I'm waking up early. So if you run through

666
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:09,460
all the permutations and combinations of this, can one say there is an optimal room temperature

667
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:15,140
or air temperature or skin temperature or something that we should be driving towards?

668
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:21,700
So right now, the data that we have is somewhere around about 65 to 67 degrees is optimal for the

669
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:26,260
sleep of most people. Now there's going to be variability there for sure. And we know this,

670
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:31,460
we can see this in the data too. But it's actually even a little bit more complex than that.

671
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,140
And there've been studies that people have done where they almost strap in what looks like a

672
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:40,180
wetsuit, but it's got all of these veins that run throughout them. And we can calculate this water.

673
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,500
I think we've spoken a little bit about this before, where you can exquisitely control the

674
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:49,860
temperature hot or cold at any part of the body. And I'll summarize the findings as the following

675
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:57,460
in terms of temperature. It's a three-part story. For your extremities, you need to warm up to cool

676
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:05,940
down to fall asleep. Then you need to get cold to stay asleep, and then you need to warm up to wake

677
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:15,940
up. And so the reason that you may be finding latency easier here, but quality of sleep thereafter

678
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:21,060
worse is because it's counterintuitive. How do I drop your core body temperature? I'm going to tell

679
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:26,100
you, I'm going to warm you up. But the reason is because if you take a hot bath or a shower,

680
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:32,660
all of the blood is charmed to the surface of your skin and it radiates the heat out of the

681
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:37,380
core of your body. So in fact, your core body temperature plummets. It's the reason that hot

682
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,540
bath is great, not because you're toasty in bed. It's because your core body temperature is

683
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:47,540
plummeting once you get out. So this is why sometimes having a cold room but socks on,

684
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:53,140
or a cold room with a hot water bottle at the end of your bed, just to warm the feet, because it's

685
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:58,340
the feet and the hands that need to get a little bit warm to bring the blood, because they are the

686
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:05,860
best radiators of heat out of your body. So when we warm the pores of rats, for example, they fall

687
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:11,060
asleep faster because you're charming the heat out of the core of the body. So the answer to the

688
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:16,980
question really is a little bit more complex. Keep the room cool, warm yourself up a little bit

689
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:22,420
inside of bed to radiate that heat out and get you to sleep quicker. That will make the latency.

690
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:29,060
You fall asleep faster, in other words. Then the ambient temperature will keep your body cold

691
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:33,860
throughout that middle section and later section of sleep. And then if you have a sort of a smart

692
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:40,180
thermostat, you can rise that temperature, I would say actually quite late in the game, in the perhaps

693
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:46,020
in the last 20 minutes or the last 15 minutes. And that will try to rocket your temperature out

694
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,740
and bring you, you will wake up easier and feel less groggy if that temperature is higher. Now

695
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:58,500
it's hard because the ambient may not necessarily change much of what's going on under the covers,

696
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,060
but it's the reason that most people when they wake up, they would like a hot drink, even sometimes

697
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:08,180
in the summer, because the hot drink for the most parts, and people are just using caffeine and

698
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,580
that's what they think keeps them awake. But some of that benefit of the caffeine is actually not

699
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:18,420
caffeine. It's just the hot drink itself that is helping bring back up the core body temperature

700
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,780
that makes you feel more awake. So can we quantify the following? Someone comes to you and they say,

701
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,860
Matt, I'm doing all of these things off my checklist, but currently I sleep at a room

702
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:34,580
temperature of 75 degrees. How much better would you predict I would sleep if my room temperature

703
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:40,820
went from 75 to 65? So I think the hard part of this equation, and some people may face this too,

704
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:45,620
if they look at their data from sleep trackers, you're going to be sleeping better. We know

705
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:50,260
this is using population statistics for an individual, so this is always dangerous. And

706
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,900
I never want to sort of fall into that fallacy, but let's go with it. On average, people are more

707
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:01,380
likely to sleep considerably better at 65 than 75. Do you say that in terms of duration or stage

708
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:07,780
quality or what metric? So that's where the devil is in the details, because some people will see

709
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:12,260
it in terms of quantity, particularly the quantity of deep sleep. So when we do these studies, that's

710
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:17,220
where you see some of the greatest benefits for the cooling down throughout the night. That's where

711
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:23,460
sort of the thermal gradient can be beneficial. But what's not told is that the largest effect

712
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:29,060
size is not really in quantity, which is minutes, which is what your sleep tracker, your wristwatch,

713
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:35,060
or your ring will tell you. And you have to be very careful to judge the efficacy of that

714
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:41,460
experimental change on the basis of quantity and minutes. Because if anything, when you look at the

715
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:47,860
data, where you really see the effect is less so in minutes, which is quantity. Instead, it's in

716
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:54,900
quality, which is measured by the electrical brainwave signature. Now your wristwatch or your ring

717
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:01,140
is not going to be giving you that detail. So if you assume that the drop in temperature

718
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,780
has given you a nominal percentage benefit in terms of your deep sleep time, and therefore you

719
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:11,860
don't think it's worthwhile, I think you may want to sort of just second check that logic, because

720
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:17,220
there we're seeing it's qualitative that's more beneficial. And you as an individual, it's very

721
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:21,860
difficult for you to sense that qualitative change because you're non-conscious, of course. And

722
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:26,500
there's no good trackers out there right now that you can work typically on your periphery

723
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:36,260
that will tell you that metric. So with that said, it's not necessarily that hard of a question,

724
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:41,140
because I'm constantly trying to run these calculations about all of my scientific sleep

725
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:46,340
beliefs and think about these three buckets. I think the thing that I've probably changed

726
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:54,020
my mind on most or had a reversal on is the effects of blue light on our sleep. And in fact,

727
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,940
in the book, I spoke about a study at the time that had been done out of Harvard, which I still

728
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:03,700
think is valid, where they'd used an iPad, where you read on an iPad for an hour versus you read a

729
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:10,340
book under dim light. And they showed that that iPad had this detrimental effect on sleep, it had

730
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:16,180
delayed the release of melatonin, it had caused a reduction in REM sleep. And even when they stop

731
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:21,700
reading the iPad, it had a blast radius to it where the sleep quality was still bad for a couple

732
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:26,820
of days afterwards. And it was a compelling study and published in a good journal. But over the

733
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:31,620
years, I think there's been some research that's pushed back on that. And there's been some great

734
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:37,460
work from a university in Australia called Flinders University. And Michael Gradsdorf has done some

735
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:45,540
just great work on this at Flinders. He has changed my mind. I'm less bullish now about the idea that

736
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:51,700
these devices that we use are sleep disruptive because of the blue light. I still think that

737
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:57,140
has an effect. But what I think he's shown in some elegant work is that it's less about the light,

738
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:04,980
it's more about the fact that these devices are just so activating, that these devices are designed

739
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:11,620
to trigger alertness, and what we call physiological arousal in the brain. And in other words, what

740
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:16,500
happens when we use these devices, the reason that they're so disruptive to our sleep is less

741
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:25,460
about their blue light. It's more the fact that we are masking our sleepiness with this overriding

742
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:31,780
artificial activation from the devices. In other words, let's say that all of a sudden, it's 10pm

743
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:36,500
and you think, I'm wide awake, I'm on my computer, I'm working, I've got my phone next to me, I'm

744
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:41,940
checking it, it's pinging, it's dinging. All of a sudden, all of the lights go out, there's a massive

745
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:47,060
electromagnetic pulse that curses across your environment. It knocks out all of the devices,

746
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:52,820
you've got no phone, no iPad, no electricity. I suspect that within about 15 or 20 minutes,

747
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:59,300
you'd start to feel sleepy. And it's not because of the blue light effects, it's the fact that you

748
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:06,180
are, and you were all along, sleepy. But these devices, because they're so activating,

749
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:12,900
was creating a competing force that hit the mute button on the sleepiness, and it activated you.

750
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:20,340
So I've actually down-regulated my belief in the effects of blue light. And I've introduced this

751
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:26,580
new mental framework regarding the effects of the invasion of technology into our evening lives and

752
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:32,340
our bedrooms. And I'm much more now in our world with this idea that they are mentally stimulating

753
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:37,620
rather than blue light emitting. Forgive my ignorance for this question, but has the experiment

754
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:44,500
not been done where you've taken groups of subjects and you've subjected one group to just a blue light?

755
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:50,420
So an actual blue light that's hitting, I forget how many nanometers that is, but the actual...

756
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:54,500
Right, and the shorter that wavelength, yeah. Yeah. And then you have another group that is

757
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:59,620
just being blasted with red light, and then you have another group that is just being blasted with

758
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:04,260
a regular LED and white light. So you're getting the same intensity of light,

759
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:10,980
but you're moving the wavelength, and therefore you're nullifying the stimulatory effect of what's

760
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:16,340
being read or looked at. I mean, to me, that experiment would eloquently demonstrate whether

761
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:21,940
or not blue light per se is the problem. Has that not been done? It has. So people have played around

762
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:26,740
with the wavelength of the light, and what we believed is that it's the cooler blues, the shorter

763
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:31,620
wavelength light that are most detrimental. And the reason that screens were blamed is because

764
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:37,380
they are LED based, which is enriched in the lower visible light spectrum, the shorter wavelength,

765
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:42,660
in other words, the cool blues. And that's why the blame came because it was stamping the brakes on

766
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:47,460
melatonin, especially powerfully. And those studies were done. They were done by Chuck Seisler and

767
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:52,100
Steve Lockley from Harvard years ago, and that led to this sort of belief. And I still think

768
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,500
there's good validity in that. And by the way, there was a couple of studies that came out in

769
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:01,860
animals that were now suggesting at least, I think it was in rats or mice, I could be wrong,

770
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:06,180
or if it was in fruit flies, I apologize, where they actually found the opposite, where they found

771
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,940
that the warmer color lights had stronger blocking effects on melatonin. It began this sort of

772
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:18,100
controversy, had we got it wrong about blue light. And then this work from Flinders University,

773
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:24,100
from Michael, was coming online regarding this cognitive component. And it really sort of made

774
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,780
me shift my belief system. So yes, those studies have been done. And they principally looked at

775
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:35,700
melatonin. I think they studied less a full night of sleep with polysomnography and really asked the

776
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,940
downstream consequences. They were just simply saying, how does it affect your melatonin,

777
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:45,700
which is maybe one step short of saying, how does it then affect as a consequence of that change in

778
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:51,380
melatonin, your subsequent sleep, without necessarily doing a much more sophisticated

779
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:56,020
study, which I think are now being done, where you do the coke Pepsi challenge of

780
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:04,260
same amount of light stimulation. So light is standardized, right? Light becomes the variable

781
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,820
that's the only independent variable. That's right. And then you start measuring independent

782
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,820
variable at polysomn and melatonin for what it's worth and do everything.

783
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:18,100
ALICE And then you do a second round of studies where light actually becomes the constant

784
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,980
stimulus where you maintain the same light exposure. But in one condition, you're doing

785
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:29,300
something cognitively activating, like building a Facebook account or checking that versus you're

786
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:35,780
simply just there in front of the blue light. But there's no cognitive stimulation to really do the

787
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:40,900
two by two disambiguation of that. I think those studies are coming, but that's one of the things

788
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:47,300
where I've definitely changed my mind, I think, and I felt compelled to now speak more about that

789
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:57,540
and less about the blue light. The last set of clips will shift our focus to look at the effect

790
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:02,020
that caffeine can have on our sleep and the dangers of sleeping pills. If you found yourself enjoying

791
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:08,020
these clips and want more content, we have seven episodes with Matt, including three AMAs. These are

792
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:12,820
great pieces of content to go back to and listen to if you want to scratch this itch a little bit more.

793
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:22,900
ALICE The other place where I think I've changed my mind and maybe even some of my behavior

794
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:32,660
is around coffee and caffeine. The evidence has continued to mount and it's un-ignorable.

795
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:37,620
And now, again, these are mostly associational epidemiological studies, which both you and I

796
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:43,220
know are problematic for lots of different reasons. But they're so consistent that if you look at

797
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:51,460
coffee drinkers, they reliably de-risk a whole constellation of diseases that you want to avoid.

798
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:58,340
And yes, there is a dose dependency to it where once you get past three or four cups,

799
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:04,580
then things go in bad directions or the opposite direction at least. But for the most part,

800
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:09,940
there seems to be this set of very clear associations between low-to-moderate caffeine

801
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:16,660
consumption and de-risking health disease conditions. How on earth does this square with

802
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:21,780
Matt Walker's espousing of caffeine's impact on sleep and the fact that a lack of sleep seems

803
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:27,620
to be associated with many of those same conditions? The go-between here is that caffeine,

804
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:32,980
of course, can disrupt your sleep. So I've kind of modified my beliefs a little bit.

805
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:40,740
I think caffeine consumption is actually not only just fine, but maybe to be encouraged if there is

806
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:47,620
more causal evidence. I think you and Tim Ferriss would speak about this idea that the dose makes

807
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:52,980
the poison. And that is true with caffeine. But I also think there's a second variable here,

808
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:59,220
the dose and the timing make the poison when it comes to caffeine. If you're drinking it later in

809
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:04,980
the day, then I don't think we would see those same health benefits. We would see health detriments

810
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:11,620
and we don't have the data to help to find that. But then I've added a layer of complexity to that

811
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:16,500
after listening to a good friend of mine and a writer here in Berkeley, Michael Pollan,

812
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:22,980
who wrote a book on Audible that you can hear called Caffeine. And it goes into great depths.

813
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:28,100
And we spoke about this. He interviewed me for the book. He believes that the health benefits,

814
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:34,820
which are very hard to deny of caffeine, are not really due to a cup of coffee. It's actually the

815
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:41,060
fact that the coffee bean itself carries with it lots of antioxidants. And in fact, the reason

816
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:47,540
that you get these health benefits is because the antioxidants take a joy ride on the good bus of

817
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:53,700
this thing called caffeine. And his belief is that for Americans, for many Americans who don't get a

818
01:17:53,700 --> 01:18:01,380
balanced diet, coffee in the morning may be one of the only primary sources of antioxidant consumption.

819
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,020
And that's why you see the health associations. And in fact, I looked at a fantastic review from

820
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:12,900
2017. And what they found was that in fact, decaffeinated coffee, which carries the same

821
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:19,620
antioxidant load, but without the caffeine, has many health benefit associations with it,

822
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:24,820
which then started to make it all a bit more nuanced that perhaps it's more about the antioxidant

823
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:31,300
benefit rather than necessarily the caffeine benefit. But there is certainly an association

824
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:37,620
with coffee that I think makes me more likely to tell people it's fine to be drinking a couple of

825
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:42,420
cups of coffee in the morning. Please do that. In fact, if anything, there seems to be some health

826
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,060
benefits. I think it's probably because of the antioxidant benefits, but I've changed my mind

827
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:51,620
that too. I think I've become more relaxed. And in fact, I've now started to drink decaffeinated

828
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:57,380
coffee in the mornings. And is the reason you're not drinking caffeinated coffee because it just

829
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,940
activates you too much or because you still fear it will, and because you fear it will impact your

830
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:06,260
sleep negatively? Yeah, it's because I still fear that it impacts my sleep negatively. There was a

831
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,900
study by a good colleague of mine at the University of Surrey in England called Dirk Jandayk published

832
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:15,700
many years ago. And they were actually dosing people with caffeine at seven o'clock in the morning.

833
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:21,060
And they could still pick up in the signal of subsequent deep electrical sleep that following

834
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:27,700
night, a reduction in the quality of that deep sleep. So I think again, it depends on who you

835
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:34,020
are. There are genetic differences in how quickly people metabolize caffeine. And I think I'm someone

836
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:41,380
who may be on the moderate end of the sensitivity spectrum. So I typically stay away from it. But

837
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,740
other people I think probably don't have that same sensitivity in morning coffee consumption.

838
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,780
Caffeine is fine.

839
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:58,660
Well, thank you, Orrin Hatch, for the supplement industry. We owe you a debt of gratitude. And I

840
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:04,420
hope you can hear the sarcasm in my voice. I think most people now are wise to it. And we certainly

841
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:10,340
spoke about it at length in the original episodes about the real downside of things like Ambien,

842
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:15,620
Lunesta, these drugs. In fact, very recently, I just saw something in the news that tried to tally

843
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:20,340
up the number of deaths that could actually be attributed to these things. So I mean, I feel very

844
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:29,460
comfortable telling patients that I would rather you stick your genitals in a grinder than you take

845
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,740
Ambien or Lunesta.

846
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:36,740
There's always the point in taping a podcast with P. Sretir where it just comes to one of these

847
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:42,580
wonderful crescendos, the things that I think about, but I have no bravery to say. And he just

848
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:45,860
comes out and says them. And this is part of the reason I adore him as a friendly colleague.

849
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:50,900
Yes, I really hate these drugs. I really hate them. By full disclosure, I still prescribe them

850
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,980
on occasion to patients who really insist on having them as a safety net. I would not let

851
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:58,900
any patient have those and I can monitor by prescription. There's no patient I'm going to

852
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:03,380
take those drugs every night. And maybe if they needed a couple of nights a month as they're

853
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:07,940
traveling and such, we work really hard to get them off it. But let's talk about sort of the

854
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:13,140
softer things that people often rely on consistently for sleep aids. What about things like Benadryl

855
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,700
or Advil PM? I get a lot of questions about that here. I don't think we would argue that those are

856
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,180
good for sleep. I think that maybe we could frame the question as how bad are they for sleep?

857
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:27,700
Yeah. So firstly, to come back to Ambien and sort of its collection, Lunesta, all of those classic,

858
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:32,900
what we call the sedative hypnotics. In fact, you're right. I think it was nine days ago from

859
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:39,940
the point that we're speaking right now, the FDA updated its mortality risk warnings regarding

860
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:46,260
those sleeping pills because of this increased risk of death, both acutely for a number of reasons,

861
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:54,340
but also this data are just chronically in terms of far greater cancer. We also see in part, I think

862
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:58,660
it's probably because of a weakening of the immune system. And I think we spoke about this before.

863
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:05,860
The irony is that sleep is incredibly powerful in boosting the whole collection of weaponry

864
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:11,620
in your immune system. Yet when you sleep and sleep longer with those sleeping pills,

865
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:16,820
you would imagine your immune system gets even better. The opposite seems to be true. It gets

866
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:21,140
worse. And the reason we know this is because there's higher rates of infection in those patients

867
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:28,500
who are taking sleeping pills scales with the degree of use and dosage. So I would say trying

868
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:34,660
to use those as a very last resort. Now, there are some patients for whom alternatives don't

869
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:40,020
seem to work. And for a short period of time, that seems to be recommended right now by the

870
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:45,700
medical community. But I should also note that in 2016, the American College of Physicians made a

871
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:50,820
landmark recommendation that they said based on the health risks and the concerns together with

872
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:58,100
the nominal benefit of those sleeping pills above and beyond placebo, sleeping pills must no longer

873
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,500
be the first line recommendation for insomnia. It has to be something else called cognitive

874
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:08,020
behavioral therapy for insomnia or CBT, which we can come back to in a second, which I've had

875
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:13,700
three patients go through formal CBT with great success. It's a non-pharmacological, it's a

876
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:18,820
psychological method. You work with a therapist and they try to understand where your sleep

877
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:25,140
problems are at and create a bespoke solution for you, the individual. So there's lots of tools in

878
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:32,900
the CBT box that we can use to try and help people sleep better. And because everyone who has sleep

879
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,300
problems is usually a little different from one person to the next, you have to create a more

880
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:43,140
Savile Row tailored suit for that person in terms of that sleep prescription, quote unquote. But

881
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:48,100
it's just as efficacious as sleeping pills in the short term. But what's better is that when you

882
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:53,700
start working with your therapist, those benefits can last. Now, I think the last report was maybe

883
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:59,300
somewhere between up to five years that you can maintain that benefit, unlike sleeping pills,

884
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:03,380
where when you stop them, you not only go back to the bad sleep that you had,

885
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,060
it's usually even worse. It's called sleep rebound insomnia.

886
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:12,500
How do you recommend people find good CBT eye therapists? Because like all things therapy wise,

887
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,900
the practitioner matters. Now I've been very fortunate because we work with this amazing sleep

888
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,700
doc named Vic Jane in Chicago and wherever my patients are, if it's San Francisco, New York,

889
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:26,180
he knows the best therapist and he just makes that introduction, plugs us directly in. But if

890
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:31,860
you're listening to this and you're thinking, I live in St. Louis and boy, would I really benefit

891
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:37,540
from this? How can a person listening figure out there's a just trial and error. You just have to

892
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:41,700
go through people until you find someone who's really clicking with you. So one of the things

893
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:46,180
that we can do, maybe in post in the show notes, there is a website that comes out of the American

894
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:52,260
Academy of sleep medicine. And there is one page, it's not that easy to find, but I know the link,

895
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:58,340
so I'll send it out. And you go to that link and you insert your zip code into this website. So

896
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:05,780
this is of course, just for people in America. And it will return the closest certified centers

897
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:13,140
by the American Academy of sleep medicine for sleep disorders, including CBT eye. And you can

898
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,700
give it a radius and you can give it a distance. Tell me where's close. And they will give you the

899
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:22,740
sleep centers to contact, contact them. And you can go from there. And what should you look for

900
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:27,700
in terms of, cause we know that all doctors are not created equal. All mechanics are not created

901
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:33,780
equal. All lawyers are not created equal. How does a person evaluate their own individual or is it

902
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:39,780
simply through the results? I mean, right now it's going to be in part trial and error. And I would

903
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:46,820
say have a conversation with two or three potential CPTI therapists and just try them on

904
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:52,020
for size and see how they work. If you can get any referrals right now, sometimes you can even go

905
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:57,700
onto places like Yelp or other places where you can get some reviews to some people. If they're

906
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,500
motivated to write, it's usually because they had a bad experience. So keep that bias in mind. But I

907
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:08,660
would say, if you can get a referral from a friend or a colleague, that's a fantastic way to go to,

908
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:14,180
and then speak to these people and ask them about their success rates and ask them also,

909
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:19,300
where have you found problems with your patients? Which patients have you typically had the hardest

910
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:25,300
difficulty with in terms of the profile of sleep problems? And if they sound like you,

911
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:32,500
then maybe you want to look elsewhere as well. But CPTI over sleeping pills for sure. In terms of

912
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:40,660
things like Tylenol PM or Benadryl is, Benadryl is typically used. There is a little bit of evidence

913
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:48,020
that Benadryl induced sleep also has some of the risks associated with it that sleeping pills have.

914
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:56,580
It's less potent in terms of that bad consequence and outcome to sleep, but the bad consequence and

915
01:26:56,580 --> 01:27:02,260
outcome remains statistically significant in those reports. So I would shy away from things

916
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:08,180
like Benadryl as well. Tylenol PM, I just don't think there's good enough data yet to suggest

917
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:14,340
that it's either good or bad. And what about low doses or intermittent use of benzodiazepines,

918
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:20,020
either short acting ones like Ativan or longer acting ones, Xanax or longer acting ones like

919
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:26,580
Valium? I talk about this in my jet lag protocol when I'm doing heroic bursts of jet lag, 12 hour

920
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:31,700
time zone difference. And I have to put myself to sleep. We talked about the entire routine around

921
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:36,180
exercise and caffeine and going to sleep immediately, getting on the plane. And I use

922
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:42,580
phosphatidylserine and I use the Kirk Parsley stuff. And I'll also use Valium to just make sure

923
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:48,580
I am out. And what are your thoughts on the short term use of benzos, again, paired with these other

924
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:53,300
agents around jet lag? I don't think anyone's really advocating they be used in any ongoing

925
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:58,980
manner either. Certainly not. Yeah. Infrequent use, I suppose it depends on how infrequent in

926
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:04,100
one of the studies by a guy called Dan Kripke, who is actually emeritus here in San Diego.

927
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:10,980
He just looked at not only whether use of sleeping pills was detrimental to mortality. He looked at

928
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:17,300
the frequency of how often you were taking those. And what he was finding is that even anywhere

929
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:24,580
between three to 18 pills per year carried a statistically significant increase in mortality

930
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:31,620
risk. And did he put benzos in the same category as the Ativan Lunestas? He did, yeah. So he sort

931
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:37,620
of has broken some of that stuff down and broken it out too. I would say in truth, see how far you

932
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:43,620
can really get with all of the other kaleidoscope of possibilities of sleep enhancing possibilities

933
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:49,700
that we've discussed. And if those fail, then I think you can think about less resources, but

934
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:56,020
those drugs typically just are not producing natural sleep. So I would think of those

935
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,460
medications like that box on the wall that says break glass in terms of emergency. If you're in

936
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:06,580
that situation and you're really struggling, then it's possible that that's the time to break glass.

937
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:13,140
But those shattered shards can sometimes still be. You can still cut you. What about GHB or Zirim

938
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:18,740
Irem as a precursor? This is a drug that is incredibly potent in patients with narcolepsy.

939
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:23,140
Zirim is available by prescription. Of course, unless you have narcolepsy, you're going to pay

940
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:31,060
an unbelievable amount. It's one of the funniest sort of economic incentives imaginable. But

941
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,300
several listeners have asked, and several of my patients actually have asked about

942
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:40,340
does Zirim actually produce appropriate sleep staging? What's the data on that?

943
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,940
So the data, if you look at it, almost looks like Zirim is a great drug or GHB is a great

944
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:52,020
drug for increasing the amount of deep sleep that you have, mostly because it puts your brain into

945
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:58,100
a more sort of sedated slow rhythm, which a sleep technician, if they didn't know that you were on

946
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,900
Zirim, would look at it and say, that looks not dissimilar to deep slow wave sleep. So I'm going

947
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,940
to score it as I'm sort of scoring these eight hour sleep records. I'm going to score it as deep

948
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:14,660
sleep. So overall, in terms of total amount of sleep, GHB or Zirim does seem to actually

949
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:21,140
increase the amount of slow wave sleep time that is scored by a technician. And I'm being very

950
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:27,140
technical in my language because I want to be precise in this regard. However, if you look at

951
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:33,540
the electrical signature of that sleep, which is now independent, so when a sleep technician scores

952
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:39,540
a trace, they have a set of criteria that they use to define which stage of sleep each 30 second

953
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:45,380
epoch of time, each 30 second window of time there is throughout that eight hour period. And they

954
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:50,900
scroll through it 30 second page by 30 seconds and they score each of those. They add them all up.

955
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:56,020
That's what gives your sleep profile and sleep score. So using the criteria that we've had now

956
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:03,380
for about 60 or 70 years, they will score more of your sleep as being quote unquote slow wave sleep

957
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:10,580
when you are on GHB because it seems to produce what looks like slow brainwave activity. And by

958
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:17,780
that criteria, they have to score it as such. But if you unbuckle yourself from this kind of

959
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:23,060
standard sleep scoring criteria and a human and you just let an algorithm process the electrical

960
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:29,060
signature of that sleep, it now does not look like naturalistic sleep. And in fact, if there's

961
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:35,620
anything that we've seen that Xyrem seems to be detrimental to, it's actually these things called

962
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:41,460
sleep spindles. Now sleep spindles are these short synchronous bursts of electrical activity that

963
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:47,700
happen during non REM sleep. They last for about a minute or a minute and a half. And we know from

964
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:52,820
the work that we've done and other people have done, they are critical for things like learning

965
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:59,780
memory and brain plasticity. And what we found is that when you take GHB or Xyrem, the amount of

966
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:06,180
sleep spindle activity is decreased often. This shows up sort of at the end of as you're

967
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:11,460
transitioning from theta to delta, does this typically occur? Actually, what happens is usually

968
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:17,540
sleep, sleep spindles at the end of a deep slow wave. So you've got all of these slow waves that

969
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:23,380
happen during deep non REM sleep. And typically what happens is that sort of once you've hit the

970
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:28,980
peak of that slow wave, you will often have a little bit of a spindle burst. And in fact,

971
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:34,740
those two things couple, it's called phase amplitude coupling. So at the peak of the

972
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:40,580
deep slow wave on its awesome rise up, that's the burst. That's when you get the burst additionally

973
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:45,300
of the sleep spindle. So if I could convert it to a sound, which we've done, you would get these slow

974
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:53,380
waves, which would sort of sound like, and then often riding on top of those slow waves, you'll

975
01:32:53,380 --> 01:33:03,780
have a sleep spindle. So you'll sort of have like, and that is the sleep spindle. It's this burst of

976
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:09,620
faster frequency activity. And the coupling of those two seems to be critical in terms of things

977
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:14,900
like long term memory transfer, shifting memories from short term to long term. So you protect them

978
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:21,860
and make them safe. Those spindles also seem to have a role in terms of triggering the strengthening

979
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:26,420
of connections between brain cells, something that we call brain plasticity or long term

980
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:33,140
potentiation within the brain. And when you are blocking those sleep spindles, the idea would be

981
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:40,020
that you're preventing typical memory and brain plasticity events that occur. So once again, you

982
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:44,740
can see that. So it's kind of a lesser of two evils. It's you take a patient who's got narcolepsy,

983
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:49,940
if the alternative is they're constantly falling asleep at the point where they can't function

984
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:56,020
normally. Well, maybe we have to give up something. But again, what I'm hearing you say is if you're

985
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:01,620
an individual whose sleep is not fully optimized, assuming you can afford xyrem, which pretty much

986
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:06,900
no human being can afford it, that's just not the solution either. We don't have deep sleep in a pill.

987
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:11,540
That's right. Your analogy is a good one. No one would say chemotherapy is good for a healthy

988
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:15,940
individual. But when you're suffering from cancer, it's the lesser of two evils. The same is true

989
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:21,060
in narcolepsy. Yes, you sort of the cost reward equation that is in the favor of taking the

990
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:25,540
medication. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in

991
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:30,340
diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to

992
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,700
bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

993
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:40,420
members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership

994
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:45,700
benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that

995
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:51,620
detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's

996
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:57,460
show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

997
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:03,220
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

998
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:08,580
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release

999
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,980
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1000
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:18,340
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1001
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:23,860
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1002
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:28,500
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1003
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:33,140
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits,
