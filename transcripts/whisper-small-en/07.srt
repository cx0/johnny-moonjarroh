00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,920
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,720
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,560
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,840

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,360
In this podcast, I'm going to be discussing LP Little A. A little while ago, we put up

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,960
a little questionnaire on Twitter that said, if I'm going to do a solo podcast interviewed

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,280
by Bob, what topic would you want to hear? And we put up two options. The first was LP

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Little A. The second was hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. Survey ran

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
for about a day and the results were unambiguous. 80% of you wanted to hear about LP Little

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,560
A, though many of you did want to hear about HRT and we will absolutely get to that. So

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,840
on this podcast, we structured it as an interview. Originally, I thought I would just do it as

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,520
a quote unquote lecture, but I realized that would just be way too boring and it would

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,320
be more fun to play patty cakes with Bob and have him interview me. So that's what we did.

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,320
So Bob put together an interview and he just asked me a bunch of questions about LP Little

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,760
A. We're going to talk about what the heck it is, why you should care, why it's problematic,

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,520
like the protein, what some of the potential treatment options are and what's on the horizon.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,440
Now I got to admit, this is a bit of a technical podcast, but I also know that this is kind

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,880
of a technical loving audience. So don't be discouraged. I also think this is one of the

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,320
tests where you really have to be able to look at the show notes. I find some of this

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,520
stuff really complicated myself and I find a picture is sometimes worth a thousand words.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,680
So especially when I get into stuff like Kringle repeats and Kringle four subsection two zone

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,840
five, like that kind of stuff, you've just got to be looking at a picture to understand.

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,400
So if you can't be able to look at something while you're listening to it, that's fine,

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,320
but maybe go back after the fact and look at it or look first and then listen, something

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,200
like that. But the show notes here will be very helpful and hopefully this answers a lot of the

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,680
questions that people have been asking me over the past year about LP little a. And again,

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,560
if this format is helpful, let us know because we're really happy to kind of do one of these

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,960
every couple of months where we just put up a general topic and Bob grills me on it. So without

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,480
further delay, here's the discussion with Bob Kaplan on LP little a.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,840
Bob, Peter, how are you? I'm doing well. I notice you have a coffee there. Of course.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,480
What number is that today? Seven. At least. I've watched four. Well, seven doubles,

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,600
probably seven double espressos. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. That's impressive. It's a low day.

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:18,400
So this is the first of what I suspect and assume we might do more of where we threw a question out

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,760
to people and said, pick one, have a vote. I don't know. We gave him a day or so. And the choice was,

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,840
do you want to know about LP little a or do you want to know about hormone replacement therapy

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,280
in postmenopausal women, which by the way, has a more politically correct name now that I can't

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,160
remember endocrine modulating therapies for women in menopause or something. I don't know.

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,240
I was going to go with golden years or something to that effect. The point is HRT versus this.

42
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,560
And it was about 80 20 in favor of LP little a, which kind of bums me out because I actually

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,840
really wanted to talk about HRT, but next time we throw HRT in, we're going to put it up against

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,680
something like bocce ball. And hopefully HRT comes out ahead and we can talk about it.

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,720
I think you have been accumulating a bunch of questions that people have also started sending

46
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,200
in about LP little a and I think that's what we're going to talk about.

47
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:23,800
Absolutely. So a lot of questions are around what is LP little a and I thought in order to

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,680
explain that, maybe we might need a quick primer on lipoproteins to kick things off.

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Do you know anyone who can do that? I think I'm looking at them.

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Oh, okay. I was afraid you were going to say that. Starting from the basics, if you go to your doctor

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,400
and you get a cholesterol blood test, they're going to probably show you a couple of numbers,

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,280
a total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol. And if you're really lucky, they'll put bad next to it.

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,000
HDL cholesterol. And if you're extra special, they'll put good next to it. Triglycerides and

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,040
non HDL cholesterol. That is a standard lipid panel. Those numbers are largely unhelpful,

55
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,360
but more importantly, they're largely misunderstood. So when people look at LDL and think it's bad

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,400
cholesterol, that immediately tells you that they're missing what the L and the D and the L

57
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:16,400
stand for the LDL stands for low density lipoprotein. And admittedly, if you don't have a background in

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,680
biochemistry or something, you might not understand in looking at that, that that implies that it's a

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,080
macro structure. So cholesterol, which is the principal molecule that is carried by these lipoproteins,

60
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,080
is something that is made by the body. So every cell in the body makes cholesterol. And most cells

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,920
in the body make enough cholesterol to meet their own needs at the cellular level. And the single and

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,520
most important need of cholesterol we have is cellular membranes. So cell membranes must be

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,880
fluid. They must be able to move. They must be able to facilitate the attachment of one cell to

64
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,760
another. They must be able to hold transporters across their membranes and things like that. And

65
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:06,960
of course, cholesterol makes up the bulk of those membranes. So in addition, you turn cholesterol,

66
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
when I say you, I'm referring specifically to certain organs, like the adrenal glands,

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,880
the ovaries, the testes, turn cholesterol into hormones that are either sex hormones,

68
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,280
glucocorticoids, gonadotropins, these things. So if for no other reason than just being able to

69
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
have cells that work and have hormones, cholesterol is pretty important.

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
Because we're not going to get too far into that. The point I want to make is that you can't

71
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,200
traffic or move around cholesterol in the bloodstream because blood approximates water.

72
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,880
And so the things that move freely in the blood have to be things that are what we call hydrophilic

73
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,840
or things that would be soluble in water. So something like glucose can move around the

74
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,280
bloodstream very easily, but cholesterol cannot. And therefore it needs to be packaged in something

75
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,240
that is itself water soluble. And that something is a lipoprotein. And the two dominant lipoproteins

76
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
that are found in the bloodstream are the high density lipoprotein and the low density

77
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,280
lipoprotein. And their names are referring to their densities in a type of assay called

78
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
gel electrophoresis, which has to do with how far these things move on an ion gradient.

79
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,400
There are other lipoproteins that don't stick around that long. So VLDL, very low density

80
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,760
lipoprotein and IDL or intermediate density lipoprotein, which is almost non-existent. It

81
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,920
has such a short half life. And the longer residence of the LDL is probably what explains

82
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,760
its atherogenicity. And that's why LDL is considered the most atherogenic particle after

83
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,520
LpA, which we're going to talk about today. So when you're looking at your blood test,

84
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,560
what you're seeing is the cholesterol concentration within the various particles. So when it says total

85
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,400
cholesterol, it says, well, if you break apart the HDL particle and the LDL particle and the VLDL

86
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,920
particle, and if you can find it the IDL particle, how much total cholesterol do you have? And that's

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,920
a number, call it 200 milligrams per deciliter. Okay. And when it says LDLC is 120 milligrams

88
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,440
per deciliter, that means if you break apart the LDL, that's the concentration of cholesterol

89
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,000
contained within them, et cetera. Now, in the past, we've talked about the importance of knowing

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,800
the number of particles you have and how that is a more accurate predictor of your atherosclerotic

91
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,640
risk. And so the LDLP, which is similar to the APO-B in terms of its predictive power,

92
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,600
which is the number of particles. And the reason you can use APO-B as a surrogate for that is that

93
00:08:49,600 --> 00:09:00,160
each LDL particle has an APO-B, which is an apolipaprotein that wraps around the spherical

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,880
lipoprotein. It's APO-B100 specifically. So by counting those, since each LDL has one and only

95
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,160
one APO-B, you can quantify the number of LDL particles. And again, we care about that because

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:23,680
it tracks more with risk. The LDL, the ideal and the LDL all have the APO-B100. The HDL does not.

97
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,320
The HDL has something called APO-A1. It's a different lipoprotein. And it probably explains

98
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:40,000
in large part why HDL is not atherogenic and LDL is atherogenic. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis

99
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,280
is one that's predicated on, and we should probably attach and I'll link to this, the post

100
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,400
on heart disease where I go through this in great, great and gory detail, the process by which the

101
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,320
lipoproteins get through the endothelial space between cells, which is actually not that hard to

102
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,840
do. An LDL particle is somewhere between 20, 21, 22 nanometers. It's probably not an order of magnitude,

103
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,840
but several multiples of that is the space between the endothelial cells. So it's the size

104
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,320
of the LDL particle really doesn't determine the ease with which it gets through the cell or not,

105
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,960
or between the cells. What's much more important is because most of the LDL that gets into the

106
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,000
sub-endotheo space gets right back out and doesn't cause any trouble. Where the trouble comes is when

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,120
they get retained and when they get oxidized and when they kick off an inflammatory response. So

108
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
it is certainly the case theoretically that you could have a very high LDL,

109
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,480
but by hook or by crook, if your LDL particles don't get retained in the sub-endotheo space

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,080
and don't kick off an inflammatory cascade, you're not going to suffer the effects that you otherwise

111
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,520
would. But all things equal, we would love to see a lower LDL particle number because the process

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,600
by which those particles enter the space seems relatively stochastic. So in a few minutes,

113
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,440
that's kind of the overview of these lipoproteins. Okay, so I think one of the reasons why we've had

114
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,920
so much interest in LpA is a New York Times article by Anahad O'Connor. I think it was January

115
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,760
this year that was entitled, A Heart Risk Factor Even Doctors Know Little About. And he tells the

116
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,840
story of Bob Harper, who was one of the biggest loser OGs. I think it was him and Gillian were

117
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,960
the two trainers. And so Bob had a heart attack at a gym at age 52. And according to his annual

118
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,400
checkups, he always checked out very healthy. And as it turned out, according to the article, Bob

119
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:47,360
has quote, perilously high levels, end quote, of LpL in his blood, something that was I don't think

120
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,880
was ever measured prior to his heart attack. So I think this article was an introduction to this

121
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,600
particle for many people who read it. Not only that, it's reported that a small percentage of

122
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,880
physicians actually know about it. So kind of going back to the original question, what is

123
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,880
LpL? Well, in full disclosure, Anahad is a really good friend of mine. And I know he'd been working

124
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,720
on that story for about two years, actually, I guess I'll take a little bit of credit for getting

125
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:22,320
him interested in ApoA and LpL. And Anahad, because he's just such a curious dude, was sort

126
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
of like blown away at this. He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Tell me about, you know,

127
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,160
we walked through everything that we're about to talk about today. And he just couldn't believe

128
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
that something that was so ubiquitous, probably somewhere between one and five and one and 10

129
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
people walking around with this elevation. And of course, it's a long tail to the right distribution.

130
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,720
So where you define the cutoff as perilously high is a function of how many people will be perilously

131
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,320
high. But he just couldn't believe it. And then I, you know, introduced him to many of my mentors,

132
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
and he did his own research. And the result of that was a story that I thought was excellent,

133
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,000
because I can't count the number of patients that sent it to me saying, Oh, my God, this is that

134
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,800
thing you're always talking about. Yeah. So what is this thing? So we talked about the LDL particle

135
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:21,280
number. So it's this spherical thing. Call it 20 nanometers in diameter. And it has a outer

136
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:29,040
spherical structure that is made of lipid, cholesterol, phospholipid inside. It has a core

137
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,000
that consists of cholesterol ester. So this is non, this is like the cholesterol without its

138
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,680
bulky side chain and the triglyceride. And on the outside, as I mentioned, it has this one

139
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,600
apolipaprotein called apo B 100. So we'll just refer to that from now on as the garden variety LDL.

140
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,920
Now a subset of these, and it's mostly, as we'll probably discuss genetically determined

141
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,280
and inherited in a codominant fashion, a subset of these have something else attached to that apo B

142
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,040
and it's attached covalently. So that means that it's not an ionic bond. It's an actual,

143
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,360
in other words, it's a much stronger bond. It's a disulfide bond, which in amino acids and in

144
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,160
biochemistry tends to be a pretty strong bond. So the apo B has this disulfide bond that attaches

145
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,600
it to a totally different lipoprotein and it's called apolittle A. And this lipoprotein is made

146
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,200
in the liver and it has a property that it resembles another molecule in the body called

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,600
plasminogen. Now I suspect that everything I'm about to say is going to not make that much

148
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
sense until you look at the pictures. This is one of those things where a picture says a thousand

149
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,360
words. So what we'll probably do is, and that defeats the purpose of a podcast, I realize,

150
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
because people want to listen to this, but they don't want to have to miss the picture. But I

151
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
think this is one of those things where it's worth looking up the picture. But this apolipoprotein A

152
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,360
has a repeated folding structure. These domains are referred to as cringal domains. So we're sort

153
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,520
of lost in a nomenclature of apolittle A and cringal potato chip folds and all this stuff. And

154
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,280
it's just like, it's super complicated, but these repeating structures are organized by cringal

155
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,640
domains and there are five of them. Plasminogen, that is, has five of them. ApoA does not have

156
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,880
the cringle one, the cringle two, the cringle three. It does have a cringle four that very

157
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,800
much resembles plasminogen and it has the exact same cringle five that comes from the plasminogen.

158
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,000
So to distill that again, ApoA looks like plasminogen in that it has cringle domain five

159
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,240
and a cringle domain four that is similar, but it's the cringle domain four that has 10

160
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
subsegments. So you have cringle four one, cringle four two, cringle four three, all the way up to

161
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,400
cringle four nine and cringle four ten. And if that doesn't have, you're looking at me and you're

162
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,160
laughing. It's like, it's hard to believe we're talking about it at this level of detail, but

163
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,640
the cringle four two is where you see the greatest variability and you can have a cringle

164
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,920
four two with just a couple of folds in it. You could have a cringle four two with 40

165
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,080
segments that are repeating and that determines the mass of LpA and that's going to become,

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,400
I wouldn't be telling this story if it weren't for some reason in anticipation of talking about

167
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,120
something else. And with the plasminogen and the cringles in the homology, in other words,

168
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,640
how similar are they? You're basically saying that if you were to look up, like if you were to look

169
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,120
at the structures of both of those, you could very easily confuse one for the other. They look very

170
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
similar. It probably depends on the similarity during the cringle four because the cringle four

171
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,960
tends to dominate it. So I don't want to give an answer that could be incorrect because I suspect

172
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,400
it depends on the individual. I think there are some individuals whose ApoA looks more like

173
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
plasminogen because everyone's plasminogen looks the same, but the ApoA is where we see the

174
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,040
difference. So we're really dealing with two things, which is how many of your LDLs have those

175
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,120
ApoAs attached to them and then what do your ApoAs look like? And what they look like is basically

176
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,720
what do your cringle segment four subsegment twos look like? Now it turns out that between those

177
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,200
two factors, the one that probably matters most is the number of your LDL particles that also have

178
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,360
this covalent bond to the ApoA. In other words, it's probably the number of the

179
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,800
ApoA particles bound to the LDL particles through the ApoB or the number of LpA's

180
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,320
that matters more than the mass of the LpA. So on that note, I was thinking about ApoB

181
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:09,440
and that there's one ApoB per LDL and then with ApoA, there's one ApoA per LpA, but not necessarily

182
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,080
not every LDL. But every ApoA is on an LDL particle. Every ApoA is on an LDL, but not every LDL has an

183
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,120
ApoA. And that's the difference between individuals when you look out at a population is the

184
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,360
how many of their LDLs are rolling around with ApoAs. Now, I don't think we'll get into it today,

185
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,240
but if there's ever an appetite to go ultra deep on LpA, we could probably talk about the relationship

186
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,680
between ApoE and ApoA. So it turns out that as people may know, you have three different

187
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,160
variants of ApoE. You have ApoE2, ApoE3, ApoE4. Of course, they combine in all six combinations

188
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,600
that I'm sure everybody's familiar with. But as you move from the two to the three to the four,

189
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,200
you see LpA go up. You see ApoB go up and you see triglyceride go down. And this is a pattern that

190
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
has been demonstrated over and over and over again. And what's interesting is why that's happening

191
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
with respect to the ApoA. But again, I think that's probably more the seniors course rather

192
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
than the freshmen course. Yeah. On the note of the freshman course, just looking at it and thinking,

193
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:28,240
so we're asking what is LpA? And if you're to look at how it's spelled out, it's capital L,

194
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,920
lowercase p, parenthetical, lowercase a, and close parentheses. And it's basically saying it's a

195
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,600
lipoprotein with an ApoA attached to it. Yeah. And if you were going to come up with an equivalency,

196
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,920
you'd do three little parallel lines as an equal line and say that's equal to LDL hyphen

197
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,120
little a or little ApoA. It would be the longhand way to write that. I don't know that anybody's

198
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
ever written it that way in the literature, but that's just another way to think about it.

199
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,880
Okay. So piggybacking on that, can you explain the difference between LpA mass,

200
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,520
then there's LpA cholesterol, and then there's the LpA particle content. And then as you mentioned,

201
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,040
there's the Kringle domains, the number of Kringles could also be called the different ApoA

202
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,200
isoforms. Can we quantify those? How are those measured? Yeah. I believe the first way this was

203
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,240
quantified. And again, this will be the type of stuff that I think would be really fun to explore

204
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,360
with a guy like Sam Tamikis, who's probably the world's expert on this topic. And we should

205
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,880
definitely make sure we get Sam on the show. I believe LpA mass was the first way that this

206
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,040
was quantified. And whether it was the first or not, I don't know. But what I can certainly say is

207
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,360
it's by far the most ubiquitous. I'm sure that 19 out of 20 times when a patient is having their LpA

208
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,760
checked, it is the mass that is being checked. Certainly if a patient comes to me and they've

209
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,280
been at least fortunate enough to have had their LpA checked, it's a mass. I almost never see the

210
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,080
cholesterol checked anymore. I think there used to be a company I believe called ATHROTEC that did the

211
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,440
test. I think they got bought, or at least that assay got bought by VAP and now VAP does it. But

212
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,360
I'll explain later why I don't think that's such a great test. And then of course there's the LpA

213
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,000
particle number, which is just the counting of it. So the LpA mass is directionally a reasonable

214
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,840
test, but it's not a great test. And the reason is it's measuring for particles that carry ApoA,

215
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,320
it's measuring the mass of everything, which is the ApoA, the ApoB, the phospholipids,

216
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,440
the cholesterol, the triglycerides, the dogs, the cats, whatever. It's measuring the mass of the

217
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:57,360
entire structure. Now the larger the cringal, section four, subsection two, the more that mass

218
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:05,040
is dominated by ApoA. But you can see very quickly how you could be misled. You could take two people

219
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:13,520
that have the exact same LpA mass, but if one of them has a very long segment four, sub-segment two

220
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,680
repeat binding domain, guess what? He's going to have a much fewer particle number, or more to the

221
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,640
point, the person that has the smaller segment four, sub-segment two is going to actually have

222
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,960
more particles. And so those people are not at equal risk. It turns out that the guy that's got

223
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:38,240
more particles is at higher risk. But when a patient shows up and their LpA mass is really,

224
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,320
really low, like less than five milligrams per deciliter, the likelihood that their LpA

225
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,960
particle number is very high is really, really low. And back in the olden days, and by the olden days,

226
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,640
I mean like four years ago before LpA particle number was measured, I used to actually look at

227
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,800
both. I'd look at LpA mass and LpA cholesterol, acknowledging that neither was perfect, but

228
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,320
basically coming up with a two by two, which was if both were high, I knew you had a ton of particles,

229
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,080
case closed. If both were low, we were off to the races and high fiving. And then when one was high,

230
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,320
one was low, we would just sort of follow up and test for reasons that we'll probably discuss later

231
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,920
around things that could actually change LpA as you march down the field. But luckily, most

232
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,560
patients were either double positive or double negative, and therefore you had a pretty good

233
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,880
sense of where their risk was. You then asked about LpA cholesterol. So that basically is

234
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,040
analogous to measuring the cholesterol content of an LDL particle number, except here it's measuring

235
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,160
the cholesterol concentration of an LpA particle number. And that, again, in isolation is not very

236
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,840
helpful. I am not an expert in clinical chemistry, but I've spoken with people who are, and it turns

237
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,960
out there are some other technical issues with that test that renders it not entirely helpful

238
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,920
and also misleading in its own way under certain circumstances. And it's for that reason that I

239
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,080
really prefer looking at the LpA particle number, which even though it's reported in an animal per

240
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:20,240
liter, to my knowledge is not actually measured via NMR, the way LDLP and HDLP were pioneered by

241
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,480
Lipa Science. It's a different assay, but nevertheless, it is counting the Apo little a's

242
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,480
that are attached to little Apo B's. And so you're getting a number of those. And for that test,

243
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,560
we like to see people less than 50 nanomole per liter. When people are sort of 50 to 100, I put

244
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,480
them in kind of a gray area when people are over 100 or certainly over 125 nanomole per liter.

245
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,760
That's when I start to get worried because I often get asked this question. The highest number

246
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,840
I've ever seen on a patient is about 650 to 700 nanomole per liter. And I've got a few patients

247
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:05,760
that walk around at 400, 500 nanomole per liter. So the Lp little a cholesterol, it sounds a lot like

248
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,080
when we're measuring LDLC. So if you're measuring Lp little a cholesterol, you're measuring the

249
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,160
amount of cholesterol that's carried within the Lp little a particles. And similarly with LDLC,

250
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,760
you're measuring the amount of cholesterol that's carried within the LDL particle.

251
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,040
Similarly, you would rather know the LDL particle. Yeah. And this is actually what makes it so

252
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,360
problematic is it's even worse than the discordance between LDLP and LDLC because at least when you're

253
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,960
dealing with LDL, you know the molecular weight. You don't know the molecular weight of Lp little a.

254
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,440
This is actually the point I forgot that I wanted to make a moment ago. I remember once

255
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,680
having a patient come to me with everything but the Lp little a P and I remember thinking, well,

256
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,840
I used to be a smart little organic chemistry whipper snapper. I should be able to convert this

257
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,480
from milligrams per deciliter into nanomole per liter. And of course, anyone listening to this who

258
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,280
knows more about chemistry than me will remember that all you need to know is like Avogado's number

259
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,720
and the molecular weight and you're ready to go. But of course you don't know the molecular weight.

260
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,240
That's the problem because the Apo A's don't look the same. The whole calculation goes to hell in

261
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,280
a hand basket. You can't actually calculate the molecular. You don't know the molecular weight

262
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,800
because of that Kringle sub segment, the Kringle four segment too, because it's got such variability.

263
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,280
It's not like you can say the molecular weight of sodium is X or the molecular weight of testosterone

264
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,360
is Y. So with the Apo A and how it comes in different isoforms, can you measure the Apo A?

265
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,200
Yes, but it would be for a given individual. That's the point. Yes, you could absolutely measure

266
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
the molecular weight of an Apo A, but it would be like yours and mine would probably be different.

267
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,360
So therefore, at least to my knowledge, and again, I don't want to speak out of turn because I'm sure

268
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,880
someone listening to this is going to go, no, no, no, you knucklehead, this is being done. But to my

269
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,880
knowledge, this is not something that's done clinically, whether it will be or not. Again,

270
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,200
that's probably a great question for someone like Tom Dayspring or Sam Tomakis or one of those guys.

271
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,360
I think that today the best test we have is the LP little a particle number. And there's a proxy

272
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,840
for it, but I'm guessing we'll talk about that later, which is you can also measure the amount

273
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,480
of oxidized phospholipid. If you normalize that for Apo B, you're getting almost a one-to-one

274
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,640
mapping of that because there's another interesting little, it's not a trivia point because trivia

275
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,880
tends to be irrelevant. This is actually quite relevant. Apo little a has lots of lysine.

276
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:43,440
The amino acid lysine and lysine really binds oxidized moieties. Now, Apo B does not contain

277
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,960
much lysine at all. And therefore, Apo B is not particularly effective oxidized moiety scavenger,

278
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,600
but Apo A is. And so if you think about your rolling around as an LDL, now you got a tail

279
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,080
thrown on you, which is called an Apo A, right? You got your little disulfide bridge attaches

280
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,880
to Apo B. You got your Apo A tail. Only you can see what my hands are doing right now.

281
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,080
This is great radio.

282
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,760
Yeah, this is awesome radio. We're smiling.

283
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,360
We'll have pictures. The pictures are definitely worth a thousand words because you can see the

284
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,960
cringled domains. And if you have a longer, you can see like longer tails and shorter tails.

285
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,120
Yeah.

286
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,160
This would all make sense.

287
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,160
And then once you've got your tail in place, now you start to fill that tail up with all

288
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,280
these oxidized phospholipids, you can start to measure. If you measure those phospholipids

289
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,800
normalized for Apo B, you're getting a pretty good proxy also of that. And by the way, this

290
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,080
may actually explain, and this is one of the questions like, you know, when we get Sam on

291
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,400
the show, this is one of the questions I want to ask him is just taking a step back from all of

292
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,600
this. Sometimes you clinically know when a person has an elevated LP little a before you take any

293
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,760
blood out of them. These are the patients who don't seem to fit the classic picture of someone

294
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,720
with premature heart disease in the family. Nobody's overweight. Nobody's diabetic. Nobody's

295
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,720
smoking or even if they are, the disease seems to come prematurely. It seems to come out of nowhere.

296
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
They also tend to, you know, if you ask enough, you might even see that somebody has aortic stenosis

297
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,760
and you just know the answer before you get there, especially if you have their family tree and you

298
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,000
can trace it and you can realize that whatever's happening here is coming through dominantly.

299
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,600
Is that something, it's a premature cardiovascular disease? Is that a clinical term? Is there like a

300
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,400
cutoff when you call it premature? Yeah, I mean, I think loosely we would say someone who's having

301
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,440
a major adverse cardiac event before 60 would be premature. Of course, I have a different

302
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,680
definition of that. I would think a major adverse cardiac event before 80 is premature, but I think

303
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,920
someone who's having any major adverse cardiac event, mace before the age of 60, I think anybody

304
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,160
would consider that premature. So what I've never been able to figure out is, you know, that patient

305
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,560
of mine that had like an LDL, an LP little A of 650, family history is not outrageous. You know,

306
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,720
when people get heart disease, they get it in their 70s. The patient of mine who has the 500,

307
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
I've tested this patient's family. I know where it came from. I know which parent it came from and

308
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,360
the burden of disease is modest. So there is something else going on here. And it's just

309
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,680
like the case with, we know that LDLP alone is not the issue. We know that it's just one factor.

310
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,440
And similarly, not all LPL little A's must be created equal. And so the question I'd want to

311
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,400
get into with an expert on this is, does it have to do with the lysine binding domains,

312
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,600
the affinity for these oxidized moieties? Is there some feature of one person's versus another's

313
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,480
that lends to a more aggressive oxidation within the sub-inethyl space or greater retention or

314
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,240
something like that? I think that gets into why do we have LPL little A? So what would be the

315
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,040
evolutionary basis? What's the function of LPL little A? Like it can't just be some

316
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:03,280
hell particle that's just trying to kill us. I mean, in theory, it could because it kills us through

317
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,160
basically three mechanisms that don't tend to kill you young. So if you were taking a purely

318
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,560
evolutionary standpoint, I think sometimes bad things track. But it turns out that even like

319
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,720
APOE4, which in today's environment doesn't seem particularly protective, APOE4 was quite

320
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,560
protective against parasitic infections in the CNS. And hell, up until a few years ago, that would

321
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,680
have been a pretty good thing to have. Of course, now that we can live long enough, that upside

322
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,040
isn't worth the downside of an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. So LPL little A clearly does

323
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,840
two things that are separate. And I think we could argue, at least theoretically, that it would have

324
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,120
provided a benefit evolutionary. The first is if you go back to what we talked about, you have this

325
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,520
great homology to plasminogen. And plasminogen being a clotting factor means that people with

326
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,040
elevated LPL little A tend to have what's called hypercoagulability. So they have an ability to

327
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,520
form blood clots better than someone who doesn't. Now in today's environment, that's not an advantage

328
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,520
because most of us are not in an environment where bleeding to death is a major concern.

329
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,440
But you can imagine 50,000 years ago, bleeding to death would actually be a significant concern.

330
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,000
And so I think these people would have had a trauma advantage with respect to,

331
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,160
and I'm sure you could probably pose many benefits during childbirth.

332
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,320
When I think about what I saw in the OB-GYN rounds, how many times

333
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,600
was a woman bleeding so sufficiently that she required blood clotting products? It's not unheard

334
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,200
of. And so you think about the benefits this could have had all the way from birth, the

335
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,240
breathing of a child, right up until getting scratched by an animal or whatever. The second

336
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,520
benefit is more of a speculation, I think, but it's probably that going back to those lysine

337
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,520
binding domains that if you're in a relatively low oxidative environment and your LP little A's

338
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,280
know where to go when they're done, which is to the liver and where not to go, which is the coronary

339
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:18,560
arteries in the aortic valve, they're actually amazing scavengers. So I'm sure somebody out

340
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,440
there has got better data on this or has data period, because I'm obviously speculating,

341
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,160
but you could make the case that being able to have more particles that can scavenge more of

342
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,240
these oxidized phospholipids and oxidized moieties and take them back to the liver,

343
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,720
which is the ultimate place of clearance for the LP little A, which is a totally safe place to take

344
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,320
these things, that would pose an advantage. And it would be the case today that maybe we're in a

345
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,080
higher inflammatory environment and maybe we've gone too far. In other words, maybe we're

346
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,880
overwhelming the system's ability to clear it. And on top of that, we may have other risk factors,

347
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,880
hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, other drivers of inflammation that are now giving these LP little A

348
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,400
is another place to go, which is, yeah, you're ultimately going to end up at the liver,

349
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,040
but like 6% of you are going to get stuck in the sub endothelial space and wreak havoc. And

350
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,480
on top of that, you're doing a way worse job than the LDLP because the LDLP when it gets there is

351
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,720
bad enough, but the LDLP little A is now dragging all that oxidized crap in there with it.

352
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,080
So the next question is what is the problem with elevated LDLP little A or what are the problems

353
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,320
with LDLP little A elevated? So basically they fit into sort of three categories. The first being

354
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,080
enhanced atherosclerosis. The second, I don't know which by magnitude would pose a bigger threat,

355
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,920
but probably aortic stenosis given the severity. And then the third being enhanced venous thrombosis.

356
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,280
So what do those things mean? So basically more atherosclerosis, more aortic stenosis,

357
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,120
I believe about two thirds of the cases of aortic stenosis are explained by elevated

358
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,240
LDLP little A. So you have four valves in the heart and one of them is called the aortic valve.

359
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,920
That's the valve that separates the left ventricle from the systemic system. So the proximal aorta.

360
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,360
So that valve is under more pressure than the other three valves by a long shot,

361
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,040
because it's the one that's directly in front of the most powerful chamber of the heart.

362
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,160
That valve has three leaflets. It's a tri-leaflet valve. And it seems that LP little A has a

363
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,280
particular affinity for going there and inducing bone forming proteins to create calcifications.

364
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,400
And when that valve loses its suppleness and it becomes calcified, you get basically a blockage

365
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,960
of that valve called the stenosis. And so this condition of aortic stenosis is very problematic.

366
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,920
One of the earlier signs in the blood that somebody has aortic stenosis would be signs

367
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,520
of swelling or enlargement or dilation of the heart. And there are blood markers like

368
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,560
brain naturitic peptide, BNP or pro-NT BNP that are actually used quite frequently in

369
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,800
ERs to assess patients very quickly for cardiomyopathy or cardiac failure.

370
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,080
And so that's one of those things that we like to look at. And if I see a patient with LP little A,

371
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm always screening them for aortic stenosis out of the gate. I don't care if they're 30 years old.

372
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,880
I mean, many of our patients are in their 30s and 40s, but if they have an elevated LP little A,

373
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,360
we're doing echo at a minimum and preferably cardiac MRI, which is much more accurate, to

374
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,840
both look at the morphology of the aortic valve and get a very accurate gradient of pressure.

375
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,000
And then sometimes you'll get patients. I have a patient who has a bicuspid aortic valve,

376
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,640
which is going to be by itself that's predisposed to aortic stenosis. And he also has a very elevated

377
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,480
LP little A, about 250 or 300. So even though he's only in his 30s, he gets a cardiac MRI annually,

378
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,560
and he's already showing a pressure gradient. So, you know, I've explained to him that he is going

379
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,320
to need an intervention at some point in his life, but the good news is we're going to do it

380
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,120
long before he experiences any strain on his heart muscle. And the good news again for patients today

381
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,920
is this stuff's going to be done interventionally and not via open heart surgery as it once was.

382
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:31,280
On the atherosclerosis side, I think the Mendelian randomizations, the GWAS and the epidemiology all

383
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:39,200
tell a very similar story. I suspect that it's both its ability, it's probably an all of the above

384
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,400
when it comes to why, meaning it's, are these particles more likely to enter the sub-enthelial

385
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,280
space? I don't know why that would be the case. Are they more likely to be retained? Probably,

386
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,160
because they have that whole big cringal oxidized moiety thing there. Are they more

387
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
likely to kick off an inflammatory response? Very likely because of what they're dragging in with

388
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,200
them. And then on top of that, to have the prothrombotic component, I suspect is what's

389
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:16,720
driving the increase in the risk of atherosclerosis. But in truth, we don't have definitive proof that

390
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,400
LPa is a more atherogenic particle. And you and I were talking about this the other day that

391
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,320
there is this paper that actually was looking at patients with post-MIs and even suggesting that,

392
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,520
well, everybody who has an Mi has a rise in LPa. And we'll probably get to that later,

393
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,680
why we think that might be the case. But the question posed is, well, maybe LPa is the result

394
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,120
of atherosclerosis and not the cause of it. I don't agree with that because many post-MI

395
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,320
patients don't have an elevated LPa. And I think a better explanation for that is that LPa also

396
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,280
acts as an acute phase reactant rising with inflammatory responses. But probably not until

397
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
the antisense oligonucleotide trials complete, will we actually know the answer to this question?

398
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:13,200
Because really without a clinical trial, you can't actually infer cause and effect the way we can with

399
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,960
other aspects of atherosclerosis, like the LDL particle or inflammation, where we have elegant,

400
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,000
prospective clinical trials that create a relationship between cause and effect.

401
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,640
The last thing that I guess I mentioned was the thromboembolism. So I used to have a practice of

402
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,760
putting everybody with an elevated LPa on a baby aspirin just to combat the effect. It turns out

403
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
that that was probably an oversimplified approach and that there's only a subset of people for whom

404
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,080
aspirin counteracts the effect. So unfortunately, this is still one of those things where I don't

405
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,040
think we have a great answer. I do take DVT prophylaxis, so deep vein thromboses, prophylaxis,

406
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:03,040
prevention. I do take it more seriously in the LPa patients and there are certain strategies you

407
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,440
can take around flying. There's actually a commercially available product called flight tabs,

408
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,760
which you can buy on Amazon. I was, remember when we did the research on this, I was blown away that

409
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,200
you could buy these things on Amazon because they're actually quite potent. But I do recommend

410
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,880
that people with elevated LPa if they're on really long flights. And again, I'm not recommending that

411
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,200
for people who are listening because I can't, but I certainly recommend to my patients to a

412
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,360
subset of them that we're particularly worried about that we look at either pharmacologic agents

413
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,400
or even an OTC agent like that as a way to reduce the risk of these types of events.

414
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,320
So do we know how much elevated LPa is associated with these increased risks? If we're looking at

415
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,120
the epidemiology, what are the associated risks with cardiovascular disease?

416
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,560
So with aortic stenosis, the hazard ratios are anywhere from two to four, depending on the

417
00:40:52,560 --> 00:41:00,480
studies. And I think they probably median ends up being roughly two and a half. With VTE, with the

418
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,600
venous thromboembolism, I think the hazard ratio is about 3x. And again, it's important to put this

419
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,200
in perspective. We've talked about absolute versus relative risk. So when you talk about a 3x risk of

420
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,040
something that occurs like 1% of the time, that means you're going from a 1% absolute risk to a

421
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,560
3% absolute risk. So in other words, it doesn't mean like if you're listening to this and you have

422
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,320
an elevated LPa, you need to call an ambulance to drive you home because you're afraid you're going

423
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,080
to have a pulmonary embolism. And similarly, a hazard ratio of two and a half, three, even four

424
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,760
on aortic stenosis. As I said, it probably explains about two thirds of the total volume of aortic

425
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,880
stenosis, but it doesn't mean that every patient who's got this is going to get it. I think in the

426
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,160
case of that one patient of mine, his bicuspid valve is just a setup to make things worse

427
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,360
because he's now got a double whammy on that. And when it comes to atherosclerosis, basically

428
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:07,760
you see odds ratios of about two to four depending on the amount. So it looks like a pretty good dose

429
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:16,000
response where it's sort of below about 30 or 40 milligrams per deciliter. Because unfortunately,

430
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,840
all of these studies are done with LPa mass and not particle number. And I can't really convert

431
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,200
that, but we believe that that's probably about 50. That's probably, you're going to get comparable

432
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,160
in the 50 to 75 nanomole per liter is this sort of safe zone where it's relatively flat. And then

433
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,120
it starts to uptick pretty swiftly. So by the time you're at, call it 200 milligrams per deciliter,

434
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,640
you're at about a 60% increase. Now, if you stop for a moment and think about that,

435
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:56,960
what should you be more afraid of? A 3x hazard ratio for VTE or a 1.6 hazard ratio for atherosclerosis

436
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,240
or a 2.5x hazard ratio on aortic stenosis? This is like the advanced clinical epidemiology

437
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,120
question, right? I think the answer is the 1.6 on atherosclerosis is by far the most disconcerting

438
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,880
because atherosclerosis is infinitely more prevalent. So a 60% increase in risk on something

439
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,600
that is going to kill a third of people is a big effing problem. Whereas a 3% risk on something

440
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,600
that's going to ding 1% of people, yeah, we'll manage it. But that's not what we stay up late

441
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,160
thinking about. And even for that particular individual that has that risk profile,

442
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
that if they look at their absolute risks, that probably bumps up their absolute risk the most

443
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,200
with cardiovascular disease. Yeah. We're screening for aortic stenosis,

444
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,520
not because I necessarily think it's even at the population or societal level,

445
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,280
cost-effective, but at the individual level, we're not going to let that kind of stuff slide.

446
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But if you were to think about this at the population level, the thing we have to be most

447
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,880
concerned of is somewhere between one in five and one in 10 people, and in some cultures,

448
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,800
it's even higher. In Southeast Asians, it's even higher, are walking around with these little

449
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,520
time bombs. And to the point of Anahad's story, I'm still shocked at how many doctors don't

450
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,840
understand this. Now look, if you're a radiologist or a dermatologist, that's okay. I don't think you

451
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,760
need to know this. But if you sit anywhere on the front lines of medicine, if you're a family

452
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,600
physician, if you're a GYN even, because for many women, their GYNs become their PCPs,

453
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,400
their primary care physicians. If you are anywhere in the crosshairs of taking care of a patient

454
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,640
where you have some input into how they lower their risk of cardiovascular disease, and you

455
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,080
don't understand most of what we're talking about on this podcast, I worry that you're

456
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,280
missing an opportunity to help patients. Okay, so another question that came in,

457
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,920
I think you touched upon it very quickly, is what is the prevalence of elevated LPa? Probably what

458
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,280
is elevated LPa? How is that determined? Well, to my knowledge, everything that's done on this that's

459
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:07,360
published is based on the LPa mass, not the particle number. But the US levels define normal

460
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:14,000
as less than 30 milligrams per deciliter. The European atherosclerotic society defines normal

461
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,440
as less than 50 milligrams per deciliter. And I believe both the UK and Germany consider anything

462
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:33,280
over 60 sufficient for state covered apheresis. Apheresis is a type of treatment where a patient

463
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:41,040
has a very large IV put in one arm, typically about a 14 gauge, and blood is taken out,

464
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:49,200
run through a machine that spins at a certain frequency to generate a separation of the plasma.

465
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,560
And you can basically fractionate the plasma and identify something that you want to remove. So,

466
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,920
back when I was at NIH, I used to volunteer for apheresis every four weeks to donate lymphocytes.

467
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,080
And then they basically put everything back that once they strip out the piece they want,

468
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:12,400
but you can actually do apheresis and remove the apo little a. The problem is the frequency with

469
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,400
which you have to do it is staggering, because the half-life of these particles is a matter of days.

470
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,360
So, these patients would undergo apheresis potentially twice a week. So, that's obviously

471
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,440
a very difficult way to be tethered. So, we got into it a little bit there. How is abnormal LPa

472
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,200
treated or dealt with? So, you just got into the apheresis. Are there other therapies currently

473
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,520
available? So, apheresis is something that we just really never resort to or very rarely resort to.

474
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:51,280
And certainly now that PCSK9 inhibitors are on the market, I think that apheresis is becoming

475
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,600
probably less and less utilized. Historically, the agent for treatment has been niacin. Now,

476
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:04,160
niacin's got kind of a checkered history because it's known to lower apo B. So, you take niacin,

477
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,280
your LDL goes down. And this is a super contentious topic in lipid circles. But the question is,

478
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:18,320
does niacin save lives? And depending on how you look at the trial data, the answer is maybe or no.

479
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,720
It's like a wonder drug, theoretically, right? It lowers LDL, HDL goes up, LP little a might go

480
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,400
down. So, on paper, it looks at least up to that point, it looks great. Right. That's exactly right.

481
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,200
It does three things that we historically know when they happen. Good things should happen. LDL,

482
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:43,280
particle and cholesterol, apo B all go down. HDL cholesterol goes up. Although I would argue that

483
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,000
that's not a good thing. I think we have a pretty good sense of why raising HDL cholesterol inorganically,

484
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,520
meaning pharmacologically is not going to be good. And it lowers LP little a by probably a third.

485
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,480
C-TEP inhibitors? Yeah, exactly.

486
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,400
Five times the charm or? I think we're waiting for number five. Yeah.

487
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,240
But it turns out that in the trial that basically doomed niacin, the trial probably wasn't designed

488
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,680
that well in that they were giving niacin to patients who were already on a max dose statin

489
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,880
and looking for the HDL increase to see if that was adding benefit. And so, you basically get

490
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,000
lipidologists in two camps and actually it's not, it's quite evenly split, at least in my narrow

491
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,600
sampling of smart lipidologists where you get some who say niacin should never be used. And then you

492
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,400
get others who say, look, it's probably not a great drug, but if you have a patient who can't take

493
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,600
anything else, it's still a good drug. And I know lots of lipidologists who are still putting

494
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:50,240
LP little a patients on niacin, even though there are no data to suggest that that will save their

495
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,480
lives. But I got to be honest with you, I'm not convinced that that's necessarily a bad thing.

496
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,160
I generally don't. I now move to the third thing, which is the PCSK9 inhibitor. But I guess before

497
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,240
I do that, I should explain statins because everybody is probably saying where do statins

498
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:11,520
fit into this? And it turns out statins don't clear LP little a, which is kind of counterintuitive

499
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:20,000
if you know how statins work. So statins work via two mechanisms, what we call sort of the direct

500
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:29,040
and indirect mechanism. So the direct mechanism is that they inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is an

501
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,240
enzyme that catalyzes one of the early steps, if not the first step, I believe of cholesterol

502
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,880
synthesis. So if you're making less cholesterol, you would have less cholesterol, there would be

503
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,880
less cholesterol to carry around, you could require fewer lipoproteins. But that's not really the main

504
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:54,160
way it works. The main way it works is that the liver, in response to the statin, upregulates

505
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:04,800
something called SREBP2. And when that thing gets upregulated, it puts more LDL receptors

506
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,600
on the surface of the liver. So this SREBP2, which I'll just abbreviate for short, is called

507
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,040
the sterile regulatory element binding protein. It basically says, hey, the liver is getting less

508
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,760
cholesterol, and it wants more cholesterol. So I'm going to put more of these LDL receptors on my

509
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,680
surface to pull more in. Now, I didn't know this until recently, but one of the other things that

510
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:35,520
SREBP2 does is it actually produces more PCSK9. Now, PCSK9 is a protein that degrades LDL receptors.

511
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,640
So it's actually a bit of a check and a balance. So you have more LDL clearance because of more

512
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,480
LDL receptors, but you also speed up the rate at which those LDL receptors are degraded.

513
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:56,800
So the statin is causing these two indirect effects, but the net tends to be an enhanced

514
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,040
clearance of the LDL particle, the APO-B particle, and therefore a lowering of the LDL cholesterol.

515
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,720
But it doesn't lower LPa. And if you're listening to this and you remember what we talked about at

516
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,600
the outset, you're probably thinking, that doesn't make sense. LPa is just an LDL with an APO-A on

517
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,760
it. Why wouldn't the LDL receptor clear it? Because if the LDL receptor clears it,

518
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,920
it should also go down. I asked Tom Dayspring about this because a really interesting paper

519
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,520
came out a few weeks ago that actually tried to explain this. And like all good papers,

520
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,520
it ended up leaving more questions than answers. The best explanation that I understood from Tom

521
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:48,000
was that LPa will get cleared by LDL receptors eventually, but it's just the last in line.

522
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,080
So after the LDL is cleared and the VLDL is cleared, yeah, then you might get to the

523
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:03,840
LPa. But the problem is you never get there. So maybe in theory, if you increase LDL receptor

524
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:11,040
expression enough, or if you could knock out PCSK9 and offset the second piece of what the

525
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,440
statin is doing, the statin would work. And it turns out that that is largely what this paper

526
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,080
showed. And what we've always known, which is when you combine a PCSK inhibitor with a statin,

527
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,840
you actually do get a reduction of LPa. Whereas a statin by itself is anywhere from no reduction

528
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:37,840
to in some studies, an actual increase in LPa. And PCSK9 alone also lowers LPa. So to be clear,

529
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:46,880
PCSK9 inhibitors are not FDA approved for the use of lowering LPa. But those of us who prescribe

530
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,960
these drugs, both for patients with other indications and with LPa, generally acknowledge

531
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,840
that we're seeing about a 30% reduction in LPa, sometimes as high as a 50% reduction in LPa,

532
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,440
when patients are taking PCSK9 inhibitors with or without statins. And that also probably speaks to

533
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,360
the fact that we know that LPa is cleared by different receptors. So its primary receptor is

534
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:18,720
probably LRP2, but it's also probably cleared somewhat by VLDL receptors, and even something

535
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,480
called SRB1, although I'm not sure of that. And frankly, I don't know that anybody is. So that

536
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,600
what the PCSK9 inhibitor is doing is it's inhibiting PCSK9, and therefore inhibiting the

537
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,960
protein that degrades not just the LDL receptor, but these other receptors that clear LPa.

538
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,440
Interesting.

539
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,680
Sure.

540
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,680
I was just thinking about something. On statins, so oftentimes I'll read in the papers,

541
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:56,560
just to back up for a second too, I often read in the papers LPa, the words mysterious, unknown,

542
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,520
in some ways we're in our infancy and understanding this. But I think in one of those papers,

543
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,880
Samikas looked at the effect of statins, not only just statins in general, but different statins,

544
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:17,040
Atorvastatin, Pravastatin, Pitivastatin, Livolo, Arasuvastatin, and Simvastatin. I think maybe that

545
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,880
covers all the statins. If I'm just looking at his data, the LPa actually looks like it's trending

546
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,160
up on statins. Not only that, the oxidized phospholipids to ApoB are also going up.

547
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,280
Is there any explanation as to why the thing could actually be elevated?

548
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,200
Yeah, because the ApoB is probably going down. It's probably that you're lowering the denominator.

549
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,600
Got it.

550
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,600
That's my guess. What's clearly acknowledged is that when you give a patient with elevated

551
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:52,720
LPa a statin, which we do absolutely, it's not to lower the LPa, it's to lower the LDL.

552
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,560
Actually, I'm glad you brought this up because I missed the punch line in all the detail.

553
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:04,080
At least one of the punch lines is how do we treat patients with elevated LPa? Well,

554
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,880
we're probably not going to give them phoresis. If they can't afford to buy a PCSK9 inhibitor,

555
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,640
because it's certainly not going to be approved, you have only one other choice, which is to

556
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,520
actually have two other choices, but I'll get to one in a moment. It rarely works,

557
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,240
but it works occasionally. Your real issue is you have to give them a statin because you

558
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,440
now have a new LDL target. My LDL target, when I say LDL, I'm always referring to LDL-P.

559
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,360
My LDL-P target is the 20th percentile or lower for every patient.

560
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,320
How much lower you go than that is a function of other risk factors. Are we talking about

561
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,360
secondary prevention? What's the family history? Are they insulin resistant? All these other factors.

562
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,720
But a patient who's got an elevated LPa immediately falls into the category of all

563
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,760
things equal, they're at the 10th percentile or lower. You will often need a statin to get them

564
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,320
there. Now, not always. I have some patients who don't need a statin to get their LDL-P down to

565
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,760
the 10th percentile, but they're the exception and not the rule. I don't want people to get the

566
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,200
impression that if you have an elevated LPa, you shouldn't be taking a statin. Now, it's quite the

567
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,640
opposite. You probably should be taking a statin, but just understand that the statin is there to

568
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,720
control ApoB and not LpA. Okay. I don't know if we have enough ammo to cover this, but hormone

569
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,960
therapy, estrogen, I think has been shown to lower LpA. I didn't know that actually. This is an up-to-date,

570
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,920
which is a nice service that compiles a lot of this information, almost like a systematic review.

571
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,800
They have a section on lipoprotein A and cardiovascular disease and lipid lowering.

572
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,720
One of the things that they noted was estrogen replacement therapy reduces LpA levels by up to

573
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,880
50%. They have a couple references there. An effect that was somewhat mitigated by concomitant

574
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,880
progesterone therapy in some reports. I don't know if that's a women's health initiative,

575
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,000
so we're probably dealing with different variables, but not the PEPI trial. However,

576
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,840
the clinical role for hormone replacement therapy is uncertain and it is not recommended

577
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,240
for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. If that HRT topic wasn't compelling enough to go over,

578
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,280
I think this is another reason, another wrinkle to throw in there.

579
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,880
I'd like to understand that better. That strikes me as a bit too good to be true,

580
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,600
frankly, because certainly, if that's true, that's one, it suggests it might only be...

581
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,360
I guess the question I would want to know is, does that imply that women who go through menopause,

582
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,720
wouldn't they see an increase in LpA? All things equal if they did not receive HRT?

583
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,320
I believe so, yeah.

584
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,120
I'm going to go and look at the LpA levels of my patients who have gone through menopause

585
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,560
while under my care, but nothing jumps out at me. There was one other thing we didn't talk about,

586
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,200
which is what's on the front lines here in terms of really interesting stuff, which is these things

587
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,120
called ASOs, which is really the first treatment that is designed specifically to lower LpA.

588
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:07,760
So, ASO stands for Antisense Oligonucleotide. So, these are molecules that disrupt protein synthesis.

589
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,840
So, I can't remember exactly where they ask. I think they act after the messenger RNA,

590
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:19,680
between messenger RNA and translational RNA, but maybe they act between DNA and messenger RNA.

591
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,520
I should know this. I'm sure there's like... I'm sure that's a very well-known obvious fact

592
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,920
that I'm just forgetting, but the point is they disrupt the synthesis of ApoA,

593
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,880
which is occurring in the liver. So, this is a drug that goes right to the heart of LpA.

594
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,200
And I didn't say this earlier, but it's worth pointing this out.

595
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:46,240
When you go through my whole rigmarole on why do statins probably not decrease LpA,

596
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,040
it doesn't appear that anything that's going to lower LpA is going to do it on the catabolism side,

597
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:59,440
meaning the breakdown side. It appears to be on the synthesis side, the making side. And so,

598
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:07,680
while the monoclonal antibodies like the PCSK9s also increase degradation, they reduce the synthesis.

599
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,920
They're actually reducing the synthesis of ApoA on the liver as well.

600
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,880
So, these antisense oligonucleotides go right to the heart of that, and they directly stop the

601
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:26,640
synthesis of ApoA, and therefore, you just have your garden variety LDLs. These drugs have been

602
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,520
shown to have safety and efficacy. So, they have concluded phase one and phase two trials,

603
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,480
and they are slowly enrolling in phase three trials. I think three years ago, I said they'd

604
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,000
be done in five years. Three years later, I think they'll be done in five years.

605
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,960
consistent. The frequency distribution figure that we'll include somewhere,

606
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,000
it shows effective antisense oligonucleotide, and it says around 70% to up to 99%, so it could

607
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,160
potentially wipe out, virtually wipe out LpL. Yeah, no, even somebody who's got an LpL of 200

608
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,240
can be normalized. I'm a little leery of wiping out something entirely. It certainly suggests

609
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,960
that if you have this ASO, you can test a hypothesis in terms of LpL lowering therapy,

610
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,600
for sure. Well, that's what I was referring to at the outset, which was until this trial is done,

611
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:25,520
I don't think we can definitively know the answer of what is the true risk? How do you quantify the

612
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,840
true risk of LpL? I think we got through a lot of the major questions. This is awesome. We didn't

613
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:39,600
have to go for four hours. There's a bonus question. We're in the bonus round. There's some

614
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,080
other stuff we can talk about too as well. I think getting into the oxidized phospholipids,

615
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,840
how that works in the Lp, PlA2, we could get into. But one of the things that I was thinking about is

616
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:57,680
that with lipoproteins with LDL, with HDL, even triglycerides, you have some tools in your arsenal

617
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,120
just in terms of, let's call them behavioral modifications or things like that. If you

618
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,120
challenge somebody or somebody said, I need to lower my triglycerides in 30 days or else,

619
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,760
you could probably do that through diet. Absolutely. Triglycerides, by far the most

620
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,200
sensitive thing in the blood as far as lipoprotein lipid related molecules to dietary intervention.

621
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,880
In theory, it sounds like you can play around with a lot of the lipoproteins. Actually,

622
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,560
a lot of the biomarkers, but it seems like with LpL, it doesn't seem like it can be modified all

623
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,080
that much by lifestyle. Is that right? Or at least that's the current thinking.

624
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,560
No, that's absolutely correct. Probably the reason for that is,

625
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,760
as we just learned from the PCSK9 statin comparisons, directionally speaking,

626
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,400
there are two things that are driving LpL, how much you make and how much you clear.

627
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,040
But the game seems to be won and lost on the how much you make front.

628
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,840
How much you clear seems to be a second order thing. Now, when you look at LDLp,

629
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:02,720
just to contrast it, nevermind triglycerides, when you look at LDLp, you go back to four things

630
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,640
that determine the number of those particles. Three of them have to do with how much you carry.

631
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,040
One of them has to do with how much you clear. So three about the cargo, one about the port.

632
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,680
How many triglycerides do you have? How much cholesterol do you synthesize? How much

633
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,400
esterified cholesterol or non-esterified cholesterol rather do you reabsorb after it

634
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,120
passes through the biliary system in the enterocyte? And then what's your LDL receptor profile look

635
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,160
like? Primarily in the liver, but also in the gut. Now we just established you can clearly lower

636
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,400
triglycerides through nutrition. So you got somebody walking around with a triglyceride of 200

637
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:48,640
and an LDLp of 1600 and you do nothing but lower their triglycerides to 50 while I can't predict

638
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,800
what their reduction is going to be. It's likely going to go down. And so that's a lifestyle

639
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,080
intervention and that clearly does things. And it turns out that we know that diet is also going to

640
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:05,600
lower or raise. Certainly it has an impact on LDLc. That is known, but it also can have an effect on

641
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:13,440
LDLp through cholesterol synthesis and absorption. Now I think that the relationship there is much

642
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:21,040
less clearly understood. I've speculated about what I see occurring. There seems to be a subset

643
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,480
of people who when they consume high amounts of saturated fat see a really significant increase

644
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,560
in cholesterol synthesis. I think Tom Dayspring has written a really eloquent piece on this. So

645
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,040
if we can find it, if it's publicly available, we should link to it because I think it's a great

646
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:43,120
piece on the hypothesis around why certain people in the presence of high saturated fat just start

647
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,240
making much more cholesterol. And then of course the contentious topic is does it matter?

648
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,080
I don't think we know the answer to that question, but that's a point.

649
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:59,440
I was among them at one point. I think you get an NMR and it gives you your LDLp count. Is it in

650
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,080
nanomoles?

651
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,280
Nanomole per liter, yeah.

652
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:08,960
And it actually reminded me of Fletch and Gillette collecting rent, I believe. And he picks up one of

653
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,200
Gillette's letters and he says, oh, a letter from the Oakwood Potency Clinic. We're sorry to inform

654
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,680
you we can't process sperm counts as low as yours. So in the case of this NMR, I get the test back

655
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,320
and you probably know the number. Maybe it's like 2,500 or...

656
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,000
The upper cutoff is 3,500.

657
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,240
3,500 and it has one of those awesome greater than signs. It says greater than 3,500. It's like,

658
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,120
we're sorry, our machines can't process LDL particles as high as you. And I think during

659
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,880
the time I was doing an experiment where I was eating a lot of my calories were coming

660
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,080
from saturated fat. It was probably supposedly a well-formulated ketogenic diet, but coconut oil,

661
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:52,080
maybe some of it's coconut oil, butter, et cetera, but it was heavily loaded with saturated fat.

662
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,320
I would love to read that article because it's one of those things that's gone around the circles.

663
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,800
Is it good? Is it bad? But it is definitely something that's seen, I think.

664
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,400
Yeah. I mean, given how amazing we've made progress on this and how we've barely been

665
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,560
out for an hour and we're almost done. I mean, I'm happy to expand on this just based on my

666
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,480
observations because I'm sure someone's going to end up asking anyway. I've probably seen this

667
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,280
now a dozen times where either someone comes to me already on a ketogenic diet or we put them

668
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:26,720
on a ketogenic diet and they develop this change in their lipids. Now, there are some people who

669
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,200
will argue that it's transient and it's going to go away in a year or two years or whatever, maybe so.

670
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,360
There are others that argue that it's irrelevant, that the increase in the cholesterol synthesis

671
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,680
and the LDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol is actually a good thing and there's some reason

672
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,280
that they offer for that that I don't quite buy or understand. But my view is all things equal

673
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:56,560
until I know better, I'm going to assume that high LDL is probably problematic. More importantly,

674
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:02,960
the point is, are there ways to reverse the diet and reverse the condition and figure out what was

675
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,640
the component within the diet that was doing it? Was it the total fat? Was this the subset of the

676
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:13,840
fat, et cetera? And in all but one of those cases of maybe a dozen, when you just replace the saturated

677
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:20,160
fat with monounsaturated fat, even if they stay consuming a very high fat diet, the problem goes

678
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,880
away, which has not that that's proof of anything, but that really suggests to me that in those

679
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,640
patients, they're getting more saturated fat than they can process because I had one,

680
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,040
the first patient that I ever went through this with, my first thought was, dude, we got to take

681
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,400
you off this ketogenic diet, man. We can play keto camp all day long, but I'm not that comfortable

682
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,480
with these numbers. And he was like, but I'm not going off a ketogenic diet. And he had all his

683
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,040
reasons for why he felt better and performed better and all those things. So I said, okay,

684
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,600
well then we could keep you on a ketogenic diet, but I want to see what happens if your saturated

685
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:04,960
fat goes from 75 grams a day to 25 grams a day. And to do that, you're going to get really familiar

686
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,600
and friendly with olives, olive oil, and macadamia nuts. And he's like, I don't care. You know, this

687
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:15,520
kid, he was a young guy and he was, he'd do anything. He was kind of like a robot. And so sure

688
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:22,800
enough in like eight weeks of that change, his LDLP went from greater than 3,500 to, you know, 1,200.

689
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,560
Same thing. I had a lot of guacamole, macadamia nuts that replaced the saturated fat and the

690
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:35,680
numbers came down and everything else, give or take HDL, triglycerides, all that stuff were

691
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,680
sort of in the same ballpark as before, but that LDLP came down. Yeah. And I got to tell you, I mean,

692
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm sure that this will kick up a storm of people with, you know, very, very strong religious like

693
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,800
views on, oh, there's nothing wrong with an LDLP of 3,500. And, you know, again, I don't buy it

694
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,720
because the other thing I don't buy is a lot of those times you'll see the oxidized LDL go up as

695
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:09,680
well. And how are we in the middle of Manhattan and some knucklehead is like drag racing on 79.

696
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:16,720
I don't get that. It's the most gratuitous. I think we should, we should get involved.

697
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,400
We should rev up the engines. He likes cars. We just need some jackhammers right now. So,

698
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,400
yeah, when I see the oxidized LDL and CRP go up as well, which I often see with that, then I think,

699
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,840
you know, there's something else going on here. This isn't just a cholesterol synthesis problem.

700
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,040
It's an inflammatory problem. Something is, and look, I wasn't that guy. I mean, I probably ate,

701
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,360
when I was in ketosis, I was probably eating 200 grams a day of saturated fat.

702
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,080
Maybe not quite that much, maybe 150, but I was eating a lot of saturated fat,

703
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,320
but I didn't have any of those response. You know, my CRP was really low. My trigs were

704
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:00,640
non-existent. My LDL particle number was probably around the 50th percentile, you know, 12 to 1300

705
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,120
nanomole per liter. Like I just didn't have any of those findings. And again, I see a lot of people

706
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,480
who don't have those things. So I don't know why some people have these paradoxical reactions,

707
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,680
but I also don't think it's safe to ignore them just because insulin levels have gone down.

708
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,760
And going back to oxidized LDL, if you saw oxidized LDL going up, my newbie understanding

709
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:29,200
of this is that oxidized LDL is in a sense, LP little a. So that LP little a.

710
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,360
Well, that's oxidized phospholipid.

711
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,040
Yeah. So the LP little a picks up the oxidized phospholipids from the lipoprotein from the LDL.

712
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,560
And then that LP little a particle itself is now carrying the oxidized phospholipids,

713
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,880
but that's not a oxidized LDL.

714
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:52,480
No, the ox LDL assay is different from the ox PL assay. The ox LDL assay works independent of how

715
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:59,200
many ApoAs you have. I like to see that number below 40. Again, I think the lab likes to see it

716
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:05,200
below 60, but I like to see that along with the LP PLA2, which you alluded to earlier. These are

717
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,840
really local markers of inflammation. And those are important because if you see a patient with

718
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:16,240
an elevated C reactive protein, should you be concerned about it? I mean, yes, probably,

719
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:20,960
but the question is, is it cardiac specific or not? You can't really tell. So that's why

720
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:28,560
looking at fibrinogen and C reactive protein and homocysteine and LP PLA2 and oxidized LDL

721
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,720
help you get a better picture of if there's inflammation, how much of this do we think

722
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:38,640
is going on locally at a vascular level versus someplace else. You see this all the time in

723
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,280
people who have food insensitivities and things like that with respect to the fibrinogen, the CRP.

724
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:50,720
Yeah. So we'll probably throw in those figures. You just mentioned that the LP PLA2 and LP little

725
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:57,840
A, and then there's another thing called it's the oxidized phospholipids over the ApoB. And in that

726
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:04,080
paper, it's a 2007 paper. And I think Samikas is the last author on it as well. He's all over the

727
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:11,360
place. They show the hazard ratios and it's a J curve. So that the very the lowest, they call it

728
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,080
the sex style. So they partition it into six different groups. And on the lowest, if you look

729
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:23,200
at the hazard ratio, the hazard ratio is about two. So the risk doubles. If you have very low

730
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,440
LP little A. Does he explain why he thinks that's happening? I'm not. I wonder if it's an

731
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,560
artifact of ApoB being higher. Possibly. The denominator going up would shrink the total

732
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,400
number. I'll have to look at that. Are there any other LP little A questions that came through the

733
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,000
interwebs? Not through the interwebs. Well, then I think we can bring to a close our inaugural.

734
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,880
Chapter one. Chapter one. Vote on what you want to hear about. Any final words, Bob? It's interesting.

735
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:58,400
I knew about LP little A a little bit prior to on a hot article in January. And after doing some

736
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:03,280
digging, there's some other thoughts about this stuff that I'm sure we'll get into down the road.

737
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,120
But it's that proverb, I think Naseem Taleb quotes, he says it's a Venetian proverb.

738
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It says the further from the shore, the deeper the water. And so the more you dig into this,

739
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,080
the more you learn, the less you know, in a sense, you sort of expose yourself to a lot of unknowns.

740
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:27,040
So it's absolutely fascinating. And I think it also gets to how most physicians don't even know

741
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:32,080
about this stuff. And you alluded to it in one of our conversations previously, that there's this

742
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,440
lag in terms of the medical knowledge and what's the accepted wisdom and the guidelines and things

743
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:44,320
like that. So I think LP little A is one of those cases that's just, it's fascinating. The more you

744
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,960
learn, the less you know, but the more you want to learn. Yeah. And we're really, as you pointed out

745
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,520
earlier in our infancy of this thing. Yeah. If we were just going to put numbers to it, I think five

746
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,240
years ago, I had 50% understanding, like one unit of understanding to two units of perceived total

747
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:09,920
volume of content. Today, I'm at 10% understanding, 10 units of understanding to 100 units of

748
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:16,400
perceived total content. So has my knowledge gone up in five years? Yeah, it's gone up 10 fold.

749
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,120
The problem is my appreciation for how much information is out there on this topic has gone

750
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,720
up 50 fold. So my relative insight has actually gone down five fold. What is that? It sounds like

751
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,360
the Dunning Krueger effect a little bit. It's that when you know, like just like the surface level,

752
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,960
that's where you're the most confident. You think you know everything. And then as you learn more,

753
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,120
it's like that Dunning Krueger, it's like a you, and then your confidence and your knowledge goes

754
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:46,080
down. Hey, welcome to the 24 hour news cycle, cable TV, and Twitter, man. I don't know if that's

755
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,760
Dunning or Krueger, but it's that it's on the left side where it's everybody's very confident.

756
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,360
Well, in summary, I'd say the following. If you're listening to this as a patient,

757
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,040
you should demand that your LP little a be known. It's non-negotiable, especially if you have a

758
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:03,680
family history of atherosclerotic disease. If you're a physician, and this is your first exposure to

759
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,640
it, I hope that we've invited you to learn more. And I hope that we've provided you with enough

760
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,840
information that you're sufficiently curious and we'll certainly make a point to link to this some

761
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,800
of the what we think are more relevant things. Worth noting, I think about three days ago,

762
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,320
an ICD-10 code was actually just issued for elevated LP little a. That's a pretty big deal.

763
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:31,120
That's like one of the signs that it's not some little nerds only thing. Once you get your ICD-9

764
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:37,920
code issued, or ICD-10 rather. And if you are neither a patient nor a physician, I don't know

765
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,280
what you are. And therefore this podcast probably is not for you.
