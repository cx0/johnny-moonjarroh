00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,480
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,840
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,520
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,440
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,920
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,120
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,920
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,840
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. This week I had the pleasure of interviewing two

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,400
people, Dr. Avram Blooming and Dr. Carol Tavras. If Carol's name sounds familiar to you, it's because

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,080
it should. I've spoken about her often as she is the author of one of my absolute favorite books,

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,520
Mistakes Were Made, but Not By Me. And if you haven't read it, I recommend you hit pause now,

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,240
go and buy it, come back. Carol's a social psychologist and an overall great skeptic.

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,320
Her collaborator in this project, which we'll get to, is Dr. Avram Blooming, who's a hematologist,

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,000
medical oncologist, and an emeritus clinical professor at USC. He's also formerly a senior

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,120
investigator at the National Cancer Institute. The book we discussed today is their most recent

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,480
project, a book called Estrogen Matters, which as its name suggests is a book about hormones,

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,520
and in particular it's a book about hormone replacement therapy in women. Now I realize at

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,320
this moment about half the people listening to this, i.e. those of you who are guys are thinking,

56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,440
do I really need to listen to this episode? And the short answer is, I think you do. At the very

57
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,440
least, if you know a woman or care about a woman, you should be listening to this episode. Why?

58
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,480
Because in many ways this topic has created as much confusion and generated as much bad information

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,920
as any topic in medicine, and yes, I am including nutrition science, which is the absolute bottom

60
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:45,080
of our understanding of science. And the sort of parallels between the story of HRT and the

61
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,080
nutritional guidelines in the 70s and 80s is almost uncanny, and that comes across during this

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,480
interview when Carol and Avram tell a story that I had either forgotten or didn't know.

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,080
The book is written in, I think, a very clear way, and I do recommend that anyone who is

64
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,800
interested in this topic, you know, not just take our word for it in this episode, but instead

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,160
get the book and go through the references. I spent a lot of time utilizing my team to help

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,880
prepare for this interview, because as familiar as I am with this topic, and I think I'm more

67
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,000
familiar with this topic than most physicians, I still felt the volume of information was just

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,440
so great that I wanted to make sure I had gone back and read all of the studies in preparation

69
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,160
for this. And in many ways I'm glad I did, because it allowed us to really get into some of the

70
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,480
details here and hopefully do so in a way that isn't confusing for you, but rather at least

71
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,880
opens the door to your thinking about this. This is a very polarizing topic. It is almost a religion,

72
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,880
so you will see that there are people on both sides of this that are pure zealots, and unfortunately

73
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,200
that just makes it that much more difficult to sort of interpret the literature on this.

74
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,000
But in the end you will have to be the judge of this. It is certainly my view, and I don't hide

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,640
that view anymore, that most women do benefit from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement

76
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,920
therapy. But not all women do, and I think one of the challenges for physicians and patients alike

77
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,720
is trying to stratify which patients will receive much more benefit than the risk that's posed to

78
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,200
them, and of course perhaps as importantly identifying the patients for whom the risk

79
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,520
is outweighed, or is disproportionate rather, to the benefits. The interview largely covers the

80
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,160
subject material covered in their book, which is to say the history of hormone replacement therapy,

81
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,720
the impetus for the women's health initiative, a very serious critique of not just the initial

82
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,320
publication but the subsequent publications, and then a little bit of a deep dive into each of the

83
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,920
clinical conditions for which hormone replacement therapy should at least be considered. And of

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,600
course I think the most important of these is in not just cardiovascular disease, which gets a lot

85
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,440
of attention, but neurodegenerative disease, and I think Avram makes a very compelling case for that.

86
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,480
So without further delay, here's my interview with Dr. Avram Blooming and Dr. Carol Tavras.

87
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,960
Before we get to this week's episode, I want to remind everyone that one of the benefits of being

88
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,400
a subscriber is a discount program that we've created. Now the purpose of this was to take

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,880
the money that companies have offered to pay for advertising and say, look, instead of doing that,

90
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,160
I'd rather just talk about the companies that have products that I love and use without being paid

91
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,680
to do so, and say take that money that you would have given us in advertising and pass that on to

92
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,640
discounts as listeners. So the first one's coming out this Wednesday, and if you're not a subscriber

93
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,440
yet, that's okay. You've got plenty of time to sign up. Head on over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward

94
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,680
slash subscribe, where you can have access to this discount and future discounts. And now let's get

95
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,880
to this week's episode with Carol and Avram. Hey guys, thank you so much for making the trip down

96
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,000
from LA today. We're happy to do it. This is one of the topics that I have been meaning to explore

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,640
so deeply over the past two or three years through what was originally going to be a

98
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,920
multi-part blog post and a number of other things. And there always was a reason not to do it. And

99
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,960
then you and I spoke about a year ago, Carol, and I said, Carol, I'd love to interview you about

100
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,920
mistakes were made. And your response was, I can't talk about that book anymore. I'm so tired of it.

101
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,240
All I want to do is think about this new thing that I'm really excited about, which is Estrogen

102
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Matters. And I must admit, I was embarrassed at that point to acknowledge I didn't realize you had

103
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,480
been working on it, even though I had read the paper that you guys had written in 2009, which we

104
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,520
were talking about a few minutes ago. So it was sort of an aha moment for me. And I was delighted

105
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,520
because I thought, well, you're going to do a much better job than I would have done,

106
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,080
you know, because you're going to put so much more work into it. So I guess for the listener

107
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,720
that's not familiar with you, Carol, let's start with you, Carol, you're a psychologist,

108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,520
social psychologist, social psychologist. What's a social psychologist writing about estrogen for?

109
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,120
My lifelong interest has been in bringing good scientific research in psychology and medicine

110
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,720
to public attention. And as you well know, this is an effort that is not always greeted with

111
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,760
huzzahs and cheers. And thank you ever so much for showing us that our beliefs are wrong and

112
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,200
our time to be replaced. But it's my lifelong quest. And that's what I do. And that's,

113
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,320
of course, what mistakes were made, but not by me was about why it is that people resist

114
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,960
new information that is better to know, that is beneficial, that improves our knowledge.

115
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,160
And that's been my life work. And as a social psychologist, I have always been interested in

116
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,200
the barriers to critical thinking and the reasons that people do not accept information

117
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,560
when it is in their best interest to do so. So knowing Avram blooming for as many years as I have,

118
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,680
we have discussed over the years how our shared interest, his in medicine and mine and psychology,

119
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,840
reflect the same concerns. What happens when research calls into question some established

120
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,400
belief that is widespread in our society? You know, I know I've told you this before,

121
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,680
but I'll repeat it that mistakes were made, but not by me, would certainly be on the list of the

122
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,560
three books I have recommended and or gifted the most. And in fact, I remember reading it and just

123
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,200
somehow finding out how to get ahold of you and just calling you and emailing you and inviting

124
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,920
you over for dinner. You must have thought that was the weirdest thing ever. Not at all. I was

125
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,880
very flattered and pleased, by the way. And by the way, this work on estrogen that Avram has

126
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,280
so excited me about could be a chapter in that book. It actually is as are other things that we

127
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,880
have discussed, for example, dietary recommendations and things like that, that I know you have

128
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,600
contemplated going back on and thinking about that. So Avram, what about you? Tell us a little

129
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,440
bit about your background, your training as a clinician and why in particular this issue has

130
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,560
become something that's resonated with you. I'm a medical oncologist. I've spent over 50 years as

131
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,960
a medical oncologist. And my reason for going into the field was to help people live as long

132
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:30,360
and as well as possible, enlisting them, helping to decide how best they should be treated.

133
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:39,000
And breast cancer constitutes about 60% of my practice. And I've watched the progress in breast

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,360
cancer, very happily noting how many people we now cure. And in fact, our early breast cancer

135
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,040
now is about 90% curable. And I found that while I was making a lot of people better in terms of

136
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,320
the cancer, I was making them worse in terms of the symptoms associated with the treatments they

137
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:09,240
got. And when you treat something for that long, you want to understand what it is so that you can

138
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,920
treat it most effectively. And first, let me say at the beginning, I'm a medical oncologist,

139
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,640
and I don't yet know what cancer is. And I'm in very good company, because I don't know anybody

140
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,000
who knows what cancer is, even though many will tell you they do, and they're wrong. And so it

141
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,640
was important that I challenge every assumption on which my practice was based. And I've done that

142
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:44,040
continuously. And the major assumption dealing with breast cancer is that estrogen causes breast

143
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:52,920
cancer, and it doesn't. And almost everything we've done in the treatment of breast cancer is

144
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:00,600
based on that assumption, so that women have been denied estrogen for at least the last 30 years,

145
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:10,440
but especially since 2002. And the result is that many women have been hurt by being denied that

146
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,800
medicine. So let's take a step back in history now, because in your 2009 paper,

147
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,680
it's actually the second table, I was actually reviewing it again this morning. It's a beautiful

148
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,360
time course of hormone replacement therapy in women. So I'll let you guys decide how you want

149
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,160
to tell the story together. But let's go back to at least the 1940s or the 1950s. How did this idea

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:40,600
of, hey, women go through a pretty abrupt withdrawal of hormones. Let's take a moment to

151
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,520
think about how we can make that better. How did that idea come about?

152
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:52,840
I think to give us perspective, let's compare men and women. The number of women with breast cancer

153
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,080
in the United States is approximately comparable on an annual basis to the number of men with

154
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:06,200
prostate cancer. The number of women who die of breast cancer each year is also approximately

155
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,200
comparable to the number of men who die of prostate cancer. We like simple answers, all of us.

156
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,280
And to think that testosterone is responsible for prostate cancer and estrogen is responsible

157
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,880
for breast cancer is a very simple way to go about dealing with this. And what we found is

158
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,240
metastatic cancer of the prostate was initially treated with castration. If testosterone causes

159
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,680
prostate cancer, taking off the testicles eliminates the testosterone. And in fact,

160
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,080
it helps. It doesn't cure, but it helps in some cases. Similarly, we castrated women.

161
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:54,200
Estrogen is made in the ovaries. If we remove the ovaries, we can cause breast cancer to regress

162
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,120
once it has spread. And it does help. Not in many cases, but in a significant number,

163
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,720
it helps. As far as cancer of the prostate is concerned, that's where we stopped. If

164
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,880
castration didn't help, we did what we could to palliate. With breast cancer, what we did if

165
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,800
castration didn't help, we went on and removed the adrenal glands of women.

166
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Now, the adrenal glands make a small percentage of circulating estrogen. And by the way, they also

167
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,440
make a small percentage of circulating testosterone. We never remove the adrenal glands of men.

168
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,600
We remove the adrenal glands of women. And as you know, there are hormones made by the adrenal gland

169
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,360
that are necessary for survival. So once you remove the adrenal gland, you have to replace

170
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,320
the hormones that were necessary for survival. And we did that. If the adrenal gland removal

171
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,200
didn't work, we then would take out the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain,

172
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,240
because that gland produces a hormone that stimulates either the ovary or the testicle

173
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,640
to make the responsible hormone. And so we used to do hypophysectomies. And while I was in practice,

174
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,680
we did that. And as you know, the anterior pituitary makes many hormones that are necessary

175
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:26,040
for survival. So we had to replace many of those hormones, and we didn't really help too many women

176
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,240
with that. Let me reiterate, we did nothing like that for men. And we hurt a lot of women by doing

177
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,600
that. We did it with good intentions, but we hurt them. What we then found is when women had breast

178
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,160
cancer, because we were concerned that it might come back, we prophylactically removed their ovaries,

179
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,320
saying, well, if estrogen causes breast cancer, this will help prevent it from coming back.

180
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,920
And we tested that with seven different studies. None of those studies showed that it worked.

181
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:09,000
Did we ever treat men by prophylactically castrating them? Never. And we never will,

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,920
because men still control medicine by and large. So we were doing a lot with good intentions and

183
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,120
hurting women. We then were looking at what estrogen is capable of doing. And this goes back

184
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,120
to your question. Back in the 1940s, there was a book written called Feminine Forever that

185
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,680
essentially said, well, women should take estrogen forever, and it'll be an eternal fountain of youth.

186
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,880
That's not true. That book was oversold. The doctor who wrote that book was paid for by the

187
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:52,440
drug company who made estrogen. And we didn't know that until his son told that to the press

188
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:02,280
after he died. But estrogen did do some very good things. And what we found estrogen is capable of

189
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:10,280
doing is first, estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause. The way menopausal symptoms are

190
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,400
viewed as well, it's hot flashes and night sweats, and it'll usually last a year or two, and tough it

191
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,800
out lady, and you'll get through it. And point the fact, there are many symptoms associated with

192
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,200
menopause that aren't just hot flashes and night sweats. It includes palpitations. It includes

193
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:38,520
cognitive decline. It includes joint pains. Sleep disturbances, lots of things. And it usually lasts

194
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,440
about seven and a half years, not two years. And in some women, it goes on for decades.

195
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:54,200
And women are taught to suck it up and deal with that. Estrogen is also capable of reducing

196
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,080
significant heart disease by up to 50%. There was an article in the New England Journal of Medicine

197
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:10,040
in 1991 by Goldman and Tostersin that said, time for action, not debate, saying if women took

198
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:17,880
estrogen, they would live longer, they would be healthier. That was 1991. And we now know that

199
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:25,640
estrogen has been shown repeatedly to help diminish the risk for significant heart conditions.

200
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,720
So let's pause for a moment because I want to make sure that people listening to this,

201
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,480
and I hope it's not just women, but it should be men as well. Unless you're a man who finds

202
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,880
himself not knowing any women, then maybe you won't listen to this. But let's explain what these

203
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,240
hormones do a little bit. So there are not many papers that I have printed out in my office,

204
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,760
because we just don't print papers up that much anymore. You know, we don't physically have a

205
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,400
paper copy, but there are a handful that I have printed up. And one of them, of course, is the

206
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,560
WHI, both the 2002 and then some of the republications, because I do like to show people the

207
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,240
actual data, which I think speak for themselves. But another thing that I have printed up is the

208
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,480
hormone cycle for a woman during her reproductive years. And I started doing this about three years

209
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,960
ago, and I was surprised how many women didn't know what estrogen was doing in their body,

210
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,720
how it would rise during the follicular phase, peak during ovulation, decline during luteal phase,

211
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,000
and come up for a second bump before declining at their period. And similarly, how progesterone

212
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
would follow a small thing now. We're going to link to images of that in the show notes.

213
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,400
But the point I want to make is, you know, women go through this for what, 35 years of their lives,

214
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,400
maybe longer, maybe 40 years of their lives. And I guess I was just surprised that I remember

215
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,760
having a patient who was complaining of horrible PMS. And so I said, well, it has to do with the

216
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,120
reduction of progesterone. And in some women, the fall of progesterone during the end of the luteal

217
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,480
phase is so rapid that for reasons we don't understand, that's going to produce a change in

218
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,200
something. And you can ameliorate that by doing X, Y, and Z. And the woman looked at me and she

219
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,440
was like, this is incredible. Like you've made me feel like I'm not crazy because you've shown me

220
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,880
this graph that explains what's happening with my progesterone levels. So I do want to make sure

221
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,200
that someone listening to this spends a moment to understand what we're actually talking about.

222
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,280
You have these hormones that we're going to hear, you know, we're going to talk about luteinizing

223
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,040
hormone, follicle stimulating hormone. You've alluded to these already coming out of the

224
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,720
pituitary telling the ovaries to make these other hormones. And really, is it safe to say at the

225
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,560
risk of oversimplifying the reason it seems that women only experienced this during a finite period

226
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,840
of their life is that's kind of when evolution wanted women to be able to reproduce without this

227
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,680
cycle of rising estrogen, progesterone, falling levels, women wouldn't be able to reproduce. Is

228
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,200
the risk of oversimplifying? Is that a fair statement of why they have, we have this finite

229
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,600
window, finite window of during which time women have these hormones versus men who have kind of,

230
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,800
you know, men have a much more gradual decline in their reproductive hormones.

231
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,840
This is a crucial thing to say, Peter, this is really important. This was something I didn't

232
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,520
realize until we began working on this book. I assumed that in menopause, estrogen declines.

233
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,240
I think that's the way women see it. It just declines the way testosterone declines in a slow,

234
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,840
moderate way. No, estrogen plummets to 1% of what it was before menopause. I think most women have

235
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:38,440
no idea that it's that great a drop in estrogen levels. And no wonder that many of the symptoms

236
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,680
that women have, which by the way, include depression, and they attribute it to a, well,

237
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,760
it's a midlife crisis I'm having. No, it could be an estrogen depletion crisis as well. And so I think

238
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,480
it's really important for women to understand that this is not just a little fall off. It's

239
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,680
really a major drop. I want to add one thing here to this because as the social psychologist of this

240
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:10,760
duo, what interests me is the way women have been given false information for so many years about

241
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,240
so many aspects of their reproductive cycle and experience that it's no wonder that many women

242
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,960
have a great skepticism about what medicine has to offer them in reproductive issues. Just what

243
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,480
Avram was saying about there was so little hesitation in cutting women up and removing

244
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,080
this part and removing that part. Let's try this other thing, things that would never have been

245
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,760
tried with men, that men would just never have agreed to. And so women have had an understandable

246
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,360
skepticism about the medical establishment's advice. And starting with Feminine Forever,

247
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Robert Wilson's ridiculous song of praise to estrogen, women began to think, well, you know

248
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,000
what? The hell with all of you on this. Estrogen is, I don't need it. It doesn't make me feminine

249
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,480
forever. And who dares to think that I need to be feminine forever in that traditional way? And

250
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,920
menopause is just a natural phase of life and I can deal with it as I dealt with the onset of

251
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:14,760
menstruation. So what I want our conversation to bring here is an understanding of why women have

252
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,800
been kind of whipped back and forth on whether estrogen is good for them or bad for them.

253
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,000
And tying onto that, we left out another grotesque example of this, which Sid Mukherjee has written

254
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,840
about so eloquently in The Emperor of All Maladies, which is the radical mastectomy,

255
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,400
which ties into all of this. Avram, the points you brought up a moment ago, I wasn't even aware

256
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,760
of the pituitary resections. I was aware of the oophorectomies, of course. I had no idea

257
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,600
they were resecting adrenal glands, which strikes me as ridiculous, but to actually

258
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,480
resect the pituitary gland, I mean, that's macabre. It's, yeah, exactly. Transphenoid

259
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,360
resections. I mean, it's just hard to believe. And yet lost in that story, which should be added

260
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,520
just to complete the sentences. And up until Bernard Fisher came along, it was viewed as

261
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,480
completely nonsensical that you would do anything other than disfigure a woman with breast cancer

262
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,880
by removing every piece of tissue above her rib cage. It's an interesting point you raise,

263
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,040
right? I never really had contemplated, truthfully, which is, could that have taken place if the roles

264
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,200
were reversed gender-wise? I'd never really thought of it. Think also about hysterectomies,

265
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,360
the routine use of hysterectomy on the assumption that a woman, once she's had her children, doesn't

266
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360
need to have her uterus. And by the way, since we're removing her uterus, let's remove your

267
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,840
ovaries as well, because what the hell, they're just there. Let's take them out as if they have

268
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,800
no function, that casual attitude of let's just get in there and get rid of it. And the term

269
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,040
hysterectomy, you want to maybe provide a bit of context for the listener on what that means? Well,

270
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,720
hysteria was thought to be caused by the wandering womb, which detaches itself and wanders through

271
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:01,400
the female body, causing mayhem and despair. Yeah, yeah, part of our more ludicrous notions

272
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,480
about the female body. The point is women weren't treated fairly, and they're still not being treated

273
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,680
fairly. And just to amplify one point I made, I mentioned that estrogen can significantly

274
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,760
decrease the risk of heart disease. What many women tell me at that point is, well,

275
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,600
old women die of heart disease, young women die of breast cancer, I'd rather not take estrogen

276
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,920
if estrogen causes breast cancer. And the answer to that is twofold. First, estrogen does not cause

277
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,800
breast cancer, and we'll get into that in detail. But more than that, in every decade of a woman's

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:47,160
life, the incidence of death from heart disease is greater than the incidence of death from breast

279
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,640
cancer. I want to reiterate this point. It's like you were reading my mind and preparing for this

280
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,080
discussion. I did something I normally don't do. I normally don't put as much time into prep,

281
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,160
but this is such a data-driven discussion, and the data are just so voluminous that I really had to

282
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,640
spend a lot of time preparing, and my team helped me greatly. But I have a chart that we will include

283
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,720
in the show notes, which makes your point very eloquently. If you begin at the age of 25,

284
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,000
you take a cohort of 25-year-old women, and you forward-looking, project their 10-year-more

285
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,400
mortality from breast cancer and from cardiovascular disease, by decade, I'm going to read off the

286
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,000
difference in favor of cardiovascular disease. So if the number is greater than one, you'll die more

287
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,680
likely to die of a heart attack than breast cancer. If it's less than one more breast cancer,

288
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,600
starting at the age of 25, going up in five-year increments with a 10-year forward look. 3.5x,

289
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:51,640
3.5 times more likely to die of heart disease, 2.4x, 2.1x, 2.3x, 2.5x, 2.8x, 2.4x, 2.1x, we're now

290
00:28:51,640 --> 00:29:07,000
at 35 years old, 2.3, 2.5, 2.2, 3.3 by 55, 4.1 by 60, 5.6 by 65, 8.1 by 70, and 12.4

291
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:15,640
by 75. When you do the math on aggregate across lifetime, it's 7x difference in favor of

292
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,160
cardiovascular disease over breast cancer. Where are the red ribbons? Heart disease kills more

293
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:30,200
women than the next 16 causes of death, including all forms of cancer, AIDS, and accidents. The other

294
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,040
thing people listening to this know how near and dear heart disease is to my heart because it is

295
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,040
the number one killer for both men and women. There's another area where I think women get a

296
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,600
bit of a short straw here, which is women present with heart disease quite differently. Do you want

297
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,120
to say something about that? Sure. The typical presentation of a man is crushing chest pain,

298
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:55,160
pain that goes down the left arm starting at the left shoulder. Women can often present with an

299
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,200
upset stomach. And because we generally don't think of women as suffering from heart disease,

300
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,360
the diagnosis is initially missed quite often, although doctors are getting more and more

301
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,960
sensitive to that now. All right. So I took us off a bit of a detour. Carol, your point's a great one.

302
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,360
I want to come back to make for the first time in my career because I don't treat many women going

303
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,120
through menopause, but any woman who's a patient of mine who's going through it, I'm going to be

304
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,400
a part of it. But this past year, I got to see firsthand how quickly a woman can enter menopause

305
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,680
because if you happen to do labs on women frequently enough, you can see the drop. So

306
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,960
I had a patient who in August of 2017, I like to check labs on what would be day five. So I can

307
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,000
really standardize where the FSH and estradiol should be. She had what looked like completely

308
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,960
normal levels. Her FSH was something in the neighborhood of 10. Her estradiol was maybe 90.

309
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,960
She was starting to have symptoms though. So I said to her, look, you are very likely in a

310
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,080
perimenopausal state. I expect you will enter menopause in the next three or four years. She

311
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:11,720
was probably 47. Rechecked her blood in November. Her FSH was 68. Her estradiol was unmeasurable.

312
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,520
I rechecked the labs because I couldn't believe it. Same result.

313
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,880
Reached out to one of my mentors, a gynecologist named Riley Lloyd in Chicago. And I said, Riley,

314
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,880
what has happened here? And he goes, you just happened to see her fall off the cliff. This

315
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,640
happens all the time. It's just we usually aren't looking at laboratory tests that frequently.

316
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,200
So it's an interesting point that I'm glad you emphasized it.

317
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,240
And also, you cannot say exactly at what age. One of the women we describe in the book who wrote

318
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,160
a blog about this, Katie Taylor, who said she was 42. She was extremely depressed. She was having

319
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,880
all sorts of symptoms. She was treated for her depression with antidepressants. That didn't do

320
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,680
anything. Her doctor said, maybe you should quit your job. That will help your stress levels. Oh,

321
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,920
sure. And fortunately, her father is a leading breast cancer specialist in England. And he said,

322
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,600
you know what? You could be in perimenopause. And she was. And she was. So many of the symptoms

323
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,160
that women begin to develop in their 40s, they don't associate with menopause. Muscle pain sends

324
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,880
them to rheumatologists and depression sends them to therapists and fighting with their spouses,

325
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,440
sends them to family therapy. And they don't think that their changes of menopause might be

326
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,960
involved. I want to say, by the way, that I am one of the minority of women who sailed through

327
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:39,560
menopause with no symptoms and my mother as well. And so I underestimated how many women really

328
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,440
suffer. It's not a verb I like to use much, but many women suffer with the symptoms of menopause,

329
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,040
which I never did. And I think that many of the women who are kind of casual about menopause,

330
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,920
oh, you don't need to take anything. This too will pass. This too will pass easy for you to

331
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,400
say if you're not sleeping for seven years. Well, that's really interesting, Carol. I wasn't going

332
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,560
to ask you that on the mic, but I was planning to actually ask you that after, which was,

333
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,600
what is your personal experience with this and how much of a role has that played in your

334
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,280
motivation? And I'm interpreting your answer to mean your motivation for this is more in the

335
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,200
spirit of truth seeking than it is a personal vendetta. Absolutely. And I'm glad you brought

336
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,880
that up because it's the first thing people want to know is do you have a vested interest in this?

337
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,840
Do you want to defend your own decision to be taking hormones? Are you getting money from the

338
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,120
drug companies? So let's make this very clear here now. Neither of us has a vested interest in this.

339
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,840
Neither of us has taken any money from drug companies. I've been a vociferous critic of

340
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,040
big pharma and a lot of its manipulations of research and its inflated claims. And no,

341
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:53,080
I don't have a personal interest in defending HRT. In fact, as a feminist psychologist for many

342
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,200
years, I was really critical of the kind of take it for granted assumption that once a woman hits

343
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,520
menopause, then you got to fill her tank with hormones to get her back to being a real woman.

344
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,440
I was very critical of that, which was easy for me to do when I was 35. And Avram, I want to just

345
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,400
maybe give you the chance to say the same sort of thing. You've obviously provided a CV that

346
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,960
provides an interesting explanation for why you would care about this given the volume of patients

347
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,800
you would have taken care of, but is there something more personal? Was there a particular

348
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,120
patient that sort of broke your heart and meaning the experience that she went through broke your

349
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,760
heart and is something that you think about a lot as you're on this crusade? Some particular thing,

350
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,600
no, but in fairness, let me tell you that when my wife reached 45, she had breast cancer and she was

351
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:46,840
treated by me with chemotherapy and she went into menopause. And unlike Carol, she was very

352
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:54,440
symptomatic and she didn't complain for two years. She had the night sweats, the difficulty sleeping,

353
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:01,080
the joint pains, the palpitations, but women are supposed to suck that up and take it. And she did.

354
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,920
And then she started to find that reading, which is her passion, was now being challenged because

355
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,600
when she'd read a book, she couldn't remember what she had read two or three pages before.

356
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,320
She did numbers in her head. She's one of the smartest people I know. And she was unable to

357
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,880
remember telephone numbers. And that's when she spoke to me and she is one of the first people

358
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,920
I put on a study, which we'll get to later, which is a study of hormone replacement therapy in women

359
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,480
with a history of successfully treated breast cancer. And it took about two weeks and she was

360
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,280
back and she would never go off them. So I guess while we're on that topic, I'm going to tell my

361
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,440
story of why I started to care about this so deeply. A woman came to me about five years ago

362
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:01,240
who had survived an ERPR positive breast cancer. So for the listener, that means she had a breast

363
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,000
cancer that showed sensitivity to estrogen, progesterone. It was not her two new, I believe.

364
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,320
So it was ERPR positive, her two new negative. She was very young. She was probably in her early

365
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,080
40s at the time of this diagnosis. She underwent a hysterectomy, oophorectomy. At the time,

366
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,120
she also underwent her mastectomies. She basically became lost. So she described it to me. This was

367
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:33,640
before I knew her. She described it to me as being unable to get off the couch. She described

368
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:40,440
the fog of being something that her doctors at the time attributed to chemotherapy. And they said to

369
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,400
her, once the chemo is done, you will feel better. Three years after the chemo, she felt worse. And

370
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,200
it finally occurred to her and to her husband that maybe this had something to do with the fact that

371
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,400
at the age of 42, overnight she lost every sex hormone in her body. She couldn't find any doctor

372
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,680
on the planet who would prescribe hormone replacement therapy to her because as a breast

373
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,680
cancer survivor who's ERPR positive, how could you do such a thing? Though she did eventually find

374
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,800
someone who was willing to give her a trial. She felt immediately better. I mean, immediately

375
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,360
better, sort of as you describe it, within weeks, she felt like she got her life back,

376
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:27,400
could do everything again. And by the time I met her, she was on a very clever regimen,

377
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,440
which was mostly estriol, so topical estriol, not estradiol. And we can get into the details of that

378
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,520
later, along with she didn't need the progesterone, obviously, because she had hysterectomy and

379
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,040
physiologic replacement of testosterone to reduce sort of to about half a nanogram per deciliter

380
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,520
level. And her case interested me so much because I started thinking, wait a minute,

381
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,040
isn't she increasing her risk of breast cancer? And I won't get into the details of where that

382
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,040
took me, which rabbit hole, but it obviously in some way led to a converging discussion that

383
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:04,200
we're having today. So I want to go back to now we're in the 1950s. You've got the snake oil

384
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,200
salesman out there. He's telling every woman she must be on estrogen. When did the tide change or

385
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,920
when did the nuance start to emerge about different levels of replacement? In the 1970s,

386
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,240
let's just go back up Premarin, which is an acronym for pregnant mare urine, which was an

387
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:32,520
inexpensive way to manufacture a lot of estrogen and was and still is the dominant form of estrogen

388
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,480
sold in the United States. And that is the company, the company that makes Premarin is the one that

389
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:45,240
was supporting Robert Wilson. Premarin was being used on women who were going into menopause.

390
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:52,120
And in the early 1970s, we found that there was a significant rise in the incidence of uterine

391
00:38:52,120 --> 00:39:00,040
cancer. And as you mentioned, estrogen alone does increase the risk of uterine cancer as much by

392
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:07,720
as five fold. And so estrogen prescriptions fell off dramatically in the early 1970s.

393
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:16,280
By the late 1970s, we had learned that giving progesterone together with estrogen, either on

394
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,000
a cyclic or a continuous regimen, nullified that increased risk of uterine cancer. And so at the

395
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:31,560
end of the 1970s, hormone replacement therapy started to increase again. It continued that way

396
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:40,520
until about 2002. And in 2002, it is estimated that about 16 million women in the United States

397
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,440
were taking hormone replacement therapy, either estrogen alone, if they didn't have a uterus,

398
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:55,800
or the combination if they did have a uterus. And that constituted about 22% of the appropriate

399
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:04,680
age population in the United States. That was 2002. By 2004, it was down from 22% to 10%.

400
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:14,360
By 2010, it was down to 5%. And that was due primarily to the publication of a single

401
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,640
large study called the Women's Health Initiative, which you alluded to earlier.

402
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,320
Now, prior to that, there was a large cohort-based study called the Nurses' Health Study.

403
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,120
And many people looked at that and said, when you look at the Nurses' Health Study,

404
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:36,120
which is an epidemiologic study, so there was no randomization, the benefits of hormone replacement

405
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,840
therapy for women who had a uterus or estrogen replacement therapy for women who did not,

406
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,680
seemed quite compelling. And didn't some people actually ask the question, is it even ethical

407
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,640
to conduct a women's health initiative, which would, by definition, subject some women to a

408
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,880
placebo arm? Two things to that. First, the Nurses' Health Study was a study that was done out of

409
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:06,680
Harvard where 120,000 nurses were followed for up to 30 years. And yes, it wasn't randomized,

410
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,320
but the thought was that nurses were sophisticated enough to be able to report symptoms and to keep

411
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:21,000
careful count of the medicines they were taking. And it's a classic study. It still is. And what

412
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,640
they found, as you point out, is women who took it for five years or 10 years or 15 years had no

413
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,040
increased risk of breast cancer. And so when the Women's Health Initiative was first undertaken,

414
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:41,960
the ostensible rationale was not to see whether it increased breast cancer. What they wanted to

415
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,680
see is, did it really have a beneficial effect on the heart and the brain and the bones? That's

416
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,840
the reason it was set up. And there were some studies that said it did, and there were

417
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,520
two studies that questioned whether it did. And so the theoretical rationale, and I say theoretical

418
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,560
because there were motives that weren't immediately apparent when it was first set up.

419
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,080
But the theoretical rationale was to see if it was as good as we thought it was.

420
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:20,840
Now, one of the things that I didn't learn until probably three years ago, because my first

421
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,240
interest in the Women's Health Initiative was in the nutritional study, which was by budget,

422
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,440
the smaller of the two. I think you probably know these numbers. I'm probably guessing somewhat,

423
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,080
but the WHI was about a two and a half billion dollar study. Is that correct?

424
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,800
Was one billion.

425
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,560
Just one billion for both arms.

426
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Right. Compared to the wall, it's not a lot, but it's still a billion dollars.

427
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,680
Okay. I thought for some reason the one billion was just one arm and the other one, but nevertheless,

428
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,480
it was really two completely separate studies. There was the nutritional study, which we're not

429
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,800
going to get into. And then there was the study that you were talking about. This was initiated

430
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,040
in what year? About 92?

431
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,920
Six.

432
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,520
Ninety-six. Okay. And the fact that I'm alluding to, or the fact that I was alluding to a second ago

433
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,800
that I'll get to now, that when I saw it three years ago, I thought that has to be a mistake,

434
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,800
was the quality of the health of the women enrolled in that study. Do you want to say

435
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,960
a little bit about, for example, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, hypertension, and other

436
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,600
conditions?

437
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:33,880
Their average age was 63, 10 years after the average age of a woman entering menopause. 70%

438
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:41,000
of them were seriously overweight or obese. More than half were smokers. They had high rates of

439
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,960
hypertension. And this was not an ideal healthy sample by any means.

440
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:54,120
In fairness, if they were looking to see the benefit on heart disease, what they said was,

441
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,840
well, we're going to take an older population because the incidence of heart events would be

442
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:06,360
greater in that population. We would see a difference sooner between the women who were

443
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,440
on hormones and those who weren't. And so for economic reasons, it made sense to choose an

444
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,080
older population. But this was never a normal population. And as soon as the study came out

445
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:25,480
in 2002, it was immediately extrapolated to all women everywhere.

446
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,520
And there's one other detail about this study that I think you will shed more light on,

447
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,080
and you do so in your book, which when I first read it, I thought that can't be right.

448
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,640
But women who were especially symptomatic were excluded because of a concern that if you

449
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,160
took in women who had serious vasomotor symptoms and they were randomized to the placebo,

450
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,720
your dropout rate would be too high. Is that correct?

451
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:57,480
That's correct. And that would be all right if you acknowledge that up front. But three years

452
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:05,800
after the study was first published, there was a study saying that it has absolutely no benefit

453
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:12,120
on quality of life. And the first question when you read that is what planet were these people

454
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:20,520
living on? And the reason they found that is because women who were significantly symptomatic

455
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,680
were excluded for just the reason you stated that if they had been randomized to placebo,

456
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:34,360
the fear was they would stop the placebo and drop out of the study. And so what the report said

457
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:41,640
is, well, among these women, the majority of whom were not symptomatic, we found no improvement

458
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,520
in the symptoms that weren't there. But the New York Times headlined it saying hormones have no

459
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:55,560
benefit even on quality of life. By the way, the 13% of the women who were symptomatic

460
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,480
had a significant improvement, but they were lost among the entire population.

461
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, you would have been very statistically underpowered to catch them because they represent

462
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
such a small subset of the cohort.

463
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,800
Let me just give you one bit of history here. When the Women's Health Initiative,

464
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:20,120
it did one of these stop the presses thing. We've found this increased risk of hormones on

465
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,040
breast cancer. So we have to stop our study immediately and have press conference and

466
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:30,280
announce this terrifying finding. And I remember clearly from calling me up and saying,

467
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:38,520
Carol, they're announcing this alleged increase in the risk of breast cancer. Number one,

468
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,880
the journal article, JINJAMA, has not even been published yet. You could not go directly to the

469
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,240
journal itself and look up the findings for yourself. This is a big no-no in scientific

470
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:58,280
communication and publication. But also, the increased risk, this alleged increased risk

471
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,720
of breast cancer was not statistically significant. It wasn't statistically significant. In my

472
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,560
business, you don't get to go into publication and say, gee, we didn't get any significant results

473
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,880
here. We found something that looks problematic or interesting and maybe we need to do more research,

474
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:25,320
but not significant. And that's what really first gave us pause. Why are they heralding

475
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:35,080
this strange finding for what purpose and why are we wanting to scare an audience in advance

476
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:42,760
of actually offering the real data? And that's what got our skeptical neurons flaring.

477
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,920
I want to come back because we're going to go really deep on the difference between absolute

478
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,920
risk, relative risk, the difference between the CEEs versus the CEE plus MPI. I want to go deep on

479
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,840
that. But I want to pause here for a moment to ask you an honest question, which is you hear this

480
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:05,160
and it stinks of conspiracy theory, except that I'm the most anti-conspiracy theory guy out there.

481
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,120
I typically attribute to incompetence rather than malice. I mean, like it's Oswald killed Kennedy.

482
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,800
There's no two ways about it. We don't want to believe that. We want to create a bigger narrative

483
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,760
because Kennedy was so significant and Oswald was so insignificant. But the reality of it is

484
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,040
conspiracy theories almost never hold up. Was there a conspiracy? I mean, I'm using the word loosely

485
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,360
and I'm trying to, I'm asking in the loaded way, but when you look back at it through the lens of

486
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,560
what we know today, it seems improbable that this cluster could have taken place.

487
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:43,000
I think they were behaving just like scientists who went into this research with a strong belief

488
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,560
that HRT is harmful to women and in particular increases the risk of breast cancer. Jacques

489
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,440
Rousseau, who was the cardiologist who led the women's health initiative, had published an

490
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,240
article in, I don't remember which medical, 1996 basically saying it's time to bring the HRT

491
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:07,640
bandwagon to a halt. The HRT bandwagon. He says too many women are on HRT. This is not a good

492
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:15,720
thing and it's time to stop the rolling bandwagon. So he himself clearly had some kind of bias going

493
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,880
into the direction of this study. I don't think it's not a conspiracy. You as a reader of mistakes

494
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:28,840
were made, but not by me know that when you go into a research project with a belief that you

495
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:37,160
really are sure of, you see in the data what you expect to see in the data. I mean, I remember

496
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,960
years ago the first book I ever wrote, which was on anger. In those days, people thought that

497
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,680
ulcers were caused by suppressed anger. And I would go and look at these journal articles. These

498
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,120
were not malevolent people or fraudulent researchers, but they so deeply believed that

499
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,000
suppressed anger causes ulcers that they would say, well, we didn't actually get a significant

500
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,480
result here, but it's looking like that's what it would be if it were significant. I mean, really.

501
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:08,920
Let me add two things to that if I can. First, the article says, this is the 2002 article of

502
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:15,320
the Women's Health Initiative, says that this increased risk of breast cancer almost reached

503
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,440
nominal statistical significance. I don't know of any other article anywhere that states that.

504
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,600
Statistically significant doesn't mean it's true, but it means the finding has a less than

505
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:36,520
one in 20 chance of being a coincidence. So it's worthy of investigation, but almost reached

506
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,200
nominal statistical significance. That sounds like you're straining to reach a conclusion

507
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,040
that you didn't reach. But there had to be other accomplices here. So on some level, the journals

508
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,400
had to at least make a case here. By the way, out of curiosity, why did this end up in JAMA,

509
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,280
not New England Journal of Medicine, the initial publication? Any?

510
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,200
They've published in both JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine.

511
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,320
Yeah, but the first one. Why?

512
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:09,960
The first one was JAMA. JAMA may have accepted it first. And JAMA came out with the press release.

513
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,960
I don't know of any other situation where JAMA or the New England Journal came out with a press

514
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,320
release before the published article was available to doctors to read.

515
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:27,400
Well, and you saw, of course, in our chapter on this, Robert Langer, writing last year why he

516
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,920
waited so long, we don't know. But he was one of the investigators who revealed the background

517
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,800
story about this. There were 40 principal investigators distributed across the country.

518
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,200
They were summoned to a meeting to discuss the paper that was going to appear in JAMA.

519
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,560
They were told for the first time what this article was going to consist of. It had been

520
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,320
written by three members of the writing committee for the Women's Health Initiative. They said,

521
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,640
you can't do this. And they were told, well, okay, let's see, it's 9am. You have until noon to read

522
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,440
this report and offer your criticisms. And at noon, when they offered whatever they could put

523
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,600
together in three hours, they were told too late, the article has been published in JAMA and it's

524
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:15,560
at the warehouse ready to be sent out. So for conspiracy, who? Most of the investigators

525
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:22,200
themselves never saw that first JAMA article. I invited one of those three investigators to

526
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,200
come speak at my local hospital several months after the study was published. And he was asked

527
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:35,640
by one of the doctors in the audience about the significance of the findings and how come this was

528
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:43,080
published around the world. It was responsible for a 50 to 70% drop in hormone prescriptions.

529
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,920
And yet it looks as though the data aren't statistically significant. What am I missing?

530
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:55,560
The doctor asked. And he was told by one of the three, you know, this is the most expensive study

531
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:02,440
ever done. By the time we're finished, it will cost about a billion dollars. And so if we think

532
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:09,000
we have found something and the results don't quite add up, and this is a direct quote,

533
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,480
the statistical police have to leave the room. And the medical audience was aghast.

534
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,360
Who were the three writing authors of the study?

535
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:26,280
Rowan Chlibowski was the doctor who's a professor at UCLA who was talking. Jacques Rousseau was the

536
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,720
principal investigator. And I'm not sure.

537
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:50,140
The

538
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,580
doctor was a professor at UCLA.

539
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,700
What's sort of disturbing when in reliving this story, because I read your book like six months

540
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:07,420
ago, so I feel like I'm reliving this. This bears an uncanny resemblance to another story

541
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:14,540
that took place in the mid eighties when the dietary guidelines were being set. And there

542
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:19,740
was basically an NIH consensus that took place. And I was giving a talk. There was a grand rounds

543
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:28,380
at UCSD in 2011, I believe, or maybe 2012. And I gave the talk about how there was this consensus

544
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:34,700
and everybody went in a room and 36 hours later they came out with this consensus. But the problem

545
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:40,220
was the consensus didn't match the data. It wasn't orthogonal to the data, but it was very far from

546
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,540
what the data were. And I believe it was Mark Hegstead who's no longer alive, who at the press

547
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:50,380
conference said when asked something about, don't you feel like maybe we need to know the answer

548
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,700
a little bit more? And he basically made a similar argument, which was with the stakes being as high

549
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,980
as they are, we don't have time to wait for definitive answers. So I give the, I give my

550
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,940
talk after the talk, a woman comes up to me and she says, I was an endocrinologist at NIH and I

551
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,700
was one of the, and I can't remember how many people were in the room, call it, you know,

552
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,900
40 people or whatever. I was one of the people invited to that. I think it was Basil Rifkin.

553
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,980
I can't remember who was the person that was running the section, but she said, and I'm not

554
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,020
making this up though. I obviously am paraphrasing. She said, when we sat down in the room, they closed

555
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:29,660
the door and they said, here it is. We've already written the consensus statement. Nobody leaves

556
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:36,860
this room until we all agree to this statement. And she said they were basically held hostage in

557
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,220
that room until they agreed to the consensus statement, which 36 hours later they basically

558
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,860
did. And they all left the room. I even remember her making a case about how they brought in really

559
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:52,300
crappy Chinese food to sort of feed them a little bit, give them enough food. But I mean, that story,

560
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,940
I've never forgotten that story and it was very upsetting and it really is an extreme example of

561
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:02,380
mistakes were made, but not by me. I do believe that, you know, Basil Rifkin and Mark Higgs had

562
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:09,180
and all these guys had good intentions, but they were now so far gone from any sense of understanding

563
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:15,020
what data meant that it was irrelevant. I mean, they had gone purely into the role of evangelists

564
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:22,780
and the story you just told sounds so unfortunately similar that it's like I'm in a bad movie.

565
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,980
It doesn't even, it doesn't sound possible. The other thing of course is the negativity bias,

566
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:34,940
which cognitive psychologists have studied, finds that people are more drawn to negative news than

567
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:41,740
to positive news. And certainly negative news is what sells, what gets attention. I think if the

568
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:47,500
Women's Health Initiative had stopped the presses to say we are happy to report that HRT is beneficial

569
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:53,820
for women and prolongs their lives and makes them feel better, this would not have been as newsworthy

570
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:59,580
or as shocking. You know, and Jacques Rousseau told a reporter from the New York Times that they

571
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:05,020
wanted to do it this way to break into the noisy news cycle and get attention for the study.

572
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,980
Would be nice if you had good data behind your press release, but so there were a number of

573
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,900
motives. If so much money had been spent on this, don't we have to have something really worthwhile

574
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,620
to say to warrant that expenditure? Let's talk a little bit about the statistics. So one of the

575
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:32,060
tables I have printed up in my office is from, I think it's the 2014 or 2015 JAMA paper that went

576
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:38,700
back and looked at all the data because a lot of times women will say to me, doesn't HRT increase

577
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:44,540
the risk of breast cancer by 25%? That's the common question I get asked. Doesn't HRT increase

578
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,140
the risk of breast cancer by 25%? So where'd they get that number, right? They're getting that number

579
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:53,900
from the news. So let's talk about where that number came from. The first number is 26%

580
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,820
just to be a stickler. Yes, exactly. But we round. We round to the nearest five. Well, because they

581
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:07,820
came out two years later with 24%. That's correct. The initial 26% was among women who took

582
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:14,780
hormone replacement therapy, meaning the combination of estrogen and progesterone. If you look at

583
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,100
estrogen, let me interject for a moment because I should have done this earlier. Let's explain

584
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:24,220
what the study looked like in terms of randomization. You had two cohorts of women, correct? You had

585
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:29,980
women who had already undergone a hysterectomy and they were randomized to estrogen or placebo.

586
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,220
Correct. So CEE, so conjugated equine estrogen or placebo and women whose uterus was still in place

587
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:43,500
were randomized to CEE plus MPA versus placebo, correct? Correct. Was the randomization one

588
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:49,100
to one to one through all of that? Yes. Okay. The women who were randomized to estrogen had no

589
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:55,020
increased risk of breast cancer. In fact, if you want to be a stickler and play the same game,

590
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:02,460
my recollection is those women had a hazard ratio of 0.79 and the confidence interval ended up at

591
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:12,300
1.01. To translate that into English, the women who were on estrogen only had a 21% risk reduction,

592
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:17,820
but the 95% confidence interval crossed unity, which meant it was not statistically significant.

593
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:23,340
The P value was 0.07 if my memory serves me correctly, which meant there was a 7% chance

594
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:28,300
that that effect was random, meaning it didn't hit the 5% threshold. Right. But I remember that

595
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:36,620
mostly. Pretty, pretty close. The fact is there was no real increase among the women who got

596
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:41,420
estrogen alone that we would hang our hat on. There was one paper that came out that actually

597
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:48,860
showed a 30% significant decrease, but that didn't hold up in subsequent papers. So let's

598
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:55,500
say there's no increased risk with estrogen alone. With estrogen and progesterone, there was a reported

599
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:03,660
26% increase. And it's important that we understand what that is. First, that was not statistically

600
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:10,540
significant so that by scientific standards, we think that could have been caused by chance alone.

601
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,260
What was the P value? I don't remember the P value.

602
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,180
But you're saying it was definitely below. It was above 0.5.

603
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:24,540
Yes, it wasn't statistically significant. But in order for there to be a 26% increase,

604
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:34,860
you have to know what the actual risk in numbers was for women who got the estrogen plus progesterone.

605
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,260
So let's hit pause and explain absolute. Yeah, you're going to explain absolute versus relative.

606
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:46,780
You're comparing the incidence among women who took the two hormones compared to women

607
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:54,700
who were randomized to a placebo. And there was this 26% reported increase. Now, you could have

608
01:00:54,700 --> 01:01:03,900
a 26% reported increase if you have a real increase in risk or if your control, the women

609
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:11,020
who were randomized to placebo had a lower than expected risk of breast cancer. And in fact,

610
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:16,860
when you look at those numbers, you find that when you compare the women who were randomized

611
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:25,020
to the two hormones compared with the women who were randomized to placebo on the estrogen only

612
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:31,820
arm, there was no increased risk even among the women who were randomized to the two hormones.

613
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:40,460
It was because there was a lower than expected risk among the control group who were randomized

614
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:46,300
to the two hormones that you had what looked like an increased risk, not a statistically

615
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:52,380
significant one, but an increased risk. What's the best explanation for that? Is there one? Yes.

616
01:01:52,380 --> 01:02:04,140
The women who had taken hormones before being randomized on the study, who were randomized to

617
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:13,740
placebo, had a lower expected risk of breast cancer than women who had never taken hormones.

618
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:21,980
If you take the women who had taken hormones before going on the study and remove them from

619
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:29,020
the control group, you find no increased risk when you compare the women who got the hormones

620
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:36,460
with the residual women in the control group. So the women who were taking hormones before the study

621
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:44,300
had a lower than expected risk of eventual breast cancer. They lowered the control group number,

622
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:51,660
and they gave you this artificial increased risk that you saw among the women who took the two

623
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:58,220
hormones. Is that clear? Of course, it's always hard to make that clear. That's an example of the

624
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:06,620
kind of data manipulation that went on to try to create the impression of a real finding that really

625
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,420
was not there. But Peter, to your question about absolute and relative risks, that's what's crucial

626
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:20,540
here. If I say that eating a grapefruit doubles my risk of bunions, I need to know what numbers

627
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:26,860
we're talking about. If the numbers jump from one person to two person out of a hundred or out of a

628
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:32,700
thousand, that's not a very big... I can say it's doubling the risk, but it's trivial. But if the

629
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,820
numbers double from 500 to a thousand in a group of 10,000, then we might have a finding we should

630
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:45,020
be paying attention to. Most studies, epidemiologists, of course, report relative risks where we don't

631
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:49,500
even know. In some cases, we don't even know what the absolute numbers are. Abram and I were at

632
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:58,460
pains in our book to see when we would read studies that reported an increased risk of X, Y, or Z,

633
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,660
or a reduced risk of something, to see what the absolute numbers were. Are we talking about

634
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:09,660
outliers? Are we talking about a finding that's really statistically strong as well as significant?

635
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,300
And in many cases, we couldn't even find what the absolute numbers were. But where we could, we

636
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:19,260
really paid attention. By my calculation, which you can do straight out of the data reported in

637
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:26,460
the Women's Health Initiative, the absolute increase in risk, if you believe the 26%

638
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:37,660
relative increase, it calculated at about 0.9 cases per thousand or nine cases per 10,000.

639
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:37,660


640
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:45,340
So it was less than 1% absolute risk increase, even if it turned out to be true, which by the

641
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:51,980
way, to simplify matters, when I'm talking to women about the risks of hormone replacement

642
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:57,340
therapy, I say, as a general rule, consider the Women's Health Initiative, you're ceiling on risk.

643
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:03,020
This is probably as bad as it would get. And if you would accept that there's an increase of 1%

644
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:07,820
in your risk of breast cancer, and here are all the caveats on why I find that hard to believe,

645
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:13,820
but at least you have a case study here for how bad it could be when you stack the deck against

646
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:18,300
you statistically. And against that is what are the benefits to you?

647
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:26,300
Well, that's the point. Absolutely. But even talking about those risks, which we don't accept

648
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:32,060
as real, and there were other studies like the Nurses Health Study that, as I mentioned earlier,

649
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:38,540
showed that there is no increased risk of breast cancer with hormones taken for 5, 10, or 15 years.

650
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:46,940
Even assuming those risks, we know that women who were diagnosed with breast cancer while on

651
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:55,260
hormones have a better prognosis, stage for stage, than women who were diagnosed not taking hormones.

652
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:01,180
And even the Women's Health Initiative, in one of the subsequent papers, said that the women who

653
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:08,140
had been randomized to hormones and have gotten breast cancer had a lower risk of dying from

654
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:12,460
breast cancer than the control group that didn't get hormones.

655
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:18,140
This is huge. This is such an important thing for physicians and for women to understand,

656
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:23,980
and it seems so counterintuitive. Women who've had breast cancer, who are on HRT,

657
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,820
have a better prognosis. This is astonishing.

658
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:32,860
And what's interesting about it is you can dismiss the Nurses Health Study on that because of the

659
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:39,100
healthy user bias that goes into it. It is easy to say, and I think it's a legitimate criticism,

660
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,100
that the women in the Nurses Health Study who had better outcomes, of course they had better

661
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,940
outcomes. They were more health conscious. They were nurses. They were selected through that

662
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,740
process to be that way. So the proponent of the Women's Health Initiative will say it's a better

663
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:58,940
study because it was randomized, notwithstanding the limitations of that. But it's interesting

664
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,020
that in this subset analysis, which is always fraught with its own statistical issues,

665
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:08,620
the finding of the Nurses Health Study with respect to this point you make still held up.

666
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:16,060
That is to say, I'll repeat it because it is so important, a woman who is on HRT at the time of

667
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:22,780
breast cancer diagnosis has a lower rate of mortality, not just all cause, but breast cancer,

668
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,420
if I'm correct. Yes. And if we amplify that just a little,

669
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:36,060
hormones have been used, estrogen specifically, has been used to treat breast cancer. And there

670
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:42,540
have been significant favorable responses. I can't imagine treating lung cancer by increasing the

671
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:50,380
number of cigarettes you smoke every day. And yet, as early as 1944, there were researchers

672
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:58,380
publishing a 25% response rate among patients with measurable breast cancer who were treated

673
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:07,420
with estrogen. If a woman gets pregnant after breast cancer, flooding her body with estrogen,

674
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:15,020
and we used to advise women never to do that, and women disregarded our advice, the pregnancy

675
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:22,380
does not increase the risk of breast cancer coming back. If anything, it decreases the risk

676
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:28,460
of cancer coming back. This is what I find so important and so fascinating, which is the heart

677
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:36,540
of this discussion is to try to puncture the widespread premise that estrogen causes breast

678
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:44,220
cancer. And that's, of course, the great fear, but it's just an embedded assumption. And here,

679
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:50,540
as Avram has just described, research from treating women with breast cancer, or women

680
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:56,300
who are pregnant, or women who began menstruating very early, the many directions we might look at

681
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:02,060
women on birth control pills, do any of those things that increase the amount of estrogen in

682
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:07,420
your body, is that related in some way to breast cancer? And it is not. That's the key.

683
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,620
So another interesting aspect of looking at the Women's Health Initiative,

684
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:15,740
which it's very hard to look at the data and not ask the question, what is the role of MPA?

685
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:22,700
Because when you look at the women who had a uterus, these are women who got estrogen and

686
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:29,020
progesterone, synthetic progesterone, progestin, versus placebo, there was a trend towards a higher

687
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:35,740
breast cancer. But when you look at the opposite, the women who had no uterus, and therefore only

688
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:41,660
needed estrogen, the trend was in the exact opposite direction to the exact same magnitude.

689
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:46,700
I mean, it almost looks like you couldn't make it up. There are, they are mirror images of each

690
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:52,620
other. So you have to ask the question, what are the differences? And there are two. One of them

691
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:58,780
had a uterus, one did not, and one took synthetic progestin and one did not. So the question is,

692
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:05,580
does not having a uterus and or does taking synthetic progesterone make a difference?

693
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:12,620
First on the synthetic progesterone, it's MPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate, which was used

694
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:18,700
in the Women's Health Initiative because that was the most widely prescribed progesterone available

695
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:25,500
in the United States. First, let me go back to saying that the increased risk seen with the

696
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:33,100
combination was not statistically significant, did not hold up, and was due largely to a problem

697
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:38,940
with the control group. If you accept that, anything we say at this point is…

698
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,740
Speculation.

699
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:47,660
…and irrelevant, really, but I'll take your question. So what has resulted from that is people

700
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:53,740
are saying, well, the problem really isn't estrogen. We'll give estrogen a pass. The problem

701
01:10:53,740 --> 01:11:01,020
is progesterone, and in fact, this particular synthetic progesterone. Well, I'm not sure

702
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:07,660
there's a problem because the numbers don't really bear that out. But if there is a problem,

703
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:17,580
there are now forms of progesterone which are not synthetic that are now being advised and used,

704
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:26,060
and thus far have not been associated even with any finding of an increased risk of breast cancer.

705
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:36,860
But in addition, progesterone also has been used to treat breast cancer, and progesterone works

706
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:45,100
as well as tamoxifen does to treat breast cancer. In a randomized trial comparing tamoxifen

707
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:51,740
to progesterone, in the early 70s when tamoxifen was first produced and marketed,

708
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:57,660
progesterone did a little better than tamoxifen, but because in the doses used,

709
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:05,260
it was associated with increased fluid retention and women became nauseated, it lost out to

710
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:13,820
tamoxifen. But it was used to treat breast cancer. There was a study that came out of India by an

711
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:22,780
investigator trained in England who found that if he gave an injection of progesterone around

712
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:31,340
the time of surgery to remove primary breast cancer, he significantly improved the prognosis,

713
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:39,340
decreased the risk of recurrence. So making a lot of noise around progesterone doesn't really fit

714
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:45,420
the available data that we have. So two things. One, I actually had a discussion with Joanne

715
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:52,060
Manson about this a few years ago, which was why did you use that crappy estrogen in progestin?

716
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:59,020
Why didn't you use what we would use today, which is bioidentical estrogen, bioidentical progesterone?

717
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:03,340
And I've always had a lot of respect for Joanne, by the way. I don't know if you guys were able to,

718
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,580
did you interview her for the book? I don't, yeah, I didn't think so. And she gave me an answer that

719
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:11,100
I thought was very logical and you've alluded to it already. She said, you're probably right,

720
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:17,820
Peter. I mean, I think the bioidentical hormones are likely better, but we had to do it with what

721
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:24,220
was available in the, we had to test what was being used by the average physician at the time. And

722
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,940
certainly people at the time were making some noise that shouldn't we at least use bioidentical human

723
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,980
hormones, which intuitively makes more sense. But she said a study testing that wouldn't have made

724
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:40,060
sense in the nineties because that wasn't what the average woman was being tested. So that said,

725
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:45,660
most women today are using bioidentical progesterone, aren't they? When they're receiving

726
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:50,060
hormone replacement therapy, they're still using synthetic progesterone? Well, first,

727
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,980
Primerin. Yes. Let's talk about the estrogen. The word bioidentical is a buzzword. As you know,

728
01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:03,660
bioidentical really refers to estradiol, which is the leading circulating estrogen in a woman's body.

729
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:12,780
And there are pharmaceutically prescribed estrogens that are made by significant manufacturers

730
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:18,620
that we have no problem with. And I want to get back to that in a minute. But bioidentical is also

731
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:26,140
used for what is prepared by pharmacists based on prescriptions written by local practitioners

732
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:35,580
where quality control is lacking. There is no clear dose equivalency. And every responsible

733
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:40,860
investigator I know wants to make the point that buying something because it's got the word

734
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:48,780
bioidentical, which sounds comforting, is a mistake. Second, Primerin, which is pregnant

735
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:55,820
mer urine, and I say that rubbing your face in it because it sounds so terrible, is the longest

736
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:03,980
studied form of estrogen. And we now have 60 years of data with Primerin. And most of the studies that

737
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:10,220
show the benefit for estrogen are studies that were done on Primerin for the same reason that

738
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:17,820
Joanne Manson gave you. It's the one that was used most often. In addition, Primerin contains at least

739
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:25,660
10 different forms of estrogen, including some that are the most beneficial forms of estrogen

740
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:33,260
for brain health, which is not present in estradiol or estriol. So that my preference,

741
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:40,780
based on data only, is Primerin because we have the most data supporting it. Now, as far as

742
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:48,780
progesterone is concerned, yes, micronized bioidentical progesterone appears to be the

743
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:53,820
safest form of progesterone administration. What do you think explains, this is a bit of a pivot,

744
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:59,100
but what do you think explains the mechanism of action? So I'll take a step back and preface this

745
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,380
with the following. You alluded to this earlier. Most people intuitively think testosterone must

746
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:10,540
be driving prostate cancer. But the problem is men tend to get prostate cancer when their

747
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:14,460
testosterone levels are at their lowest, not their highest. And men with high testosterone

748
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,740
when they're young don't seem to get prostate cancer. So it's just a bit confusing. And in fact,

749
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:23,420
there's more recent data to suggest that the lower the testosterone, the more likely the

750
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,180
probability of a high grade prostate cancer. So everything seems to be moving in the wrong

751
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:31,340
direction as testosterone goes down. May I just interrupt that it's the same with estrogen?

752
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:31,660
Yes.

753
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,900
As women get older and have lower estrogen levels, the rates of breast cancer increase.

754
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:42,220
So therein lies my point. What do you think explains the mechanism by which estrogen

755
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:48,300
withdrawal and or removal, and the same for progesterone, is increasing this risk? And why,

756
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:55,420
Avram, can you point out these examples of administration of these things that seem to

757
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:00,220
potentially improve the condition? What do you think is happening at the molecular level,

758
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,980
acknowledging what you said at the outset, which is we don't have a goddamn clue what cancer is?

759
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:09,260
We have clues, but I said I don't understand what cancer is. And the reason I said that right at

760
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:14,460
the beginning is to try to forestall just this kind of question. The best answer I can give

761
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:22,940
is we think we understand the environment that is friendly to a cancer, which is the environment

762
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:30,540
in which the cancer develops. And we try to change that environment to make it less conducive

763
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:36,860
to the continued growth of the cancer. That means in a low estrogen environment, you might use

764
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:42,460
estrogen because that is now unfriendly to the cancer. In a high estrogen environment,

765
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:48,540
you might remove estrogen. Same with testosterone. But exactly how that works,

766
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:53,500
I would use a lot of fancy words and they would try to cover my ignorance.

767
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:59,580
Appreciate the honesty. Most of us tend to use those fancy words and hide our ignorance behind them.

768
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:08,060
So in 2002, the JAMA study comes out and there were a bunch of follow-ups. So there was a 2003,

769
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,140
a 2004 follow-up. What did each of these follow-ups attempt to do?

770
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:19,660
The 2002 follow-up said that the combination of estrogen and progesterone increases the risk

771
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:25,340
of breast cancer. Not true. We've discussed that. Increases the risk of heart attacks,

772
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:33,020
increases the risk of cognitive decline, decreases the risk of colon cancer, and helps protect the

773
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:38,860
bones. That's really what it said. And then there were all these arguments about the statistical

774
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:46,460
significance of the breast cancer finding. And so in 2003, they came out with a second article

775
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:53,820
showing borderline statistical significance for the increased risk of breast cancer.

776
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:59,420
This is the point you alluded to earlier. This is actually the paper that I am looking at more

777
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:08,460
often because this is the one that went from 1.26 as the hazard ratio to 1.24. This is the one where

778
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,900
the p-value actually went to 0.5 from, I believe, 0.05. That's right. And the content in Slevo

779
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:21,980
showed that it was borderline statistically significant. But in 2006, a follow-up article

780
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:28,220
said that that reported increased risk in that population had disappeared with continued

781
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:34,620
follow-up. And that article never made the headlines and most people aren't even aware of it.

782
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:41,180
And in fact, people like Joanne, and I think this is why I respect Joanne a lot. She is one of those

783
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:46,780
investigators from the WHI who I believe is trying to course correct it. I remember driving

784
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:53,020
to work one day and hearing her on NPR, and this was probably like maybe five years ago,

785
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:57,180
and she was being interviewed. And I don't know if I'll be able to find, you know, if we can find

786
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:01,580
the link to this, that would be great. I doubt we will. But she basically made the point. She said,

787
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:07,020
look, I think the recommendations went too far. And, you know, I could at least respect that she

788
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:12,060
was now walking it back. Now, she may come to a different conclusion than the one you've come to,

789
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,980
but she was at least willing to say, look, I think there really are a subset of women,

790
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:20,860
especially those entering menopause who have symptoms who deserve to be treated. And we made

791
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:25,100
a mistake. That was really my interpretation of what she said. They were willing to say that it

792
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:31,500
was okay for women to take hormones. This is the mantra that women hear all the time. The smallest

793
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:37,020
dose for the least amount of time, the smallest dose for the least amount of time. And as Avram

794
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,220
keeps pointing out, there is absolutely no empirical evidence to support that advice. It's

795
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:46,700
a bit like saying smoke the fewest cigarettes for the shortest amount of time and you'll be,

796
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:51,820
you'll get the benefit of smoking, but without the lung cancer. It's not so, but I think it does

797
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:56,620
represent a compromise in terms of the women health, women's health initiatives realization

798
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:01,580
that HRT really was beneficial for quality of life issues for women in menopause.

799
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:08,780
What they were not prepared to do was to consider HRT's benefits over the long haul

800
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:15,420
for women in later years in reducing the risk of osteoporosis, dementia, and heart disease.

801
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:21,500
That they are not willing even yet to suggest that HRT has any prolonged benefits over time.

802
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:28,620
You don't have to go back to NPR. I believe it was 2017 when Joanne Manson published a paper

803
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:35,340
saying just what you said. First, yes, we went too far. Second, we found that women who

804
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:41,340
earn hormones had a lower risk of breast cancer, lower death from breast cancer, and in fact,

805
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:50,060
lower death from all causes compared to women who weren't taking hormones. But she didn't

806
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:57,180
endorse the use of hormones. She fell back on the lowest dose for the shortest period of time,

807
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:05,180
which would be okay if hormones weren't so beneficial. A study that came out by Nenanda

808
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:12,700
Cole from Boston, which we quote in the book, showed that if every woman in the United States

809
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:18,540
took hormone replacement therapy. Now, admittedly, this is before the women's health initiative was

810
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:25,900
published, it would increase the median survival of women by 3.3 years in this country.

811
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:30,780
There's no other intervention I can think of that has such a great consequence for longevity.

812
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:37,660
Phil Sorrell at Yale calculating how many women might have died prematurely from heart disease

813
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:43,100
because they went off HRT was thousands and thousands of women per year. The number he

814
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:51,980
came up with was 50,000 women between 2002 and sometime in the early teens might have died as

815
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:57,180
a result of being taken off hormone therapy. One of the diseases, and I'd like to do this

816
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:01,660
a bit more systematically now because you guys have done in the book such a great job. Your book

817
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:06,540
is organized basically. Once you go through the case you've made, you then basically have a chapter

818
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,620
for each outcome. So let's start with one of them. Let's start with the brain, near and dear to my

819
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:15,180
heart as well. As you think about longevity, you have to think about delaying the onset of

820
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:20,780
dementia. And again, what most people don't realize, in fact, it's one of those things where

821
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:25,260
I remember the first time I learned it, I thought, how did I not know this already? The great divide

822
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:30,940
in chronic disease is Alzheimer's disease. It's the one that disproportionately targets women.

823
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:37,980
So women are two times more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease than men. And let's put that

824
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:45,820
in context for a moment. Can you imagine if, I don't know, women were two times more likely to

825
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:51,740
die of heart disease or of pick a given cancer, pancreatic cancer, something that's not gender

826
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:58,300
specific. You'd be scratching your head thinking, how is this possible? And so what's the explanation

827
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,100
for that? I'm not going to offer one, but I will offer a hypothesis. The most obvious difference

828
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:09,500
between men and women is not the rate of longevity in women, which would be the knee-jerk response to

829
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,380
why that's occurring. Women living a year and a half, two years longer must explain it, but those

830
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:21,580
data don't bear out. So another hypothesis might be women have an abrupt loss of hormones. Men have

831
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:27,660
a gradual loss of hormones. So say a little bit more about what your beliefs are now with respect

832
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:32,540
to the data and what they tell us about the risk of Alzheimer's disease. For every woman diagnosed

833
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:38,780
over 60 with breast cancer, two women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. The cure rate for

834
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:46,940
early diagnosed breast cancer is now approximately 90%. The cure rate for Alzheimer's disease is zero.

835
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:52,700
We have treatments for breast cancer that we haven't gone into, but it's not really the subject

836
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:59,500
of this podcast. And there is no treatment for Alzheimer's. If there is one disease that women

837
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:11,340
fear more than breast cancer, it's Alzheimer's. Exercise and diet and mental gymnastics and even

838
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:19,340
a product of jellyfish has nothing to do with preventing Alzheimer's disease. The one potential

839
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:27,500
preventive medication is estrogen, and that can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease

840
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:33,180
by between 20 and 50%, depending upon the study you look at. In that chapter where we review those

841
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:39,580
studies, animal studies, lab studies, real life field studies, randomized controlled studies,

842
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:45,900
the findings converge from all of those directions of research to show the benefits of estrogen on

843
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:51,020
the brain. Barbara Sherwin at McGill, who has studied this question for many years, she's someone

844
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:58,540
from my side of the professional fence, I'm a psychologist, and she was asked about taking

845
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:04,220
estrogen for many years and so forth. And she said, you know, I get so cross when people say

846
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:11,660
taking HRT is not natural. She said, what's not natural is for a woman to live to be 85 or 90 years

847
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:17,740
old. And if estrogen is something that can help women to live with healthy mental functioning in

848
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:22,460
those later years, then I am all for it. Yeah, that's a great point you raise, which it goes so

849
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:28,460
much beyond all of this, but that really envelopes this discussion. What does natural mean? Exactly.

850
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:34,460
If natural means what evolution intended, we're all irrelevant by the time we're my age, I mean,

851
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:39,260
let alone your age, right? I mean, so if we've decided to live in a society where we value living

852
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:44,860
beyond our reproductive years, then why aren't we entertaining things that are quote unquote

853
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:51,260
unnatural? Exactly. It really is an asinine argument to me, but obviously I'm biased.

854
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,860
So are we in that respect, absolutely. So let's now talk a little bit about heart disease,

855
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:04,060
because if the increase in breast cancer was this screaming headline in 2002,

856
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:10,460
the second headline had to be heart disease and stroke. As Carol pointed out, with a median age

857
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:17,820
of 63, with 70% of the population overweight a significant number of whom were obese, with half-

858
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,940
I believe about 30%, 34% were obese, if you recall.

859
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:26,860
Yes, that's right. With half of them or 40% smokers, and with a significant number having

860
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:33,420
high blood pressure that was treated, this doesn't represent a cardiovascular healthy population.

861
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:41,100
We know that estrogen is capable of causing platelet clumping. Platelets, as you know,

862
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:46,220
are small corks that circulate in the blood that help prevent bleeding by going to a site of

863
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:53,260
bleeding and plugging it up. Estrogen can cause these platelets to clump, and if you already have

864
01:27:53,260 --> 01:28:00,220
blood vessels that are narrowed by pre-existing heart disease, a platelet clump can further

865
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:06,860
narrow the blood vessel and cause a cardiac event. As a result of that, it is recommended

866
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:14,140
that women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease not start on hormone therapy, and the

867
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:22,540
ideal time to start is around menopause, sometime within the first 10 years of cessation of your

868
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:29,180
periods. Now, having said that, that doesn't mean that older women must never take it. In fact,

869
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:36,540
that increased risk of cardiovascular events is seen generally during the first year that a woman

870
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:42,060
starts hormones. Point of clarification, that increased risk, but that's after the window of

871
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:47,260
opportunity, 10 years after menopause begins. That's correct. There is no increased risk if

872
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:52,780
a woman begins HRT at the time of menopause. With no pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

873
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,900
This is actually what I wanted to ask you about, so thank you for clarifying this. Let's make sure

874
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:01,900
that the listeners are crystal clear on this. If you take a woman entering the normal perimenopausal

875
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:07,260
to menopausal state, and she has no pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and I want to come back

876
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,580
to how we'll define that, but let's wait on a moment. The data make it pretty clear there's

877
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:17,340
no increase in her risk of cardiovascular disease ongoing. Correct. Not just for five years.

878
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:23,740
Correct. Okay. Case two, you take a woman who is, let's just make the math easy, she's 60 years

879
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:30,060
old, and she went into menopause at 50. She has a window now that is 10 years. There is zero

880
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:35,260
evidence that she has existing cardiovascular disease. She begins hormone replacement therapy.

881
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:40,620
How clear are the data that she is also not increasing her risk of cardiovascular disease?

882
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:46,220
Well, it depends on the studies you've done to show that she has no narrowed blood vessels.

883
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,900
Let's go gold standard to the best of our ability. Calcium score is zero,

884
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:57,180
CT angiogram shows nothing, lipids are beautiful. She's probably okay, but let us say we are not

885
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:03,340
here trying to increase sales of hormones. No, no, I understand. What we want to do,

886
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:09,340
and just to make it clear, is empower women so they not be given some curt answer when they

887
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:16,620
ask about it. This is a legitimate course of action to follow, but with and after a discussion

888
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:22,060
with your physician. Yeah, what I'm mostly trying to do is identify the women who might be at risk

889
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:30,060
and who need to think twice about it, which sounds like it's women who have been completely deprived

890
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:34,140
of hormones, meaning they went through menopause, they have been off hormones, they are now,

891
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:41,900
call it 10 years out, and they have some pre-existing clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis.

892
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:48,380
Is there risk only one year after starting therapy and then it returns to baseline?

893
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:55,580
Their risk is highest during that first year, and then it diminishes and diminishes and diminishes.

894
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:02,700
There haven't been the kind of studies that I can tell you it returns to baseline, and I can't say

895
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:09,020
that with assurance. But the major risk is during the first year. And if during the first year it

896
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:14,940
doesn't occur, the likelihood is they will be well and won't have one of these events.

897
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:19,580
This is interesting because there was a similar study, I shouldn't say similar, there was a

898
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:24,620
parallel study to this idea published, I want to say it was in JAMA, but it might have been

899
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:28,540
the New England Journal of Medicine a few years ago that looked at men with older men who were

900
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:35,340
not particularly healthy put on testosterone replacement therapy. And one year after the study,

901
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:40,300
the men on the testosterone group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.

902
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:46,220
Three years after the study initiated, the risk was equal. And at five years, the men receiving

903
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:51,660
testosterone had a lower risk of heart disease than the men on the placebo. It's actually quite

904
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,420
interesting that it mirrors what you've just described. And I'd never made that connection

905
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:00,620
until now. It is quite interesting. And it's the question we get most often from women who entered

906
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:07,020
menopause and were scared off hormones because of their doctors. And now 10 years later, or even

907
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:13,020
more than that, this is one of the most common questions that Avram gets. Can I go back on it

908
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:18,860
now? I've been off this for 10 years. Is it safe to go back on? Because I'm suffering, because I'm

909
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:23,420
having so many symptoms, because I'm really in discomfort and the quality of my life is terrible,

910
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:28,460
I would like to go back on hormones. Is it safe? So we understand the importance of this question

911
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:32,780
and how an individual woman really needs to assess what her particular risks are.

912
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:39,340
And Carol, that case study that you hypothetically put forth, that kind of flies in the face of what

913
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:46,220
most people think. Most people think a 60-year-old woman who took hormones eight years ago and has

914
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:50,140
not been on them anymore can't possibly have symptoms, right? It must be something else?

915
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,940
No, they do indeed have symptoms. Avram said earlier, the average length of time a woman has

916
01:32:54,940 --> 01:33:00,540
symptoms during menopause is seven years. That's the average. For some women, it's 10, or 12,

917
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:06,460
or 15. Avram gets letters from former patients saying, you know, I'm in my 70s here, in my 80s,

918
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:10,860
and I'm having this terrible trouble sleeping, and my doctor won't renew my prescription,

919
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:17,020
won't renew my prescription, I'm 78 years old. You know, I'm doing fine on hormones, please.

920
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,700
And the minute they go off, their symptoms often return.

921
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,700
So let's talk about an area that doesn't seem to have that much controversy, but just for the

922
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:29,180
sake of completeness, let's talk about bone mineral density and osteoporosis for a second.

923
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:36,460
First, let's talk about bone mineral density. Bone mineral density is used as a substitute

924
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:43,580
marker for osteoporosis. It is a bad substitute marker. It's the best one we have,

925
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:55,500
but it's not a good test. And one of the ways to explain that is bone elasticity is what allows

926
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:02,620
bones to bend without breaking and allows us to be active without suffering acute fractures.

927
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:11,820
Bone elasticity is due to the girders within the bone that are made of collagen and that are broad

928
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:24,140
and healthy and bend. The bone mineral density measures the envelope in which those girders are

929
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:31,980
contained. The envelope is the cortex of the bone, and the cortex of the bone is made largely of

930
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:39,180
calcium to show you what a bad measure bone mineral density is. And I'm sure you know this, Peter, if

931
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:46,300
you give patients fluoride, you will dramatically increase bone mineral density and the bone will

932
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:54,620
become thick and break easily and have no elasticity. And that's not a good treatment for osteoporosis.

933
01:34:55,180 --> 01:35:02,940
The best way to check for osteoporosis is to take a bone in the body and put it in a vise and see

934
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:10,860
how much pressure you can exert before the bone snaps. The problem is that's funny. I do that test

935
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:16,300
on most of my patients, but you would be amazed then there are a subset of patients that refuse

936
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:22,700
that. Yeah, they refuse that test. Exactly. And we don't have that test yet, although somehow we're

937
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:30,860
able to do it on bridges to predict when bridges will fail. And I'm not sure why we can't do it

938
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:39,900
on bone yet, but bone mineral density is used as a substitute. And we now know that as many women

939
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:46,940
in the United States will die each year of a hip fracture as the number who will die of breast

940
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:54,140
cancer. Wait a minute. That sounds almost impossible to believe. I'm very sensitive to how often people

941
01:35:54,140 --> 01:36:02,220
die of hip fractures. So did you say that in a given year, there are as many women who will die

942
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:06,620
from a hip fracture who are obviously going to be much older, that's a concentrated older subset,

943
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:11,340
as all women who will die of breast cancer? In the United States who will die of breast cancer.

944
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:17,420
I don't know that the hip fracture is directly responsible for their death,

945
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:26,860
but approximately 21% of women who fracture their hip will die within a year of the hip fracture.

946
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:34,700
And that number is approximately 40,000, which is the number of women who die in this country

947
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:40,460
of breast cancer every year. Do you know how many men die of hip fractures or sustain hip fractures

948
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:46,060
that within a year, proceed their death? I haven't looked at that number. I think it's close,

949
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:55,260
but I don't know. It is. Okay. And estrogen will decrease the risk of osteoporotic hip fracture by

950
01:36:55,260 --> 01:37:04,860
up to 50% better than any treatment available over the long term. And you can well say, well, now

951
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:10,620
we have calcium and vitamin D, for example, and that is- And bisphosphonates.

952
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:15,900
Well, calcium and vitamin D first. Then you can turn on television and see women talking about

953
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:23,660
that. And since we just mentioned that the problem is not the shell of the bone, which is fed by

954
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:30,140
calcium and vitamin D, which aids calcium absorption, it is the internal girder network

955
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:36,860
of the bone. In a postmenopausal woman who is not on estrogen, calcium and vitamin D have no

956
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:44,860
protective effect against hip fracture. So let's talk about bisphosphonates, which do help prevent

957
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:51,820
hip fracture almost as well as estrogen does. The problem is if you take them for longer than

958
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:59,900
five years, you have an increased risk of fractures within the femoral shaft. They're called

959
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:07,020
atypical femoral fractures. And that increased risk has been used to say that bisphosphonates

960
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:14,780
should not be used for longer than five years. Whereas you can take estrogen as long as you

961
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:21,580
take it, your bone elasticity and your bone health is preserved and there's nothing as good as

962
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:25,980
estrogen. Anything you want to add to that, Carol? I think he said it just perfectly.

963
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:33,900
All right, Carol, tell me about colon cancer. What does HRT do to increase or decrease a woman's

964
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:38,540
risk of colon cancer, which is a cancer that a lot of people don't realize how high that is on

965
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:45,580
the mortality table because its lethality is of course nowhere near as bad as pancreatic and lung.

966
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:49,820
But it's more lethal than, again, it depends on how you define it, but it's going to be more lethal

967
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:55,980
than breast cancer. So this is a big problem. This was almost an unintended or unexpected

968
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:03,420
discovery about the benefits of estrogen in reducing the rates of death from colon cancer.

969
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:09,980
I think it was kind of off the mental chart of is this something we want to even think about as

970
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:14,220
being a benefit of estrogen. But a number of significant studies have shown that it does

971
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:18,620
indeed reduce the risk of colon cancer. This was one of the few things that didn't,

972
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:22,860
if my recollection is this was one of two or three findings in the women's health initiative that was

973
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:27,100
not really changed over time and not particularly controversial. Is that correct?

974
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:31,180
Yes, there were other studies, including the nurses health study that showed that

975
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:38,620
there are many studies that showed 20-25% decreased risk of colon cancer among women

976
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:44,540
taking estrogen, but we don't know why. I will say here at the beginning with the women's health

977
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,740
initiative, the first thing they wanted to say in those first years was something they called their

978
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:54,380
global health index. Is that what they call it, Avram? This was supposed to be a sort of an overall

979
01:39:54,380 --> 01:40:02,220
measure of health and longevity, claiming that estrogen reduced longevity and increased women's

980
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:10,220
mortality from all causes over the years. It was quite an exaggerated claim. And over the years,

981
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:15,820
they have been walking back from that one. Well, okay, it doesn't really increase the risk of dying

982
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:21,980
from all other diseases that there might ever be. They were really looking to scare people

983
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:28,380
for some reason at that point. Then they stopped talking about this global mortality rate statistics,

984
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:34,380
especially because they began looking at individual risks of death from various diseases and finding

985
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:39,900
that there was no increased risk. Diabetes is another one that estrogen seems to decrease.

986
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:44,780
In the women's health initiative, diabetes was self-reported. Can you explain why the hell that

987
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:51,660
was the case? No. There are so many gaping holes in my understanding of how the women's health

988
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:58,380
initiative came to be. RST. And that's yet another example of rather than actually make diabetes a

989
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:04,620
secondary or tertiary outcome, we'll make it a self-reported outcome. I've never seen a study

990
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:09,980
where that's been the case. Have you? Single most expensive study ever done in this country,

991
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:15,340
and that's the third time one of the people around this table has said, I've never seen that

992
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,020
in a medical institution before. So tell me why you believe that

993
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:26,060
HRT might actually reduce the probability of diabetes rather than increase it.

994
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:31,580
Because the numbers suggested it. That's all. I would like to see many more studies

995
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:37,180
before we reach that conclusion. And you'll note we didn't mention diabetes in the book.

996
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:41,180
No. Yeah. This is something I just brought up from actually mining, looking through the data

997
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:47,260
myself because it was so counterintuitive. Let's talk about the real downsides. It's hard to dispute

998
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:53,580
that there was a real increase in pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism. You alluded

999
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:58,540
to it already because you talked about platelet activation. Let's put it in context. Can we talk

1000
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:03,100
about the magnitude? So we saw the increase was clear in relative. How big was the absolute

1001
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:12,060
increase? It's very small and a clot, a thrombophlebitis, a swollen leg because of a clotted vein,

1002
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:17,740
is usually not very serious unless, as you mentioned, a piece of the clot breaks off,

1003
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:25,980
goes to the lung. That's a pulmonary embolism and that can be fatal. The incidence is small. I don't

1004
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:33,500
have the number in my hand. It's significant enough that if the patient has a condition or

1005
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:39,900
is taking something that can predispose to that kind of clot, it must be a consideration before

1006
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:45,260
somebody starts on hormones. The other thing that stood out to me was the increase in the incidence

1007
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:51,260
of gallbladder disease, though it was never really clear to me what the hell they were talking about.

1008
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:55,020
Did they mean stones in the gallbladder?

1009
01:42:55,020 --> 01:43:00,140
They meant stones. That seems to be a statistically valid finding.

1010
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:06,140
Colocystectomy, removing a gallbladder among women who are on hormones,

1011
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:11,900
is a not infrequently reported finding and has to be thought of.

1012
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:16,780
So when you take a step back and think about all of this, I think we're just as a society

1013
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:24,140
very conditioned to want binary answers. Something is good. Something is bad. Something is all good.

1014
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:30,700
Something is all bad. For the unfortunate reasons you've described, HRT, following the Women's

1015
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:37,980
Health Initiative, fit into the all bad category. I don't think you're here saying it's all good,

1016
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:42,220
but it sounds like it's more good than bad and obviously that's my belief as well.

1017
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:50,380
How should a woman who's listening to this, who is either not in menopause yet, in menopause,

1018
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:59,100
past menopause, how would you counsel her to think about this as she approaches her physician

1019
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:02,460
who may already have a very strong point of view about this?

1020
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:08,060
I recently got back from London where I gave a talk at the Royal Society on the book in a

1021
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:14,140
discussion on the pros and cons of hormones. When you walk into the Royal Society in London,

1022
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:20,140
emblazoned across the front in Latin, it says, take no one's word for it.

1023
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:24,300
There was an interesting guy who was the first president of that. I'm blanking on his name,

1024
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,900
Isaac, what was it?

1025
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,020
Newton.

1026
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:30,540
Newton. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're in heady company there.

1027
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:37,020
Exactly right. The reason we wrote the book with references on every chapter,

1028
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:45,260
trying to give people the data on which our conclusions are based, was, as I mentioned,

1029
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:53,820
to empower women so that the book is meant to make you a better consumer of healthcare,

1030
01:44:54,380 --> 01:45:00,860
so that when you go to your physician, you and your physician together can work out the best

1031
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:10,300
program for you to follow. And our conclusion from the book is that the benefits of hormones

1032
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:21,100
far outweigh the downsides, and hormones have been unfairly excluded from medical regimens

1033
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:25,020
that women should at least be offered for consideration.

1034
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:29,740
I would add to this because I come from a history, of course, of feminist criticism,

1035
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:35,660
of medicine and psychology and the bias in the nature of research and so forth and gender

1036
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:41,900
research. And so I am well aware of and for a long time supported many of the feminist criticisms of

1037
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:51,100
HRT and of, in general, the medicalizing of normal problems of life. The less is more movement in

1038
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:57,660
medicine is designed to educate the public that sometimes you don't need to medicate every

1039
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:01,660
possible problem you could ever have in your life and that we're taking too many medications

1040
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:05,900
and too many drugs and so forth and so forth. And with much of this, I completely agree,

1041
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:13,500
but the alternative to over-medicalizing our problems is not to under-medicalize them either.

1042
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:22,140
And I think that many women influenced properly by feminist critiques of medicine have become,

1043
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:26,060
you know, think that there's something unfeminist about taking HRT, you know,

1044
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:31,340
something anti-woman about taking HRT. I'm not enough of a woman if I need to take hormones or

1045
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:39,820
that kind of argument. And I think it's as much a feminist argument to say what is best for women

1046
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:47,020
overall, what is best for a particular woman who is dealing with symptoms that are painful and

1047
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:54,780
difficult and complex. You know, I'm going to be speaking at a meeting of where it was interesting,

1048
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:59,020
the board told me, well, we can't possibly invite you to come and talk about your book

1049
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:03,980
because everybody on this board is anti-HRT and they're feminists and they've been anti-HRT all of

1050
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:07,980
their lives and so forth. And then she called me the next day and said, well, the board has decided

1051
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:13,820
unanimously to ask you to come talk about this book on account of they're now all in menopause

1052
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:20,700
and suddenly saying, you know what, my body is talking to me and I need to listen. So I think

1053
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:29,180
that the issue of HRT for women is not there's a correct ideological stance to be taken,

1054
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:36,300
but rather one that needs to look at what is best for most women and for any given woman making

1055
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:42,220
this decision. And let me just add at the beginning of our discussion, you spoke about a patient of

1056
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:48,860
yours who was suffering through menopause who went on estriol and progesterone and a little

1057
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:56,060
bit of testosterone. No progesterone, she had had a hysterectomy. The estriol was the safest way

1058
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:02,860
perceived to give her estrogen. I just have to say that we don't have large scale studies on

1059
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:10,380
estriol so that one has to take every step very carefully. And the simplistic answer

1060
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:16,460
that testosterone has to be good because it can stimulate libido and since it's a male hormone,

1061
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:21,660
it must be anti breast cancer. Testosterone has also been associated with the development

1062
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:28,620
of breast cancer. It can show some stimulation of growth of breast cancer in culture and that too

1063
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:33,820
has to be looked at very carefully. These are all such important questions. In fact,

1064
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:40,300
when you think about what we've just talked about, we have talked about cancer. We have talked about

1065
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:46,140
atherosclerosis or all of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's

1066
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:53,340
disease. And then when you add fractures to that, you have basically, if I'm doing the math right,

1067
01:48:53,340 --> 01:49:01,820
accounted for about 80 to 85% of deaths that women will experience. And you're talking about

1068
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:07,740
something that could move the needle by, let's be conservative and call it 10 to 20%,

1069
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:15,260
potentially more, but let's say conservatively 10%. Will there ever be a correctly done women's

1070
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:21,260
health initiative that will include these other questions? We've never asked the question about

1071
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:26,140
other forms of estrogen. We've never asked the question about testosterone, which most women

1072
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:33,500
don't realize this, but even during her reproductive years, she has 20 to a hundred times more

1073
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:39,660
testosterone in her body than estrogen, even at ovulation. And she's losing that as well as losing

1074
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:46,220
her estrogen. But to your point, we don't have a clinical trial that asks that question. Will we?

1075
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:55,180
No. And the reason we won't is the idea that every truth can only be determined by a prospective

1076
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:01,580
double-blind randomized study is simply not holding up. In fact, there are now

1077
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:10,140
many articles appearing in the general medical literature talking about well-followed, carefully

1078
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:17,020
put together observational studies that can give us information that we simply can't get from

1079
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:26,540
double-blind randomized trials. I think when we begin to understand better what cancer is,

1080
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:35,180
we will have better answers. The data that we try to string together are data based on studies

1081
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:43,260
which follow our ignorance and our attempt to see through this darkness to work out the best

1082
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:47,980
treatment for any individual patient. Do you think there's something else at play, which is

1083
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:54,620
notwithstanding the complexity and the cost of repeating a study of that magnitude?

1084
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:00,700
Not withstanding? Not withstanding the complexity and cost? No, that's what's standing. That's

1085
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:06,940
what's standing in the way, of course. Well, I guess that's my point. Is the issue that the NIH,

1086
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:11,660
which is really the only entity that could ever fund a study of this magnitude, there is no

1087
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:18,860
industry version of this study. Did you interview folks? I'm trying to remember who you interviewed

1088
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:24,300
from NIH. Do you get the sense that this is case closed in the same way that unfortunately,

1089
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,660
many still view the dietary studies of the 70s and 80s as a bit of a case closed?

1090
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:38,620
Let me just add that people ask us why we are a voice in the wilderness, voices in the wilderness.

1091
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:45,900
Well, we're not. If you look at the people who have endorsed our book, they include Vince DeVita,

1092
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:49,660
who is the director of the National Cancer Institute, part of the NIH.

1093
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:55,020
Yeah, Vince actually, along with Steve Rosenberg, my mentor, and I forget the name of the, there was

1094
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:59,820
a radio, an oncologist. Sam Hellman. Sam Hellman. They write the Bible on oncology.

1095
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:05,100
They write a very important book called Cancer. That's correct. Jerry Casira, who is the editor

1096
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:10,460
in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, endorsed our book. Leslie Turnburg, who is the

1097
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:17,740
president of the Royal Society of Medicine in England, endorsed the book. These are very well

1098
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:25,820
informed people, as many female groups endorse the book as well. Phyllis Greenberger, who's the CEO

1099
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:33,740
of the Women's Science Cooperative, endorsed the book. These are people who are aware of the data,

1100
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:40,380
are aware of the limitations of the data available to us, and they strongly recommend that this

1101
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:47,660
book be read, not just by women, but I have men who come up to me who thank me for saving their

1102
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:53,740
lives because of their wives getting better, and that was killing them.

1103
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:54,460
Yeah.

1104
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:59,740
But you see your question, I think Peter, too, is what kind of research needs to be done to help us

1105
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:03,980
answer the questions that we have remaining? What kind of research? So there won't be anything as

1106
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:09,340
big as the Women's Health Initiative, as costly as that, as the statistical police have to leave the

1107
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:13,100
room because we're never going to be able to do anything this big in this elaborate again.

1108
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:19,100
I think that's true, but what I think what I'm seeing that I find really interesting, and Avram

1109
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:24,460
alluded to this already, is that we now can do studies comparing the outcome of randomized

1110
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:30,700
controlled trials with observational studies, and it turns out we've all thought, oh, the RCT is the

1111
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:34,940
gold standard, and if it isn't the RCT, then forget it. I don't want to even look at any

1112
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:38,540
observational study. I don't care what other field studies you've done. I don't want to see any other

1113
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:44,620
kind of data. If it's not an RCT, I'm done. And I know some scientists have that view. What really

1114
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:51,020
impressed us in gathering the research we did was that when you look at different methods of

1115
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:56,860
investigation across many different samples, many different countries, many different times,

1116
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:02,460
when you start to get a convergence of evidence where you don't just have one outlier here saying,

1117
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:06,940
oh, look, HRT is beneficial, but no, there's a convergence from so many different directions,

1118
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:10,220
then you can feel a little more secure that you're really on solid ground.

1119
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:19,180
And I'm finding, too, as Avram just said, I want to underscore this, not every RCT is bias-free

1120
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:26,220
and reliable, as we've just been seeing, and not every observational study is to be thrown out

1121
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:31,100
because it's only an observational study. Yeah, and there's another point here that so much of

1122
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:37,260
our thinking about epidemiology is based on nutritional epidemiology, which John Ayanidis has

1123
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:44,540
recently described as, I mean, effectively garbage. I mean, I think he even went so far as to say that,

1124
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:49,580
and if you know John, he's quite measured in his words, but I mean, he's basically said there's

1125
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:53,900
no role for nutritional epidemiology. And so you might say, well, then there's no room for all

1126
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:58,700
epidemiology, but there is a difference, I think, and it's subtle, but it's important. Part of the

1127
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:04,140
trouble with nutritional epidemiology is it relies on things like food frequency questionnaires,

1128
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:08,860
which anybody who's ever actually tried to fill one of these things out realizes they're almost

1129
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:17,180
impossible to gather data. Whereas epidemiology may, in fact, have less of the data crisis

1130
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:23,260
when the intervention is simpler, and certainly taking HRT is simpler than remembering what you

1131
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:29,100
ate over the past seven days. Point two is, so this is, by the way, I have no overarching point.

1132
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,620
I'm just stating a bunch of thoughts as I try to wrestle with what you're saying.

1133
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:39,020
Point two is, I think we have seen that it is impossible to eliminate healthy user bias from

1134
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:45,660
epidemiology. There are no branches of statistics that can eliminate this, and we must always

1135
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:51,500
acknowledge that, and that is why we have to be careful when we look at epidemiologic studies of

1136
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:56,460
things where the intervention is more likely to appear in a healthier group or a more health

1137
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:01,180
conscious group or more affluent group. The third point, which I want to highlight what you've said,

1138
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:06,780
is we are lulled into a false sense of confidence with randomized controlled trials, and yet

1139
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:12,860
virtually all of them have some measure of what's called performance bias, which, you know,

1140
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:19,900
predimid, which is generally regarded as the best nutritional study, despite the, you know, change in

1141
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,860
the statistics around the randomization, suffered a very large performance bias,

1142
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:30,460
meaning the group that was treated was given much more attention than the group that was the

1143
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:36,620
placebo, and therefore they were probably, or at least possibly more likely to change behaviors in

1144
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:41,740
other ways that could have impacted the outcome. So your point is correct, which is just because

1145
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:46,940
something is a randomized controlled trial doesn't mean it is free of bias. I want to add something

1146
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:52,300
I think really crucial here that's in a way a theme throughout our book, which is that the

1147
01:56:52,300 --> 01:57:01,900
demands on researchers to publish or perish has meant a proliferation of badly analyzed studies.

1148
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:05,980
So this is where you're an epidemiologist, you've got a thousand, you've got thousands and thousands

1149
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:11,180
of people in your sample, and you don't find what you thought you would find, you find no connection

1150
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:16,380
between cucumbers and bunions, right? And so instead of saying, gee, we find no connection

1151
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:24,460
between these two things, they then engage in these statistical practices that are no-nos for

1152
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:32,220
any statistician or scientist to do, and yet the results find homes in medical journals. I go back

1153
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:39,100
into my data, I rummage around until I find some tiny subset of the sample that seems to support

1154
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:45,100
my hypothesis. You don't get to do that, and yet in these studies over and over as we show in our

1155
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,820
book, not only do they get to do that, but they get published. That's the reason for that, the

1156
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:55,820
wonderful table with a list of risks, of increased risks of breast cancer that include using an

1157
01:57:55,820 --> 01:58:03,180
electric blanket for more than six months, but less than two years, and eating grapefruit and so forth.

1158
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:08,060
Those were preposterous findings that weren't replicated, and yet all of them found homes in

1159
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:12,860
medical journals, and that's the concern. Yeah, I have the table here. I was actually reading it,

1160
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:19,740
well, actually, I was reading this in your 2009 paper, and it's great, fish intake, 14% increase

1161
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:25,980
in the risk of breast cancer, French fries, 27%. French fries, one extra helping of French fries.

1162
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:31,660
It was just one additional serving of French fries. Per week. Per week. In the pre-school population.

1163
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:38,220
Yeah, no, no, look, if you're eating fries at the age of four, I promise you that. Grapefruit, 30%

1164
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:43,420
increase. But only if you eat half a grapefruit. That's right. Three quarters of a grapefruit

1165
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:46,860
ameliorated the risk entirely. Exactly. Being a Scandinavian flight attendant.

1166
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:53,260
Finish to be particular. Yes, yes, yes. We had to be very specific, but if you were Icelandic,

1167
01:58:53,980 --> 01:59:00,060
instead of Finnish, the risk went from 1.87 to 4.1, and if you use an electric blanket,

1168
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:05,100
it's interesting, the risk goes up to almost 5x. But that's only if you are African American,

1169
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:09,100
and only if you use it for a certain number of months per year, and only under a certain number

1170
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:14,860
of years. You have to use it for fewer than six months a year, but for more than 10 years.

1171
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:20,460
There you go. You can't make this up. That's somebody really looking to eke out something

1172
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:25,260
statistically significant to publish. One other point to put in, when we started by saying,

1173
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:30,540
we don't know what cancer is, let me tell you one of the things we do know. One of the hardest

1174
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:37,420
malignancies to treat when I started was called acute pro myeloplastic leukemia. This is a

1175
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:45,260
condition where the bone marrow is full of very immature, angry cells called pro myelocytes or

1176
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:51,980
pro myeloblasts. Chemotherapy, even intensive chemotherapy, was associated with a 2% to 5%

1177
01:59:53,020 --> 02:00:00,380
possible response rate with no complete remission, and everybody died. About 15 years ago,

1178
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:06,540
several investigators found that the problem with pro myeloblastic leukemia is not that these

1179
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:13,420
terrible looking cells are multiplying too quickly. It's that the cells are facing a maturation

1180
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:20,940
arrest that immature cells multiply very quickly. That's how we go from being two cells to being an

1181
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:28,540
organism in nine months, and then they start multiplying slowly. As cells mature, they multiply

1182
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:37,820
less actively. If there's a maturation arrest, so the cell cannot mature beyond a particular point,

1183
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:44,780
the cells grow very quickly, and they kill the patient. If you give something, and in the case

1184
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:51,660
of acute pro myeloblastic leukemia, it's a form of vitamin A called trans retinoic acid. If you

1185
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:57,980
give that to the patient, you remove the maturation arrest, the abnormal leukemic cells

1186
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:05,340
proceed through normal maturation, the disease disappears, and the patient is better.

1187
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:14,060
Looking at the tumor cell as the enemy, instead of as the smoke behind the fire of the maturation

1188
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:21,740
arrest was misguided. I think we're going to find in many malignancies that our understanding

1189
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:29,500
of what cancer is is going to change, and we're going to stop trying to identify the tumor cell

1190
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:35,420
as the enemy, but we're not there yet. There are people that are really talking,

1191
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:41,820
and this has been a voice that people have been starting to gain some volume, is

1192
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:47,420
look at the role of stromal cells, for example. We have focused, as you're pointing out, almost

1193
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:53,820
exclusively on the actual cell that has undergone the genetic alteration to render it cancerous,

1194
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:58,460
but the stromal cell that surrounds it, the environment in which it lives in cellularly,

1195
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:03,260
is now, I think people are starting to realize there's something there.

1196
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:03,820
Absolutely.

1197
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:06,940
And now how we target that for treatment becomes a second question, but

1198
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:11,180
this is a great point. I want to thank you for writing this book, because

1199
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:15,580
I don't know how much you guys thought about it before you did it, but you're going to make some

1200
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:21,820
enemies writing a book like this, because you're going up against effectively established medical

1201
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:29,100
entities that have a position, and it becomes easy to discredit people who come across as zealots.

1202
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:33,980
And I'm not saying you're coming across as zealots, but anybody who writes a book that basically says

1203
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:42,460
some very obvious well laid out conclusion is incorrect. You don't get to say that meekly.

1204
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:47,660
You have to say that with a megaphone to overcome the noise, and when you do that, it looks like,

1205
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,020
well, you're a zealot.

1206
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:55,020
And we welcome the criticism and the discussion, and rather than make enemies,

1207
02:02:55,020 --> 02:03:01,500
we welcome critics, and that way we will all learn. We don't claim to have the final answer,

1208
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:08,460
but we think that this book represents an important step forward in empowering women

1209
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:11,340
and helping them live longer and live better.

1210
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:19,340
And Avram, when Avram has debated those who have a publicly different point of view and has said,

1211
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:24,620
okay, here's my point of view, here's the data, here's what I find, please tell me why you

1212
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:28,460
disagree, and they don't. They can't. They haven't.

1213
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:34,780
Well, what is the best counter argument you have heard to your point of view?

1214
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:38,940
And even if it's not at a macro level, but two specific issues.

1215
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:49,260
It is incredible how silent the other side is. Incredible. I've debated people in public.

1216
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:54,780
I debated a leading advocate of hormone replacement therapy who earned the cost of a debate.

1217
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:56,060
A leading opponent.

1218
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:01,180
A leading opponent. In the course of the debate said, look, if all you care about

1219
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:07,580
is looking good, feeling good, and living a long time, then take estrogen. And I sat down.

1220
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:13,740
It's very rare in life that your opponent actually does the mic drop for you.

1221
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:17,820
I put that on a slide and used it in future talks.

1222
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:25,500
It's almost hard to believe. One thing we didn't touch on is race. So we've talked about

1223
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:30,860
pre-existing heart disease, and that may be a fork in the road. That may be a place where we

1224
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:36,620
need to reconsider or restratify. When we talk about race, we know that there are different racial

1225
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:42,780
predispositions to breast cancer. Has anything come out of all of the reevaluations of the data

1226
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:48,300
that would suggest one way or another that Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Asian

1227
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:53,580
women might actually benefit or be harmed differentially from hormones?

1228
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:58,300
The first answer to the best of my knowledge is no, but the reason for that is the overwhelming

1229
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:09,260
majority of the studied patients are Caucasian. There was a report in 2003 that said that the

1230
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:16,140
incidence of breast cancer has dropped precipitously. And people in the Women's Health

1231
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:24,140
Initiative said, well, we published this study in 2002, and the incidence of hormone replacement

1232
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:31,260
therapy went down significantly. And while we can't claim credit, we can't think of a better

1233
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:38,140
explanation than that. Well, that's preposterous. It's preposterous first because cancer doesn't

1234
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:44,140
start and develop within six months. Some people think it takes as long as 20 years. And when they

1235
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:51,820
were greeted with that, the answer was, well, we agree. We didn't decrease the risk of cancer

1236
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:59,900
starting, but what we did is cancers that were subclinical, therefore not diagnosable,

1237
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:05,900
that would have been stimulated to grow by the hormones, never mind that the hormones don't

1238
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:13,180
stimulate the cancers to grow. They diminished, and that's the reason for the decline. Well, first,

1239
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:19,020
you don't know how many of the women who didn't get breast cancer were or were not taking hormones.

1240
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:25,420
But even if your point is right, then the decline should have been among the very early small

1241
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:32,060
cancers that just peeked through as a result of the stimulation that you are postulating.

1242
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:38,460
And the incidence of cancer diminished, not among that population, but among the more advanced,

1243
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:47,020
larger cancers. And by the way, the decline started in 1999, not in 2002. And yet in the

1244
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:52,860
literature, they take credit for that decline. But has the decline occurred among all groups?

1245
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:58,140
Oh, and the point I was making is the decline did not occur among black women,

1246
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:06,620
that it was only seen among Caucasian women. Do we have data on the different uses of HRT

1247
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:12,700
among women at that time? Not that I know of, it also didn't occur that the decline wasn't seen in

1248
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:20,300
Norway, which is largely Caucasian. Of course, most research has been conducted on white women

1249
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:25,100
and not on African-American women. Although, I mean, the ethnic question and the regional

1250
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:30,060
question is a very important one. And I think for that reason, the fact that national menopause

1251
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:38,700
societies in every country from India and African nations and South America and Canada and that long

1252
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:47,420
list of menopause societies all have endorsed the use, the beneficial use of HRT for women.

1253
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:52,140
And have argued against take the smallest dose for the shortest period of time.

1254
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:57,020
Does that make the United States one of the more anti-HRT countries?

1255
02:07:57,020 --> 02:08:05,100
It does. Well, I would say so. See, it's interesting in England where Primerin is on

1256
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:11,820
the national health and his routine is kind of considered the old fashioned HRT and bioidenticals

1257
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:17,980
are somehow trendier and better, but there isn't quite the antipathy toward HRT that we see here.

1258
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:21,980
Nonetheless, the Women's Health Initiative had international repercussions.

1259
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:28,460
I mean, it certainly has in Canada where I naively, stupidly tried to have this discussion

1260
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:36,300
with my mom's doctor. And I mean, she looked at me like I had 12 heads before basically saying,

1261
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:41,820
son, we're in Canada here. We don't do that. There you are.

1262
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:48,300
I mean, there was no discussion. This was not, let me hear why you think your mom would benefit from

1263
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:56,780
being on hormones. It was full stop. We'd have an easier time if you were asking me to attach a

1264
02:08:56,780 --> 02:09:03,340
third arm to your mom. Oh, well, you know, we include the book with a letter from a Portuguese

1265
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:09,820
gynecologist called My Dream. And this is the guy in Portugal saying a critique of the Women's Health

1266
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:14,380
Initiative. I had a dream that the Women's Health Initiative apologized for the harms that it had

1267
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:19,660
caused in leading so many women to go off hormones. So this would suggest that there's been European

1268
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:25,660
consequences. Our book was very favorably reviewed by the London Times in a two page spread. And

1269
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:33,340
interestingly, the author of that article was Anna Maxted, whose name is on a book I see in your bookcase.

1270
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:40,380
And how has been the receipt here? I mean, you have pointed out some very notable folks, but

1271
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:46,140
by and large, it seems like the investigators, the PIs from the WHI have been quite silent.

1272
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:51,500
Has there been any reception to what you've basically said, which is let's debate this

1273
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:55,500
openly, let's lay the data out, find the criticisms and let's get better?

1274
02:09:55,500 --> 02:10:03,100
They have no incentive to. They are the Goliath. Why does Goliath want to argue with David and Jane?

1275
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:09,900
In the book, we write that if somebody came to you and tried to convince you that the earth

1276
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:17,020
was flat, you wouldn't respond to them. You would just ignore them. And we're not arguing

1277
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:21,340
that the earth is flat, but that's the way this is often being treated.

1278
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:25,180
Well, I mean, the analogy is not quite right. It's like if someone came to me and said the

1279
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:29,420
earth is flat and just asserted it, I would absolutely ignore them. But if it came to me

1280
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:36,620
and had evidence, including photographs of a flat earth from the moon and photographs of what was

1281
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:42,220
once around earth and said, here's the optical illusion. In other words, you're not just showing

1282
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:45,980
up saying the earth is flat. That's why it's so heavily referenced. Yes.

1283
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:49,020
Anything else you guys want to talk about on this topic? I mean, I could keep talking about this,

1284
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:54,460
but I think in less time than I expected, I thought we were going to need to talk for a long time.

1285
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:59,660
But you guys, I guess it's a testament to how well thought out your arguments are. And I don't

1286
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:03,980
think that this podcast is a substitute for people reading the book. In fact, I want to make that

1287
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:09,260
point clearly that you should not take our word for it on this discussion. I think this is an

1288
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:13,340
important enough question. I also think the book is accessible enough, meaning it's an easy enough

1289
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:18,780
book to read. You don't have to have a medical degree to read the book. And I think everybody

1290
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:24,300
should make the effort to read this book and should actually follow up in the references and

1291
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:29,340
should say, well, wait a minute, is that really true? Because I had that response and I'm very

1292
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:33,900
familiar with this literature and I still found myself at times going to the references and saying,

1293
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:40,940
wait, that is how did that wait? Oh, wow. I, you know, because what you did nicely is you laid out

1294
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:45,180
the time course of the literature of the studies. And I think that's an important exercise.

1295
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:51,340
Thank you, Peter. Our goal was to make the book readable enough for lay readers, certainly,

1296
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:56,060
of course, for women personally concerned about this issue so that they will understand

1297
02:11:56,620 --> 02:12:01,180
what the evidence shows without having to read every study at hand if they want to. I mean,

1298
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:06,620
so in some sections, we'll have a drumbeat of findings showing look its benefit, look its

1299
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:11,260
benefit, look its benefit, look its benefit. You could read those studies or not if you wanted

1300
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:21,020
with a discussion of what the alternatives to HRT might be for heart or brain or bones

1301
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:27,180
or feeling good in your middle years. We consider all of those alternatives, what

1302
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:34,060
their limitations are, why we think estrogen is better. So, our goal was to make it readable for

1303
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:40,620
general readers but also to provide the sources and information for those who want to know in more

1304
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:46,780
detail what the science shows. It's worth mentioning that when I write a paper, I write it for a

1305
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:53,740
medical audience, physicians, and it's a pretty dry data-filled paper. And the first paper I wrote

1306
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:58,860
with Carol, which you have in your possession, hormone replacement therapy, real concerns,

1307
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:06,300
and false alarms, we wrote it together. Carol took the data that I put and she included her

1308
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:11,180
Carol Touch, which includes things like a criticism of the Women's Health Initiative

1309
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:17,420
saying in the paper, what were they thinking? Well, I couldn't put that in a paper, but it read

1310
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:24,700
so well and so easily that I sent the paper to an oncologist friend of mine who was the editor-in-chief

1311
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:31,260
of the journal Cancer and just asking him for his comments. And he got back to me in about

1312
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:38,860
four hours and said, with your permission, I want to publish the paper. And he did with Carol's

1313
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:47,980
personality embedded in the paper and it's embedded in the book, making it witty and enjoyable to

1314
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:53,740
read as well as data-filled. Thank you, Avram. Well, it's a pleasure. We didn't discuss

1315
02:13:54,380 --> 02:14:00,700
hormone replacement therapy after a diagnosis of breast cancer. We touched on it, but chapter six

1316
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:07,420
in the book does discuss that. And that's still an open question, but it's an open question. It's

1317
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:14,380
not an obvious conclusion. As I mentioned, getting pregnant after having a diagnosis of breast cancer

1318
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:22,140
does not compromise the prognosis. In fact, it might improve the prognosis that pregnancy,

1319
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:29,660
which floods the body with estrogen before age 20, is associated with a 70% decreased risk

1320
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:36,140
of eventual breast cancer. We used to tell women if they got pregnant and they had breast cancer,

1321
02:14:36,140 --> 02:14:43,980
they must abort. And it turns out that's not true. And in fact, aborting can negatively affect

1322
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:51,100
prognosis. And we present all the findings in that issue so that it's something worth discussing.

1323
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:58,380
There are 15 studies in the literature looking at hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer

1324
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:04,620
and all but one of them show no increased risk of recurrence. And the one that shows an increased

1325
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:10,780
risk of recurrence was stopped prematurely, had a follow-up of two and a half years, and

1326
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:19,180
is a worthwhile study to look at, but clearly should not be the last word, including the senior

1327
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:23,420
author of that study said, this should not be the last word in this subject.

1328
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:28,300
Yeah. I'm glad you remembered to bring that up because that was another, you know, look,

1329
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:33,340
I've always personally thought a patient with a personal history of breast cancer, not to say,

1330
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:37,820
so we'll come back to family history, personal history of breast cancer with the exception of

1331
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:43,420
that one patient who was adamant. I mean, her words were, I would rather be on HRT than,

1332
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:47,500
I would rather be dead than not be on HRT. But I've always felt that that is,

1333
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:50,220
that is a really scary place to be.

1334
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:56,620
One of the interesting things that we talk about in the heart chapter is precisely because so many

1335
02:15:56,620 --> 02:16:02,700
women are surviving breast cancer and living for many years after breast cancer, that then there

1336
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:10,220
increased risk of heart disease increases. And so now there is a new specialty of cardio oncology

1337
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:16,300
in which the issue is how do we assure the prolonged survival of our breast cancer

1338
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:20,300
patients who are now at risk of dying of heart disease?

1339
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,580
And Alzheimer's disease.

1340
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:22,060
Exactly.

1341
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:24,460
Yes. And that's the oporosis.

1342
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:31,180
Yeah. So you're right. It is not something that we can just say, well, that's a narrow

1343
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:34,940
subset of women. If you've had breast cancer, we're going to take you off the table because

1344
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:39,580
we're neglecting, as you said, 19 out of 20 of these women, or certainly nine out of 10 of them,

1345
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:41,260
are not going to die from breast cancer.

1346
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:43,660
At least 5 million in the United States now.

1347
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:50,220
When Avram went to talk to the FDA to secure their approval for doing his study of administering HRT

1348
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:57,340
to his patients who had had breast cancer, one of the doctors on the committee said to him,

1349
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:00,860
what do you want to do this study for? Aren't all your patients going to die anyway?

1350
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:05,580
And Avram said, no, actually.

1351
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:07,420
The person doesn't know much about breast cancer.

1352
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:07,900
No.

1353
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:10,780
But he sat on the committee. Yeah.

1354
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:16,860
Actually, it was a she. We eventually did get FDA approval to do the study,

1355
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:20,380
which we did for 14 years and reported the results every year.

1356
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:23,180
Where the results as of today.

1357
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:28,140
It was a small study, but it fit in with the other 14, showing no increased risk of local

1358
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:33,340
recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant recurrence among the women who took hormones

1359
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:37,020
compared to the women who didn't when they were matched stage for stage.

1360
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:45,820
Oh, so, okay. Got it. Well, I could go on, but I think the point's been made loud and clear.

1361
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:50,700
Again, I want to thank you for writing the book. I think this is one of those books where there's

1362
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:56,300
a lot of work that went into it. I mean, frankly, I think your 2009 paper is itself a great paper

1363
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:00,300
and itself is, was a lot of work. That's a ton of literature to review.

1364
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:06,940
And I do hope that women, men, anyone listening to this who knows a woman comes away at least

1365
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:11,500
thinking if they have a strong point of view on this, which many people do, that they could at

1366
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:16,380
least revisit that and take the time. You know, JFK said something, it's one of my favorite quotes

1367
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:22,620
and I'm going to paraphrase it, but the gist of it is we too often enjoy the comfort of opinion

1368
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:30,060
without the discomfort of thought. And he says it much more eloquently, but this is one of the case

1369
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:37,420
studies for that, right? There are way too many people that I speak with who immediately believe,

1370
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:45,740
unilaterally believe HRT is anathema to life. And yet when you ask them why they can't give you a

1371
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:54,940
single reason other than though WHI said so. There you are. A quote that I like is the more

1372
02:18:54,940 --> 02:19:01,180
you know, the less you fear. Very well. And on that, I want to thank you guys for making the

1373
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:05,980
trip down here and I want to wish you all the best as you continue to get this message out there.
