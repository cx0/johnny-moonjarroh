00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Hey, Bob, that's a lot of books behind you, man. Have you read all of them or most of

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
them?

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,200
Well, thanks for noticing, Peter. I'm a voracious reader. Sometimes my appetite is too big,

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,360
so I have to admit, I haven't read all of them, maybe 90% I think at this point.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,320
That's impressive. Everything, the classics, literature, science.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,400
Mostly the classics, you can probably tell by the book binding on some of those. Yeah.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,560
Hard to get them out of the shelf, to be honest, to pull those things out. They're in there

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
so tight.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah. And it's good, too. Your kids can do little projects flattening leaves and stuff

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
like that.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Yes.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
We've got more of those going on.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
It's fun for the whole family.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,920
All right. Well, what do we have on the docket today for AMA number 20 something, 25?

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,640
Yeah, 25. So in a similar vein as some of the previous AMAs, I consolidated a bunch

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,040
of questions around a particular topic, and this one is cancer screening. We've gotten

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
a bunch of different questions related to cancer and cancer screening. So you've got,

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,440
I'll give you a flavor of some of the questions that we've received. How do you think about

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,760
cancer screening? Why and or when should I be screened? Which ones or which tests are

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,880
worth getting? What do you think of liquid biopsies? How do you interpret sensitivity

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,320
and specificity of tests? What do those actually mean? What are some screening tools for cancer

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,680
you use in your practice? There's another one. I don't know if this was a question from

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,960
someone, but I found this very interesting. And this is this question is, can you discuss

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,160
how you categorize cancers and how you screen for each? So I remember you told me this,

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,000
too, and it was it's pretty interesting. I don't know if everybody would suspect this

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
answer, but cancers outside the body versus cancers inside the body. So we'll get into

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,080
that a little bit. But I think it probably makes sense to start off with sort of in general,

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,240
I know you're a you're a strategy person. I know you love tactics, too. But I think

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,920
that just to be clear, Bob, do we have three or four hours set aside for this podcast?

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,120
Hopefully it's the hopefully it's the latter. Yeah, I think this could be a lot. This could

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,960
be a long one. All right. Well, where would you like to begin? I think we should begin

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,280
from the top. The first question was, how do you think about cancer screening? Yeah.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,360
So again, I guess putting this in the context of what we're interested in clinically probably

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,920
sounds repetitive, but longevity has these two components and they're not independent.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,240
But sometimes it's helpful to think about them in isolation. So lifespan, health span,

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:56,360
how do you live longer and then how do you live better? And in many ways, cancer versus

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,320
the other major chronic diseases that rob a person of lifespan, namely the atherosclerotic

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:09,480
diseases and the diseases of dementia and neurocognitive decline. The latter two tend

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,000
to go more hand in hand with the reduction in health span. In other words, by definition,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,280
when a person has Alzheimer's disease, their quality of life, i.e. their cognition is also

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,140
deteriorating. So they're experiencing both the slide in quality of life and eventually

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,920
length of life. And similarly in people that have advanced atherosclerosis, while of course

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,640
it's true that people die suddenly of heart attacks who are otherwise totally healthy,

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,120
a lot of times the reduction in the ability to carry out activities of daily living kind

46
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,040
of moves more hand in hand with that. I would say that's a little less the case with cancer.

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,320
Obviously cancer is still a disease whose primary risk factor is age. So age is the

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,040
greatest risk factor for cancer just as it is for the other two diseases. But it's also

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,120
in some ways a little bit easier to think of cancer in isolation from the health span

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,920
stuff, the decline in physical and mental and emotional state. So if you're trying to imagine

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,400
a world in which you can live longer, as we've discussed many times previously, that means living

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,160
in a world where we delay the onset of chronic disease and or have better tools to live longer

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,440
with chronic disease. But you know that I much favor the former option because we basically

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,880
spent most of the history of modern medicine working on the latter option with very, very

55
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,880
limited success. So, okay, so let's now pause it for a moment that one of the pillars of longevity

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,480
is minimizing mortality from cancer. So where does screening fit into this? Well screening is one of

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,800
three pieces that you would envision, right? The first piece would be how do you prevent cancer?

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,920
The second thing would be how do you screen for cancer and detect it early? And I'll explain why

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,440
I think that's necessary. And the third is how do you treat it when you have it? So we can talk a

60
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,080
lot about the former, how do you prevent cancer? We've had many podcasts and we have many podcasts

61
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,880
coming up where we're going to get into the treatments of cancer. But I want to focus this

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,040
one on the prevention piece. So why do I believe that? Well, this is a controversial topic I want

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,080
to say first. So not all people believe that screening matters. But I think the simplest

64
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,160
explanation for why screening matters is the evidence that suggests that a cancer that is

65
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:49,640
caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is caught later. In other words, if you catch

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,600
a breast cancer or a colon cancer when there are tens of millions or hundreds of millions of cancer

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,040
cells, your odds of treating that successfully are better than if you catch the same cancer years

68
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,120
later when there are billions of cells. And the evidence for that basically comes from examining

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:19,440
how patients respond to the exact same drugs in the adjuvant setting versus in the metastatic

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,000
setting. So what does that mean? So the adjuvant setting is when a drug is given to a patient who

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,120
has no visible cancer. So these are patients that may have had the visible cancer removed. You believe

72
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,040
that they have microscopic disease that remains and you give them a drug like Herceptin for a

73
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,680
HER2-neu positive breast cancer. And if you compare the outcomes of those patients to the

74
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,040
outcomes of patients who are given the exact same drug for the exact same phenotype and genotype of

75
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,600
the cancer, but in the metastatic setting, there's no comparison in the outcomes. And one explanation

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,040
for that may be that the more mature cancers, the ones that have been around longer, have developed

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,120
more mutations, they are more difficult to treat. So it is therefore my belief that the more we can

78
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,680
do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier, the better we will be. But we do pay a price for that.

79
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,960
We pay a financial price for that. In other words, it costs money to screen early. And we pay

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,360
potentially an emotional price from that because as we'll get to, and you alluded to, we have to now

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,040
get into false positives and false negatives. But at a high level, Bob, that's how I think about

82
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:40,560
this cancer or this topic around cancer screening. Yeah, I think it's telling too, if you look at

83
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,640
statistics on that, they call it five-year survival. So what are the odds of you surviving a

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,320
cancer? And then if you look at specific cancers like breast cancer, you're talking about, you catch

85
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,400
it early and it's a local cancer, it hasn't metastasized. And the statistics on that is the

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:07,480
five-year survival rates are about 99%. And then you go to a distant cancer, so a metastatic breast

87
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:16,000
cancer, and it's closer to about 25% in terms of the five-year survival. And also what you alluded

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,480
to as well, the false positives, false negatives. I said I alluded to that. So that gets into

89
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,600
sensitivity, specificity. And I didn't mention this, but positive predictive value, negative predictive

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,320
value. And I think it probably would be helpful to go into that. And I think pictures are probably

91
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,040
worth a thousand words in this case, in terms of looking at how good a screening tool is and

92
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,600
determining that stuff, sensitivity, specificity, et cetera. So do you want to start with just,

93
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,040
we want to just start explaining those things? Sure. So I think it makes sense to pull up a second.

94
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,400
Yeah, we've got some slides that we use with our patients. So go ahead and pull these up and we'll

95
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,720
walk through that. Because I think if you want to take ownership over your own understanding of

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,480
cancer screening, you'll definitely want to get to a point where you're really facile with these terms.
