00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,920
Hey, Carl. It is so good to see you today, although admittedly across video,

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,080
but it's like a little blast from the past from, I don't know, 20 years ago, right?

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,200
Yeah, it's amazing. We had a good group of friends back in the old days at Stanford,

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,000
and I haven't kept in touch with them as much as I'd hoped, but it's great to see you.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,360
It really brings back a lot of memories. You look great, unchanged.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,520
Well, yeah, that's funny. You don't look a bit different. It is funny when I think back to that

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,440
class of ours in med school, and I really feel like the overwhelming underachiever of our class.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,000
And I remember our first day of our surgical rotation, you, me, and Josh Rabinowitz,

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,960
sitting in that room waiting for us to be assigned to which service we would go to.

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,760
Of course, you and Josh have gone on to do unbelievable things. I've sort of modeled along.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,760
Now you're the star. And plus, I remember, even though it was the start of our surgery rotation,

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,600
you already knew how to do everything, which I was impressed by. You knew all the knots,

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,040
and I was like, wait, this is the first day of the rotation. How do you do that?

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:27,480
Well, let's pick it up back there. So you were in the MD-PhD program, so we didn't start at the

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,920
same time. We just finished at the same time. You had come in earlier. But I think the reason I knew

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,360
you even on our first day of surgery was because you had done your PhD in the same lab as two other

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:47,080
friends of mine, Alex Rabinowitz and Jason Pyle. And all kidding aside, I think that, look, all the

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,400
kids that went to med school were pretty bright. But I think the MD-PhD students were sort of in a

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,400
class of their own. And I suspect it was even harder to get into that program than it was just

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,320
the straight MD program. So thinking back to your time as an undergrad, but what did you major in

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,960
again in undergrad? I did biochemical sciences, they call it, at Harvard instead of biochemistry.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,280
They had to do everything different, and they didn't call it a major either. It was a concentration.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,920
So I concentrated in biochemical sciences. So there you go. But I had a lot of other interests.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,840
All my friends were physicists, theoretical physicists, in fact. And so I was exposed to some

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,960
pretty unusual stuff for a biochemist. And were they allowed to call it theoretical physics at

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:39,160
Harvard? They were. Okay, that's good. I just want to... Good question, yes. They were allowed to name

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,440
it. Good, good. So at what point during your biological science concentration did you know

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,480
you wanted to go into medicine? It was pretty early because I was interested in the brain early on,

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,920
and I wanted to understand the brain at the level of cells. But I was also interested in the most

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,840
high level aspects of brain function. And so I thought I needed to talk to human beings. I needed

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,000
some access to the human brain. I found that interesting because I was interested in emotion

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,080
and the ability to express feelings through words. And I was torn. I liked writing and literature

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,040
and the use of words, and I liked cells and biology. And I wanted to somehow fuse them,

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,440
and it seemed that medical school was the way to go because I could work with the human brain.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,680
And obviously you could have just gone to medical school, but you also selected into this very,

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,240
very advanced program that was incredibly selected, the MST program, the Medical Science

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,920
Training Program. And so that tells me at the outset that you also knew you wanted to do research

39
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:55,480
beyond, quote unquote, just clinical medicine, yes? Yeah, that's right. And that was the nice

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,200
thing about the MSTP is it lets you delay making a commitment. So you keep both threads alive.

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,760
And then there's a beautiful synergy that can happen too, and certainly happened with me that

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,920
you realize, oh, wait, I don't have to make this decision. It actually is good to keep both threads

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,560
alive in my work and my life. And that's what happened. But it's a pretty special thing we have

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,320
in the United States. There are efforts along these lines in Europe and other countries,

45
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,000
but it's not nearly as institutionalized as it is here. It's a really special thing.

46
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, it really is. And again, I keep saying this, but I feel like there were maybe what,

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,480
six or eight MSTPs per class. And I always felt like you guys had the most pressure on you,

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,520
right? There was this expectation from both the clinical side that you would go on to be great

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,320
doctors, but then you were also, especially at places like Stanford, where you had the opportunity

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,120
to do your PhDs with Nobel laureates, would be Nobel laureates, exceptional scientists, that you

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,000
would also basically be leading the charge scientifically. And for what it's worth, all of

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,800
my friends in the MSTP program, I think you're the only one that ended up doing clinical training as

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,600
well. I think most of them didn't end up doing residencies. They either went purely into academic

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,760
research tracks or actually went into industry. But before we get into the fact that you also

55
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,240
did clinical training, let's talk a little bit about that transition. You came into medical school

56
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,200
pretty hell bent on neurosurgery. Yeah. That was the goal because, you know, again, how do you,

57
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,880
how do you get access to the, to the human brain and who among the different clinical specialties

58
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:51,560
has that access? Who can, who can, would most directly interact, study? And it seemed to me

59
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,440
the neurosurgeons had it all. And if one were to build an interface with the brain, if one wanted

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,520
to both communicate with a person as they were expressing feelings and emotions and to understand

61
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,520
at the level of cells what was going on, who could do that? But a neurosurgeon was my, was my

62
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,000
reasoning. And, you know, and I, the neurosurgeons that my, that my colleagues and friends that are

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
amazing people, you know, brilliant. And, and I, I saw no reason not to, to pursue that. And so that

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,880
was the first rotation that I, I selected in those second two years of medical school, even before

65
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,000
surgery, I did neurosurgery. And so, which was kind of interesting, just, just coming in there with,

66
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,800
with no general surgical training as well. That's how, how certain I was.

67
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah. It's funny. Well, I had a similar experience whereas the thing I absolutely positively thought

68
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,840
I was going to do, I picked as my first rotation. In my case, I had less of a pleasant experience

69
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,600
than you. I think you had a pleasant experience on neurosurgery. It wasn't that in any way you

70
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,640
didn't like it, but what was your first? Well, I, I planned to do pediatric oncology. So I,

71
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,840
I went out of the gates with two months of pediatrics, which, which actually I didn't enjoy

72
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,360
largely because I just didn't feel like I didn't fit in. I think so much of your medical school

73
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,520
experience in terms of your clinical rotations is a function of how well do you fit in with the

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,000
residents of that specialty. And I didn't feel like I fit in with the pediatricians. They didn't

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,080
laugh at my jokes. They thought I was probably a little too obnoxious. I probably spent too

76
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,680
much time imitating Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, pretending to eat the babies, but it just,

77
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,920
the whole thing just didn't go well. It was a disaster. And then my next rotation was general

78
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,560
surgery where we connected. And even though I had no desire whatsoever to go into surgery,

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,240
that became a, a kind of overnight love and away we go. But so, so you're doing your neurosurgery

80
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,120
rotation, which again, yes, highly unusual that you would do that so early in your training. That's

81
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:03,240
usually something one does in the fourth year, not the third year. And I mean, I'll say this,

82
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,320
Carl, when I did general surgery at Hopkins, I did one month of neurosurgery as a rotation,

83
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,800
having never been interested in neurosurgery. So sort of saying, well, fine, I'll do this. I didn't

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,120
have a choice. I had to do this month of neurosurgery and I fell in love with it. I couldn't,

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,480
and in fact, I spoke to the program director at Hopkins and said,

86
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,560
would it be ridiculous for me to try to transfer into neurosurgery? That's how much I enjoyed it.

87
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,840
And it turned out that he said, I can absolutely get you in, but it won't be at Hopkins. Hopkins

88
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,480
is the most competitive neurosurgery program in the country. We only take three people.

89
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,640
It's already full. You're not going to get in here, but I can get you to another program. And I,

90
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,960
I actually contemplated it for about a month. So I can see the appeal of it. There was something

91
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,680
about cutting open the dura and operating on the brain. And it's a surprisingly simple organ in

92
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,480
that sense. Like at the gross level, it's surprisingly simple. Obviously, much of what

93
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,880
we're going to talk about today, Carl, is not at the gross level where it's anything but simple,

94
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,640
but what was your experience like? I mean, it was, yeah, at the one, at one level, it is an organ.

95
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,720
And, and it's, it would be unfair to say that all that neurosurgeons get to do is think about it as

96
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,480
an organ. They do have to think about that, the blood supply and, and, and the, whether the cells

97
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,520
are receiving enough oxygen and, and, and, and glucose. And they have to think about it in the,

98
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:37,720
in the context of the physicality of it, perhaps more than the, the, the mentation aspect of it.

99
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,960
And so, but they, they, they do get to think about high level concepts in that rotation. In that

100
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,120
month, there was a patient who had a little bit of a thalamic infarct as a result of the, the

101
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,640
surgery and a little bit of loss of tissue in the thalamus. And the patient had a neglect

102
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,680
syndrome, which I spent a lot of time working with the patient afterward, characterizing exactly

103
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,960
how this worked. You know, I asked the patient to draw a clock and the patient drew, you know,

104
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,080
just half of a clock. And it was an amazing, you know, classical thing, but amazing to see with

105
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,880
your own eyes as you're talking to another person and the person said, oh, the clock looks fine.

106
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,360
It's a, but it was a half a clock. And, and that certainly didn't diminish my interest in neurosurgery

107
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,720
at all. It was, you know, this was at the one level, you know, there were problems, which nearly

108
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,080
clearly needed to be better, you know, aspects of, of neurosurgery as with every clinical specialty

109
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,600
needed to improve, needed to reduce, you know, consequences like that. And yet at the same time,

110
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,960
it was incredibly interesting as well. I loved the operating room. I loved the suturing, although

111
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:51,240
I wasn't as good as you, I think. And I, I, but I was good enough. And it was particularly because

112
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,680
it was so early. I think the promise was there, it would have worked out. And it was, it still had

113
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,800
a magic about it. You know, when you, when the Dura is exposed, it's a, it's, yes, it's, it's an

114
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,400
organ, but it's a, there's a spirituality to that, to know that, that you're actually looking at the,

115
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,880
the storehouse of human beings, you know, thoughts and feelings and, and everything about them all,

116
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,600
all encapsulated in this collection of cells. It's, it's quite an amazing thing. And so I had no

117
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,640
negativity at all. I did note that neurosurgeons, they, they didn't get a lot of free time. There

118
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,760
was not a lot of, you know, philosophizing. And I noticed, you know, it's a seven year

119
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,840
progression. And I talked to all the neurosurgery residents and I noted a steady decline and

120
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:50,120
willingness to philosophize as their progression through the residency continued. You could almost

121
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,920
plot that, you know, literally on a, on a graph. And, and with all, you know, due credit to them,

122
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,440
it's the nature of the system they're in that they don't necessarily have all the time. They

123
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,080
would like to think deeply, although they certainly are very bright and thoughtful and

124
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,440
certainly could. And so I did note that I noted that, you know, here, here are people who maybe

125
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,640
don't have the freedom to do everything I would like. And that was in the back of my mind.

126
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,480
Yeah. I think back to the three people in my class. So at the entering class at Hopkins,

127
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,960
three of them were neurosurgery assigned. So they did the internship with us, but then they went

128
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:35,800
off and I mean, boy, they were, they were three ridiculously smart guys. Yeah. And you would think,

129
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,240
well, they're in neurosurgery. So how interested are they going to be in their year of general

130
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,600
surgery? But they were every bit the exceptional interns that, that the categoricals were the ones

131
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,240
who were going to go into general surgery. But one of the experiences that jumps out at me from my

132
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,760
month of general surgery at in my internship was an awake procedure we did on a patient. So under

133
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,800
local anesthetic, the brain was opened and the patient while wide awake was being probed in an

134
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,680
effort to determine certain symptoms and to see what part of the brain could be lesioned in order

135
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,120
to ameliorate these symptoms. And I think for anybody to see that in real life with their own

136
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,040
eyes even once is it's, it's really hard to believe what you're watching, right? First of all,

137
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,240
the brain is not the same sensory organ. The fact that you can be awake while a surgeon is probing

138
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,880
into your brain and firing an electrical impulse into one area or another to see how it changes

139
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,040
this part of your visual field or this part of your, I mean, that was, that was something that

140
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,720
was a magic that I don't think I could describe otherwise. Yeah. And, and that, I felt that very,

141
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,680
very strongly. And so there was, it was all systems go after that. They, you know, surprisingly,

142
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,680
the neurosurgeons at Stanford liked me okay after that too. I got very positive feedback from them.

143
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,000
And, and, and they said, Hey, you know, come back and do a sub-i sub-entrinship and we'd love to,

144
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,200
to get you down this path. So which, which was a, you know, that, that was a, that was a green light.

145
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,640
And I was, I was happy with that. It was, it was where I was headed. Of course, things changed

146
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,240
after that. Yeah. So the best laid plans, there was another mandatory, there's set of mandatory

147
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,520
rotations we have to do neurosurgery, not being one of them, but pediatrics, general surgery,

148
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:34,440
internal medicine being the OBGYN. And one of them is psychiatry, kind of this afterthought for,

149
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,840
you know, the medical student, right? Very few people want to go into psychiatry.

150
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:47,320
And yet amazingly, two of the smartest people in my med school class, you and Paul Conti end up

151
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,440
picking this field ultimately. Just amazing, right? So tell me about your, how did you go into your

152
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,360
psychiatry rotation? Were you looking forward to this or did you view it the way many of us did,

153
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,640
which was just get me through it. I had a get me through it, you know, attitude coming in. And again,

154
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:13,000
no disrespect to psychiatry, of course, you know, it's a, they have a hard challenge. Still,

155
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,840
we have this challenge that there's not a, a measurable really, you know, we have, we have

156
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,840
effectively, you know, questions we ask patients, it's all with words is how we work. And no biomarker.

157
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,080
No biomarker still. Yeah. I mean, there's efforts along those lines, looking at EEG, you know,

158
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,240
ratios of this to that and there's progress being made, but still clinically, you can't make

159
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,240
diagnoses based on measuring something about the brain and psychiatry. You can, you can notice that

160
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,680
there's something else going on, a neurological or medical problem, but you can't define someone's

161
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,600
psychiatric state with, with a, some biomarker. And that still amazing to this day, still true.

162
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah. So what, tell me about your psych rotation. Cause I remember we kind of had choices. I did an

163
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,320
entirely outpatient month, which I ended up finding quite enjoyable. That's the irony of

164
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,240
these things. You kind of, I did it as one of my last rotations prior to graduation, which meant

165
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,560
there was no chance, even if I'd liked it, I was too late for me to make that choice. I had already

166
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,960
matched, I think in general surgery, but it was an outpatient month. So relatively low acuity.

167
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,760
But, but interesting nevertheless, what, what was your month like?

168
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,160
So my mind was the opposite of that. It was, and this was probably a fortunate thing for me.

169
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,200
It was in the locked unit at the VA at the Veterans Administration Hospital. And this was a,

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,920
a unit where patients can't leave. And this is due to, you know, being a danger to themselves

171
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,120
or a danger to others or having a greater disability. And this, you know, these patients

172
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:02,920
were severely ill. And I walked into that. You know, I'd had typical experiences. Everybody,

173
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,360
you know, has friends or family who've had, you know, depression or anxiety. I'd had,

174
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,520
I'd seen substance abuse and intoxicated states and dementia. And I had a fairly, you know,

175
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,880
I thought decently broad understanding of what can go wrong on the, on the psychiatric side.

176
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,880
But I can tell you nothing, and you, you know this by now, but, but I can, I can tell your,

177
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,960
your viewers and listeners, there is nothing like what you can see when you walk into the,

178
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,640
the locked ward of a psychiatric hospital. There's a, there's the, there's a sort of a purity,

179
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,000
not in a good way, but there's a, because there's not confounding issues like intoxication and so

180
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,720
on, there's a, there's a consistency and a purity to the disorders. And so if you have someone with

181
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,080
acute schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, other things that might confound what's going on

182
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,520
have been removed. And there's this very strong, acute, straightforward expression of the symptoms.

183
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,920
That's just mind boggling to see if you haven't experienced it before. And, and that's, that was,

184
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,640
was my experience and it completely changed my course. There was a, even on the, you know, my

185
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,720
very first day, there was a, a patient with schizoaffective disorder, which is a very severe

186
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,600
combination of mood and psychotic symptoms that are all mixed up together. And this patient

187
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,320
accosted me in the, in the locked unit, started screaming at me and, and, but it was, it was not

188
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,480
necessarily sort of a street encounter that you might have in a, in a city. It was more,

189
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,600
it was more direct and personal and evocative of something going on in the, in the mind of the

190
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,040
patient that was clearly a source of immense suffering, of great disability. And yet at the

191
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,200
same time, it was, it was tantalizing because this was a human being who was physically intact,

192
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,440
but whose reality was so completely different from mine. We were two people with intact bodies and,

193
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,200
and, and brains who were, you know, next to each other. And we inhabited completely different

194
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,800
realities. And to experience that was a utterly transformative moment. And, and I both seen the,

195
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,200
the suffering and realizing I have no idea what's going on here, but it's incredibly

196
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,240
interesting too. How is this possible? How could this be happening to a human being? And,

197
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,240
and without that direct exposure, I don't know what would have happened, but having had it,

198
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,440
it changed my course. Which is interesting. I mean, many people when confronted with that would be

199
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,560
quite frightened, especially when you realize the limitations of the tools that you have,

200
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,640
right? So let's, let's consider another analogy, which is, you know, a patient that comes in with

201
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,400
a gunshot wound to the chest. That's an incredibly frightening experience. There's literally, you know,

202
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,600
a sucking chest wound, blood could be splaying around the room, vital signs are crashing,

203
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,720
the person's on the verge of death. But that can be exciting in a way because we actually have the

204
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,800
tools to do something, right? It might be completely draconian. We might be doing a

205
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,840
thoracotomy in the ER, cross clamping the aorta, but you run that patient to the OR and you know

206
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,560
how to fix them. You're experiencing something that I would argue is much more frightening,

207
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,240
but compounded by the fact that what do you do? I mean, you could temporarily give that person

208
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,880
howdall and, and sort of snow them, but that's not curing them. So was it, which of, was it more the,

209
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,400
we don't have the tools here. This is an unbelievable opportunity to learn or, or,

210
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,640
or, you know, how did that experience, which I think for many people could have been off-putting

211
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,560
do the exact opposite in you? I mean, I had, it's a, it's a great question because I, I,

212
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,640
and I would completely understand that the normal or typical reaction would be sort of an aversive

213
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,680
thing, you know, how this is, this is not something I want to spend my life doing in this,

214
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:32,120
in this setting. But I had a, I had a different reaction, which surprised me. And it was partly,

215
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,000
it was, it was really, there were two sides to it. One was exactly what you're saying.

216
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:46,440
The level of mystery here was actually for me, it was a positive rather than an aversive thing. And

217
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,640
maybe this was partly the, my scientific training, you know, at that point I'd completed my, my PhD

218
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,760
and, and, and I spent years trying to figure things out. And we all want to figure things out. That's

219
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,360
a natural human impulse. Not everybody necessarily spends years and years and years trying to figure

220
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,240
out the same thing. And that's, that's the kind of training we get in, in, in, in the PhD program.

221
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,160
And I saw that and I was like, okay, gotta figure this out. This is, this is clearly

222
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:24,200
a mystery that is something that it's a burden that humanity shares. It's a terrible burden that

223
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,480
this human being is suffering. But what's the solution? We've got to figure it out. We've got

224
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,800
to understand this. And, and it's a mystery that strikes to the heart of, of what it always intrigued

225
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,560
me, which is what is, what is an emotion physically? What is a feeling physically? How does the

226
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,320
collection of cells in our brains, and that's what it is. It's a collection of cells. How,

227
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,920
how is it possible that that creates a feeling and emotion? And I realized at that moment,

228
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:03,320
this is, this is actually, you know, why I came to medical school. This, and it all made sense in,

229
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,520
in one moment that, that hadn't before. And, and then, you know, of course, as a, as a,

230
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,120
as a physician, as you well know, we, our instinct is to help, is to heal and, and we want to do that.

231
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,960
But as you say, if we don't have the tools, what can we do? It's, it's a problem. And I wasn't

232
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,480
frustrated with the inability to do anything. And I would understand that reaction too.

233
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,200
And the fact is we, we could do a little bit though. So it wasn't quite nothing. And there

234
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,520
are medications back then and still that help somewhat. They don't come with understanding.

235
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:49,720
They don't help us explain to the patient or the family or to ourselves what's really going on,

236
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,560
but they do help a little bit. And so I was, I knew that I could do something, not much,

237
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,200
but a little bit. And as time went on, hopefully, and as the science progressed,

238
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,200
maybe we could do more. And so that, it fit together in a, in a moment. And I didn't have

239
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,800
another thought for neurosurgery after that, although it was, it was a hard process, you know,

240
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:26,680
to reshape what my trajectory was going to be. I had one set of plans. My friends and family had a

241
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,600
set of expectations. I can tell you, I think my, my father was pretty disappointed when I told him

242
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,320
on the phone that I was going to do psychiatry. I could hear it in his voice. It was, it was almost,

243
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,600
yeah, it was a quite a, and, you know, again, he, he came around in the end too. And, and I think

244
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,760
he's, he's happy now, but at the time I could, I could sense that this was not what he'd hoped

245
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:58,440
for me. So yeah, it was, it was an adjustment. It was a, a remapping, but it was a very compelling

246
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,800
experience that, that the process of medical training and the required psychiatry rotation

247
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,640
made possible. So Carl, you, you now make this decision to completely veer into this nearly

248
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,000
orthogonal track. I mean, psychiatry and neurosurgery, of course, have one thing in common, which is the,

249
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,320
the organ of interest is the brain, but at that point they basically, you know, differ.

250
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:31,640
How did you decide you were going to both pursue the clinical training, the residency for psychiatry,

251
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,440
but also do whatever was necessary to make sure that you could ultimately be running a lab? Because

252
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,240
I, I think throughout this period, you never lost sight unless I'm misremembering of the desire to

253
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,760
be a physician scientist and not just a physician. So, you know, residency, especially 20 years ago

254
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,680
when we did our residencies, they didn't have 80 hour work week requirements and things like that.

255
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,480
So residencies were quite demanding. Was it a little hard for you to say, Hey, I'm going to

256
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,240
actually have to put my research on hold for a little while? It was, it was hard. And this is,

257
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:15,080
there are a lot of challenges that people in this realm face because things move so quickly.

258
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:24,200
In the research realm that if you step aside for even a year, forget about four years, you know,

259
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,680
the world you reenter is, is so different and it's very hard to catch up. And this is, you know,

260
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,200
that's to some extent an old problem because that's been faced by everybody who planned

261
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:45,000
to do a residency. But it's, it's not negligible because it's an old problem. It's that issue,

262
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,320
exactly, that ends up driving people to make this hard choice that you mentioned earlier and saying,

263
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,040
you know, in the end, I'm going to have to do one or the other. If I do the residency,

264
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,680
I'll be a, I'll be a doctor. I'll be a good doctor, maybe a great doctor. I'll be,

265
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,560
I'll be informed by all my scientific training. Maybe I'll read papers better. Maybe I'll be more,

266
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,720
you know, amenable to new ideas, new treatments as a result of that. But ultimately I'll be a

267
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,960
physician or on the other side saying, you know, I'm not going to do the residency. I'm not going to

268
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,680
drop off this, this fast moving train. I'm at this moment, I've just finished my PhD. I'm a

269
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,880
world expert in this. I can do things that nobody else can do. Why lose that momentum? Why not

270
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,920
speed up, add the next tool in the tool belt, launch yourself and make great discoveries. And

271
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:49,160
that is very, very tempting. I had, you know, very clear opportunities to do that. And so that's the

272
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:57,240
hard choice that the MD PhD faces at that moment. Now efforts are made to ameliorate that. So

273
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,800
residencies, you know, again, this was the time still where the residencies were extremely

274
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,960
difficult. And I had some, for me, this was compounded by some personal challenges. I was

275
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,320
effectively a single dad at the time. And so I had to also think about this other factor,

276
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,960
very important. Now I've got to think about residency. I've got to think about lab. I've

277
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:31,400
got to think about family. And it was very, very challenging. And yet there are these research track

278
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:39,640
residencies and they help a little bit. So there are, and Stanford and other, you know, programs,

279
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,560
both in psychiatry and in other specialties, they have efforts to help people keep their

280
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,120
scientific, you know, mind alive during residency. And it's not great, but it's a little bit, a little

281
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,720
bit of protected time here and there. Never quite enough to get momentum, but at least to keep a

282
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,000
foot in the lab and try to stay connected. And so I did that. It was a research track,

283
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:11,320
psychiatry residency. And I stayed at Stanford and a big factor in that was that literally at the

284
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:20,200
same time, and I was very fortunate in this regard, a guy named Rob Malenka, who was a psychiatrist and

285
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:28,280
a great neuroscientist, was at that moment coming from UCSF to Stanford. He had come and was setting

286
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,600
up his lab at Stanford. And I knew, here's somebody, a psychiatrist, but also a neuroscientist.

287
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,560
He'll understand, you know, what's going on in my residency that I'm, you know, I'm taking call,

288
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:48,520
I'm up all night. He'll know, he'll understand why I'm never in the lab during expected hours,

289
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,840
why I'm never at lab meeting. And that made it work out. And I worked nights and weekends.

290
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,280
I maybe came to one of his lab meetings over four years and I effectively did a combined

291
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,360
postdoctoral fellowship and psychiatry residency at the same time at Stanford.

292
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,600
Some funny stories. I, you know, because Stanford's very compact, as you know,

293
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,280
I could literally take call from, you know, from the lab. I'd be patch clamping. I'd be up at the

294
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,160
rig, you know, listening in, making measurements on currents flowing across a single cell.

295
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,840
And I'd get paged, go walk over to the ER, admit a patient, come back, you know, patch

296
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,000
clamp the next cell. And it was a pretty special moment when that happened that felt like the

297
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,240
different parts of my life were, like, they could work together. They could be compatible. And that,

298
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,440
with all, you know, so many people have such a hard time understandably making that work,

299
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,960
making the pieces fit together. And I feel fortunate that I was able to make that work.

300
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,280
Now, what year was your son born? Ninety-eight?

301
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,840
He was actually born in 96. So he is 25.

302
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,560
So you're four, he is five years old, basically, when you're in the midst of this.

303
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,840
Yeah, that's right.

304
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,160
So how did you manage that?

305
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:14,520
You know, it was these, this is actually something that I touch on. I know we may talk about this,

306
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,840
the book I wrote projections later, but it was a turned out to be a theme early in my,

307
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,600
in my life, how my experiences with my son, how they related to all the stressors and the

308
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,200
patient experiences that I was having. And in a way, psychologically, although it was difficult

309
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:42,360
to make everything work, practically, it also, it helped me a little bit to have a

310
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,720
something that mattered more than anything else in the lab or in the clinic, there was something

311
00:31:51,720 --> 00:32:01,000
that sort of was on a different scale. And it helped me not get too stressed about things

312
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,720
happening in the lab or the clinic. And that's a common feeling and people with kids, for me,

313
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,120
it was, it was extremely important at that time. You know, and it was, there were patchwork solutions

314
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,320
of childcare and so on that made things work, but it was ultimately, I think it was helpful for me

315
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:26,360
in getting through those times. And by the way, he is now an MSTP student at Baylor. So he's doing

316
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,880
his MD, PhD in Texas. And he's now second year. He's a cool kid. He's good at guitar much better

317
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,520
than I am. And he likes computer science.

318
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,280
Yeah, he's got some big shoes to fill, but I, and I'm positive that none of that pressure comes

319
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:52,920
from you. So, um, so I remember when you were finishing your residency, um, I just remember

320
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:00,520
because of our common friends, like how kind of exciting it was when you were now setting up your

321
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,040
own labs. So we're talking about what? Oh, five, Oh six ish. Yeah. The lab started to get set up in

322
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,640
oh four. Okay. Um, and then it really hit full steam. Yeah. Between oh six and oh nine,

323
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,240
but oh four was when we were setting it up. So as you're embarking on this,

324
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,880
what is it that you experienced during that, that transformation of your, your clinical training,

325
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,480
your residency, how did that shape the problems you were interested in solving?

326
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:38,760
Well, I, you know, having just completed my psychiatry residency, I had seen, I had a pretty

327
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,120
deep understanding of where things were clinically. Uh, I knew what, not just the medications we had,

328
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,240
but also the brain stimulation treatments, the interventions that we had available at the time.

329
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,200
I did, uh, you know, I did electroconvulsive therapy, which, uh, is, you know, it's a,

330
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,320
it's very effective for treatment resistant depression. Uh, it's the treatment of choice

331
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,480
for many people. It's incredibly effective. It's stunning to see it's, it has some problems. Uh,

332
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,840
you don't want to give it too much and there, there can be side effects, but it's incredibly

333
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,680
effective. What's the durability of it? Uh, it depends of some patients need, uh, what we call,

334
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,800
you know, uh, maintenance, uh, electroconvulsive therapy. So after three months or so, uh, the

335
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,600
effect will be diminished and they'll, they'll, uh, require to stay alive effectively patients

336
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,520
who are, for example, just acutely suicidal. Uh, and they'll need every three months or so,

337
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,000
what we call maintenance, uh, or continuation, uh, electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.

338
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,720
So it's not a, it's not a permanent, uh, fix, uh, like so much of medicine and so much of

339
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,960
psychiatry, you know, uh, it's something that moves things back into a healthy range for a time.

340
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,160
But we didn't know how it was working. It definitely helped, but, but it was for a

341
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,600
scientist, it was very, it was satisfying to help the patient to, to take somebody who

342
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,880
was, you know, in just horrific psychological distress, uh, and, and put them into a state

343
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,280
where they could go back and do their work and, and, and, and live with their friends and family

344
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,400
and be happy for some time. That was great, but we had no idea what, and still don't, uh,

345
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,520
what was going on there. Why is this, uh, seizure that we give the patient? And it's,

346
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,720
it's done in a pretty refined way these days. The patient's body is paralyzed, so there's no physical,

347
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,080
you know, seizure. It's, it's all happening in the, in the brain and it's, it's a safe procedure,

348
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,080
but still it's, it's not specific, right? Where you're causing a general pattern of activity

349
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,440
through the brain of the patient and, and this astonishing psychiatric effect is created.

350
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:56,840
I, I, I, clearly it was a mystery, still is, and I was unsatisfied by that. There were early efforts

351
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,320
at the time of, of other brain stimulation treatments. There was a vagus nerve stimulation.

352
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,200
There's a, as you know, there are the nerves that run, uh, the 10th cranial nerve that comes from,

353
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,520
the brainstem and goes down to innervate the heart and the abdomen also sends fibers back to the

354
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,160
brain and you can put a little cuff around the nerve and, and stimulate the brain through the

355
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,480
neck, which is kind of interesting, a little, little highway to the brain. But the effects,

356
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,000
although it became approved, FDA approved for depression, the effects were very small on the

357
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,120
population level, very inconsistent. Likewise, we had transcranial magnetic stimulation, which was

358
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:38,360
in its early days then as well, which was a, uh, you know, it's a, it's a treatment where you can

359
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,280
noninvasively stimulate a tiny patch of the brain by putting a rapidly changing magnetic field, uh,

360
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,680
near the, the, the, the scalp of the patient. Effects small on the population level did get FDA

361
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,160
approved, but still not fully understood. So all these, all these treatments, and of course,

362
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,240
none of the medications to this day do we fully understand their mechanisms of action. So there

363
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,280
was a lot of mystery. And so I came from my psychiatry residency fully aware that, that

364
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,480
essentially the entire field was unmoored from scientific understanding, no fault of the

365
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,800
practitioners, no discredit to them. It was just not known and we didn't have the tools and

366
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,160
techniques. We had no specific way of causing something to happen to a particular kind of cell.

367
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,400
All these treatments are non-specific, a seizure all through the brain, uh, you know, a stimulation

368
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:36,440
of a nerve wherever that nerve may go known, but not specifically related to any psychiatric, uh,

369
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,480
symptom, uh, transcranial magnetic stimulation. Yeah. You can stimulate a little patch of, of the

370
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,480
brain, but we don't know where depression comes from, where anxiety comes from. Is it this patch

371
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,080
or that patch or that patch? No deep level of understanding, uh, was present. And, and of course,

372
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,680
the medications act all through the brain without cell type specificity. So that was the,

373
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,280
that was the setting. And then, you know, to answer your question, then as you know,

374
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,400
clearly, uh, basic science, you know, how could you build an approach to give you some, some kind

375
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,760
of, uh, precise causality. And that was, that was the context. Well, I want to dive really deep into

376
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:24,760
this because it is essentially, um, the skyscraper of your life. I mean, look, if you, if you retired

377
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,120
tomorrow for medicine and science, Carl, if you tomorrow decided you were going to go surfing for

378
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,360
the rest of your life, you would have already accomplished more than that of a hundred scientists.

379
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,280
Um, so I want to, I want to come to this in detail, but before I do, I want the viewers and the

380
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,400
listeners to get a little bit more of an understanding of the brain structure, because

381
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,560
we're going to be talking about structures of the brain. We're going to be talking about the cells

382
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,520
of the brain. And, um, I wonder what the easiest way to do this is maybe we can start about the

383
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,840
brain and it's three layers and what, you know, we talk about them through our evolution maybe and how

384
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,360
each one added to the next, but, but each one has a subset of functions. I'll really defer to you,

385
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,960
Carl, this is your domain and not mine, but, um, maybe we just take a step back and really give

386
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,040
people a sense of, of some neuro anatomy, some neuro physiology, what neurons are, what axons

387
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,320
are, how chemicals get transmitted. I think investing some time in this now will really

388
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,640
enable people to understand the depth and breadth of your literally world changing discovery.

389
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Well, well, thank you for the, first of all, the gracious, uh, comments. I, we have a long way to

390
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,440
go though, and I'm not, uh, and maybe it's many lifetimes, uh, ahead there, there are very deep

391
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,360
mysteries in the, in the brain that we have much, much work to do exciting fun work, but much work

392
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,200
to do to get to where we want to be. But, uh, it is, it is a, an exciting moment and we've, and,

393
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,240
and what we've been able to accomplish has, has been, uh, thrilling. Um, and, and it's a testament

394
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,160
to all the amazing people that, that we've been able to, to get together to work on this. And,

395
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:14,360
and indeed the brain is, is something, it's very compelling. Uh, it's so interesting and mysterious.

396
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,280
The cells in the brain are more complex structurally than any other cell. They're

397
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,200
in our brains, there are approximately 90 billion neurons. That's what it'd be.

398
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,840
Each one of them is, it's a self-contained unit. It's covered by a membrane, but it can generate

399
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,960
electricity. It's got little channels, little pores in its surface that can generate little

400
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,120
electrical impulses. And that's how you can have a single neuron that projects from one part of the

401
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,280
brain to another or from one part of the brain to the spinal cord and, or it can send connections

402
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:59,080
through its axon, its outgoing wire, uh, effectively to many parts of the brain. And it sends that

403
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:06,360
information in the form of electricity down its axon, down its outgoing, uh, connection. And the

404
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,480
connections are received by the downstream cells through little structures called dendrites. And

405
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:18,200
the interface from one cell to the next is called a synapse. And in most cases, information gets

406
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,400
across that little gap from one cell to another in the form of chemicals. So the, the electricity

407
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,000
triggers release of a chemical. The chemical drifts across this tiny little gap that's some

408
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,480
tens of nanometers, and then it acts on receptors in the other side, the post-synaptic side, and,

409
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,520
and that creates a new burst of electricity in that downstream cell. So that's the electrochemical

410
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,400
process that, of information flow. Now you've got this going on and 90 billion neurons at the same

411
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:52,600
time. They're all, maybe they form 10,000 or even a hundred thousand synapses each. Their wiring is

412
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:59,960
incredibly complex. Uh, um, there's some structure to it. There are collections of axons that may

413
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,800
travel together, but then they also bifurcate and separate in incredibly complex ways. And all of

414
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,000
that's in the brain. And then there's some structure to it, as you alluded to. Uh, and one

415
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,440
way we can think about this is, is indeed evolutionarily. We're vertebrates, okay? That means

416
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,000
we have a backbone and we've got a certain organization to our brain. In my lab, we have

417
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
fish and we have mice and we have rats. And then I also do clinical work. These are all vertebrates

418
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,160
from fish to us. We all have the basic vertebrate body plan and brain plan. And, but evolution has

419
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,960
given us, obviously we have much bigger brains than, than fish do. And, uh, a couple of things

420
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,000
have happened over the course of, of, you know, hundreds of millions of years, is that first of

421
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,560
all, we've scaled everything up. We've taken the same structures. We've added many more cells

422
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,240
to them. Uh, and that lets us do more complex things. And we've also added new things on top.

423
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,240
And so in the surface of the brain, there's what we call the cortex, uh, which means literally the,

424
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,560
the surface of, of the, of the brain. It's like the, the rind of a melon. Except in human beings,

425
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,240
it's, it's quite thin. It's just a few millimeters, uh, thick. And within that few millimeters,

426
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:20,200
there are six separate layers within that cortex or rind. Uh, and those are layers of cells. So

427
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,920
there are six layers of cells in this sort of shawl or, or rind covering the brain. And then all the

428
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:35,400
wiring coming out from that cortex, uh, goes to deep structures. Uh, and our, our cortex is much

429
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,640
more advanced. The fish don't really have something like that, but they've got the deeper structures.

430
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:49,080
They've got the interchanges and the movement control and the, the, uh, uh, arousal systems

431
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,200
and the sleep systems and, and there are structures deep in the brain, like the hypothalamus that

432
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:02,360
govern all the primary needs of, of salt balance and, uh, avoiding danger and mating and sleeping,

433
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,840
thermoregulation. These deep structures are common to every vertebrate. We have a hypothalamus.

434
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,040
The fish has a hypothalamus. These deep structures are shared and ancestral among all vertebrates.

435
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,680
And so you've got this, you've got these deeper structures that are, that are conserved and

436
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:25,160
ancient. And you've got this, uh, in, in us, we've got this surface structure that is, uh, incredibly

437
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,080
elaborated in, in our lineage and, and, uh, is responsible for some of the most complex and, and,

438
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,640
and mysterious things we do. And, and, but the great thing is, and mice sort of sit somewhere in

439
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,240
between. They have the cortex, uh, that we have, and it's amazingly similar. It's got the same six

440
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,560
layers. It's got the same kinds of neurons that are connected in the same way. It's just much smaller,

441
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,760
than what we have. And so by looking at the fish and the mice and ourselves, uh, we can piece together

442
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,600
a lot by studying the cells and the connections that make things happen. And, and that's the

443
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:07,080
context that we come to as a neuroscientist. And what about this, this first layer, the brain stem,

444
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,360
this kind of most primordial layer that handles so many of these functions when we're not even

445
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,200
thinking about it, like, like breathing. I mean, what, how conserved is that across all of these

446
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:25,400
models? Yeah. The brainstem is, is highly, highly conserved the, you know, in the brainstem and in

447
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:33,320
the midbrain we have clusters of neurons, uh, like the dopamine neurons and the serotonin neurons

448
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:41,720
and the noradrenaline or norepinephrine neurons. They're all, uh, clustered there in the brainstem

449
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:53,480
in and around, uh, other cells that govern, uh, the movement of the, uh, muscles of the face and the

450
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,840
neck and that send information down like the vagus nerve that we talked about, send information

451
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,440
down to the rest of the body. These basic structures in the brainstem are, are highly conserved.

452
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,680
Fish and mice and human beings, uh, all have them. There's a little bit of different

453
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:15,400
shaping and arrangement, but it's basically the same logic. And are there neurons as the way you

454
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,200
describe it, it sounds like a neuron might have mostly just serotonin. So when that neuron fires

455
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,080
at the end of its synapse, serotonin is the only chemical that comes out. Is that, is that the case

456
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,080
for neurons that each one only can emit one neurochemical? So it's a largely binary signal

457
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:40,040
or are there any neurons that can secrete more than one neurotransmitter? A relatively recent

458
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,240
understanding has been that there are multiple neurotransmitters that can be released by the

459
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,160
same neuron. We still refer, for example, to the dopamine neurons as dopamine neurons because

460
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,480
that's what that's, that's what makes them special. That's what they can do that other neurons can't

461
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,600
do. But what we've discovered recently, what the field has discovered recently is that dopamine

462
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:06,920
neurons, some of them also release another neurotransmitter called glutamate, which is

463
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,240
an excitatory neurotransmitter. It stimulates the downstream cells. Other dopamine neurons can release

464
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,960
a different one called GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It shuts down

465
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,240
the cell that's receiving the signal. So there's actually a great deal of complexity and that's

466
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,080
not all. There are also other things that can be released at the same time, things we call

467
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:33,640
neuropeptides. And there's a lot of complexity on the other side of the synapse too. Different cells

468
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,280
have different receptors for the different chemicals that can do totally different things.

469
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:44,920
You can have a receptor for glutamate that makes excitation happen, or you can have another receptor

470
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,880
for glutamate that doesn't do that, but makes a longer pattern of modulation happen. That's not

471
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,840
even a direct excitation. So that's just a, just a flavor of the complexity. But broadly speaking,

472
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,320
you'll see us still refer to things like dopamine and serotonin neurons, because that's the first

473
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:11,880
level of complexity. So prior to the work that we're going to get into here, what tools existed

474
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:20,280
to really try to establish causality between the stimulation of one region of the brain

475
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:31,000
and some sort of response, be it a phenotype or an impulse, or I mean, was there ever any way to

476
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,280
imagine how one part of the hypothalamus was responsible for a type of thought or emotion? I

477
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,080
mean, how was that probed? Yeah, this was a big challenge that neuroscience faced, which is

478
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:53,160
finding out what actually matters for function. And what we did have, we had ways of listening in,

479
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:01,240
we had ways of putting in electrodes to listen, to pick up electrical patterns of activity. You

480
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,680
can put an electrode in the cortex or in the hypothalamus or in the brainstem, and you can

481
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,880
pick up the chatter of neurons as these little electrical impulses go by. And you could use the

482
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,480
same electrode, you could also stimulate, you could send current in through this wire effectively that

483
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:25,480
you that you've placed. And yeah, that has an effect. And so you can make things happen by

484
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,000
just sending current into the brain. And at some level, though, this is just a scaled down version

485
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,440
of the electroconvulsive therapy we talked about, which is also just current being put into the brain

486
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:43,320
causes things to happen. But there's no cell specificity, every single neuron in the brain is

487
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:51,320
electrical. And all parts of every neuron are electrical, not just the cell body itself that

488
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:58,040
has the DNA in it, but also every part of the axon, every part of the dendrite, all electrical. And so

489
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,400
if you send in current to a spot in the brain, even with a tiny electrode, you're affecting every

490
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,800
single cell near the electrode. And not just that, every little bit of wiring that happens to be going

491
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,520
through there. So there's no cell type specificity because every cell is electrical. And that's still

492
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:22,520
though, there's work you can do. And so you can you could stimulate a region of the brain and see

493
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:29,480
if that causes something to happen in the animal. And there was a great deal of really foundational

494
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,960
work in neuroscience going around and stimulating different parts of the brain. It was discovered

495
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,200
that if you put an electrode in the parts of the brain where dopamine neurons live and where the

496
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:48,760
axons come out, that rodents will really work hard for that. They like that, it seems. We can infer

497
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:55,640
that because they will press a lever thousands of times a day to get a burst of electricity to the

498
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:02,760
dopamine neurons. And so that little clues like that are built up over time. But then there was

499
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,440
always complexity as we dove deeper into it. We realized, wait, this is not just the dopamine

500
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,160
neurons. In this region of the brain, there are a lot of other cells and connections. So is it

501
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,920
really the dopamine neurons? It's this region, but what really are the cells? And so there was a lot of

502
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:25,080
uncertainty in the field as to which cells were actually doing what. And so we had that. But then

503
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:32,520
there was not a good way to turn things off also. And so in science, we like to add things and see

504
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,040
what happens. And that's testing whether something is sufficient to cause an effect. And we like

505
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:44,280
doing that. That tells you something. But then we also like to take away something of interest. And

506
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,560
we can see what is lost with that. And that's called, that's testing the necessity of something.

507
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,960
How much is that needed? And so we would we would have liked to turn off cells and say, okay,

508
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,440
now what's different in the animal and their behavior? And there was not a great way of doing

509
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:06,360
that. Crude ways, if you stimulate really hard with an electrode, you could effectively exhaust

510
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,640
the cells and make them not fire anymore. And that was sort of the state of the art,

511
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,720
both clinically and research wise, in trying to create a local inhibition. But again, not cell

512
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,040
type specific at all, because all the cells are electrical. And that's the kind of situation

513
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,720
situation that we found ourselves in. Not too different clinically or basic, you know,

514
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:37,000
no cell type specificity. So do you remember where you were, what you were doing the very first time

515
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,880
you learned what a channel opsin was? So this is an interesting thread that the there are these

516
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:54,280
plants that make and small plants, in fact, single celled plants that make channel

517
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:01,720
red opsins. These are single proteins that live in the that are placed in the in the surface

518
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:08,760
membrane of cells, but microbial cells, not not in our cells in in algae, single celled algae.

519
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:17,160
And related molecules are present in ancient forms of bacteria. And these these have been known to

520
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:25,560
exist for years. And and this class of protein is really interesting because they're light activated

521
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:36,600
electricity generators. These are single bits of biology, single biomolecules that do an amazing

522
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:46,120
job. They receive a photon of light and they move charged particles ions across the surface of the

523
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:52,840
cell. Now, there's a huge family of these, these are called the microbial opsins and a subfamily

524
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,880
of them is called the channel red opsins. Now, what's amazing is that these proteins were known

525
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:05,000
broadly in biology, in biochemistry for decades. They've been discovered in 1971

526
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:14,120
by Dieter Osterhelt and Walter Stakinius, who are at UCSF. And this was part of the training of

527
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,840
biochemist biologists in in Lubert Streier's beautiful biochemistry textbook. There's a page

528
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,560
on the bacteria red opsins and there's a this was that's that's where I learned about it.

529
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:32,120
You know, these these proteins, they have a photo cycle, it's called they have a

530
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,320
choreography of movements of the protein after the photon hits that lead to an ion,

531
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:46,840
a charged particle moving across the membrane of the cell. So this, but so this was, you know,

532
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,080
a class of proteins that was was well known. And, and it turned out that these microbial

533
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,440
opsins turned out to be the key for for optogenetics, the technology we developed

534
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,800
that brought this cell type specific causality that made it possible.

535
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,520
I want to understand this a bit more, Carl. How? Because so it sounds like, okay, because

536
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,680
I also had Lubert Streier as a professor, I have his textbook, it's one of the few textbooks I've

537
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,040
still kept. First of all, I don't remember that. So I mean, like, that might be a page in that book,

538
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,760
but I was not paying attention during that lecture. So it's it sounds to me like you knew

539
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:34,680
about these even back in medical school. When did the idea come to you that said, wait a minute,

540
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:48,200
I can now genetically insert these things into neurons and effectively put a digital switch

541
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:56,440
into a single neuron? How and when did that idea cross your mind? Yeah. So there was a coalition of

542
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:04,360
a coalescence of different threads that happened that were partly plausibility threads. And, and

543
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:11,240
if you look at this historically, anybody in theory could have thought about this and tried this

544
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,120
in, you know, in the late 80s or all through the 90s, these genes were known.

545
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,720
Somebody could have put them into neurons and tried this, but it wasn't technically plausible

546
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,920
for many reasons. They were not until the 90s and particularly the late 90s, they were not good ways

547
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,640
of introducing genes into neurons. Neurons are a little bit tricky. They're very finicky and

548
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:40,760
sensitive. And, and I knew this because this was, you know, this was a theme in my PhD work and

549
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:47,400
also in my postdoc work, you know, can we, how can we get genes into neurons even in a cultured

550
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:53,480
neuron preparation? It's not easy. And so that was, that was certainly part of it, part of why,

551
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:01,400
I mean, why nobody had had tried this before. But in the late 90s, that started to change. And,

552
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,720
and I did an experiment introducing genes into, into neurons as part of my postdoctoral work in

553
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,400
the Malenka lab that was in. And so this was something I was, I was good at. I'd, I'd develop

554
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,880
the viral tools and the ways of introducing genes in that were, that were plausible.

555
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,880
Tell folks a little bit about how that works. Yeah. We're obviously, you know, these days,

556
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,880
I think even the lay person is somewhat familiar with genetic modifications. People have some sense

557
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,640
of how these have even been used to help develop vaccines and things like that. But let's start

558
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,840
from a place, assuming people don't even really know the difference between DNA and RNA and just

559
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:47,240
explain how you could use this thing called a virus to do your bidding with respect to the

560
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:55,240
insertion of a foreign gene. So this is, and this is by no means a minor thing. In some ways,

561
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,360
this is, this is the whole ball of wax, as we say. How do you get a gene into a neuron in a,

562
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,400
in a specific way? So this is the technological aspect of this in some ways is everything. And

563
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,280
so it's definitely worth the time to talk about this. You know, how do you, how do you do it? Well,

564
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:19,400
so DNA is, is the instruction manual for making proteins, things like proteins,

565
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:28,680
biomolecules that have a job. Each gene is a bit of DNA. It might be a sequence of what we call

566
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:33,560
nucleotides. They have A, G, C, and T. There's four kinds of them and they come in different

567
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,800
sequences. And by the order in which these nucleotides appear, that is a code, that's the

568
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,800
genetic code that dictates which protein will be made, a biomolecule that, that has a particular

569
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,120
structure and a job that comes from its structure, like being in a channel or something in the

570
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:58,680
surface of a, of a cell that receives a photon and lets charged particles go across. That's the protein.

571
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:05,240
The instructions for making it are encoded in the DNA in the gene. And so that, so how do you get that,

572
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:12,360
that gene into a cell? Well, it's not so easy. You know, these days, particularly with the

573
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:19,400
coronavirus pandemic, I think the general public is, is much more aware now of how this can be done.

574
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:28,760
Viruses, and there are many kinds of viruses, they are little bits of biology that basically

575
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:36,520
exist to get DNA and RNA into cells. And so they have a little bit of this genetic code material,

576
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:43,960
DNA or RNA, and they have that encased in a coating that might have some lipids or fats

577
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:53,640
and some proteins. And then that floats through, liquid floats through the air, hits a cell,

578
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:02,680
and fuses with the cell, gets the DNA or the RNA into the cell. And then that triggers the

579
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:10,200
creation of new virus particles. And that's how the virus spreads. So viruses are professional

580
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,360
introducers of genetic material in the cells. They are extremely good at that. They are evolved

581
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:22,840
for that. And this, this DNA, RNA distinction is interesting. Some viruses work with DNA.

582
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:29,240
Some are RNA. What is RNA? This is also something that the coronavirus pandemic has brought to the

583
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:37,160
public's attention very recently. That's the step in between DNA and protein. It turns out,

584
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,400
for various reasons, it's useful to have an intermediate step. First, the DNA gets turned

585
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,640
into RNA, very similar structure, but then that gets turned into the protein. Some viruses work

586
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:55,000
with DNA, some are RNA. So this, it turns out, is then very useful for the biologists because

587
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,920
if you want to get a gene into a cell, and in my case, suppose you want to get a gene for making a

588
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,840
light activated channel, if you want to get that into a cell, how do you do it? Well, you get the

589
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,800
DNA into the cell. And what's the best way to do that? Well, use a virus. And there are viruses

590
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:23,240
that are dangerous and lethal, but there are also safer, weaker viruses. And then there are

591
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:32,200
modified versions, even of those, that virologists have engineered to be extremely safe, to have

592
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,720
lost the ability to propagate from one cell to another, but can do that first step, can

593
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:44,280
bring DNA into one set of cells, and then the life cycle, if you will, stops at that point.

594
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:51,800
And those are the viruses that I had experience with from my postdoctoral work,

595
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:59,480
safe modified viruses that can be used to shuttle bits of DNA into cells. And so that's the core

596
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,760
technology. And again, this was a relatively recent thing, and particularly for neurons,

597
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,000
a relatively recent thing. The technology for doing that was not so clear in the past.

598
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:21,320
The other thing that I want to point out is that there were many people who were thinking about

599
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:27,960
this and trying this. And we did, from my lab, publish the first paper that used a microbial

600
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:35,400
opsin to get light sensitivity, but it was, as it turned out, quite a close call. We published

601
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:45,080
the paper from my lab in 2005, and that came out in the summer of 2005. Within six months,

602
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,440
several other papers came out. They all were submitted right after ours was published,

603
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,560
and so clearly many people had been thinking about this. They saw our paper came out,

604
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:05,080
and then rushed to submit theirs. And these were big time labs, people who were very respected

605
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:14,120
and thoughtful, including, this is something I didn't know, but the brother of my PhD

606
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,200
advisor. My PhD advisor was Dick Chen, his brother Roger Chen was a Nobel laureate

607
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:27,480
for his work with green fluorescent protein. It turned out he was also working on this as well.

608
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,880
I talked in my great length about this. Of course, he did okay. He got a Nobel prize

609
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,160
for other work, but all this was going on before his Nobel prize. And so he was quite,

610
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:46,120
I think, frustrated that he wasn't able to get to this moment as quickly. So it was a

611
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:53,960
sort of a broad awareness in the field that the technology was now available. We could introduce

612
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:00,920
genes into neurons, that these microbial opsins existed. People had wanted to get cell type

613
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:12,120
specificity for a long time with neurostimulation. Francis Crick of DNA double helix fame had been

614
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:18,360
calling for this sort of technology for years. In fact, in 1999, he'd even suggested that not only

615
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:24,840
did we need a way in neuroscience to control individual cells, individual cell types, but he

616
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,480
said maybe light would be a good way of doing it. He didn't have an idea of how to do it, but he said,

617
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,760
light would have some good properties. It would be fast, it would be relatively noninvasive, photons

618
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,600
could scatter through tissue, and most neurons don't respond to light at baseline, unlike

619
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:47,960
electricity. And so it would be a way of getting great specificity. So there was a broad awareness

620
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,040
that this kind of thing suddenly might be possible. I have two unrelated questions, Carl, about this.

621
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:02,360
The first is, when you introduce the virus, is it one virus that can introduce the gene to one

622
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:08,520
neuron and that's it? He said there's no replication capacity of the virus. So does that mean that the

623
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:15,240
dose of the virus you give determines how many cells will pick up the channel?

624
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:24,760
That's correct. So you can give a very high concentration of viral particles and that will

625
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:30,200
mean that you get more cells. Also, you'll get more copies per cell. You can have multiple

626
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:38,520
viral particles infecting the same cell and that is actually very important. Another big issue with

627
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:46,600
these microbial options is they generate tiny currents. They're not as professional at generating

628
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,800
huge currents as mammalian ion channels are, which was a big reason why I think a lot of people didn't

629
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,640
rush to this as well. People looked at those current sizes and said, this is not going to

630
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:05,880
work. Most existing methods of introducing genes gave you maybe one to seven copy numbers of the

631
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:12,440
gene, as we say. So not enough to control a neuron and that was a huge issue. But with the viral

632
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:19,880
technologies, you could get hundreds or more copies of the gene per cell and you could get

633
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,320
much bigger currents with these microbial options. So then again, my experience with the viral tools

634
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:33,960
was critical. Just give us a sense of the current. So when you talk about a normal mammalian neuron,

635
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,640
how many do we measure these in picoamps, nanoamps? Yeah, picoamps and nanoamps are exactly right.

636
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:48,840
So an action potential is how many picoamps? Yeah. So a couple of ways we can look at it. So the

637
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:58,760
action potential, this is this blip of electricity that propagates through down the axon of a neuron.

638
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:09,000
It can be triggered by signals that are in the order of 100 to 200 picoamps. And then it becomes

639
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,240
a voltage impulse that's about 100 millivolts and that propagates down the cell. So if you're in the

640
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:24,440
hundreds of picoamp range, you're in business for controlling neurons. A single option is capable of

641
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:31,640
what? Vastly less than that. And so a couple issues come up. So first of all, what we

642
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:40,760
found is that if you don't have a high copy number, the currents that you're generating are

643
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:49,080
on the single or less picoamp level. We haven't done, because the currents are so small,

644
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:54,680
you typically don't even do the experiment you're asking, the single channel current

645
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:00,200
measurements. Since then, out of scientific curiosity, we and others have looked at the

646
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,800
currents that are generated and they're extraordinarily small. We only get

647
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:16,440
to the hundreds of picoamp level by probably expressing 100,000 to a million opsins per cell.

648
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,280
So this was the key issue. There was many orders of magnitude, as we say,

649
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,120
several factors of 10 away from where we needed to be with these opsins, unless there was a way

650
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,520
of introducing many genes and getting very robust, safe expression.

651
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,680
How do you introduce the virus? So let's just say we're talking about a mouse here,

652
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:51,480
and you decide you want to test in this particular region of the Pons. So a part of the brainstem,

653
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:59,160
you want to exactly get it there. How do you direct the virus to exactly the cell you want

654
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:05,480
to get this specificity? So this is the other technological challenge that had to be faced.

655
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:13,080
It was not obvious how this would be done. Where would the specificity come from? Yes,

656
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:22,120
none of the cells respond to light. Yes, maybe we could add a gene that makes the cells respond to

657
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:27,880
light. But wait, hang on a minute. Where's the specificity going to come from? How do we get

658
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:35,080
this gene only into the cells we're interested in? Well, all right, what could you do? You could

659
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:42,120
concentrate the virus and do a very focal injection into, let's say, the Pons. And so

660
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,800
you could create a little hotspot of virus, and then that virus would get into all the cells

661
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:58,280
that are in and around that spot in the Pons. And that's good. That gives you some spatial

662
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,520
specificity. You're now at a spot. And that is already a big leap beyond the electrode,

663
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:13,320
because the electrode and the virus both so far and how I've described them are not cell type

664
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:20,680
specific. But the electrode is going to be stimulating all the axons that happen to be

665
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:28,200
going by. If you do a viral injection at one spot, viruses are not very good at getting into axons.

666
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:33,720
They're just going to get the cells, the little spherical cell bodies that live in that region.

667
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,480
And so right away, that gives you some specificity. You're getting less of the

668
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:44,840
cross-streams of activity being stimulated. But it's not enough, because even if you're just

669
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,160
getting the cells, the cell bodies there, there are many different kinds. There are the dopamine

670
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,960
cells, but right next to them, there are the GABA cells, and next to them are the glutamate cells,

671
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,200
and they're all jumbled up together. And there, you're not too different from the electrode.

672
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,840
Now, if you put in light, you're still going to be stimulating all these cells. And so what you need

673
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:12,760
is a way to make the production of the opsin cell type specific. Okay, so how are you going to

674
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,000
do that? Well, the virus, there were many possibilities we could think about. And this

675
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,720
probably, till we really solved optogenetics, probably took till 2009, because this was the

676
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:30,360
critical issue. How do you get a versatile, generalizable way of targeting specific cell

677
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:36,040
types? And back in 2004, 2005, there were some possibilities that we and others could imagine.

678
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:43,800
You could try to imagine engineering the virus capsid, this coating of the virus that has

679
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:49,080
proteins on it. There were theoretical ways and even possible practical ways of engineering

680
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,400
capsid proteins so that they would only target one kind of cell, because that kind of cell had

681
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,640
something else on its surface, and maybe we could create some kind of lock and key mechanism.

682
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:05,640
Yeah, so just like a coronavirus, its lock and key basically works through the ACE2 receptor.

683
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:13,640
If you knew what a potential surface protein or receptor was on the dopaminergic neuron,

684
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,520
that could be your entry. That would have been the first thought that would have come to my

685
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:23,400
naive mind. Yeah, and that was plausible. It could work. It had some

686
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:30,760
drawbacks, which are that you'd have to... First of all, we didn't have that richness of

687
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,360
understanding. It wasn't as if there was some lookup table. Okay, dopamine neuron has this,

688
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,560
but then make put this on that. That didn't exist and still doesn't honestly. So it was more just,

689
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,800
okay, there's going to be a lot of work. Every time you want to target a particular cell type,

690
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,120
you're going to have to now do some deep dive into all the proteins it expresses,

691
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,680
and also all the cells that are nearby that you don't want to target and make sure...

692
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,640
You're not crossing them.

693
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,760
...whatever your strategy is, is not giving you some cross activity. And so we initially

694
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:07,560
plausible, and then as you start to think about it more, you're like, oh, this is never going to be

695
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:14,120
versatile, generalizable, practical, and indeed it still isn't today. So that wasn't it.

696
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:25,160
Now, another strategy is that is working with DNA. Each gene, each bit of DNA in chromosomes,

697
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:34,040
in genomes, has this code for the protein, but also near it, it's got another bit of DNA

698
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:42,600
that's called a promoter or an enhancer. And this is a bit of DNA that doesn't code for a protein.

699
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:51,320
What it does is it attracts what are called transcription factors, things that decide

700
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,120
whether that bit of DNA gets turned into RNA and then into protein. They, by changing the structure,

701
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:04,200
by changing things around the gene, they determine whether this gene is expressed at all. It could

702
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:09,800
sit there quiet and not make the RNA and the protein, or it could be active, make the RNA

703
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:16,360
and the protein. Turns out that is critical because that was a path forward. We could work with

704
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:25,000
the bits of DNA near genes, promoters and enhancers. This gave us some leverage, not all

705
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,360
of it, but some of the leverage. And if you think about this, well, think about a dopamine neuron

706
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,600
again. So what is a dopamine neuron? Well, it makes dopamine and it releases dopamine. Okay,

707
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,000
now how does it make dopamine? Well, it's got its own biomolecules that make dopamine. It's got

708
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:49,080
enzymes that turn other precursor chemicals into dopamine. Now those enzymes are made

709
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,880
chiefly in dopamine neurons. And why are they only made in dopamine neurons and not in your

710
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,320
big toe neuron? Well, it's because... Or more importantly, not in the serotonergic

711
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:04,520
neuron right next door. I mean, that's the key insight is you exploit the promoters

712
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,880
that are making unique enzymes to a particular neurotransmitter.

713
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,320
Exactly right. And so it turns out each cell type is defined by its job,

714
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:23,480
just as in many cases we are defined by our jobs. And this is a critical thing because

715
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:32,600
a professional dopamine producing cell is going to have by its dopamine enzyme encoding genes,

716
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:39,640
it's going to have promoters or enhancers that dictate in this cell type, this gene will be

717
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:44,520
active. And so what we did was we said, okay, let's see which of those bits of DNA, those

718
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:51,320
promoters and enhancers can we borrow from, let's say, the tyrosine hydroxylase gene. This is a

719
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,040
gene that helps make dopamine. We could go take a little bit of its promoter and we could put that

720
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,720
in front of the channel rhodopsin gene, package that whole thing up into virus infect cells. Okay,

721
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:07,000
now you inject- You could almost administer it systemically at this point and it's going to

722
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,480
go exactly where it is a very elegant solution, Carl. Yeah. And in fact, the systemic thing now

723
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:18,040
in some ways is done in some settings. It's more costly actually because you have to use a much

724
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,680
higher load. Make a lot more virus. And actually the focal injection gives us other advantages.

725
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:28,520
So we still actually prefer the focal injection, but you're right that the specificity is now

726
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,560
in large part taken care of by the promoter. And so you can inject that in. The virus gets into

727
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,680
all the cells, the serotonergic cells and the dopaminergic cells, but the gene is only expressed

728
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,800
and the opsin is only made in the dopamine cells as a result of it. So I have another technical

729
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,960
question, Carl. So let's go back to your garden variety cold causing adenovirus, right? So

730
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,080
you're out and about in the park or you're on an airplane and you happen to catch this cold from

731
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:02,280
you happen to catch this cold from somebody. That adenovirus is going to go and it's going to infect

732
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:08,600
the epithelial cells lining your trachea, probably get into your lung or something like that.

733
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,240
It's going to incorporate its genetic material into your machinery, which will then make its

734
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:21,560
proteins. That's how it replicates. And of course, the immune system is very good at recognizing this

735
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:29,000
because it's either going to put soluble antibodies to antigens on the surface or if it's

736
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,960
done through class one and class two, the T cell system is going to come and through antigen

737
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:40,440
presentation will recognize foreign antigens being presented on the surface of a cell. So in other

738
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,080
words, the host cell, your cell will hold up its little hand and say, look, I've got this little

739
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:52,520
protein in me. It's the T cell will come and destroy that cell. How do you prevent the immune

740
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:59,880
system from standing by watching you do all of this very elegant genetic engineering and then

741
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,760
just coming along and big footing you because it says, wait a minute, that channel options not

742
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:10,520
supposed to be here. Are you just getting lucky that it's not being presented on the MHC class

743
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,000
one or class two as a peptide or meaning pieces of it because obviously it would be much larger

744
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,320
than a nine to eight amino acid peptide. But yep. This is a great question. This was another

745
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:29,000
energy barrier to tackling the strategy. Everybody thought and rightly so this is a

746
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,040
potential concern, right? The immune system is going to attack the cells making this foreign

747
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:40,920
protein and kill them. Well, a couple of things helped us here. One is that we were working in

748
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:48,200
the brain and as you know, the brain is what we call an immune privileged organ. The T cells and

749
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:56,760
B cells that patrol our bodies don't have free access to the brain. They're kept out and that's

750
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:02,840
pretty interesting situation. Why is that? A lot of interesting evolutionary speculations to that,

751
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:10,680
but it's a fact and so they can't get in. Without that, no doubt things along the lines of what

752
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:14,760
you're saying would be relevant. We've actually even recently explored this sort of thing.

753
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:24,440
People have been interested in peripheral, not central, peripheral optogenetics and it works,

754
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,840
but people see loss of the expression and the cells expressing the

755
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,600
options over time, over months and the immune response is certainly part of that. But in the

756
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:40,520
brain, that doesn't happen. That's a great question and here we definitely leverage the immune

757
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:46,360
privilege. This was very helpful, Carl. I think maybe for the listener they thought,

758
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:51,080
boy, these guys want to do a lot of detail here, but I think this was really important because

759
01:19:51,960 --> 01:20:00,680
I think only now can we understand the magnitude of A, what you and your team accomplished in what

760
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:07,320
scientifically is considered a nanosecond. I mean, in four years that you were able to do everything

761
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:16,840
you just said and now we're in 2009, 2010, you have the capacity to introduce these options

762
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:25,880
to very specific cells such that you could say two neurons, which are different, I can put this

763
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:33,320
gene into one and not the other. This is unparalleled. You now have this capacity

764
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:42,440
to use photons to turn neurons on and off with precision that could never be achieved anatomically

765
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:50,280
under anatomic resolution. That's right. So what was the first question you sought to ask

766
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:56,200
using this technology from a neurobiology and neurochemical standpoint? Well,

767
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:03,800
we've talked about dopamine a lot and in 2009 there was an experiment that I and the whole

768
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:10,760
field had wanted to know, which really is, is it the dopamine neurons? Is their activity what

769
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:17,560
what animals are getting from this stimulation of that region or is it something else, some other

770
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,760
cell type that's nearby? Is it the GABAergic or the serotonergic cells that we know are right nearby?

771
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:31,720
And in 2009 we did that experiment. So we introduced a channel retopsin, an excitatory

772
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:39,320
channel retopsin just into the dopamine neurons of this spot in the midbrain that's called the

773
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:44,680
ventral tegmental area or VTA. It's got all these other kinds of cells, but that's where the dopamine

774
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:51,160
neurons also live. And we used a souped up form of the promoter strategy I just told you about

775
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,640
to get the gene into the dopamine neurons. And we asked a very simple question.

776
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:04,600
If you have a mouse and you give it a two room house to live in, it's a very simple house,

777
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,200
two rooms, I can go back and forth from one room to the other. So kind of just like a New York

778
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:19,080
apartment. Yeah, on a good day. Yeah. Then what if you turned on the laser light, the light that

779
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:26,680
activated the channel retopsins on the dopamine neurons, but you did that only when the animal

780
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:34,440
was in one room and not the other room. And what we found is that if you did that, the animals

781
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:44,360
preferred to be in the room where the laser light had been applied compared to the other room,

782
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:49,000
which was equivalent in every other way. So this would be the analogy just to,

783
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,080
sorry to interrupt, but just to make a really crude scenario. You could have done this experiment

784
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:01,560
a hundred years ago if you said, I'm going to put sugar water in one room and not in the other.

785
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,520
Is there a preference that the animal has for it? Presumably it would always want to go to the room

786
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,880
with sugar water or cocaine or something pleasurable, but yet here you were able to do

787
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:18,920
that without anything other than the excitation of a particular neuron. Exactly right. And in fact,

788
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:23,640
this test is an old test. It's called the conditioned place preference test. And yeah,

789
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:31,240
it's a animal now prefers a place. And it's because of the conditioning is how it was done

790
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:38,280
classically. Just as you're saying, you would pair something good like cocaine or sugar or

791
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:43,080
food or a social interaction, a mate, something like that. And you would see later that the

792
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:49,160
mouse would choose to spend time in there revealing to us by its behavior that this

793
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:54,840
thing was positive in value to it. And you can do the flip side too. You can do a negative thing.

794
01:23:55,400 --> 01:24:00,040
You can make it feel mildly nauseous. You can give it lithium, which we give to patients too

795
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:06,680
in one side effect. You can have as mild nausea. You can give a mouse mild nausea that way,

796
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:11,400
but only in one room and then it'll avoid that that room. And that's conditioned place aversion.

797
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:18,280
So the animal can report to us the sign, if you will, the valence positive or negative of its

798
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:23,080
experience by where it chooses to spend time. And that's incredibly valuable. This harkens back to

799
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:31,000
my very first wanting to be a neurosurgeon because a human being could tell me what they were

800
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,200
feeling. Well, of course, a human being is more eloquent, but behaviorally a mouse can report

801
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:41,240
whether it's something as a positive or negative value to it.

802
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:47,640
And that test, Carl, when you're looking for the positive valence, what's the frequency with which

803
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,560
you would expect that to be the case? I mean, presumably it's more than 5149 in favor of the

804
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,520
dopamine firing. Just give us a sense of if you ran that experiment a hundred or you ran a simulation

805
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:06,200
of that experiment a hundred times and you always fired the dopaminergic neuron with your opsin,

806
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,320
how many times out of a hundred would it go to the positively valence side?

807
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,440
We try to keep things in. You can make this as extreme as you want.

808
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:25,000
So the answer is a bit flexible, but with typical rewards, with sugar water, with a social

809
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:32,600
interaction, the number you're looking for is sort of 70, 30, or 80, 20. That's kind of the level to

810
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:38,760
which the mouse will prefer one chamber versus another, one room versus another in terms of how

811
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:45,320
it devotes its time. But you can actually, you can make that, you can push those numbers,

812
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:52,520
both optogenetically using light or with stimuli up or down by making the experience more extreme.

813
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:59,240
It's quite a flexible test. And we had later versions of this, you know, that in some ways,

814
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:05,240
the animal's expressing its subjective sense, we think, by where it's choosing to spend time.

815
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,480
You can also make a more souped up version of that test where the animal actually has to work

816
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:17,560
to get the light by pressing a lever or poking its nose in a little hole, a nose poke, and

817
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:25,720
trigger a pulse of light by each of its actions. So this is a slightly more advanced version where

818
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:32,840
you say, how hard will you work for light? How hard will you work for a precisely defined

819
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:39,560
set of activity in your precisely defined dopamine neurons? And if you deliver

820
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:46,920
light, you can get an animal to press a lever thousands of times a day to get that light.

821
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:56,600
And so now there is no doubt that the activity of dopamine neurons in this way is positive.

822
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,720
And it's not just positive, it can be extremely positive. Animals will work very, very hard to

823
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:10,280
get it. It's just amazing that this could be done. Let's keep going. I can only imagine how

824
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,480
excited you and your colleagues were by this finding. And of course, it probably only

825
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:20,440
whets your appetite for the breadth of questions that you now want to ask.

826
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:30,520
Where was the clinical community in recognizing the value of this tool? So you have all of these

827
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:39,320
questions that have for, I think it's safe to say, thousands of years been, in other words,

828
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:45,240
even before the codification of medicine as we know it today, we've always wondered things

829
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:52,360
like what regulates mood? How can two people anatomically be nearly identical and yet one be

830
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:59,800
happy and one be sad? Where do memories reside? What is a memory? What is a feeling? What is a

831
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:05,960
thought? All of these things. And yet I suspect that this experiment, as simple as it was,

832
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:13,960
for the first time gave you a profound sense of optimism that you now have a tool finally

833
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:21,080
to ask questions. So you're splitting your time here, right? You're still an on the ward

834
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:27,320
psychiatrist. So on the one hand, you're doing kind of the most cutting edge science in the

835
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:34,200
field. And at the other end, you're still trying to help people who are bringing these questions

836
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:39,000
to your mind. How many of your colleagues in psychiatry, not necessarily your direct colleagues

837
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,640
at Stanford, but just, I mean, the community more broadly, how appreciated was this tool

838
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:53,480
10 years ago? It's actually very interesting that you ask that the appreciation in the

839
01:28:54,440 --> 01:29:01,320
scientific psychiatry realm, and these are clinicians, psychiatrists who also have

840
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:08,040
some interest in the science side. The appreciation was very quick and immediate

841
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:19,160
because I think the psychiatrists know and knew better than anyone else how much specificity was

842
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:25,240
needed and wanted in their field. And I had, this was, by the time we got to 2009,

843
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:30,440
the generality of that targeting method was key because then people knew, okay,

844
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:36,120
this wasn't just a parlor trick, a one-off, a demonstration that you could get some kind of

845
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:42,600
photosensitivity in one cell once, that this was actually a generalizable versatile method. You

846
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:51,240
could apply this principle to any cell type. It was done in freely moving mammals and mice,

847
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:59,720
of course, having our same brain structures, our cortex, our hypothalamus, and everything in between

848
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:08,520
the. The significance and the opportunity was pretty clear to everyone by 2009,

849
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:16,440
particularly the psychiatrists. And so then there was a lot of a great deal of interest,

850
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,480
and because the technique was generalizable, it was very widely adopted. And we sent the

851
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:29,080
clones, the bits of DNA to thousands of labs around the world and many thousands of discoveries

852
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:34,680
were made by other labs, which was great after that, really showing that anybody could use it

853
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:41,400
to tackle any question, any disease, any symptom in diverse animals. So after 2009,

854
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:49,800
it was off and running. Between 04 and 09 though, those were hard times because we were still

855
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,640
putting the pieces together, solving the light delivery, solving the virus issues, getting the

856
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:59,560
cell type targeting to be generalizable and versatile. And I would say it wasn't really until

857
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:05,720
2009 that we could look at this and say, yeah, we've done it at this point.

858
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,720
Was this work funded by NIH?

859
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:14,440
Yeah. So early on, I had some initial trouble getting grants, but then pretty quickly,

860
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:23,080
once the opportunity became clear, both the National Institute of Mental Health and the

861
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:30,280
National Institute on Drug Abuse, two main institutes of the NIH immediately were very

862
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:37,080
supportive. And then later we got a great deal of support from DARPA and from the National Science

863
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:45,480
Foundation. And then also from a number of private donors, people who in many cases came through

864
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:51,560
the psychiatry setting, friends or family members who had suffered from psychiatric disease, and they

865
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:58,280
had heard about what we were doing and wanted to support it. So we ended up getting both federal

866
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:06,840
and nonprofit institutions and private donors and it all came together. But until, really until we

867
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:11,240
had things working in this generalizable way, times were a little bit tough.

868
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:18,040
Well, I mean, it is, again, remarkable now as you sort of look back at it to think that,

869
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:24,360
A, that it all worked out. I mean, there's a hundred steps that this could have failed.

870
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:32,440
And again, I'm still amazed that it really only took four years, although I'm sure there were

871
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,960
times in there it felt like it was taking forever. But I mean, as you know, you're such a historian

872
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:44,200
of science as well. I mean, it is a remarkable period of time. So let's talk about some of the

873
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:49,800
other questions that you wanted to probe with this technology. So what about any of the other

874
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,040
neurotransmitters or neurons in particular? Where did you turn to next?

875
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:03,080
Well, we were particularly interested in harkening back to my, what got me into psychiatry in the

876
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:12,760
first place. I wanted to understand internal states of mammals and how they can go wrong and

877
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:21,000
create symptoms. And if you work with animal subjects, with mice, for example, you have to

878
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,720
figure out what they can report that matters. And one thing they can report very well

879
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:38,600
are these universal things that all mammals experience, anxiety and social interaction

880
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:46,120
and caring for offspring, for young. These are quintessential mammalian

881
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:54,600
states that matter. They can go wrong. And so I wanted to study them and I wanted to study them

882
01:33:54,600 --> 01:34:00,280
in ways that were now precise and causal and had to do with specific cell types.

883
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:07,640
And so one of the first things we did was anxiety. And, you know, as a psychiatrist, I

884
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:16,280
specialize in patients who suffer from depression and also social

885
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:25,480
difficulties, autism spectrum disorders. And a common theme in both autism and in depression,

886
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:33,480
anxiety is a big part of that. Anxiety is not a small thing. Anxiety can be absolutely crushing

887
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:42,920
to one's life, to one's interactions, to occupation, to even being able to go out in the world.

888
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:51,400
This is a very potentially severe disorder in many people. Of course, anxiety, though,

889
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:59,320
is also can exist in a normal healthy range too. And it only becomes a psychiatric disorder

890
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:05,800
when it exceeds that healthy range and verges into or in many people, unfortunately,

891
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:12,200
goes way beyond into a very pathological extreme. How do you define that maladaptive transformation

892
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:19,800
from normal anxiety, which I suppose you could even make the case if a person was incapable

893
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:25,560
of experiencing anxiety, they could probably injure themselves and they might be socially

894
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,720
quite destructive. So in other words, there must be some evolutionary basis for anxiety

895
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:35,560
and self-preservation. But as you point out, I can't imagine anybody listening to this hasn't

896
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:41,000
been personally experienced or hasn't personally experienced or known somebody who has experienced

897
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,120
anxiety that has crossed too far. But I mean, is this something that falls into the DSM-5 where

898
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:52,840
there's an actual criteria? There must be, right? Yes. Yeah. There are. And in fact, it's the

899
01:35:52,840 --> 01:36:02,760
criterion for rising to the level of disorder in the psychiatric literature and in the DSM-5 or

900
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:10,840
diagnostic and statistical manual is that it's only a disorder if there's impairment in what we call

901
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:18,520
social or occupational functioning. So you could have any symptom in psychiatry, even a hallucination,

902
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:25,240
for example, but if it's not impairing your life, your social occupational function, we don't call

903
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:31,320
it a disorder. And in fact, I've had patients who were hallucinating, but it was in a way that was

904
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:36,360
not disrupting their life. I had a blind patient who had visual hallucinations, but he was fine

905
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:41,960
with them. They weren't distressing to him. And so we wouldn't say it's a disorder. It's just

906
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:50,600
something happening. So that's the criterion we use. And of course, it is somewhat flexible

907
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,520
because different people have different social and occupational situations. And this is a challenge

908
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,320
we have in psychiatry, but maintaining that as a criterion is very good because it ensures that we

909
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:06,760
only treat things that need to be treated. So then you think about anxiety. Well, if you can't

910
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:13,080
function, if you can't leave your apartment to go to work, well, that's impairing your occupational

911
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:18,680
functioning. And so there are people who have anxiety easily in that realm or far beyond.

912
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,040
And those are people we want to help. On the flip side, as you point out, there are people who

913
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:31,160
have risk-taking behavior that's extreme because they don't perceive or worry about threat. And

914
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:39,640
that's also a problem. So anxiety, we need to treat it in patients who are severely affected.

915
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:46,760
And the problem is, in anxiety, there are medications that help, but they come with

916
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:54,440
some problems. So the most effective anti-anxiety medications are things that relate to

917
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:00,520
Valium and Xanax and Ativan. As you know, these are medications that work,

918
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:09,000
but they can be addictive. They can cause the human being to adapt to the dose and to make it

919
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,760
very difficult to stop them. And they also can cause... Do we think that they primarily work

920
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:21,880
through their GABA agonism? Is that the primary belief? Yes. So you talked about GABA earlier.

921
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:28,280
This is a relaxing, for lack of a better word, neurotransmitter. This is a non-excitatory.

922
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:32,920
That's right. That's right. And that's exactly how these act. They act, in fact, directly on the GABA

923
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:42,040
receptor and they facilitate its action. And so this is... They work. They just have some problems.

924
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:46,760
And not everybody can tolerate them. They cause some cognitive slowing and sedation and so on.

925
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,840
It's like they have some issues. In which neurons in particular do we think that they're

926
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:57,480
concentrated in their action in. That is a great question. It's subject of a lot of research. If we

927
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:05,000
understood that deeply, then we could make a separate intervention targeted to those cells.

928
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,640
The problem is that we don't yet know that exactly. We don't know exactly which cells are

929
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:17,480
the most anxiety relevant cells that these medications are targeting. There are some hints,

930
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,760
but I would say not factually known yet. But you're getting to this key point where optogenetics

931
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,440
was helpful because then we could ask that and answer that question. We could say, okay, which

932
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:34,200
cells govern the different features of anxiety? And then, now, what am I talking about here with

933
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,160
different features? Well, actually, this is kind of interesting when you think about it. So what

934
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:44,120
is anxiety? Well, it's actually got different parts to it. First of all, there's physiology.

935
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:49,800
We've all been anxious. We know heart beating faster, breathing faster. So there's physiology

936
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:58,840
that changes. Then there's also a behavioral change. When we're anxious, we avoid the risky

937
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:05,960
situation. We have an impulse to avoid. If we're anxious out in the open, we avoid going out in the

938
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:15,080
open. And mice do this too. And then finally, there's a negative quality to it, which may sound

939
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,200
trivial. This is the negative valence. This is the hardest part to put your finger on.

940
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:22,440
This is the hardest part to put your finger on. And it's the most mysterious and...

941
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:26,280
Perhaps the most difficult, meaning perhaps the most difficult to experience.

942
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:33,080
It's the most difficult to experience. And it's also the most difficult to understand why we have

943
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:39,000
this. If we're already avoiding the risky situation, why does nature also have to make us

944
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,400
feel bad? And there are some very interesting evolutionary discussions one can have about that.

945
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:51,240
The fact is, though, that's how it is. Anxiety feels bad. And that's what makes it, in many cases,

946
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:56,680
so clinically, causes so much suffering in addition to the behavioral dysfunction that happens.

947
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,760
So actually, anxiety is complicated. It's got these different parts. And they all come on

948
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:05,000
together, all go away together. And then you've got to ask, okay, these are so different. They're

949
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,800
probably controlled by different cells, right? So you've got behavior, and you've got breathing,

950
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:14,520
and you've got inner subjective sense. These are all very different, probably different

951
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:20,200
cells are doing it. So then right away, you've got to ask, what are we going to target? And so we

952
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:25,480
thought we need to figure out this. And so we used, in 2013, we did an optogenetics experiment

953
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:33,000
that targeted different parts of what we thought could be the anxiety pathway. And we found that,

954
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,400
indeed, different cells control each of these different parts. There's a set of cells that

955
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:45,800
control the breathing changes. And there's another set of cells right nearby that control the

956
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:52,120
behavioral changes, avoiding risky situations. And there's yet a third set of cells that control the

957
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:59,880
negative valence, the internal state. Each cleanly controls a separate feature of anxiety.

958
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,520
And we did this with optogenetics, introducing light sensitivity.

959
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:11,400
And then reproducing each of these completely distinct manifestations of anxiety.

960
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:18,680
Exactly, exactly. So we found we could turn up or down each feature in mice completely separately

961
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:23,400
from the others. We could have animals that, and this got so interesting philosophically,

962
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:32,520
we could make animals avoid the open area, the exposed realm that people and mice, but we don't,

963
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:36,360
many people don't like being out in exposed areas. Mice definitely don't, because that's when they're

964
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:45,960
going to get eaten. We could make mice be much more avoidant of an open space

965
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:53,320
with a specific cell type optogenetic intervention. But the mice didn't care that this was happening.

966
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:59,960
There was no negative balance to it. And this was so interesting that we could create the behavioral

967
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:05,560
avoidance of anxiety without the mice, without the negative feeling, having this negativity.

968
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:11,960
And so that it turns out then that behavioral states that mammals have, they can be cleanly

969
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:17,320
broken apart into these features, and we could show that with optogenetics. That was one of my,

970
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:23,560
one of the papers from that period of time that was most interesting, because it was so

971
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,400
interesting in that regard. And other people, Katherine Dulock, for example, at Harvard has

972
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:33,880
done some great work on parenting another quintessential mammalian state using the same

973
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:40,120
set of techniques, optogenetic techniques that we described. She did this in 2018. Mice are

974
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:45,800
pretty good parents. They take care of their young, mostly. That can break down at times,

975
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:52,280
but they care for their young. And Katherine Dulock's lab did an amazing experiment. They

976
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:59,800
optogenetically found that the different parts of parenting could be broken down into their

977
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:07,880
sub features as well. And the two parts of parenting that were broken down in this way are

978
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:16,440
going out to find the young and bring them back to the nest. So go and get your kids and bring

979
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:21,160
them back home. And anybody who has kids knows that's a big part of being a parent. You got to

980
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:29,400
corral them, get them back to the safe spot. But that part of parenting, the mice do very well.

981
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:36,120
They also care for the young. They groom them. That's an extremely important part, both human

982
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:43,320
and mouse parenting, of course, is grooming the offspring. Turns out there's a parenting

983
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:51,240
controlling area, but the go and get the kids cells are different from the groom the kids'

984
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:56,600
cells. And you can optogenetically break them apart very cleanly and show how this parenting

985
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:02,440
state is assembled from its features. And this kind of thing has been, those are just two examples,

986
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:08,200
but that kind of thing really gets to the heart of what's so interesting about the brain is how

987
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:16,280
do these complex states, how are they pieced together from cells? Why does anxiety track so

988
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:21,960
closely in people with autism? Have you been able to glean any insights into that?

989
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:30,360
You know, autism is something that interests me immensely. What do we really understand about this

990
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:35,720
disease? I think we know that it's got a significant genetic component. It's not

991
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:43,240
entirely clear what triggers it. But, you know, it's phenotype, of course, exists on a

992
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:51,320
pretty extreme spectrum in terms of functionality, superpowers and super deficits. But what do we

993
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:58,280
know about autism? And then specifically, why is it that anxiety tracks so closely in people with it?

994
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:05,640
This autism is one of my main clinical focus areas. This is actually my clinic office here. I see

995
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:12,520
patients with autism spectrum disorders here. I know that they are hard to treat. There's not a

996
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:19,880
medication that treats autism. But as you say, a lot of them are very anxious. And that I can help

997
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:27,480
with. I can help them with their anxiety, with medications like the benzodiazepine class of

998
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:34,680
medications that we talked about. Those help the anxiety. They don't help the social problems per

999
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:40,040
se, but they help with the anxiety. And why is that? Why are these patients with autism so,

1000
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:46,200
why is anxiety such a comorbid symptom, as we say? Why does it show up so much in autism?

1001
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:58,440
Well, the human social interaction world is very complicated. It's very fraught with possibilities

1002
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:08,520
for misunderstanding, catastrophic errors of interpretation, embarrassment, humiliation,

1003
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,680
confusion. We have a very social world that we've created. And people who have

1004
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:22,680
difficulty with keeping up with the fast rate of social information and making sense of it,

1005
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:29,400
it's a very anxiety-provoking situation. When you're talking to somebody, how do you know

1006
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:36,360
where to look, what to do? What part of them do you pay attention to? Do you look at their eyes?

1007
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,080
Do you look at their mouth? Do you look at their body movements? God forbid, there's more than one

1008
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:46,680
person. In a conversation with three people, how do you know who to look at? How do people know what

1009
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:53,720
to say next? To someone on the autism spectrum, these are extremely challenging situations,

1010
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:59,960
because it's very hard to keep up with this high information rate of the social interaction. And

1011
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:05,000
this is something in the book, Projections, that we've talked about. There's a whole chapter,

1012
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:13,400
a story on autism and on how this might happen neurobiologically, how this information overload

1013
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:21,720
might happen. We have patients who are as confused by social interaction and as overwhelmed by it,

1014
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:28,680
as you can imagine, somebody not knowing the language, not knowing the customs of a culture,

1015
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:34,680
and being placed into it while extremely consequential things involving them were

1016
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,160
happening in real time. And that's kind of the situation. And so you can understand

1017
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:45,320
anxiety being a big part of autism, just being unable to predict what happens. And so these are

1018
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:52,760
patients who we can help with their anxiety, still not yet with their autism. The genes that are

1019
01:48:52,760 --> 01:49:00,520
linked to autism, there are many. It's a very genetically determined disease, not completely,

1020
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:06,600
but heavily genetically. The problem is, like so many of the psychiatric disorders, the genetic

1021
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:12,520
underpinnings, it's a patchwork. It's many different genes that all contribute a little bit

1022
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:17,480
in those cases. And so with all the beautiful genetics, which has given us a lot of insight,

1023
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:22,040
it hasn't led to treatments because there's not a single gene, single protein,

1024
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,120
single cells intervening yet. Are you optimistic that that's going to change? I mean, what does

1025
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:34,600
the treatment for someone with autism look like in the coming decade? Let's keep it relatively

1026
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:44,840
short term. Well, the exciting thing is Optogenetics has given us a window now into what could be

1027
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:53,320
this sort of 10 year time scale of autism treatment because now, and again, mice are social,

1028
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:58,600
not only do they parent, but they're also social. They will choose to spend time with another

1029
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:09,560
even same sex member of their species compared to being alone. And they have complex interactions.

1030
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:16,680
They have a give and take. They exchange information. And there's a lot of it.

1031
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:23,720
And if you make mutations in some of the genes that are most powerfully related to autism,

1032
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:29,720
that come from the human literature, you can make mice that have impaired social interaction as

1033
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:34,840
well. And we've done this and we've studied these in laboratory and we've asked, can we correct

1034
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:43,240
the social deficit of these mice? And we can. And this is a whole thread of work in my laboratory,

1035
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:52,440
studying social interaction and asking which cells, which circuits in the brain can improve

1036
01:50:53,480 --> 01:51:03,000
social interaction, including in these autism mutation mice. And what's pretty interesting

1037
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:09,640
is that if you think about social interaction, just like everything else, and the parenting

1038
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:14,120
example made that clear, there are different parts to it. Part of a social interaction

1039
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:19,960
might be the motivation, the drive to be social, and that could vary in people. Also,

1040
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:27,720
the cognition, the understanding, the insight, that could be separate. That's another part of

1041
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,920
being social, is understanding what the heck's going on. And probably different cells affect

1042
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:38,840
each of these. And indeed we found that. So there are some dopamine neurons that do seem to increase

1043
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,560
the drive for social interaction. But then there are other cells in the front of the brain,

1044
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:50,680
some of the most advanced complex cognitions happen, the frontal cortex, that may be more

1045
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:58,840
involved in the information fire hose that's coming through with a social interaction. How do

1046
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,720
you keep up with it? How do you make sense of it? That may be more of the cognitive side. And so

1047
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:07,960
just like everything else, you've got to figure out what's most important. And we found those

1048
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:13,800
though. We now know the cells that can improve social interaction in these different areas.

1049
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:22,520
And now that we understand these cells better, you can imagine designing medications that for

1050
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:31,080
the first time are aligned with a specific kind of cell that's known to be important in social

1051
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:36,520
interaction. And that's the exciting opportunity for the future. We're not there yet, but at least

1052
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:43,400
now we have a causal cellular understanding, and that opens so many doors. Is it your belief,

1053
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:51,480
Carl, that at least in the next decade or so, optogenetics will be the tool for establishing

1054
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:59,560
cellular signal-wise causality, but not be the mode of treatment? In other words,

1055
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:04,440
I'm sure people ask you this all the time. I certainly have a thought on this, but I thought

1056
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:09,800
it's worth asking just to make sure everyone's on the same page. Is it your belief that patients

1057
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:15,640
are going to be coming into your clinic with probes that you will be lighting directly

1058
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:25,320
to actually change the neurotransmitters via the light? Or is it that we'll just use that as the

1059
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:30,920
tool to establish where to target our treatments? Or do you think it's going to be a combination of

1060
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:38,920
these? Optogenetics, in my view, is by far the most important aspect of it is it's a discovery

1061
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:43,800
and understanding tool. This helps us because this brings so much that we didn't have before.

1062
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,800
Understanding what actually matters, what makes things happen in the brain,

1063
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:53,960
at the level of cells is the opportunity that optogenetics creates, and that understanding

1064
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:58,760
then opens the door to every kind of treatment. Once you understand that, which cells are actually

1065
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:04,520
causing and relieving symptoms, you can design medications that address those cells, you can

1066
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:11,480
design brain stimulation treatments targeted to those cells or their axons as they project across

1067
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:23,080
the brain. It opens up every door in principle, providing this causal foundation. That said,

1068
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:27,640
so that I see is by far the future. It's the understanding that opens every treatment door.

1069
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:32,680
That said, my friend and colleague, Botan Roska, in Switzerland, just this year

1070
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:40,920
was able to confer a form of sight onto a blind person with optogenetics. This was just published

1071
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:48,280
in the journal Nature Medicine this year. Ten years ago, he and I had collaborated on a study

1072
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:57,800
where he put one of our microbial opsins into a human retina, cadaveric, after life. He had ways

1073
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:05,080
of keeping the retina alive for some time in these donated retinas. He was able to show

1074
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:11,240
optogenetics worked perfectly well to control human retinal neurons. He spent the next 10 years

1075
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:18,920
going through all the hoops of going through primate studies and then clinical trials.

1076
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:27,640
Then just this year, he's a vision scientist and he focused on retinal degeneration and was able

1077
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:35,000
to take a human being who was blind from retinal degeneration and he was able to create light

1078
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,120
sensitivity so this person could accurately reach for objects on a table that was not possible before.

1079
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:49,160
Literally, making a blind person see, at least to some extent, can happen. I think there may be

1080
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:56,920
cases like that. Of course, they're uplifting to see, but the biggest picture is that it's a

1081
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:04,360
discovery tool. I want to pivot a minute to talk about your book because I think it becomes a great

1082
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:10,040
place for us to now talk about some of the mental illnesses that people will be familiar with,

1083
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:15,880
depression, mania, and its cousin bipolar disorder, eating disorders, all of these things that you've

1084
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:22,760
written about so eloquently. First of all, I want to tell you that if I'm not already in complete awe

1085
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:30,920
of your scientific achievements, I'm equally in awe of your writing achievements. I just don't

1086
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:37,080
think it's fair that one person can be so gifted on two dimensions, Carl. It's really disappointing

1087
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:41,080
and I hope there's something in life that you're horrible at so that I don't feel even worse about

1088
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:48,680
myself. No, seriously, your book is unbelievable. It's called Projections and I've read it twice.

1089
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:58,680
I will encourage every listener to read it because it will shatter some of the images people

1090
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:04,680
have of scientists because you don't write like a scientist. I say that as somebody who's in the

1091
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:13,160
process of finishing up their book. The biggest challenge I have in writing is making it accessible

1092
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:17,960
to everybody, making it interesting enough that someone for whom this is not their life

1093
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:26,200
wants to read it. You've done that in spades. This really reads like at times poetry.

1094
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:34,120
I know you've always had an interest in writing. Did it require much effort and discipline to write

1095
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:40,440
about such technical matters at times, but also to write about the clinical conditions,

1096
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:47,400
the psychiatric conditions that everybody's familiar with? It seemed effortless that you

1097
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:52,120
were able to do this in such an easily accessible and artistic way.

1098
01:57:53,080 --> 01:58:00,600
First of all, thank you, Pete. It means so much to hear that. You never really know when you

1099
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:09,640
take a step like this or a risk like this if it's really working. This was a risk. This was

1100
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:14,600
something that was very different. It's not what people expected. As you say, not a typical

1101
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:27,480
scientific text at all. The goal I had was to help everybody in the world, whatever their

1102
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:35,320
background, I wanted to help them understand and feel what these altered states are. That's such

1103
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:40,920
a big part of the book is to work with that feeling, to help people understand and feel

1104
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:47,160
for themselves what mania might be like or what the fragmentation of schizophrenia might be like,

1105
01:58:47,160 --> 01:59:00,280
or the crushing pathological grief of bereavement, or the incredibly complex

1106
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:08,200
states of eating disorders where you have these astonishing behavioral patterns that seem so

1107
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:18,520
inexplicable compared to what you would think would be what we were evolved to do.

1108
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:25,000
Everything from these uplifting exuberant states of mania to the depths, I wanted people to feel

1109
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,720
this. I had to do this with the writing, with the words. I wanted to do it with the writing

1110
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:38,760
and the words. In each chapter, the writing is adapted to cause that feeling. In the mania story,

1111
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:47,800
the words are exuberant in the way that mania is in the schizophrenia or psychosis story.

1112
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:58,840
There's a fragmentation and a disorganization that happens. In all these cases, I had to work

1113
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:05,480
with words in ways that are not typical for a scientist. Of course, I wanted to do it. This was

1114
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:12,440
my initial passion in life. For me, it was incredibly fulfilling, actually, to come back

1115
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:18,600
and be able to do this. I'd always wanted to do it. I had now not just the desire, but I had a

1116
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:26,120
mission. I had something I wanted to tell. I wanted to share with everybody. For me, it was

1117
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:33,480
incredibly addictive, actually. I did the bulk of the writing over a couple years from

1118
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:45,000
2017 to 2019 or so, and then wrapped it up in 2020. I looked forward to this so much every day.

1119
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:52,040
I would block out a couple hours, but a different time each day, depending on my schedule. Life's

1120
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:59,400
complex now. I've got five total kids. Things are hopping at home. My wife, Michelle, is an

1121
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:05,720
incredibly accomplished MD-PhD herself, also running clinical trials. Also one of our classmates.

1122
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:12,920
Also one of our classmates. Of course, she's in the hospital a lot. No day is as simple or predictable.

1123
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:19,880
The writing time would be at different times, often very late at night, often early in the

1124
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,200
morning. I tried to block out two hours, but I would find I would look forward to that like

1125
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:32,280
almost nothing else. I just relished the joy of finding the right word and spending days

1126
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:39,720
thinking about trying to find the right turn of phrase. It was incredibly uplifting, honestly,

1127
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:45,080
even though, of course, a big challenge logistically. One of the things I love about the

1128
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:53,480
book is how you really try to dive into the evolutionary basis for mental illness. This is

1129
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:58,040
something I'm always obsessed with. I always love trying to think about things through an

1130
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:04,840
evolutionary lens. Sometimes the answers come a little easier than others. One of the places

1131
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:10,360
where it comes up is in the story of Alexander. This is a gentleman, won't give away the entire

1132
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:17,480
story, but basically post-9-11 is triggered into what sounds like his first manic event, correct?

1133
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:23,000
That's right. That's right. Which then gets into this discussion of mania. What is mania?

1134
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,280
One of the things I found very interesting about this was the discussion about the evolutionary

1135
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:35,800
basis for mania. This is interesting to me personally because this is a very personal

1136
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:43,640
story, I guess, but when I was in residency, I was encouraged by my wife actually to see

1137
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:52,280
a psychiatrist. She had some concern about some of my behaviors. The psychiatrist, after one day,

1138
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:58,120
I don't know if she was right or wrong, but she decided I was hypomanic. That was her diagnosis.

1139
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:03,640
That, of course, got me very interested in, well, why is this the case? How does she know?

1140
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:08,920
Why would this be? I began examining everything I'd ever done in life.

1141
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:14,760
One of the things I came across was at the time, it was a psychiatrist at Hopkins,

1142
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:21,880
so this would have been 2004, 2005, had written a book suggesting that the prevalence of hypomania

1143
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:27,480
in North America was higher than anywhere else in the world because it had the highest

1144
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:34,360
concentration of recent immigrants. The argument was, well, by definition, if you have a collection

1145
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:43,160
of people who are one to five generations away from people who had basically the nerve to leave

1146
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:49,320
a comfortable life elsewhere, and in the case of certainly my parents and many people who came here,

1147
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:52,280
basically to come to nothing. You don't know the language, you don't know the culture, you don't

1148
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:58,120
know the people. It wouldn't be surprising that you could concentrate hypomania here.

1149
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,920
A, I'm curious as to whether you have any thoughts about that theory, but perhaps more importantly,

1150
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:10,760
let's dive into this evolutionary basis for mania because the point that you get into about

1151
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:16,040
how there are sometimes wherein traits are very valuable at the population level and not at the

1152
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:21,400
individual level, I found that fascinating. Well, first of all, that's a very interesting

1153
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:30,600
route into this discussion, which is the immigrants, the recent immigrants, and the

1154
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:37,240
possible genetic link to have the, in recent times, to have the get up and go to leave,

1155
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:45,400
to take the risks, to have the energy, to have the motivation to actually make it happen,

1156
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:52,200
sustain it, this complex goal with so many possible downsides. That's no small thing.

1157
02:04:52,200 --> 02:05:00,840
Some people wouldn't want to do it, some would. And mania is, it's one of the poles of bipolar

1158
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:08,360
disorder, which is a very genetic, highly genetic disorder, one of the most in psychiatry, bipolar

1159
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:13,880
type one disorder, extraordinarily genetically determined. And what is it? Well, it's not these

1160
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:19,320
two poles. Just to be clear, Carl, does that mean that bipolar stems from bipolar, or it just

1161
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:26,040
clusters with other psychiatric illness? So in other words, schizophrenia or significant depression

1162
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:31,320
would also be genetic precursors to it. What it means in this case is that it's, if you look at

1163
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:38,120
monozygotic twins, especially those that are raised apart, that's where the most pure

1164
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:44,920
information comes from. You can look at the concordance of mania or bipolar disorder appearing

1165
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:52,600
in each of these twins, identical twins. It's more than 50% for bipolar type one, in fact,

1166
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:59,800
verging above 70%. So you have a very strong bipolar type one genetic. And just out of

1167
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:05,880
curiosity, what is it for autism in that same setting? Autism also high, maybe just a touch

1168
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:13,720
under that. With depression, it's like 50%. And so most of the psychiatric disorders have

1169
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:22,040
strong genetic links. They tend to be less than 80%. But in this kind of 50 to 80% range for many of

1170
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:28,760
the severe ones from depression, schizophrenia, to autism, to bipolar. And so this is something we

1171
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:37,240
face in schizophrenia and in autism. But in bipolar, it's extremely strong. So right away,

1172
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:43,720
we know there's that link. And mania is the positive pull of bipolar disorder. The other

1173
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:50,680
pull is depression. People with bipolar type one have had at least one manic episode where they

1174
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:56,920
have a period of time, could be a week, where they've had this very clear, discrete state of

1175
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:04,200
elevated mood, increased goal directed activity, projects, plans, spending, taking risks, faster

1176
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:13,000
speech, not needing sleep, truly not needing sleep, not nearly as much. And, you know, honestly,

1177
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:19,960
even though this causes problems, and serious problems, and not to sugarcoat it at all, mania

1178
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:25,480
can do terrible things. People make very poor decisions, they can be fatal.

1179
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:29,640
Yeah, I was just gonna say, aren't people even slightly more likely to harm themselves

1180
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:35,240
during a manic phase than the depressive phase? Yes, or the transition from out of depression

1181
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:40,520
to mania, that's actually probably the most risky time when they might still have some

1182
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:43,560
of the negativity from the depression, but now they have the energy to.

1183
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:51,400
Yeah, exactly. And so that, not to say there's, you know, it's a problem, but yet at the same

1184
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:55,400
time, you know, some of my most memorable experiences in talking with manic patients is,

1185
02:07:56,040 --> 02:08:01,320
I actually love talking to them because there's such a charge of energy, anything's possible,

1186
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:09,640
they're funny, they're warm, they're charismatic. And it's so easy to see that this is a state

1187
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:14,440
that's, it's not a bunch of random things happening in the brain. This is a coherent

1188
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:20,120
state of elevated mood, it's consistent, you see it in one patient, you see it in another patient,

1189
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:27,160
it's something that's there that human beings have as something they can do, a sustained

1190
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:32,520
state of elevated mood and energy. And you look at that and you think, okay,

1191
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:42,360
you know, why? And also, you know, what does that mean for treatment? Is there an ethical issue

1192
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:50,920
with treatment? Is there, are there cases where mania is positive? And this is something that the

1193
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:56,520
story in the book and projections really made me think so hard about. This was actually when the

1194
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:02,840
seed for the book was first planted in my head. It was just 20 years ago, right after 9-11,

1195
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:10,040
and this patient Alexander, he had never had any psychiatric illness at all, nor in his family.

1196
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:17,240
But he was flipped into a completely classic full-blown mania after 9-11. He had no particular

1197
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:24,360
connection. In fact, he was on a sailing trip in the Mediterranean with his wife at the time,

1198
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:32,040
came back home after 9-11. And a couple of weeks later, he was manic. All these symptoms that we

1199
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:40,760
talked about, and it was a huge problem. He was, but his, but he had this appropriate, or at least

1200
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:48,040
aligned quality to his symptoms. He wanted to, he was, you know, he was retirement age,

1201
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:54,440
but he was training himself to go into battle. He was rappelling down trees. He was running

1202
02:09:54,440 --> 02:10:02,520
through the night. He was reading about military strategy. And then it verged into this, you know,

1203
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:11,880
very difficult, emotionally challenging. He was screaming. He was hyper-religious. Everything had

1204
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:20,200
become quite extreme and incompatible with his life. And so that ended up bringing him to the

1205
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:26,280
hospital. But, you know, looking at this and we think, okay, this is a state of elevated mood and

1206
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:31,640
energy. It was triggered by context. And this is actually the flip side of what you're saying with

1207
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:39,240
the immigrants. Not only is there likely to be a set of conditions that led to these people being

1208
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:44,360
able to take, have the energy and willingness to take the risk and meet all the incredible challenges

1209
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:53,240
of moving across countries and cultures. But then, you know, that's not this fight or flight

1210
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:57,240
response of a minute when you've got a threat and you have energy and then you meet the threat and

1211
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:04,120
then it's gone. We're talking about you need a sustained level of energy for weeks, months,

1212
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:11,720
years even, and to take a risk and a life shift like that. And so, you know, this is,

1213
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:17,720
everything is on a spectrum and you've got mania and then you've got this hypomanic state in between

1214
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:25,720
that makes a lot of sense that people who are able to sustain this elevated energy state are those

1215
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:32,040
that would be our immigrants. And it's a, and again, you have to look at this and think,

1216
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:39,560
it's a spectrum. Definitely it can be bad, but we have to value the whole spectrum and understand

1217
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,920
the whole spectrum. It's part of who we are as the human family.

1218
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:48,760
Why do you think that in the bipolar condition you have this pairing of such opposites?

1219
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:56,600
Is the depression a necessary part of bipolar to basically allow the recharging after, you know,

1220
02:11:56,600 --> 02:12:03,480
this unbelievable discharge of emotional and physical energy? Because otherwise, it doesn't

1221
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:08,840
seem like these would, you know, like for example, why doesn't it just go normal affect mania, normal

1222
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:14,840
affect mania? That's a great question. We don't have the answer. Some people, some fortunate

1223
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:19,800
people are like that. There are, you can get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder without ever

1224
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:27,240
having a depression. One episode of mania gets you that diagnosis of bipolar type 1 and those people,

1225
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:35,720
there are people who haven't hit a major depression yet. That said, most of the time there is that

1226
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:41,880
other pole of the disorder. And what is it? We don't know. Short answer is we don't know. But

1227
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:47,240
a lot of interesting ideas. One could be sort of aligned with what you're saying, that there's some

1228
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:54,120
resource that's exhausted. Is it, you know, it's not a resource that we know what it is. We can't

1229
02:12:54,120 --> 02:13:03,640
point to it. Is it a neural circuit, you know, state of some kind, a capability of a neural

1230
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:10,360
circuit that can become exhausted. We know neurons can run out of energy. This is part of how the

1231
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:14,440
brain stimulation to cause inhibition works, but that's all in a very fast time scale. You can

1232
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:20,360
exhaust neurons on seconds to minutes. It's not known what really could get exhausted on the

1233
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:27,560
week's scale. We don't know what that would be. Or maybe it's the termination mechanism that it

1234
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:38,040
just overshoots. Or maybe it's just that what's lost is a, the homeostatic thing that keeps energy

1235
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:45,480
in a tight range. And then it could go in either direction because you've lost some break that's

1236
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:51,960
present on either side. Not known, but a very interesting question. What is technically the

1237
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:58,440
most common psychiatric disorder? Is it depression? Actually the anxiety disorders, if you group them

1238
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:05,240
together, anxiety is the most common. And that is, but depression is certainly up there. That's

1239
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:14,200
in the top group for sure. Anxiety disorders are so underappreciated. A lot of people don't talk

1240
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:21,560
about them. A lot of people can make it through the day with anxiety, even if they're suffering

1241
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:26,680
terribly. So yeah, anxiety is most common. What has optogenetics taught us about depression?

1242
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:32,440
So this, you know, this is my clinical specialty. I have, you know, right here in this office, I have,

1243
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:40,120
you know, we do, I do vagus nerve stimulation. For example, this is a VNS therapy radio

1244
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:46,120
frequency controller. We have, we still do here electroconvulsive therapy. We do transcranial

1245
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:53,240
magnetic stimulation. Clinically, though we're looking for guidance from the science because

1246
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:59,400
it's still not known clinically what actually is going wrong in depression. We don't actually know

1247
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:07,080
that in a way that can guide therapies in the way that we'd like. And what's the, what's the

1248
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:11,400
scientific situation? Well, optogenetics has helped quite a bit because, and again, picking up on this

1249
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:15,480
theme, of course there's different parts to depression. And this is how we diagnose it. We ask

1250
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:23,400
about all these different parts. There's depressed mood and that's this negative state. Okay.

1251
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:28,760
There's hopelessness. So it's kind of the opposite of mania. A manic person thinks anything's

1252
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:34,600
possible. Depressed person thinks nothing's possible. There's a deep discounting of the value

1253
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:40,200
of effort. And this shows up as hopelessness. This even can lead to suicidality and certainly severe

1254
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:44,680
social and occupational dysfunction. And then there are other parts to depression. There's

1255
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:49,480
something called anhedonia, which is really interesting. This is the absence of pleasure.

1256
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:53,640
Yeah. This is perhaps the most insidious component of depression by far.

1257
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:58,360
Right. Right. And it's not commonly known. You don't, people on the street don't talk about

1258
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:02,840
anhedonia, right? It's, they'll say they're depressed, but nobody talks about their anhedonia.

1259
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:09,240
But it's an incredibly important symptom. It's a core, such a core symptom of depression that

1260
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:13,880
actually you can get a diagnosis of major depressive disorder without depressed mood.

1261
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:21,720
If you also have anhedonia, it's that important. And it's the absence of pleasure or joy from

1262
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:27,640
things that normally bring pleasure or joy. And we've all had a cold and we've known that taste

1263
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:36,840
is gone, food has lost all joy. It's things, even without the cold, with the anhedonia of depression,

1264
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:43,640
all the joy of food or social interaction or your children, your grandchildren,

1265
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:53,960
a book, a movie, all the joy of life is gone. And this is a horrific thing. It leads to very

1266
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:58,600
serious problems. And that's something that Optic Genetics has helped us understand.

1267
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:05,400
What do we know about that? Yeah. Where do the neurons reside and what are the neurotransmitters

1268
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:12,200
involved in the propagation of anhedonia? So, so again, you might say, how are you going to

1269
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:18,360
test this? And you can, you can set up very simple behaviors with, with animals that, that provide

1270
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:26,680
some insight. First of all, you could provide a simple choice for animals, mice like us, like

1271
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:32,440
sugary drinks, and you could give the animal a choice of a sugary drink or just water. And normally

1272
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:38,680
a mouse will prefer kind of like we do, they'll prefer the sugary drink and, and by a factor,

1273
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:46,760
you know, two to one or more. But a mouse that's been stressed, it's had some unpredictable events

1274
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:57,000
happen. It's had its sleep disrupted. It will not prefer the sugar water nearly as much. It won't

1275
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:03,000
care as much. And so such an interesting thing, given all the evolutionary importance of a small,

1276
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:10,520
high metabolic rate, mammal needing sugar, and we know the reward that we feel from, from sugar and

1277
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:16,680
presume it's very similar for them, and then not caring sugar water, regular water. So in other

1278
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:23,320
words, if you had them going 50 50 between sugar water and regular water, that would be even more

1279
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:27,080
telling than if they disproportionately went to the regular water, right? You would be looking for

1280
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:32,120
a complete amelioration of the effect of the sugar water would suggest that they have basically lost

1281
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:37,800
interest. That's right. That's exactly right. And that in fact happens. And so, so we, we and others

1282
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:41,960
have explored this, this kind of thing with, with optogenetics. And we found that there are,

1283
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:48,680
uh, you know, pathways and coming back again to the, to the dopamine neurons, which are

1284
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:55,800
tightly linked to mood and mania and depression. These, but they're a complex set of cells. Some

1285
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:59,560
send connections to one part of the brain. Some send connections to another part of the brain.

1286
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:07,560
We have found some interesting pathways that relate to those dopamine neurons where you can actually

1287
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:18,520
affect how potent a normal rewarding stimulus is by something going on in the frontal cortex.

1288
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:25,400
And the frontal part of the brain and overactivity in the prefrontal cortical areas can cause

1289
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:35,000
anhedonia in rodents. An overactivity seems to cause an inability of the dopamine neurons to

1290
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:41,080
recruit, reward circuitry. And so this is an insight that optogenetics brought us and it's

1291
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:45,880
something that we're following up mechanistically. It's kind of an interesting thing that there's,

1292
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:51,560
what we found is that again, using optogenetics, that the frontal cortex can suppress both positive

1293
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:57,480
and negative things. It can suppress fear. It can suppress anxiety. This is part of how we exert

1294
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:05,240
cognitive control over situations. We can enter a scenario that we know is risky if we think about

1295
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:14,760
it enough, if we, uh, frame it enough for ourselves cognitively, if we review the need for it, for

1296
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:21,800
taking this action. And so our, our frontal cortex can help us by tamping down negative

1297
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:28,600
aspects, but it also, when overactive, it turns out can tamp down positive aspects as well. And

1298
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:34,440
optogenetics has given us a causal insight into this. And so that's just one example, but all the

1299
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:42,200
other features of depression as well are susceptible to optogenetic study and we've got insight into

1300
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:47,800
them. Hopelessness being another one. And so here, you know, again, you might ask, how do you,

1301
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:52,440
how do you measure hope in an animal? Well, you know, you can, you can put an animal in a

1302
02:20:52,440 --> 02:21:02,360
challenging situation that is not escapable. Animal can, can try to get out of this challenging

1303
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:07,000
situation. And then would that be like a maze that doesn't have an exit? Yeah. No, no way of

1304
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:11,160
getting out exactly. So it doesn't have to be painful. Just, just something that an animal would

1305
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:15,720
want to get out of and eventually they give up. We can do this actually in fish as well as in,

1306
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:22,120
in mice. And that giving up is effectively, it's this hopelessness. It's this discounting

1307
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:29,400
of effort. And that can be an appropriate thing. Let's say, of course, if the situation truly is

1308
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:36,520
hopeless, it really is not good to keep devoting effort to it, right? If you, if you keep flailing

1309
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:41,720
against an insuperable situation, you're burning energy, it could cause physical risk.

1310
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:48,680
You're distracting yourself from other things. Withdrawing, entering into a passive coping state

1311
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:55,960
is actually adaptive up to a point. The problem with depression is it becomes extreme. So it's

1312
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:01,960
maladaptive. It becomes maladaptive. You discounted the value of everything. And then it's got this

1313
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:07,000
mysterious negative balance to it too, which is of course also part of the problem. What do you

1314
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:13,960
think is the evolutionary basis for depression? This is something that is so ubiquitous. I think

1315
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:21,160
I can, based on what you said earlier, see the evolutionary basis for anxiety. And maybe we could

1316
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:28,280
just argue that, that the pathologic version, well, we could discuss why maybe it's been amplified and

1317
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:33,480
what it is about our environment that perhaps does that. But depression is a less, less clear

1318
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:38,040
to me and certainly mania is clear, right? I think we've made a very compelling case for why mania

1319
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:45,080
could be, why evolutionary pressure could have favored the propagation or at the, at a minimum,

1320
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:53,160
the maintenance of this. Why depression? It seems to be counter to your ability to mate, to find

1321
02:22:53,160 --> 02:23:02,120
food, to defend yourself. I'm struggling to come up with one evolutionarily valuable tool that would

1322
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:07,800
be better in a depressed state. You know, and this is a great question. I think about this all the

1323
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:15,800
time. And part of what we've discussed already may provide some insight, which is this, this withdrawal,

1324
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:23,080
this passivity. It is in some cases, you can think of it like a hibernation, you know, if,

1325
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:30,680
is it, is it like, is it worthwhile for an animal to actively try to cope with winter by running

1326
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:36,840
around trying to find more food all through the winter or to withdraw, to sleep more, to, to not

1327
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:45,240
see the value or feel the value in going outside and doing anything. And clearly, no matter what

1328
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:50,760
you do, you can't fight winter, right? The best thing is to conserve your energy, ride it out on

1329
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:58,680
some time scale that's appropriate. And so you think about now, think about depression. It comes

1330
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:04,840
with this low energy. It comes with this hopelessness, this discounting of effort, this lack of

1331
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:13,160
motivation to go seek things to be enjoyed, reduced, you know, drive for social interaction. All these

1332
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:18,760
things can be part of depression. The negative aspect is the one part that's, that's, that I

1333
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:24,040
can explain. And that's, that's of course, the clinically significant problem. Why does it feel

1334
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:29,880
bad? And this is not just feeling bad. This is agony. This is psychic pain is the kind of thing

1335
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:37,560
that drives people to seek suicide. Not to discount that at all. We don't understand why

1336
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:46,120
depression feels bad, but the passivity of coping that can be adaptive. And it's, it's perhaps,

1337
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:53,400
you could, you could see almost depression as a, as a hack, a bad hack, maybe one that's not fully

1338
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:59,880
evolved yet, just like mania, not fully evolved yet, not under all the right controls to make it

1339
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:09,800
more generally suitable and reasonable. Depression, the easiest way to make it happen

1340
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:21,640
is to remove the joy, to remove the energy, to seek out reward. And then you've got an organism

1341
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:28,520
that's going to be passive, that doesn't see a path to, to, to something positive. And

1342
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:35,560
evolutionarily, if you, if you take this, this viewpoint, maybe one way of getting to that goal

1343
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:44,840
that had some at the population level, some adaptive value included having this negativity,

1344
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:50,280
this negative state to it. And this is pure speculation, you know, but it's, it's important

1345
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:59,960
because depression is very genetically determined. It's, it's common, it's biological. And at some

1346
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:05,400
level, we have to deal with the fact that we have evolved to be where we are now. And we have this

1347
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:11,640
high rate of, of, of, of depression. And so we have to include in our thinking, the biology and

1348
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:17,400
the evolution together. And so that would be my, my, you know, my, my take on it. Of course,

1349
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:22,040
it's very hard and I wouldn't claim to have a definitive understanding.

1350
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:26,920
Two unrelated questions. I don't even know which one to ask first. So I'll probably just ask them

1351
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:33,560
both and then let you take them whichever way you like. The first is sort of a desire to understand

1352
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:39,240
where depression specifically, but even other mental illness fits into our closest relatives,

1353
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:46,600
the primates, right? Do we have a sense that our primate relatives are as afflicted by depression

1354
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:52,920
and or other mental illnesses as much as we are? Let's start with that. Yeah.

1355
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:58,040
Yeah. Well, we can, one of the clearest things we can see is that, you know,

1356
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:07,080
non-human primates can certainly enter into maladaptive states that look like grief. In

1357
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:16,040
bereaved states, there are cases where you can have a, a young non-human primate who is old enough to,

1358
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:22,120
to feed itself, but who has lost a mother, let's say has lost its mother and loses the

1359
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:29,000
motivation to feed and protect itself and stay with the, the troop and ends up dying as a result.

1360
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:36,840
This is a clearly maladaptive state documented that in a non-human primate, you could call it

1361
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:44,200
something like that, a depressed like state, deriving from bereavement and presumed

1362
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:52,280
to anthropomorphize something like grief associated with bereavement. So I believe these,

1363
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:57,160
you know, these states are, are shared by our, by our non-human.

1364
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:03,480
Any evidence of self-harm in, in, in non-human primates, does it ever get to the level of,

1365
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:11,320
I mean, you know, suicide is a top 10 cause of mortality in the developed world. It's

1366
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:15,560
important to make sure people understand the significance of that statement.

1367
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:20,520
In the developed world, when you think about all of the problems we've been able to solve,

1368
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:29,800
one of the 10 leading causes of death is self-harm. And, and by the way, if you really include

1369
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:37,240
overdose as a subset of that, it probably leap frogs into the top seven. Is there evidence that

1370
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:44,040
this occurs in other species? So a really interesting question. And

1371
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:56,840
the short answer is no. And there are less suicidal forms of self-harm that can happen.

1372
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:02,440
Now and then you'll see animals, you know, carrying out behaviors like, you know, headbanging and

1373
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:09,080
things like that. But in terms of a true suicide, the volitional ending of the self,

1374
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:16,840
there is not a animal model for that. Let's say it's not clear that that happens. And if you think

1375
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:25,000
about it, as much as we'd like to have that, so we could address this, this urgent, enormous

1376
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:31,080
clinical need that's not going away, we would love to have some way of studying this.

1377
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:39,560
We don't have it. And if you think about it, the ending of the self is an extremely

1378
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:47,000
cognitively complex thing. And it's, if you think about the act of suicide, which we don't

1379
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:52,440
understand, and it's a horrific thing, but you've got, there has to be some understanding

1380
02:29:53,320 --> 02:30:00,280
of what that means, that there is an ending of life, an ending of the self, and that the

1381
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:06,920
pain that's being felt now would not be felt then. This is a level of understanding of

1382
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:17,480
the universe that it doesn't seem that animals that are not us actually have. We could be wrong.

1383
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:23,240
I'm completely willing to admit that. There are amazing animals, you know, dolphins and

1384
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:31,400
whales and elephants have incredibly complex and amazing minds. They may be better than we are at

1385
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:37,720
some of these deep concepts, but they may have less clear ways to express it. They may have

1386
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:45,000
maybe not having fingers and hands to do things that we can do. They may not have the ways to

1387
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,240
express it, even though their cognitions may be just as complex. And so I think there are two

1388
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:56,360
factors. One is, you know, the things that set us apart, our brains and our hands, those two don't

1389
02:30:56,360 --> 02:31:01,000
come together in any other animal. And I think that's why you don't see suicide elsewhere,

1390
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:07,080
at least as we understand it. Our colleague, Paul Conti, close, also friend for medical school,

1391
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:11,560
who trained with you in psychiatry, has just written a wonderful book on trauma.

1392
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:19,880
And so it begs the question, what role does trauma play in the amplification of depression?

1393
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:28,280
We know, as you said, that depression is highly heritable. But like most conditions that are

1394
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:35,160
heritable, there tends to be environmental triggers that can bring one person to have it

1395
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:41,320
and one not to have it, even if you take the most extreme example of the monozygotic twins raised in

1396
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:45,080
a separate environment, one comes down with something, there's clearly some difference.

1397
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:53,000
So what role do you think that early childhood trauma plays in all mental illness, but I guess

1398
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,640
specifically depression? And do you believe that that could be epigenetic? In other words,

1399
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:06,440
do you believe that this thing can irreversibly mark the gene and then be transferred to subsequent

1400
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:14,120
generations? Subsequent generations, yeah. So the effects of trauma, the lasting effects

1401
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:21,080
of early life trauma are unfortunately very clear. You can see in animals as well.

1402
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:29,560
And they extend beyond depression for sure to include the personality disorders like borderline

1403
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:37,400
personality, for example. So there's no question that early life trauma has lasting psychiatric

1404
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:44,520
influence throughout life and can cause very severe problems. In many ways to look at this,

1405
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:52,440
why is it happening and how is it happening? Is there a wiring change? So is the lasting

1406
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:59,160
quality due to a physical structure of the brain as a circuit? That's one level at which it could

1407
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:06,680
happen. And the brain is very, brain circuitry is very tunable that way, especially in young people.

1408
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:18,040
And so you could imagine that early life experience with trauma sets up the human

1409
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:27,320
to expect in some ways that the world is a harsh and unpredictable place and that the

1410
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:32,520
value system had better be set up to deal with that because that's how it is apparently.

1411
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:40,040
And so you could almost imagine an adaptive, though very unfortunate, process going on where

1412
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:46,520
there's a period of youth where you're gathering statistics about the environment, deciding what

1413
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:52,200
the adult should be like, and then implementing that. And so early life trauma could intersect

1414
02:33:52,280 --> 02:34:00,520
with such a process very unfortunately and create people with a lasting state of depression, for

1415
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:07,480
example, expecting aversive things to be present at higher rates and negative consequences of

1416
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:17,000
actions to be present at a high rate. Now, that could be for sure the case as far as an evolutionary

1417
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:23,880
logic, but there's no doubt that this happens in terms of the behavioral effect and the psychiatric

1418
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:29,080
effect, the lasting effects of early life trauma. Now, if it's not neural circuitry, what else could

1419
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:34,600
it be? It could be genetic or epigenetic, as you say, you're not changing your genome from childhood

1420
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:41,000
to adulthood, but you're changing the transcription factors, the promoters and enhancers. You could be

1421
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,640
affecting gene expression throughout life. And that, at least through the life of that individual,

1422
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:49,880
we understand how that mechanistically could work. And then finally, you raise the

1423
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:56,520
intergenerational aspect. In human beings, this is very hard to separate from, you know, it's the

1424
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:01,880
nature and nurture thing. Of course, you've got the parenting that's linked to what might have

1425
02:35:01,880 --> 02:35:09,480
happened in the prior generation. And I'd say it's still controversial to how much intergenerational

1426
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:12,440
transfer can happen, although in animals there are mechanisms.

1427
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:19,080
You wrote about the, well, at least you wrote about your musings, your exploration of the idea

1428
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:23,960
of the evolutionary basis for tears. I found this completely fascinating.

1429
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:30,120
A, I found it fascinating because I'd never once considered that. And for someone like me who

1430
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:36,440
is often thinking about the evolutionary basis for this feature or that feature, it was interesting

1431
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:39,640
to me that I hadn't considered that. Say a little bit about that.

1432
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:49,160
Emotional tears, and by that, you know, the liquid coming from our tear ducts at times of emotion,

1433
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:55,160
this is apparently, as far as we can tell, it's a human trait. Our great apes don't do this,

1434
02:35:55,160 --> 02:36:02,520
and even some human beings don't do it. So it's a special thing. It's not that we are the only

1435
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:08,200
ones that grieve, but we're the ones that secrete this fluid from our eyes at these extreme moments.

1436
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:15,080
And this has been studied. There are scholars of tears, as it were, and you can do things like

1437
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:22,120
add or subtract tears digitally from pictures of faces. And these have enormous impacts on

1438
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:29,000
the reactions of people seeing these images much, much greater than a smile or a grimace,

1439
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:35,800
and particularly creating a desire to help. When we see tears, we want to help that person.

1440
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:42,520
And so this intersects very closely with the, I think, with the involuntary, largely involuntary

1441
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:48,360
nature of tears. It's a truth channel. It's not so easily gameable. It reveals something

1442
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:58,520
that in a social grouping, like those that we've evolved to maintain, it is an involuntary

1443
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:07,400
expression of something, the world changing, of needing new systems in place, and it triggers

1444
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:15,480
this outreach from people who see it in a very powerful way. And this question, can an emotional

1445
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:19,960
change cause something like this to happen? It would be a very easy rewiring to happen. There

1446
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:26,120
are already axons that come from emotional regions and go to the brainstem that control the breathing

1447
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:32,680
rate, for example, in anxiety. And right next to those breathing rate regions, there are

1448
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:36,600
regions that control the tear ducts. They're right next to each other in the brainstem, and a very

1449
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:42,200
tiny, tiny rewiring little axon just going in one slightly different direction would create

1450
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:51,560
this state of expressing this visible manifestation of an inner world. And for a social

1451
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:58,600
species like ours, it could be easily, evolutionarily selected for. And so there's, in the story,

1452
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:06,440
a storehouse of tears and projections. This is something that a patient's story helped bring to

1453
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:11,640
the forefront of my mind, and we talk about it quite a bit. Yeah, I won't give any more away

1454
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:17,960
from that story because I want people to read it for themselves. Well, Carl, I know that we've

1455
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:22,840
kind of reached the limit of our time and you have another commitment today. As you can probably

1456
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:27,720
imagine, I could continue this discussion for probably another couple of hours, and I gather

1457
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:32,360
you could as well if it weren't for this other commitment. So I think what we should do is just

1458
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:38,440
commit to sitting down again next year at some point. And continuing this discussion, there are

1459
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:43,400
so many more questions I have about personality disorders. And another topic that we didn't even

1460
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:49,560
get into today that we're both very interested in is psychedelics, both from the traditional side,

1461
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:57,320
even to the non-traditional side, the use of ketamine, psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, all of these

1462
02:38:57,320 --> 02:39:02,680
things, which are an enormous interest of yours clinically and scientifically as of mine. So

1463
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:10,920
I want to again congratulate you on not just your recent Lasker Award, which again, I'll make sure

1464
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:16,280
in the introduction to explain to people what the significance of that is, but also your remarkable

1465
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:22,120
achievements over the past two decades and this remarkable work that you've written, Projections,

1466
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:26,440
which I suspect many people are going to be reading after this. So, Carl, thanks very much for

1467
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:31,240
spending time with us today and for educating us on this amazing journey you've been on.

1468
02:39:31,240 --> 02:39:36,840
Pete, it's been great. Great to reconnect with you again on an incredibly enjoyable conversation and

1469
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:40,280
look forward to talking again. All right. Bye for now. All right. Take care.
