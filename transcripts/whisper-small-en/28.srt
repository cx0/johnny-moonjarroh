00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,760
Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of The Drive. This week I had two guests.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,360
This was a first. I've never interviewed two people simultaneously, which is not to say

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
it's rocket science. I think a monkey can figure it out. And I'm at least as good as

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,080
a monkey, so I was able to figure it out. But it did stress me out a little bit because

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,400
I was trying to figure out how do you keep two people engaged. But it seems like we did

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,440
a pretty good job and I think you'll enjoy this episode.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,840
My guests were two guys who I just referred to as the Brothers Bell, but they're obviously

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,000
known more commonly by their actual names, Mark Bell and Chris Bell. Some of you may

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,720
recognize these guys, especially if you're interested in powerlifting or if you've ever

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,920
paid attention to some really interesting documentaries, in particular, Bigger Stronger

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,640
Faster, which was sort of the breakout performance for Chris Bell. That is, I believe, a documentary

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,920
that if you look at all of its downloads on Netflix would certainly put it in kind of

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
the top 10 docs of the last decade. I could be wrong on that, but I feel like I remember

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,680
reading that somewhere. Prescription Thugs was also a follow-up documentary. And there

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,680
are a number of others, including one that is in the works at the time of this recording

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,080
that we'll link to as well. His brother, Mark Bell, his younger brother, is an absolute

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,400
legend in the world of powerlifting and he owns a number of records, all of which are

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,560
staggering and we'll get into those during the episode. This was also a bit of a first

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,920
for me in that it was the first time I interviewed people I didn't know personally. So obviously

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,320
I'd communicated with Mark and Chris through email a bunch leading up to this, but I didn't

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,480
have a rapport with them in the way that I've had with every person I've interviewed to

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,160
date, which actually is a little harder. You have to pay a bit more attention when you're

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
doing your homework. So I hope that doesn't come across as being strained. I don't think

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,520
it did. I think we were definitely getting along well and having fun. The other thing

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,120
that may or may not come across here is we were exhausted. We did this interview up at

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,640
a place that Mark Bell was renting for the month up in Malibu. And so I went up there

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,780
and they interviewed me for their documentary slash podcast. And it took about three hours

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,400
and 15 minutes. We took about 45 minutes off to play patty cakes and grab ass and eat.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,840
And then I proceeded to interview them for about two hours. So I think by the end of

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,960
that two hours, we were all collectively exhausted. So that may or may not come across. Anyway,

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,600
all those caveats aside, this was a super interesting podcast because what I really

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,240
wanted to talk about was not just their stories and their lives, which I think are very interesting

40
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,160
and touch on so many of these themes that I've become quite interested in. If you've

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,260
seen either Bigger Stronger Faster or Prescription Thugs, you'll know that their older brother

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,200
Mike died. And they talk about that quite openly in this podcast. And it's actually

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,960
quite, it's quite touching and it's actually quite emotional. Chris gets kind of emotional

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,320
at one point during this and it's sort of palpable in the room as we're talking about

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,600
it. They talk a lot about their parents, their upbringing. I obviously am completely

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,240
fascinated as to what kind of upbringing could produce such remarkable human specimens and

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,720
they are remarkable human specimens. Let's make no mistake about that. I also get into

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
some of the details about like their training and very fascinating to understand like how

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,560
relatively low volume their training was and yet how it produced such remarkable achievements.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,240
So I guess I would say the following. If you've never heard of these guys and you're

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,720
not that interested in powerlifting or strength training, I still think you will find this

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,240
interesting though there may be some parts you want to fast forward through once we get

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,600
into the technical details of some of their lifts. If you have any interest in strength

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,320
training, you're going to want to get to know a lot about these guys. And one of the things

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
I actually learned in the interview, I hadn't even done enough homework before the interview

56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,480
to know this is the YouTube channel that Mark Bell has, which I've since looked at and it's

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,440
an incredible resource for someone who is trying to learn how to do the major lifts

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:50,600
correctly. So without further ado, here is my interview with Mark and Chris Bell.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,960
Mark, Chris, thank you so much for making time to talk to me about this kind of stuff

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,440
today. Thank you. You know, this is kind of unusual for me. It's two firsts. It's the

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,560
first time I've interviewed two people simultaneously and also interviewed people that I don't know

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,120
much prior to this, but I kind of feel like I know you guys for you. Please do. You can

63
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,120
only interview one person at a time. Oh, you've learned this during the documentary.

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,200
It's just the way it is. So if we both talked at the exact same time, then this would not

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,800
work. Could be trouble. We will try to keep that in mind, but I do feel like a kind of

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,240
know you guys, which is weird. That's I'm sure something that you guys have experienced

67
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,560
before when someone's watched one of your films or seen a documentary that you've been

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,180
in or a part of, and it's sort of like they meet you and they sort of think they know

69
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,780
something about you, right? It's like, well, I know what this guy's all about because he

70
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,680
said XYZ. And so I'll try to free myself up from that. I get a lot of hugs because of

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,640
it. People like, I feel like I know you. Can I give you a hug? Yeah. It just depends on

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,240
who it is, whether or not I like that or not. When people do that, what are they thanking

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,720
you for? Because I'm sure people do thank you a lot. It's a really bizarre thing. I

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,020
never thought anybody would thank me for like making a movie, but I guess it's had

75
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,900
a profound effect on their life. So they say, thank you for making that with my film, Prescription

76
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,960
Thugs, for example. A lot of people will see that and realize, oh, you know, I have an

77
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,540
opioid problem. I have a drug problem and they'll go do something about it. So I think

78
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,960
with Bigger, Stronger, Faster is like more getting off your ass and going to do something

79
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,320
with your life and wanting to be somebody. You know, that's something that I think is

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,120
really important to a lot of people trying to prove that you're not just another bum

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
from the neighborhood.

82
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,960
And the thing about Bigger, Stronger, Faster that I found so appealing and surprising,

83
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,560
and I think that's, I would guess, at least part of the reason why 10 years later it's

84
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,760
still endured, is the vulnerability of it. You didn't hide your own issues, your family's

85
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,680
struggles. I'm sure I'm not the first person to say this, but your parents come across

86
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,100
as like the two most lovable people on the planet. Like I actually didn't have the urge

87
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,680
to hug you, but if I walked in here and saw your mom, I would absolutely have to give her

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,560
a big hug. You know what I mean?

89
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Yeah, absolutely.

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,880
Was that designed or did you, that just happened by accident that you realized, hey, I'm just

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
going to show my family.

92
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,880
It was really weird. When we did the movie, we had a lot of great people helping out.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
My philosophy is like, go find the best people and do it. So like, if you're going to make

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,680
a documentary, I was like, who's, who's a good documentary filmmaker? Oh, Michael Moore,

95
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,520
he's won an Oscar for Bowling for Columbine. I thought Bowling for Columbine was one of

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,080
the best, whether you agree with the politics of it or not, that's not the point. The point

97
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
is it's one of the best written documentaries I've ever seen. And I actually won an Academy

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,840
Award for the writing of it and it really inspired me. And I just said, I want to make

99
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,040
a movie about steroids, so I want to adopt the same style. So I watched Bowling for Columbine.

100
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,680
I literally wrote out every scene from Bowling for Columbine and then tried to define what

101
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,520
that would be if it was about steroids, like what that particular scene would be. And in

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,160
doing that developed like this style. And then I actually brought people in that worked

103
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,400
on that movie. So the editor of Bowling for Columbine was an editor and a help on our

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,840
movie as well. And that's sort of how I got into making the movie about steroids. That's

105
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,880
how I approached it was getting the best people and putting them in the right spot. So I had

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,640
learned a lot like in the course of making the movie as well. Well, he directed the cameras

107
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,880
at us once he started to get into some of the basics of the film. I think for a long

108
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
time you were kicking around the idea of he knew that there's something magical about

109
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,960
Gold's Jim Venice. And he knew something was magical about a lot of the things that we're

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,600
doing the environment we're in. But it wasn't until he got into some of the actual ideas

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,200
of what the film ended up becoming to where he started running through these different

112
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,320
scenarios with his producers. And he's like, yeah, you know, my brother's you know, my

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,520
brother Mark does this my brother Mike, you know, he was doing that. And you know, I did

114
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,120
this and they were like, wait, hold on a second. Your brothers are taking steroids right now.

115
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,080
And he's like, yeah. And he's like, they're like, that's we need to we need to get that

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,720
on film. Yeah. And the point I was getting to is those people that worked on these other

117
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,280
great movies were the ones that defined that to me. So when I was on the phone with my

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,800
producer Alex Bono, I was like, Hey, you know, you know, my brother's Mark's on steroids

119
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,560
and Mike's on steroids and I'm in the middle and I'm just trying to figure it out. And

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,320
as soon as I said that, he was like, that's the movie right there. That's exactly what

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,760
the movie is. It's like you're the middle brother and you're conflicted whether or not

122
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,720
you should take these drugs or not, regardless of whether you've tried them in the past,

123
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
you tried them once you felt a little guilty. Let's just tell that story. And what I found

124
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,200
is in making films, just being honest and telling the actual real story that's going

125
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,880
on is the best place to be. Right now we're embarking on a documentary about nutrition

126
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,120
and I keep going back to like, keep trying to manufacture what the movie should be in

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,440
my head. And I'm like, going back to it should just be what is going on right now. What exactly

128
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,280
is going on right now? I'm conflicted about my diet. I don't know how I should eat. I'm

129
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,240
trying to find answers and that's really what it should be. The most honest representation

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,520
of that and not a representation of like, here's what I think about the ketogenic diet

131
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,840
and here's why you have to do it. And so by taking this approach, I think it's allowed

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,200
us to be pretty open minded about the whole thing. There's something about that movie

133
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
also that I've watched it obviously probably half a dozen times, if not more. And each

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,480
time I see it, I'm struck by this feature, which is the empathy with which you approach

135
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,040
people. Even when I think the viewer can tell, like you don't necessarily agree. So

136
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,580
I'm blanking on the boy's name, but the high school kid who'd killed himself. That's right.

137
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,440
When you spoke with his father, that's a very touching scene because if you're watching

138
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
that purely through the lens of what the research and the data would say, it's pretty clear

139
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,400
that steroids probably had nothing to do with that tragedy. And that boy might've ended

140
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,200
up in that situation with or without steroids. But at the same time, I think if I were doing

141
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,840
that interview, I worry that I would have come across as condescending or like a no

142
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,040
at all. But I was very touched by the fact that that wasn't at all the case.

143
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah, you didn't press the issue at all. The guy just said it. The guy said steroids had

144
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,600
nothing to do with my son's death. And that was that. And I thought it was spectacular

145
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360
as well when you're watching it, like that interviewer right there, even though it's

146
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
my brother, he had an opportunity to kind of jump on that guy. Like, wait a second,

147
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,160
how could you say that? But it never goes any further than that. And it shouldn't need

148
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
to ask the beauty because you were able to sort of look, there are people where you can

149
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,160
cross examine them, but you don't cross examine the father who's lost his son. Like there's

150
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,360
there's absolutely no role for that. And so there's a certain level of civility that I

151
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
think there were other questions where I'm like, there's I think other ways to approach

152
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,140
it, right, rather than go, I'm going to jump down his throat, say, well, why don't I just

153
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,940
pose a question to him that is comparative, saying like, Hey, look, your son died from

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,380
steroids. That's what you're saying. That's what you're telling me. He died from steroids.

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,480
But also like, you know, my brother died in a sober living facility and drugs were involved.

156
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,020
And so like, I'm trying to compare and in his case, I was like, well, hey, look, you

157
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,140
know, you're gonna have a steroid awareness night in this baseball stadium, where fathers

158
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,980
are going with their four year old kid, and they go and they drink six beers, and then

159
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,180
they drive the kid home. And it's like, you know, what's the difference there? Isn't that

160
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,940
ironic? And so I was just trying to like figure out ways to not be mean spirited to

161
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,500
the guy, but yet like, sort of come across where it's like, just make some points to

162
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,300
him. And hopefully, like, it'll sink in with them. I don't know if it ever did or not.

163
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,620
I don't know if it does or not. But that's sort of my approach is to like, not really

164
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,980
go in there with a mindset of like, I'm going to destroy this person. Because think about

165
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,100
it all realistically, we are all human beings. We're all in this big soup together, we're

166
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,140
all here, we're all on this planet together, and we all have to function together. So like,

167
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,420
to pick a side and stand there just doesn't seem to make any sense. And what makes more

168
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,060
sense is like, when this movie is over, that guy is still a human being, he still has a

169
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,460
family, he still has things going on, right. And so I'm not trying to destroy that guy,

170
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,780
I just want to try to figure out what his point is and move past it. And, and so I think

171
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,580
that that's, you know, my philosophy is to try to try to keep the peace so that after

172
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,220
the film, we can still continue to have a relevant and smart, intelligent conversation

173
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
about the subject matter.

174
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,420
So I remember seeing the movie for the first time, probably in 2009. And I really I'm not

175
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,820
saying this, just because you're sitting here, but I really do credit that documentary with

176
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,380
being the thin end of the wedge that got me to begin to revisit a set of beliefs that

177
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,180
I had just taken for granted. So one of the challenges of medicine is, it's not necessarily

178
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,820
a discipline that's full of critical thought. And part of that is just the nature of you,

179
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,340
there's too much stuff you got to learn, you know, so you can't approach it through

180
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,260
the lens of intellectual curiosity all the way. It's just these are a set of facts, cholesterol

181
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,180
causes heart disease. Well, maybe it turns out to be the light, but proteins and inflammation

182
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,800
and a few other things. But look, the zero-thorter answer is, and of course, one of those hugely

183
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,340
dogmatic things is anabolic steroids, that's got to be like one of the most dangerous things

184
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,620
on the planet. And so all through my medical training, I've never really given this any

185
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,780
thought. And I just sort of assumed that stuff's got to be bad. And I even remember as a kid,

186
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,060
when Lyle Alzado died, I remember the cover of Sports Illustrated, I distinctly remember

187
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,700
the day he died. I had just come home from a run. It must've been the hottest day of

188
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,700
the summer. And I remember like, you know, reading the newspaper about it and it was

189
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,420
like, it was pretty clear, like Lyle Alzado died because he took steroids. And I was in

190
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,180
high school at the time and it was like, steroids are bad. Your movie comes along and I collect

191
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,420
quotes, right? So I've got, I have a file of just my favorite quotes. I'm going to read

192
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,900
you one of my favorite quotes, which I think applies to so many things we do. This was

193
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,340
John F. Kennedy said this, I believe at a Yale commencement in 1961, for the greatest

194
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,820
enemy of truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the

195
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:46,420
myth persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our

196
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,980
forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort

197
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,420
of opinion without the discomfort of thought.

198
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,500
That was before we got a man on the moon, huh?

199
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Oh yeah. That was when the man on the moon was an idea. So when I think about bigger,

200
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,100
stronger, faster, through the lens of that, I realize that my understanding of steroids

201
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,180
was primarily the comfort I had of opinion. It was an opinion that had been passed down

202
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,660
and passed down and passed down, but I actually hadn't really submitted myself to the discomfort

203
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,740
of thought. And I don't think your movie is meant to necessarily make the case that, hey,

204
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,140
steroids are good, steroids are bad. I mean, that's also part of the beauty of the movie

205
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,420
is the way it ends with you, Mark, is actually a very powerful ending. Super powerful. Like

206
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,420
the last scene of that movie is one of the most powerful things ever because it deliberately

207
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,180
doesn't try to say, here's the answer. But what it did, at least for me, was it said,

208
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,220
dude, I don't actually know Jack about this topic. So before I form an opinion, I might

209
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,060
be wise to start thinking about it.

210
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,900
One of the interesting things about filmmaking is we come across these things by accident.

211
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,900
We were editing the movie and my editor left the computer on one day and went back to the

212
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,220
computer and there's my dad and my mom and they're like, yeah. And they're like, they're

213
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,340
cheering after Mark one thing and we're looking at it like, that's an awesome shot to end

214
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,900
the movie on. Like it's like the family and we're like, look at Mark, he's on steroids.

215
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,540
Like he's awesome. You know, and, and that kind of feeling, you know, and see him hit

216
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,660
a few more dingers, that part with the Simpsons. And so when you're making a movie, there's

217
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,700
a lot of happy accidents. Like people go, you're a brilliant for, you went out and got

218
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,340
these day laborers and you brought them in your house and you guys made supplements in

219
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,900
your kitchen. Those guys worked outside my office. They were there every day and every

220
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,180
day I joked like, I'm going to just get these guys to make my supplements for me. And I

221
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,140
just joke around like, is this a joke? Then when it came around at the time where we have

222
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,100
to shoot a scene, I'm like, why don't I hire those guys? They're, they're so cool every

223
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,260
day. I'd like to put some money in their pocket. So I paid them a hundred bucks to come make

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,100
supplements with me for that. No idea what was going on. And I'm sure they probably still

225
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,900
don't know that they're even in a movie, but they were, and they were, they were an awesome

226
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,420
part of it. It just shows you, it just shows you how wide open this, this industry is and

227
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,420
like how things aren't what they seem. You know, you think like, oh, a supplement must

228
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,940
be made in some factory with everything's all through the FDA. And it's like, no, it's

229
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,660
not the world's just not like that. You know? So prescription thugs sort of carries on in

230
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,460
the theme of the same type of investigation, but also it's very, very personal. Yeah. It's

231
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:30,380
a little darker. You know, I remember the first time I saw it, I was confused at the

232
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,580
very beginning because I was like, but wait, their brother died. Why is, did they film

233
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,980
this earlier than I thought? And then I realized, of course, no, that was B roll. Basically

234
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,020
that was, that was film you had before you started making prescription. Yeah. Yeah. And

235
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,580
so, um, right off the bat in the beginning, I was like, I want to make this movie. And

236
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,100
I just remember had his phone call with my dad and my dad's like, my dad was crying and

237
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,500
he doesn't cry that often. Mark will tell you, right? And you don't hear him cry. He

238
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,620
was kind of like, I'm crying twice choked up pretty much. And he said, this is the legacy.

239
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,380
This is it, Chris. This is like, this is what your brother meant in bigger, stronger, faster.

240
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,700
When he said, I know there's something out there that for the world to hear, but I don't

241
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,380
know what it is. He's like, this is the message, the message that you don't need drugs and

242
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,420
ball, right? And what was really fascinating about that is my dad comes back around full

243
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,020
circle again, the point where, um, I was in trouble and I wasn't doing too well. My dad

244
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,820
called me and said, only time he's ever yelled at me and he said, I don't know what's wrong

245
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,420
with you, but you're a drug addict or an alcoholic or something. There's something going on with

246
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:39,060
you and I can't figure it out, but you're not right. And I just cried for an hour afterwards,

247
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,740
you know, just like, Oh shit. I let my dad down. Like that's the worst feeling I get

248
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,420
choked up now talking about. I was like, the worst feeling you could possibly have is like

249
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,060
you let your father down. And so for me, he was very instrumental in just being there

250
00:18:53,060 --> 00:19:00,060
for me and being like for him to show his anger just once, I think is what saved my

251
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,780
life. Do you remember that time Mark, when he was going through some stuff? Yeah, of

252
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:11,420
course. Yeah, it was hard. You know, we are, we already lost one and, uh, you know, I,

253
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,820
I guess one thing that's important to share with everybody is that it's never over. People

254
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,740
ask a lot of questions about success or getting jacked or bench press in more way. Uh, you

255
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,100
could take steroids and you can do all these different programs and you can do all these

256
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,940
different diets, but it's never over. You never, there's never a spot you get to and

257
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,220
you're like, fuck yeah, this is perfect. This is where I wanted to be. I'm going to hang

258
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,700
out right here. Every once in a while you catch glimpses of your own set of greatness,

259
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,700
right? And it feels good, but with his battle, it took so much support and it's still, it's

260
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,380
still, it's still a lot of support. There's still a lot of, he's come such a long way,

261
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,380
but there's still a lot of healing that has to continue to happen for his life to be as

262
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,620
prosperous as it possibly can be. And for him to reach, he has a lot of big goals, but

263
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,700
he's not even halfway to some of these big goals because he's still in the healing process

264
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,100
and he's heading towards all those things now, which is amazing to see after where he

265
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:19,100
came from. But it was almost like his life kind of restarted that 40 years old or so.

266
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,860
And his girlfriend at the time called me and it was a weird number. I don't even really

267
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,420
answer my phone that often, but I was just like, this is a weird hour night. It wasn't

268
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,540
too late, but most people don't really call me past like seven, eight o'clock. It was

269
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,020
like nine, 10 o'clock. And you know, I hear this voice on the other side, just real frantic

270
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,820
and really upset. And I was like, didn't understand who it was. And then started talking about

271
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,100
Chris and I was like, Oh, it's Lauren. Okay. That's why the phone number's from the East

272
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,820
coast and stuff like that. So, so then I said, okay, well, where, you know, where is he?

273
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,580
What's going on? Can you calm down? I can tell me more. And I guess he was inside their

274
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,900
apartment. She was outside the apartment and she just didn't know how she was going to

275
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,420
find him. Like what condition he would be in. And I said, well, as bad as it could possibly

276
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,180
be, I was like, you're the only like family he has there. I was like, I need you to go

277
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,540
and check it out, you know, because if he's really sick or if something happened, we need

278
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,100
to figure out a way to try to handle it. And so I said, make sure you just take his key,

279
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,140
remove his keys from the house. That way he doesn't go anywhere. And I said, and call

280
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,820
me back and let me know that he's still alive. You know, so she called me back. She was still

281
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,780
kind of hysterical. She's like, he's still alive, but he's passed out. I took his keys

282
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,620
and I talked to my wife, Andy, who just somehow always knows the right thing to do or the

283
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,100
right thing to say. And I talked to her about it. She goes, we're going to book him a flight.

284
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,660
We're going to get him up here and we need to book Lauren a flight too, because if we

285
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,060
don't book both of them, he's not going to come. He probably won't be able to get to

286
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,820
the airport in the morning and he'll probably just figure out a way to miss the flight and

287
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,420
we're going to get him here and we're going to safe proof everything around us and we're

288
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,100
going to figure out a way to help him. And that's what we did. We flew him to Sacramento.

289
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,900
I had a long time family friend that was an alcoholic herself and she explained to

290
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,700
me, you know, some of the things that we're going to go through through that process.

291
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,020
She gave me the place to send them for, what is that? Where are you going? Detox. Detox.

292
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,100
There we go. For like three or four days, you know, they take your phone and they give

293
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:40,460
you certain pills and it's very strict regimen and thing. No contact with anybody. And you

294
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,460
know, that set everything in motion. But what I always try to share with people, it's

295
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,880
a very long process. Even though that was only three days, it then led into him going

296
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,060
into rehab for another 60 or 70 days. And then it was just constant communication, trying

297
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,860
to figure out what he wants, what he needs. I think the coolest thing that came from it

298
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,620
all was sitting down with him and we had kind of this intervention thing, which really fucking

299
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,260
pissed me off because he didn't remember any of it, but he did say some things in there

300
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,900
that were, that really helped a lot. It helped me a lot and it helped everybody understand

301
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,300
a lot better of what was going on. And he said, I feel alone. And when he said that

302
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,980
I was like, I understand he's in LA and he doesn't, you know, he kind of has a girlfriend,

303
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,420
but he doesn't have us. We're not there. He flies up here for Thanksgiving, but he doesn't

304
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,780
have family. All he has is a bunch of fake ass motherfuckers around him that are in Los

305
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:43,020
Angeles. That's what Los Angeles is made of. Sorry, LA, but LA is like that. People

306
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,580
come and go in your life in a flash. I mean, they do in regular life, no matter where you

307
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,460
live, but you see that a lot in Los Angeles. You just meet a lot of people that are striving

308
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,220
to be actors, actresses, and you find out that most of these people are full of shit

309
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,460
a lot of times. Every single day you meet the person that's going to change your life or

310
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,540
they have the deal for you, you know, every day. But anyway, you know, we were able to

311
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:09,980
just surround him. My parents obviously played a huge role in all that and we were able to,

312
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,780
you know, have them here still today, what, five years later, four years later, four years

313
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,180
later. Yeah, it's weird because even thinking back to those times, like that's just not

314
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,540
the same person. You know, it's just a completely different person. I was, I guess I was in

315
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:29,300
that body, but I wasn't registered in that body. You know, like now I feel like just

316
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,180
a completely different human being altogether than I was a couple of years ago. You know,

317
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,380
I think that you have to go through some of these things to get, like if you want to,

318
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,300
for me, there are certain things that I wanted in life and there were certain things I had

319
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,180
to go through to get it, you know, and I never wanted to be a drug addict or an alcoholic,

320
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,700
but I thank God for it because I think that it's helped me to really help other people,

321
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,940
you know, and that's sort of the bigger goal is like, well, how can I use all this to help

322
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,340
you? You know, how can I use it to help other people? Like all, all I'm doing, I was inspired

323
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,620
when I was a young kid to lift weights and do, you know, do these things. And so when

324
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,100
I got older and I realized that it was all bullshit, I made bigger, stronger, faster.

325
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,380
You know, I just wanted to help people understand what we want. We have the coolest people in

326
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,700
the world asking us questions all the time. Joe Rogan's texting him asking about the carnivore

327
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,420
diet. Donald Trump Jr. is asking me how to improve his squat. I mean, there's some crazy

328
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,860
weird shit. I don't know if he's the coolest person in the world, but there's some crazy

329
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,180
weird shit going on though. Yeah. You know, that, you know, who were kind of unlikely heroes,

330
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,900
I guess, in some weird way. It's really crazy. The kind of people, even, even being able

331
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,100
to talk to you, it's like you're somebody I've listened to every podcast. We've been

332
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,540
chasing him down for some time. I've read everything. You know, like I read all the

333
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,060
blogs. I'm like, I, I just consume this stuff like crazy. So even though like be able to

334
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,080
talk to you is to me amazing. And I think that that's something that if we can spread

335
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,420
that message to other people that, you know, look, get involved in something, be proactive

336
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,540
about it, be excited, get other people on your team and go for it in life. And it doesn't

337
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,660
matter what you do, but to me, that's what makes our life fun is like now I have all

338
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,260
this opportunity to do all these, you know, fun things like Mark and I are going to go

339
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,020
see Joe Rogan perform tomorrow night. Tell me that's amazing to be able to get invited

340
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,580
to do something like that from somebody like Joe. And he's like, Hey, you guys want to

341
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,900
come? Of course we want to go. You know, and that to me is what it's all about. And what

342
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,500
it's all about is like, I just told you about when we did prescription thugs. Well, my partner

343
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,900
on prescription thugs who's sitting right across the room is Greg Young, GB Young and

344
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Greg on prescription thugs saved my life. He was the person who was able to communicate

345
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,940
with the other producers that Chris is in trouble. We have a man down, but he's not

346
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,660
going to die and he wants to save the movie. So he could have easily went to the other

347
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,380
producers who was actually Peter Billingsley, who was the little kid in Christmas story.

348
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,020
Ralphie, he was our producer, but he went to Ralphie and he said, Hey, Chris is going

349
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,620
to be okay, but he's in a rehab and we got a man down and this is serious business and

350
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,020
we got to take care of it. And so because he did that, obviously has this loyalty to

351
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,700
us when it came around to make this film that we're making about nutrition, we brought Greg

352
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,300
on Greg when he started was about 330 pounds and now he weighs about 280. So he's already

353
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,780
lost about 50 pounds just doing like a keto diet and, and he comes and trains with us.

354
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,500
And so to me, that's what it's really all about is like getting in there and helping

355
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,460
somebody else change your life because I know Greg well, and I know what he's going to do

356
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,060
is he's going to turn around. He's already told the next three people that are going

357
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,900
to tell the next three people until the next three people. And all it is, is we're getting

358
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,460
people on the side of being healthy. That's all we're trying to do as mental health has

359
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,180
improved big time. He's more determined. He's in the gym now. He's never been in the gym

360
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,460
before, which that takes a lot of courage to even work up the steps just to even get

361
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,580
your butt in a gym. And before he said he didn't even want to get up off the couch.

362
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,660
And you know, the thing with, with it is like, we're not really selling anything. We're just

363
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,500
trying to, trying to help people with their lifestyle. Mark sells products, obviously,

364
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,740
and that, that allows us to be able to do these things, which I think is a really cool

365
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,540
thing. Yeah. Our, our X for everything is 10 minute walks, go lift some weights, stop

366
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,460
being so fat, stop eating such gross foods. You know, like that's, that's our prescription

367
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,020
for everything. Yeah. But again, I think what's interesting is it doesn't come across at least

368
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,620
to me. And maybe that's cause I've gotten to know you guys a little bit since you first

369
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,020
reached out to me, but it really doesn't come across as the way a lot of people in the fitness

370
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,660
space come across, which is again, I'm not going to name names, although I've got a long

371
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,060
list of people that I think are complete and total douche bags in the space.

372
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,620
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Occasionally my Twitter account will release my criticisms of some

373
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,100
such individuals, but you know, there's this sense of, look, you just got to work harder,

374
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,260
you know, without acknowledging, Hey man, if you're down in the dumps, if you're 330

375
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,900
pounds and you're eating poorly and you're sitting on the couch, like it's not just a

376
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,180
matter of willpower. Like you have to make some other changes to at least get the inertia

377
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,940
to make these changes. And I, again, I just think it comes down to this, I suspect it

378
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,180
comes down to something you can only learn having suffered.

379
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,660
You know, what's amazing to me is like, uh, through doing this, like Greg's a guy that

380
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,300
I work with, you become closer to the people too. And so you also, you're drawing your

381
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,540
friends in more right here, rather than, than like pushing your friends out and excluding

382
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,900
them from things like you're sort of including them now and everything. And it's easier to

383
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,180
be friends with somebody that has the same dietary habits as you, it's easier to be friends

384
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,820
with somebody that does the same things as you has the same habits. And like, if I want

385
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,980
to be successful, I'm not going to let their bad habits sway me in a bad way. I'd rather

386
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,260
let my good habits sway them.

387
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,540
And building on that, I think it's also, I think people sort of don't realize that once

388
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,500
you start to let down sort of barriers and you can sort of communicate this vulnerability

389
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,060
about your own struggle in this case, it's amazing what that does for other people, because

390
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,060
I think many, many of us kind of go around thinking we're the only ones struggling with

391
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,500
problem X or problem Y. Uh, you know, I've talked about David Foster Wallace a number

392
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,380
of times. He's sort of someone I obviously never had the luxury of meeting, but I love

393
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,660
his work. And he's talked about this so eloquently, right? Which is every single one of us is

394
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,420
only experiencing the world from our own vantage point. We only know what's in our head. We

395
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,940
only know what we see. And it's so easy to think you are alone, which goes back to what

396
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,580
you said earlier, which is Chris is, he's break, he's, he's falling apart because he

397
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
feels alone.

398
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,260
Perspective is such a huge thing. And a lot of times it's easy to be judgmental, but I

399
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,580
think about my own life. And I think I had to what I can would consider perfect parents.

400
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,300
Both my parents were there for everything. My dad was like our baseball coach. And I

401
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,700
can't remember my dad ever telling me, no, that he couldn't hang out with me or throw

402
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,580
a football around with me or whatever. I can't remember a time where my mom didn't cook dinner.

403
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,300
Like, you know, they were just, just around. There was no shortage of, we can't complain,

404
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,900
no shortage of like resources, basketballs, weights, money, no shortage of hugs, no shortage

405
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,180
of love, no shortage of encouragement. So when somebody asked me certain questions about

406
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,060
whether it's my lifting or whatever, my lifting, you know, I, I started out in a way different

407
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,180
spot than maybe somebody else. Maybe somebody else grew up with abusive parents. Maybe they

408
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:25,220
didn't even find fitness until they were 40. Whereas I found it at 12 because we had it

409
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,740
in our basement because I was privileged enough to have parents that were always heading in

410
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,540
the right direction, always trying to do right by the family. And we're really trying

411
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,460
to, you know, build, build towards something. Whereas there's other people that maybe their

412
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,460
dad wasn't around, maybe their mom wasn't around, maybe their alcoholics, maybe they're

413
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,460
being abused or who, who know the list of things is unbelievable. But your starting point is,

414
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,140
is a big factor in where you start to end up.

415
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,700
And Mark talks about that a lot. And I think that that's the, you know, he said, he says

416
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,180
not everybody starts at the same spot. And so we can't really compare ourselves to other

417
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,860
people. Mark and I right now are training with Michael Hearn. Michael Hearn is a freak

418
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,500
ever since he was 14 years old. He looked like a professional bodybuilder, right? So

419
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,260
he's not just having the worst transformation in the history of the world. Cause at 14 or

420
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:17,020
actually actually more like 16 or 17, he looks the same as he does now at 48. Yeah. So he's

421
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,060
always been jacked. So exactly. And so, you know, for us, we're like, man, we, if we were

422
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,740
to compare ourselves to him, we'd just feel like crap every day. If I compare myself to

423
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,300
Mark, I'm going to feel like crap every day. Cause he's bigger than me and stronger than

424
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,820
me and leaner than me right now. He's, he's getting ready to do a bodybuilding show. But

425
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,020
you know, in my head, my goal is to try to beat him. You know, like we're, we're still

426
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,500
brothers. So in my, in my head, I'm starting way back from him and I'm not comparing myself

427
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,060
to him, but I still in, in some weird way go like, man, I hope I surpass him somehow.

428
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,820
I hope I can sneak in. I'm hoping he, you know, after his bodybuilding show, he has

429
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,740
been too many days of cheating, you know, and I can still beat him in something. But

430
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,500
I used to always beat him in powerlifting. I used to tell him emphatically, you will

431
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,500
never be as strong as me. I would, I would tell him, you'll, you won't even get in within

432
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,900
a hundred pounds of my bench press. And for a while that was like so true. And then now

433
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm not even close to him. So it's like, it's funny how those things happen and can reverse

434
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,580
never say never. Yeah. Never say never. Right.

435
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,180
To me, the journey's kind of everything. My brother, he has a more eloquent way of saying

436
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,580
it and I'll sort of bastardize it, but the gist of it is you don't judge a man by where

437
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,500
he stands. You judge him by how far he's traveled to get there. And yeah, I always thought of

438
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,140
that. I mean, I, he said this even when we were young and I remember, I think I just

439
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,780
always grew up with such a chip on my shoulder that whenever I sort of felt myself being

440
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,380
compared to someone who was better than me or I would assume was more privileged than

441
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,140
me, I would not necessarily verbalize it, but internally I would think, well, screw

442
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,140
them. I've traveled way, I might not be where they are, but I've traveled way further to

443
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,860
get here. And you know, I have always been in negative energy. It doesn't help your situation.

444
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,740
Totally. Totally. Right. And I'm still kind of, you know, completely fascinated by whatever

445
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,700
it is that motivated the three of you as brothers to be, you know, trying to be anything other

446
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,260
than ordinary. And again, I don't think anybody just wakes up and says, I'm programmed to

447
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,380
be ordinary, but you know, you guys have accomplished kind of remarkable things. I mean, I want

448
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,700
to come back and talk about the physical stuff because it is, I'd like to be able to put some

449
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,740
of that in perspective for people who don't really fully understand what some of these

450
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,460
lifts mean. And so we'll certainly come to that. But it's interesting because it's not the

451
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,580
story I would have expected, right? What I would have expected is something in childhood

452
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,100
wounded you guys, you know, and it's like your entire adult life has been a way to cope with

453
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,260
some pain and that's been channeled into mostly positive things. But then sometimes it's gone

454
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,060
off the rails. Like that's the narrative I would construct if I didn't have any background.

455
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,740
I really honestly, when I when I said January 23rd, 1984, it was a day that changed my life

456
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:03,340
forever. I meant it. I really meant it. When Hulk Hogan beat the Iron Sheik, we were we

457
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,540
were fanatics. We were nuts, man. We were like, well, that's so loved it so much. And

458
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,340
we wanted to be part of that without all we could see as ourselves inside of a wrestling

459
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,500
ring. We had the ability to dream because our dad provided and mom provided that for

460
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,140
us. That's all we had to worry about as kids was to dream big. That's it. That was the

461
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,620
only thing when I remember like the smell. I remember I remember everything about like

462
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,980
getting our first Nintendo, you know what I mean? I remember all these different things.

463
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,380
I remember watching that match. You know, I don't know how old I was. Yeah. Seven. I

464
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,220
don't know. There's such a difference. I really remember those. Those are really strong memories

465
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,780
for us. And I don't know. There's there's just such a difference from when we got involved

466
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,980
in watching wrestling to before it. Like I don't I don't remember anything before it.

467
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,220
I just remember the I actually don't even remember to tell you the truth. Not even January

468
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,420
23rd. It was before that January 23rd was the big day where Hulk Hogan pinned the cheek.

469
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,060
But before that, this was WrestleMania one. Correct. That was before that. Even this is

470
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,780
1984. WrestleMania one or 87. No. 85 85. WrestleMania one was WrestleMania one with Hulk Hogan and

471
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,580
Mr. T. It was the year after. Yeah, it was after he had to develop for you or whatever.

472
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,460
Yeah. Before that, Mark and I were watching wrestling and Mark used to have to hold the

473
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,700
clothes hanger. We had a metal clothes hanger that was attached to the antenna of my job that

474
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,460
we could get, you know, so that the TV coming. I can't really watch it. I could kind of be like,

475
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,540
he had to like hold it. But he was only like five seriously was like five or six. And Mike was two

476
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,620
years older than you. Yeah. Year and a half older than me. You're four years older than Mark. Yeah.

477
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:38,220
So he was like a little kid. He's like five. Maybe I'm 10. Right. And Mad Dog's like 12. And we're

478
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,220
watching wrestling and we're watching this body slam challenge every time Big John Studd would

479
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,340
come out and they hold up the bag full of money and they'd be like, we're going to $25,000 body

480
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:55,100
slam challenge. The smallest bag for some reason. Yeah. Tiny little bag and dollars in there too.

481
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,340
Not even hundreds. And we're like excited. Like who's going to try it this week? And we know the

482
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,060
guy's never going to get them and body slam them. Who's going to get them this week? And it's like

483
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,820
Chief J Strongbow. So we're kind of bummed out like, ah, Chief J Strongbow. He's not going to do

484
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,900
shit, you know? So Chief J Strongbow like walks out and he's standing there and he just starts

485
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,300
shaking his head like, no, he's like, got his hands crossed. He's like, no. And he turns around

486
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,500
and Andre the Giant walks out behind him and we're like, oh my God, it's Andre. And we were so excited

487
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,940
with the Andre was going to come down and slam them and take the money. But it was even better

488
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,260
because Andre came down and tried to slam them. And then the manager smashed him in the back and

489
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,980
Andre took the money and threw it out to the whole crowd. To us, like those moments were like bigger

490
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,540
than life. They were the hugest things that happened. It was like so much to where we would,

491
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,020
my dad would always, you know, say, Hey, if you guys want to do something special, I'll do one,

492
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,420
one thing a year. And it was always like, let's go to Madison Square Garden and watch wrestling.

493
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,980
Let's go to WrestleMania. You know, it was always something to do with wrestling. So for us, it was

494
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:59,660
a huge influence on our lives. We're just like what we saw in the movies and on TV. And we lived in.

495
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,020
I do think seeing our dad being a suit and tie every day was not anything that we wanted for

496
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,220
ourselves either. And he worked for IBM and he poured so much into that job. He would do anything

497
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,340
for that company. And he worked there for nearly 20 years. I think right around the time he got to

498
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:22,300
a point where he would get some privileged things upon retiring, like around 19 years or so,

499
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,980
is when they let him go. And it was like, wait, what? Like all this, this work that you put all

500
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,540
this time into, you're just out the door. And he realized it himself like that was a huge lesson

501
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,020
for us. Well, he hadn't he said he, you know, later he told us he had no ownership of anything.

502
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,180
He's like, I didn't own the fucking stapler. I didn't own the paper that they had. I didn't own.

503
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:47,100
He's like, all I owned was myself. So and after that, he I think he had like a knee surgery and

504
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,780
some things. So he went through his own process, but went through probably a lot of personal

505
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,780
development, which maybe he didn't even really realize that he needed to go through because he

506
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,900
was stuck in corporate America. He was like frozen. His brain was frozen in time where it

507
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,060
was corporate America and family, corporate American family, go back and forth between

508
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,700
those two things. It didn't leave time for anything else. But when he lost his job,

509
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,980
I think he paused for a minute, took a breath and said, I'm actually really smart.

510
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,220
I'm going to be an accountant. He was already doing some of that. I'm going to go into real

511
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,020
estate. He picked back up. I think within three years, he was not only making the money, he was

512
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,580
making an IBM, but he was doing it. And then some, our grandfather was an entrepreneur. Our

513
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,580
grandfather could tinker and fix anything. He had a used car lot. And I think a lot of our creativity

514
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,500
in their own backyard. Yeah. Yeah. And his own, yeah. So his own yard. He built his own home,

515
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,940
you know? So when I, when, when I look at my grandpa and I look at my dad, like I feel like

516
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,100
he and I are giant steps backwards compared to what those two are able to accomplish.

517
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,220
Well, there's something you said that I find really quite, quite powerful, which is despite

518
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,380
the fact that your dad was working for the man, busting his ass, he'd give anything for IBM. He

519
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,380
still gave you guys everything. Yeah. You know, you said, absolutely. You never were without a

520
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,460
hug. You never, there was never a moment when you wanted to play with your dad and he wasn't there.

521
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,140
And so my guess is that would make it a lot more palatable when you get shit on by the man.

522
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:20,620
Because can you imagine the guilt that would rest upon you if you're doing all this stuff in service

523
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,540
of your family, right? You're working this hard to provide for your family, obviously.

524
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,060
But in the process, you're, you got to make these hard sacrifices to not spend time with your family.

525
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,460
And then in the end, you get the shafts. That's where my mom came in. She had the strength to

526
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,740
pull them aside one day and say, you're not here enough. And he was like, what? He was like, I'm

527
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,100
trying to be. She's like, yeah, you keep getting these promotions. You keep making more money,

528
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,580
but you're not here. And he was like, Oh my God, I didn't, like he almost, he got lost in it. He

529
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,660
didn't know. And so my mom pulled him back in and, and that, that really helped.

530
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,820
Were your parents athletic when they were growing up?

531
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,700
No, our mom was. My mom was slightly, but she, she came from a family, a big family,

532
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,740
and she was the babysitter. You know, she had a lot of responsibility as a young woman.

533
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,780
Like literally raised.

534
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,300
She raised seven other kids, basically, you know, my grandmother at the time,

535
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,300
my grandmother was going through alcoholism as well. And same with our grandfather. So

536
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,780
our grandfather was the chief of police on my mom's side in the family. And he was dealing with

537
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,140
alcoholism. And he dealt with that up until he died. My grandmother got sober and she'd been

538
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,100
sober for what, like 30 something years, I think when she passed away, which was like last year,

539
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,980
maybe our grandparents lived down the street from each other and we would go.

540
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,020
We didn't realize the dynamics of that until we got older, that my dad and mom met on the bus.

541
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,220
And my dad like winked at my mom or something when they were like 13, but they were literally like

542
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,780
just a few flavors, few football fields away from each other. But when I go to my

543
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,780
mom's side of the family, the house was real dark and you didn't want to hang out there as a kid.

544
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,180
It smelled like alcohol. It smelled like cigarettes and just had unease, just sitting,

545
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,260
just like fogging through the whole household. You just knew you didn't want to be there.

546
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,300
You didn't know why, but you knew you didn't want to be there. No one was mean really, but just,

547
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,060
it was like, kind of like just to be the fighter where everything was like the house is just

548
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,660
depressing. But then we'd go to my dad's side of the family and everything was like bright and

549
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,780
everything's wide open. And somebody's dressed up as Santa Claus on Christmas. Somebody's swinging

550
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,300
around and acts randomly for some reason, some unsupervised kid. And then someone's got a tennis

551
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,940
ball and someone's got a wiffle ball bat. Our grandfather would pull stunts. So he would pull

552
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,100
stunts. Like he'd blow out his birthday candles and the cake would fall through the table. He would

553
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,020
he would just do crazy. And he'd film it. He'd blow the filmmaker. He was a filmmaker. He would

554
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,500
blow him everything. He'd blow his candles and then the cake would go flying across the room and

555
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,220
smash into the wall. And as kids were like, oh my God, he would do things like he'd put like a

556
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,580
little pulley and a string underneath. And he said, when I blow out the candles, I'm gonna make the

557
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,220
cake fly across the room. The kids are gonna go nuts. And it was always my grandfather, every single

558
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,740
year, every single year, and they still do it in our family, you pull the rope because he will

559
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,980
always put the trap for Santa Claus. So the day after Christmas, you pull the rope and you always

560
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,060
get Santa Claus's boot and it's full of candy. And that's what the kids do every single year. And

561
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:16,540
they still do it in our family because my grandfather started those traditions. So we always

562
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,660
when you're like 14, you're like this stupid. Yeah. You're out there like, I gotta still pull the rope.

563
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,420
Yeah. Come on, grandpa. But that's, I think those things that are like are ingrained in us, we had a

564
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,580
great life growing up. We had a fun life growing up. We used to go fishing with our grandfather

565
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:38,380
and things like that. We just grew up close. When did you realize just from the standpoint of

566
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:47,340
strength, you guys weren't normal? I was in 11th grade and I had, so my knees were really bad.

567
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,100
And when I was in 10th grade, yeah. And my knees were really, they just always hurt. And I didn't,

568
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,780
I had no idea why. And so I went to the doctor and the doctor's like, Oh, you got these bone

569
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,940
spurs in your, in your knees. We got to remove them. So he did this like arthroscopic knee surgery.

570
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,540
And I was, I had to be off my feet for, you know, a couple of weeks or whatever. And I, and I did

571
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,540
that, but I was always in pain. I didn't really know why it's because I had arthritis, but I had

572
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,820
no idea when I was younger and nobody diagnosed me with it at all. So I was playing football at the

573
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,300
time. And I went to see this chiropractor who was also our strength coach and he taught me how to

574
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,100
squat. And so it just started out where Mad Dog was going to the gym all the time. He was playing

575
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,740
football and he was really good and he could squat like 400 pounds or something. I just remember.

576
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,700
He was 16. Yeah. He was strong. He was pretty strong. And I was like, and that dog is pretty

577
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,420
strong. And then by the time he's like 18, you know, he was even a little bit stronger. And my

578
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,700
chiropractor, this guy who was trying to help me fix my knees said, well, you know, to fix your

579
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,100
knees, you need to squat. And I said, Oh no, I've been reading the bodybuilding magazines. That's

580
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,620
the last thing you want to do. It's bad for your knees and it hurts your knees. He's like, no,

581
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,100
it doesn't. I've been a power lifter forever. Just trust me to squat. And I was barely into even like

582
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,980
working out. So I started with a broomstick and I just prided myself and going back to that doctor

583
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,860
every day, every time, not every day, but like once a week saying like, Hey, now I did a hundred

584
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,780
pounds. Now I did 110 pounds. And you're how old here? Like 12, 16, 16 at this point. Yeah. And this

585
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:21,180
guy's squat at 700 pounds at around weighing around 16 years old, turning 17 about shit. I started

586
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,940
squatting a broomstick and within six months I'm squatting 315 for like eight reps. People are like,

587
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,780
what is going on with this guy? You know, people in my school were going like, this is weird.

588
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,180
And when you say that you are at this point, are you doing like top of the thighs are breaking

589
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,940
parallel? Like these are power lifting squats pretty much. They were power lifting squats.

590
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,420
There was nobody really just training at the time. But then pretty soon I was up over 500 pounds,

591
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,980
like in high school, squatting over 500 pounds and squatting over 500 pounds for working out,

592
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,940
doing reps. We responded really well to, to not doing a whole lot. So we'd go in the gym

593
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,980
and we'd do one heavy lift and we would leave. And our coach, we had like a guy that was trying

594
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,740
to coach us and he was like, Bell brothers just squat and leave. He's like, you don't even do any

595
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,380
assistance work. We're like, yeah, that's all we need. And he ended up squatting 675 that way at

596
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,660
around 18 or 19 years old. So I don't, so we were like, no, we think it's working. Yeah. I mean,

597
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,620
I think I, you know, I think the fact that, um, less training stimulus helped and we were like

598
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:23,020
really into Mike Menser. We were just talking about him before and Mike Menser was our uncle's

599
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,700
favorite bodybuilder. And he was all about like doing less and getting away with like

600
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,620
just going in and working really hard for a short amount of time. And we took, you know,

601
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,500
took those lessons, but we realized that we were strong early on, but for Mark, what was insane

602
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,140
was there was this day. It's like, this is sort of the day lifting started like the day lifting

603
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:45,980
began like for the whole world, going to like a Rocky montage after. If this was the movie of Mark's

604
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:51,820
life, there's this day where my cousin Steven came over to visit. Steven's like, ah, I can't,

605
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,580
I know I can't bench as much as you, but I know I can probably, I can even his age. Yeah. Steven's

606
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,980
my age. He's like, I'll kill Mark. And I'm like, I don't think you will. And he's like, no, I'll

607
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,780
kill Mark and bench. I can bench like two old family. Yeah. I'll kill Smelly and Ben. And so,

608
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,100
they get on the bench. They start going. It's like 135, 145, 155. We just keep going up and up. And

609
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,180
I'm like, I'm thinking Mark is really getting strong. Like whatever we've been doing, it's

610
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,420
been working. We get up to around two. Oh, doesn't have any idea how strong I am because he's only

611
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,180
had me do sets of like a six to 10 reps usually. And as we were going up in weight, we just kept

612
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,460
adding fives and tens and five and 10, five and 10. I got him on this bench off with my cousin.

613
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,820
My cousin fails at like, I don't know what he failed at, but then like 205 or something.

614
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:42,940
And Mark did like 240 or 250 pounds. At what age? He was probably like 13, 13, maybe 12 or 13,

615
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,500
like young, like, like what the hell is going on here? I definitely didn't look like I could do that.

616
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,220
My mom, actually on the same day, my mom benched 135 and she'd never lifted in her life.

617
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,300
She just picked it up off the. And it was weird too. Because she just was like,

618
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,300
like this and she started laughing all and like sinking into her boobs and everything.

619
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,620
Yeah. Boom. And she just like smashed it out. And we're like, Oh my God.

620
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,580
Yeah. You guys remind me of a family I grew up with, which is just, and it's actually,

621
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,940
sad thing is it's an equally tragic story. So not that anyone listening to this will ever,

622
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,700
I don't know if they'll ever hear this, but their name was the Stuparix. So there was Rob, Matt,

623
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:31,180
Russ, and there was one other Stuparix and they were from another planet in terms of strength.

624
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,140
So, you know, even though boxing was my thing, like I found a great place to lift weights,

625
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,500
which was this Dungy little gym at the university of Toronto that was mostly just grown men power

626
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,460
lifting. And then there was me and my best friend from high school who were like, you know,

627
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,460
they hated the fact that we were there, but by the end they grew to respect those because

628
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,260
they basically got us into power lift. And it's so funny. Everything you say reminds me exactly of

629
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,500
the Stuparix, which were, they literally only benched or squatted or deadlift, nothing else.

630
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:10,780
And their strength was redonkulous. I remember, I think it was Rob at a weight of 185. He had hurt

631
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:17,260
his shoulder so bad that he could only narrow grip bench and he's narrow gripping 385 for 10.

632
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,180
Like here. It's like, cause my shoulder hurts. So I gotta go narrow.

633
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,620
So I gotta go narrow, you know, transmit more of this to my tries. Yeah. And, um,

634
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,340
these guys were freaks of nature. And I don't know if any of this shit was true, but the rumor

635
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,460
was that they were, you know, they came from Viking stock and their mom could apparently

636
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,860
bury any one of their friends in an arm wrestle. If they brought a friend home, that's great. Like

637
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,580
you want to arm wrestle their mom, you're going through the table. Yeah. It's like, it's funny

638
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,940
cause we were like that, but we weren't even the strongest kids in our high school or we weren't

639
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,660
even the strongest kids in our area. Come on in Poughkeepsie. I think it's like in the water or

640
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,900
something. I mean, there was, there were people, we were the strongest. We were by far, we'd kill

641
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,100
people in strength, but, um, we had dudes that were huge in high school that were just like monsters.

642
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,260
That w we went to a pretty big high school. I mean, when I went to school, I was, but you, you were,

643
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,260
you were just smaller. Yeah. Well, a lot of people did steroids on Poughkeepsie. So when I grew up in

644
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:15,100
Poughkeepsie, I had a belt that said Royd sucked on it. It said Royd suck and it would make

645
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,500
everybody in the gym mad because everybody was on the juice and I was stronger than all of them.

646
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,700
And they would get so pissed because they'd see me coming in, squat,

647
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,060
and they'd see the belt, right? Sucks. And I, Oh, you're, you know, you're on shit. Well,

648
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,740
everybody would always say that I was on stuff and I just never was, you know, I just,

649
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,700
it just didn't happen. So to me all growing up, it was funny that we, I ended up making bigger,

650
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,100
stronger, faster. Cause I have that, I had that written in big block letters across the back of

651
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:45,980
my belt, Royd suck. And I ended up making this movie about steroids and talking about how they,

652
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,220
maybe they're not that bad. So how old were you, Chris, when you peaked and what, give me, just

653
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,500
give me, well, first of all, let's take a step back. Thanks a lot. Can one of you guys explain?

654
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,780
You're done. It's all downhill. One of you guys want to take the liberty of explaining to the

655
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,460
listeners what powerlifting is, what Olympic lifting is, why those are sports in and of

656
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,620
themselves. Let Mark do that. He's the expert. All right, Mark, tell us what they are. So, uh,

657
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,660
Olympic lifting is what you might see on TV when the Olympics come around. Powerlifting is not an

658
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:19,580
Olympic sport. Olympic weightlifting is a clean and jerk and the snatch. Those are the exercises

659
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,900
that you do basically involves taking the weight from the floor and figuring out some way to get

660
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,180
it over your head. There's different rules in both of them, but that's the gist of it.

661
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:33,100
You get three attempts on both of those lifts and the accumulation of both of those lifts is

662
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:40,140
called your total. So in powerlifting, you do a squat in this order, bench press, and then a

663
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:46,220
deadlift and you get three attempts at each one of those and accumulation of those that's goes into

664
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,660
what is called a total. Powerlifting is really difficult because it's hard to have leverage on

665
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,780
all three of those movements. Olympic lifting is, is very difficult, but it requires a whole

666
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,060
different skill set. Mobility becomes a big factor. Speed becomes a big factor. You're trying

667
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:08,940
to like basically move your body around the barbell, whereas powerlifting is not even like a good move

668
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:14,140
in the bar. Yeah. Power, it's just not even a good term for it because it's, it's not really a

669
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,900
definition of power, but right. Power has a speed component to it. Yeah, right. Yeah. And you are

670
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,180
doing it as fast as you can, but it's so heavy. It doesn't look fast. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, in

671
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:30,220
powerlifting, you know, for the squat, we're required to try to get our hip crease below where

672
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:36,300
the knee is, which is always in controversy because the human body can't process looking

673
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:41,260
in two places at once. So that rule should have been changed a long time ago, but it never has been.

674
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,660
So that's a squat. When it comes to the bench press, you need to pause the weight on your chest

675
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,060
for a moment. The referee will say press, he pressed the weight back up to full lockout

676
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,660
and the deadlift is pretty simple. You just pick the damn thing up from the ground and

677
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:59,420
until you're able to stand up with it fully erect, as they say. And then they just give you a down

678
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,460
signal and that's powerlifting. And you alluded to something earlier, which your numbers are

679
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,540
actually quite interesting. So, so I was not a particularly good powerlifter. I just did it as

680
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:15,820
sort of ancillary training for let's talk numbers. Yeah. So I weighed, I weighed 158, 160. My bench

681
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:24,620
was my weakest. I think my best was 270 or 275. It's respectable. Let's just say 275. Okay. So my

682
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:34,140
squat was about 495. I think pound for pound, that was my best lift. And my deadlift was about 505.

683
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,140
This is an honest man here. He didn't even give himself the five pound bump on the squat.

684
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,780
So you would agree though, that I was more of a squat deadlift guy than a bench guy. I was a pretty

685
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,300
weak bench guy actually. I was the weakest guy in the gym. You can only be good at one. And we

686
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,540
were really good at bench press. That was our main thing. Yeah. Sometimes you get it too. And sometimes

687
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,700
like somebody might be somewhere in the middle of the road on all three, and then they're able to

688
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:01,740
raise up all three over years and years. But your PRs Mark are remarkable. I don't have them here,

689
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:07,980
but if I recall, you actually benched more than you deadlifted at a PR. So give me your PRs.

690
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,740
First of all, there's kind of two parts to my lifting career or maybe even three parts,

691
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,740
but I guess to make it more simple, I used powerlifting gear, which is a supportive gear

692
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,220
that gives you assistance that allows you to lift more weight. It started out being protective and

693
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,780
then the companies made things more and more extreme. And so therefore you're able to actually

694
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:35,180
lift more weight. I did a 1,080 squat, 854 pound bench press and a 766 pound deadlift.

695
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,100
And that's all in equipped powerlifting. When it comes to raw lifting in the gym,

696
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:47,020
I've squatted 700 pounds raw before I benched 578 in competition. And I think my best deadlift

697
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:53,820
might be like 715, I believe somewhere in that range. So right now that's an interesting

698
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:00,620
distinction. To be clear, raw means no knee wrap. Yeah. So the raw powerlifting that I did was no

699
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:06,940
knee wraps, no squat. So belt only. Belt only. Yeah. Belt wrist wraps. That would be it. Sometimes

700
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:11,260
people still consider knee wraps being raw just because you're not wearing like a squat suit or

701
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:17,180
bench shirt. But yeah, those were the numbers. At that time I was so locked into what I was doing.

702
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,380
I did every and anything that I could to be stronger. You know, I've made the statement before

703
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,740
and it might sound arrogant, but I just said, you know, if you met me at that time, I would

704
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,260
bend the most savage powerlifter you would ever met because not because of my strength. I wasn't

705
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,460
the strongest guy in the world. Although I posted numbers that rivaled some of the strongest guys in

706
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,460
the world for that time, I was as strong as I could be. I don't think I could have squeezed

707
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,020
any more out of that. I pushed it as hard as I could. I got as big and as heavy as I could.

708
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:55,180
I tried eating healthy to get big. I've tried eating disgustingly gross to get big. I've tried

709
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:02,140
to do all kinds of different things and I think I pushed that envelope pretty good. I think maybe

710
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,500
the one thing that could have been a little bit better is I could have slept a little bit better

711
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,220
looking back at it, but I was just so big it was hard to sleep. I think he's right on that. I mean,

712
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:16,060
I know we know a lot of people in powerlifting and he just put everything into it. You know,

713
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,860
there was times where just like even the amount of food he would eat and stuff and I would say like,

714
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,580
aren't you worried about this or that? He's like, I'm just worried about winning. You know, like

715
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:30,860
he wasn't worried about any like everything was so laser focused in on these big lifts and these

716
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,900
big weights and the amount of energy and the amount of seriousness like it was. And it was

717
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,460
so dead serious in the gym all the time because like kind of was life or death when you're

718
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,700
squatting a thousand pounds. There'd be like a lot of fights and arguments and in the old super

719
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,900
training because it was highly competitive and people would, you know, like somebody would mess

720
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,860
up like just getting the rack, somebody would go to rack it and they wouldn't put the monolith down.

721
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,220
So he's spotty the wrong way or whatever. They yell at each other and just getting all fight and it

722
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:03,260
was just so aggressive and crazy. A lot of intensity. It's sort of where you had to go

723
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:11,340
to get there in the sport of powerlifting. So what were your PRs assisted? So I did like 675 squat.

724
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,780
I never did raw powerlifting, never came into the fray like as far as I was there, but I was

725
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:23,100
actually there. It's interesting. I was there before the equipment was really good, but not when it

726
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:30,140
went raw. So really like a single ply squat suit. I did like 675 squat. I did a 472 bench in

727
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,820
competition, but in bigger, stronger, faster in just a bench competition. I did 501 in a bench

728
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,300
shirt. I think the best I ever did in gym was like 585. That's where the shirt, the best I ever did,

729
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:48,380
I think raw in the gym is 500. But you know, now I blew out my shoulder and those things don't work

730
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,580
like that anymore. To give some people perspective, you know, everything in my gym is specialized.

731
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,700
The plates are specialized. The barbells are specialized. At the time when we, when I was

732
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:04,220
lifting those big weights, we had a bar, which is called the Iron Wolf bar. And this, this thing is

733
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:12,540
so, has so much crazy knurling on it. It's like a cheese grater that it kind of ruined the inside

734
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,460
shape of our squat rack. Because when you try to move the weight around or roll it at all,

735
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,740
it would sheer metal off of there. And if you went to duck underneath it to do a squat,

736
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,020
it would tomahawk you. It would, it would just fricking cut the top of your, your hair right off.

737
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,100
I could just boom, like a, like a razor. So everything in there is specialized. And that

738
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,700
bar was designed that way. So it stays sturdy on your back and it was extra thick so that there

739
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,940
was no whip when you're trying to squat. Because when you have that much weight on your back,

740
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,700
if the weights are flopping around, it's going to be really hard to try to stabilize it. And you're

741
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:50,300
going to end up probably falling on the ground. And also we had, you know, we use kilo plates,

742
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:56,220
which are super, super thin, or we had to always buy, you know, thinner 45 pound plates. And to

743
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,380
give people an idea of what some of this stuff looked like, I mean, it'd be very common to walk

744
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,340
into super training gym on a Tuesday or on a Thursday night. Tuesday was a big squat night.

745
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:13,100
Thursday was a big bench night. And you would see six, seven, eight, nine, 45s on each side of the

746
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:18,860
bar. One time just to do it, just cause I wanted to try it, I could have easily used our kilo

747
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:25,260
plates and stuff. But I was doing some math and I was like, holy crap, I can bench press 20 45 pound

748
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,460
plates. I'm like, I'm going to fucking try that tomorrow. And so it was 10 45 pound plates on

749
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,260
each side. If you can envision that. And now that's a special bar too, cause it has an extra sleep.

750
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:41,260
That's 900 pounds plus the bar 9 45. Yeah, it's like, yeah, right. Yeah. And, uh, you know,

751
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,220
I did it off of boards and stuff in context for people. Like for me, I understand these numbers

752
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,980
because I just know like even just like, I remember this, like I was never even able to get

753
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:57,340
two 25 for 10. I could never quite get there, which I always thought was like, until you can do two

754
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,900
25 for 10, you're not actually benching. And I remember like I could only get to about eight.

755
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,620
And so I was just such a pathetic bench presser, but I also know like how heavy that is. So the

756
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:11,260
numbers you guys are talking about, like, I don't even understand what eight 57 bench press means.

757
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,900
Like how do we, I'm just trying to think like you could bench press the back of a car. You could lay

758
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:23,340
under a car and at least get the car out of its suspension. Right. You know, I don't know an easy

759
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:29,260
way to, uh, try to explain something that's a little bit complicated to people that might not

760
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,540
understand it. All I know is that typically when you go into a commercial gym, somebody might be

761
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,780
moving around a plate, two plates, maybe three plates and the strongest guy at some of these

762
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,780
commercial gyms sometimes are pretty strong, but usually you're going to see somebody use

763
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:48,380
four or five, you know, four plates on each side. It was very common that week in and week out at my

764
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,660
gym and still is very common where there's groups of people, you know, one after another, I guess

765
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:59,260
where you can make a comparison is a friend of mine was a collegiate wrestler and he

766
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:04,940
ended up being an alternate on the Olympic team. And when he went to train at the Olympic training

767
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:09,420
center, he said, he remembered there was some guys there after he was there for a while. There's

768
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,020
some guys there that would brag and they're like, Oh, I'm an all American from this place or that

769
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:18,220
place. Or, um, you know, all state from this college or whatever, whatever, whatever their

770
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:23,900
thing was, whatever the championship was. And he was just like, we all are, you know, what's

771
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,380
special about you that you're not a special snowflake, you know? And so inside the walls of the

772
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,660
gym, as we were building up and making ourselves a lot stronger, that's what we'd see day in and

773
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,500
day out. It was just commonplace to see somebody squat 700 pounds, 800 pounds, deadlift, 800 pounds,

774
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,260
things like that. I think that was sort of, I took it for granted as a kid that from my first

775
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:49,020
exposure lifting weights, which was starting at 13 till 19, I only knew that one gym. Yeah. So I

776
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,180
only knew exactly what you're describing, which is we were the weakest, you know, me and my friend

777
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,620
were like the little babies there, but you'd see these guys who were simply from another planet and

778
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,860
everything was only counted in plates. Right. It was like, is it six places at seven places,

779
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:07,900
eight plates. And of course, you know, this was such a crappy gym that the bars were all bent.

780
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,380
Like, you know, you had to know how to position yourself under the bar to squat because the bar

781
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,420
was so permanently deformed. Dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just crazy. And now as you said,

782
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:22,140
I go into like crunch, which is where I lift weights when I'm in New York. And it's like,

783
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,060
you don't see anybody really going above two or three plates typically. And look,

784
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,340
they're still strong dudes, but what you're describing is a different world. Looking back

785
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:34,380
on it, I wish I knew more when I was doing it. Looking back on it, we tried to learn as much as

786
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:40,300
we can as we were doing it, but along the way, I've gotten injured and being hurt is worse. Like to me,

787
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:46,700
now it sucks because I'm hurt. I can't fix it. So I got hurt from, I tore my tricep just from

788
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:51,180
pushing things too hard, pushing too much too hard. Two or three years ago, maybe or what?

789
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,860
It was like five years ago and it just never healed, right? And it never,

790
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,500
when I went to the doctor to see if I needed to get it reattached, it's like, ah,

791
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:04,700
it's torn, but it'll probably heal pretty good and blah, blah, blah. And like, you know, so I just

792
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,620
didn't get it reattached. And also it was right before I went to rehab. So I wasn't in a good

793
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:14,460
state of mind to go get it reattached and whatever. And it just never came back. And so I wish I knew

794
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,260
more in, you know, now, but what's, what's nice about now coming back around is a lot of the

795
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:23,660
things that are injured. I've been, I've been able to rehab and been able to, you know, fix as well.

796
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,460
So I still print lifting pretty heavy, but I just wish we had that knowledge back then of like,

797
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:33,340
you know, not getting hurt. So knowing what you know, and you guys have heard me talk about the

798
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:39,660
importance of weight training. I, it's probably the only thing that for me is never compromised.

799
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:45,260
My life sort of revolves around weight training. So I have to get in the gym three days a week

800
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,860
and my hotels when I'm on the road are planned around where those lifts are going to be and when

801
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,420
and blah, blah, blah. And yet doesn't mean that every week I can squat and deadlift and do all

802
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:59,340
the things that matter, but almost without exception. So this stuff's important. But the

803
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:03,500
other thing I'm sort of fond of saying is, look, rule number one is don't get hurt.

804
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,460
So if someone's listening to this and either like, you know, these numbers don't mean anything or

805
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,980
whatever, but they still get the gist of it, which is, hey, I probably ought to be lifting weights.

806
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,460
And let's say they're thinking, hey, I want to be able to squat and deadlift and bench. I want

807
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:21,820
from each of you guys a really, you know, sort of the most important thing that you know, after all

808
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:27,420
of your years of both watching coaching and experiencing that you would pass on to somebody.

809
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,140
So let's start with you. Yeah. The hard part is rule number one is to challenge yourself.

810
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,420
Rule number two is to not hurt yourself. So that's where things get to be a little difficult. As we

811
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,700
get older, a lot of times that shifts, right? But in the beginning, you need to get hurt.

812
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,980
Sounds foolish to mention that, but we've all been hurt in the gym and we've all learned

813
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,820
a lot from it. And I'm not saying that you should haphazardly jump in there and not warm up and stuff,

814
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,300
but the truth is we could sit here and promote warm up and stretching and stuff and no one's

815
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,740
still going to do it. Well, but hang on, but let's talk about it. You guys are big on warming up the

816
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:06,380
glute mede. You've got, you sell a thing that one of the things I'm hoping you either have here or

817
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:12,140
I'll have to buy it on the website, but I like your little hip circle. So I mean, that was one

818
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:18,220
of the most important insights of my life was you can't squat or deadlift until your glute mede,

819
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,980
your TFL are working. It's foolish to start a workout without warming up. You've got to move

820
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,900
around. If you're going to do any sort of upper body stuff, you've got to get the elbow joint warm.

821
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:32,380
You've got to get the shoulders warm. And there doesn't have to be any science to it. There's not

822
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,220
to be anything in particular to it. If you're going to squat, you throw on something like hip

823
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,780
circle, you walk forward, you walk backwards, you walk side to side, and maybe you do some

824
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:46,140
sort of bending exercise where you're picking up barbell or plate, you know, and just bending from

825
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:51,820
the hips basically. But you have to warm up for your workouts, but if you're not challenging

826
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,620
yourself, then you're missing out on a big piece of the puzzle because you're never going to get

827
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:02,220
the results that you're looking for. People always think that when they look at other people

828
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:08,700
on social media, when they look at Jeff Bezos, the guy that owns Amazon, if they look at Elon

829
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:13,420
Musk or they look at The Rock, people are like, man, that's so cool. Like, that would be awesome

830
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:18,620
to be them. Like, must be easy. Like, must be easier because they're them, because they have

831
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:27,500
that money, because they have that freedom. It is 10, 20, 30, 100, a thousand times harder to be them.

832
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:32,860
It gets to be harder and harder to be yourself as you continue to grow in fitness. And so,

833
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:37,020
that's the reason why you have to challenge yourself each and every day. You have to figure

834
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:41,820
out a way, how can I be better than I was yesterday? It doesn't always mean that you have

835
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:47,660
to do more weight, but you have to challenge yourself in something. There has to be progress.

836
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:53,260
Without progress, I don't believe you can even have happiness. And so, the progress is going to

837
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,780
be very, very motivating to you as well. And it's going to be something that will help keep you on

838
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:01,580
track. Before I go to you, Chris, I want to follow up more on that. Talk to me about some of the

839
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:06,380
ways that you would monitor progress when you're already at the level of the world's best,

840
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:11,740
which you were. The days are long gone where there's a PR every day in the gym. You PR once

841
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,380
a year, that's a good year. So, what are you doing to motivate yourself day in and day out

842
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,300
when you're still benching every week and still squatting and still deadlifting? Like, how are

843
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:25,420
you finding out? What are these incremental goals? As you chase one thing, something else starts to

844
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:32,860
fall apart. And there'll be tipping point. You want to be really strong? Well, maybe you run into

845
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,060
an injury just because. Like, sometimes we're sitting there and trying to think about it. We're

846
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:40,780
like, well, I don't know. Maybe your hips are tighter. Maybe it's like, how about it's just,

847
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:44,220
you try to lift up 700 pounds and you've been doing it for the last three or four weeks. And

848
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,380
that's just that. Like, that's just the way the body is going to be. So, there's always something

849
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,660
to work on. There's always something to improve. You always have that kind of white belt mentality

850
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:57,740
where you're like, I don't know everything. I don't pretend to know everything. There's still

851
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:03,020
so much to learn and expand upon. And when you look around, you're like, are there other people

852
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:07,020
that are better than me in this lift? Are there other people that are stronger than me? Of course,

853
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,540
there is. Are there other people who've gone further than me? Of course, there is. So, that means I

854
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:17,340
have a lot to work on. There's always a PR to chase. There's always something to chase. It might not be

855
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:23,660
on that lift. It just might look like something different. One of the magical things that I've

856
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:29,740
learned in the gym, and it's one of my favorite things is just, and I share this with everybody,

857
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:35,340
do you know a way to get a PR every single time you step foot into a gym? Low standards start low.

858
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:41,660
Well, that's my life right there. Yeah, low standards. No, to try something you've never

859
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:48,540
done before. You know, what's your max set of seven with incline dumbbell press? No clue, right?

860
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:55,580
What's your max set of three sets of seven with one minute rest on incline dumbbell press? You have

861
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:00,220
no idea. Or machine, or like you can get excited and you kind of make it anything. And you start

862
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,300
to kind of make it into a little bit of a game. And that's where it gets to be really fun. Oh,

863
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:09,340
yeah, last time I tried this, I did, I think I only did 95 pounds. I'm going to try 100 pounds.

864
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:14,220
I'm trying 105 pounds. And at first, a lot of those things will go up and up and up and up.

865
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,780
And after a while they will dissipate, but you can always think of, well, maybe I'm going to

866
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:24,140
try sets of 25 today just because I've never done it before. So what about you, Chris, all the hard

867
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:29,180
knocks you've learned, what's the advice for the person listening to this who like wants to get

868
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,100
stronger and doesn't want to be intimidated when they walk in the weight room? Yeah, the number one

869
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:39,020
thing for me that really changed my life altogether is my diet. You know, like what I put in my mouth

870
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,580
affected what I did in the gym. And I didn't never saw that correlation when I was younger,

871
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:48,380
because I just ate like crazy and was a power lifter. But I can really see now that every

872
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:53,500
competition that I won once I moved to California. So I explained to you before we were even on the

873
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:59,900
podcast, I was telling you, when I moved to California in 1993, I met up with a group of

874
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:05,500
power lifters. One of them was Michael Hearn, another one was my friend, Ron Fedko, who is a

875
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,940
maniac. And he was a so Ron Fedko was a power lifter. He was getting his degree in applied

876
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:15,980
mathematics at UCLA, getting his PhD. And now he's the head of the computer science department

877
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:23,260
at Stanford. This guy would bench he bench press 526 with no bench shirt. He squatted 804,

878
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,740
something like that. And deadlifted like he's close to eight, something like that at 198.

879
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:33,180
And when he met me, he said to me, you're too fat, you need to lose weight. Like, like one of

880
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,700
the first things he said to me when I was like, hey, you know, I want to really weird stuff too.

881
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,300
And you're like, I said, I want to read. He told us about like the mitochondria and stuff. Oh,

882
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,380
yeah, way back. He's like, my red blood cells are way off. I should be able to press that for more

883
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:51,020
reps. Really? What? Yeah, he's always like he bends to 25 for 64 reps. Yeah, he was a maniac.

884
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,580
So anyway, he told me one of the first things he said was like, you're, you know, you're just too

885
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:01,500
fat to be a good power lifter. Like he just had no. He was rough on the edges. Yeah, he was rough

886
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:05,740
around the edges. But he's like, you know, but if you lost weight, you'd be pretty good. I'm like,

887
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,660
well, I have no idea how to like really lose weight. I've been, I've been trying to lose weight.

888
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:14,060
That's why I'm in the gym. But the entire time from the day I stepped in the gym, my goal was

889
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:18,460
to lose weight. And I'd never been able to until I figured out this keto diet, you know,

890
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,500
where you, so you, you talk about how you were chubby as a kid, Chris, Mark, were you chubby

891
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:30,860
as a kid? I was fat too. I got fat around, I got fat around 13 and continued to build because we

892
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,420
didn't know anything about eating everything we ate was snack wells and granola bars. You know,

893
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,780
wait, is that bad? Yeah. Oh, okay. Pretty cool. I was a little bit more in the middle, I guess,

894
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:44,140
but like, you know, by around 16 years old, I was like 240 pounds, but I was like, kind of,

895
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:48,780
it was kind of big, kind of big and fat. And then, you know, I started to learn more because he was

896
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:53,580
picking up stuff, relaying information to me. And then I started to kind of slim down and getting

897
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:58,460
better shape. But when I met Ron in 93 and I, the very first thing he said was like, Hey,

898
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:03,180
go get a piece of paper and write down everything I said. So I ran and did it. I got the paper. I was

899
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:08,860
all excited. I'm 23 years old, getting information from this great power lifter. And he just says,

900
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,580
red meat and water. And I write it down. I'm going, okay. And what else? That's it. That's your diet,

901
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:18,540
red meat and water. I don't even want to see you chewing a stick of gum. And I was kind of scared

902
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:24,300
of Ron. So of course I didn't even chew a stick of gum. And I went for like two or three weeks on

903
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,660
no carbs, just literally ground beef. This is before grass fed beef was even a thing. I don't

904
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,660
even, I don't even think you'd be able to find it if you had to. It was those big fat tubes.

905
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:39,420
Going around back then. Yeah. Those big fat tubes of, uh, you know, the beef, the five pounders.

906
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,980
Disgusting. And I would just cook bones and shit there. And I did that for a couple of weeks

907
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:50,060
and, um, lost like over 20 pounds, won the powerlifting competition that I went into

908
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:54,780
and then continued to do that down to like 198 weight class. And the next meet after that,

909
01:12:54,780 --> 01:13:00,300
I'd started around two 40 and got all the way down under 198. How much strength did you lose?

910
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,100
And when you got strong 40 pounds, you actually got strong way stronger. Yeah,

911
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,500
way stronger. And the thing is so, cause I lost weight. I was able to grab the bar. Now

912
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:12,780
I was able to squat better, right? I was able to get down to the bar. And so it was hard doing

913
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:17,900
like losing the weight and getting there. But once I got there, I was, I stayed relatively strong.

914
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:23,820
But my biggest problem was that for some reason, uh, there wasn't any research on a keto diet back

915
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,060
then. There wasn't any research at all on a, uh, there was research, but I didn't know how to get

916
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:33,180
to it. You know, especially the internet wasn't even around 1993, right? So barely around. What I

917
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:39,340
did was I, um, I stopped doing it because I was, I was afraid that the diet, I didn't know anything

918
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:44,060
about it. I thought we needed carbohydrates. I thought we needed. So for me, the biggest lesson

919
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:49,260
I learned was that I should have never got off the original, you know, keto slash carnivore

920
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:54,540
diet that worked really well for me. I'd gotten off of it for like 10 or 15 years until getting

921
01:13:54,540 --> 01:14:01,100
back on it more recently in the past two years. But I feel like those years in between were lost.

922
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:07,260
I feel like I ruined them. I feel like because I wasn't optimizing my training along with my diet

923
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,980
that I kind of wasted those years, you know, if someone said to you, Hey, I want to learn how to

924
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,700
squat, but I can't come to you and your gym. What do you point them to me? And I typically point

925
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:21,340
people to videos that you do. Yeah. Like who, who are you liking on YouTube? Do you, do you have

926
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:26,060
instructional stuff on there? He's got a lot. Yeah. I have over 3000 videos on YouTube. So we,

927
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:30,060
you know, we have a whole media team and we, we pump out a lot of, a lot of information. The most

928
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,860
exciting thing is that he's got videos from Ed Cohen on there, Ed Cohen's best squatter ever,

929
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:39,820
you know, and, um, videos from Stan Efroning, the strongest raw power lifter ever, you know,

930
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:44,860
one thing that Mark Rippetoe did really well is and people will bash him because they don't like,

931
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,780
there's a lot of people that don't like the way that he squats, but really what he's trying to do

932
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:53,980
is he's trying to show you a universal way to squat and people are like, and a very safe way

933
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,540
to squat. Yeah. Yeah. Biomock. Yeah, it is very safe. A lot of people will say, Oh, he's leaning

934
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:02,380
over way too much. Well, most people can't squat in an upright position. They just don't have the

935
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:07,420
ankle mobility, the hamstring mobility. He's just trying to, he's trying to too, in a five minute

936
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,540
segment, tell everyone how to squat. And that's, I think people lose, lose sight of that. Give people

937
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:16,380
the benefit of the doubt. CrossFit is a great place for people to start, you know? So that's

938
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,220
interesting because, because there's some people that argue the opposite, right? Which is CrossFit

939
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:25,340
tries to take relatively untrained people and get them to do Olympic lifting. And even when you look

940
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:30,540
at Olympic lifters, they don't do that much Olympic lifting. I'll say this, there has never in the

941
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:35,340
history of the world has there been a better fitness program than what CrossFit puts out.

942
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,700
Nobody spends more time and more money on what they put together. I know because I've been on the,

943
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,740
on the back end of it, I've seen, I've seen what they do. I've seen what they do with their website.

944
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,420
I've seen what they do with all the different things. I'm not even a CrossFit nut. I don't

945
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,060
even care about CrossFit really, to be honest with you. One thing I don't like that they do is the

946
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:59,100
gymnastics element with adults is kind of a weird thing just because it's so hard to learn as you're

947
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,780
older, but so what? It's a deeper and stronger challenge, right? But when you start to learn

948
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,460
that they spend millions and millions of dollars, obviously they make millions and millions of

949
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:15,100
dollars, but when they spend millions and millions of dollars setting up a fitness contest that has

950
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:23,500
over 200,000 participants and it narrows it down to the number one man and number one female in the

951
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:29,100
world, I think that that's fucking awesome. And that's one of the coolest human studies that's

952
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:34,460
going on. They also teach a lot about nutrition. When you go on the back end of their website,

953
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,940
if you try to take one of those coaching courses, you will get absolutely slaughtered. I don't care

954
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:44,220
how much you know about fitness. You'll get destroyed in that. It is so hard to try to figure

955
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,860
out how to like referee some of these things or how to even answer some of these questions that

956
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:54,140
are on there. They have done an amazing job and I know that they're reaching out to a lot of leading

957
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,700
researchers when it comes to the nutrition aspect. I know they used to have Rob Wolf and they kind

958
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:03,340
of have moved around a little bit. I'm not sure if you ever spoke with them, but I know some others

959
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:09,820
that have and they do a good job of investigating and poking around and finding the right thing.

960
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:16,380
I'm not saying it's the answer for everybody, but if you are somebody that just has no clue on where

961
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:20,860
to start, I'd recommend try a CrossFit box because they're everywhere. They're all over the place.

962
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:26,540
Also understand that your first experience may not be great, just like if you went to a therapist

963
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:33,340
or you went to a healthcare professional, like they might suck, right? So what? Go and try another

964
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:38,540
spot. Go and try somewhere else. You should typically find that they're very encouraging.

965
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,100
The environment is very encouraging. They want you to exercise. They want you to get better.

966
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:48,620
Their business model isn't that of a huge chain gym where they're like, we just want you to sign

967
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,900
up for 20 bucks and never see you again. So I think CrossFit offers a lot. It teaches people how to

968
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:59,180
squat, teaches people how to deadlift. I do wish that they paid a little bit more attention to

969
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:04,780
people trying to gain muscle, a little bit more like a little bit more bodybuilding stuff, but

970
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:10,060
they keep evolving and they keep moving with the times. Let's actually talk a little bit about

971
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,780
that because you're in the process of doing exactly what you just described. You're training

972
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:18,620
for a bodybuilding competition. That's probably by the time this podcast come out, the bodybuilding

973
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,820
competition will have already taken place because it's in a few weeks. But you know, I was saying

974
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,180
before we started this, I think you and I, Chris, we were just playing patty cakes in the kitchen

975
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:31,660
and I was like, yeah, I was like, there are a few things I know less about than bodybuilding. Now,

976
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,820
which isn't to say that growing up, I wasn't obsessed with it, right? Like I fricking had

977
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:41,420
every copy of every magazine. I had pictures of Lee Haney all over my wall. Obviously I know every

978
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:46,140
single line of pumping iron, including all the outtakes. So you know enough. No, no. I mean,

979
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:49,900
I know that, but the point is I don't know anything about how to like make a person bigger. Like if

980
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,900
someone came to me and said, Peter, I want to get jacked. What should I do? My answer would be,

981
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,980
I have no clue. Like I don't know. I think it involves what you eat and how you lift,

982
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:03,900
but that's about all I know. So to me, this is like a super interesting art. So what have you

983
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,980
guys learned about this? And I want to specifically hear what you're doing. First things first, I

984
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:13,900
would say a lot of bodybuilders, a lot of people that are into bodybuilding get their start because

985
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,220
they start lifting for football or baseball or boxing or whatever, whatever else they're doing.

986
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:23,020
They start like lifting weights for to get prepared for something else. And then they

987
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:28,140
get bit by the bodybuilding bug. So I think powerlifting is a great place to start for most people.

988
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:32,380
And I think it's where most people do start is sort of like, start, I started benching for football

989
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:36,220
and then I started squatting. And then, you know, next thing you know, I was into bodybuilding. So I

990
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:42,380
think like a great way to just dive in and get started is through some sort of lifting program

991
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:47,340
that might aid something else that you're trying to do. That way you're also killing two birds with

992
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,900
one stone, you're getting better at what you're trying to do. And then, you know, who knows, this

993
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:56,940
might be something that you enjoy and want to pursue. And then powerlifting to me is, I don't

994
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:02,540
think I'd ever let my kids box. I just, I feel fortunate that I got out of it alive, minus the

995
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:08,700
IQ points I don't have. But I would love it if each of my kids at least spend some time powerlifting,

996
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:14,220
because whatever you go to do later in life, you will have correctly learned the mechanics of the

997
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:20,460
most important movements in the human body, which primarily come down in your area, San Diego,

998
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:27,260
is his name Jeff Martin? Oh yeah, crossfit kids. Okay. He started that like dissolve the name of

999
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:33,420
yeah. Now it's called X brand X something. But anyway, so yeah, his thing is awesome. He's got

1000
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:38,780
all these kids involved in powerlifting, right? So I went Mark, that's awesome. Mark's company

1001
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:43,740
slingshot, they sent me down to San Diego with a camera and said, go film this powerlifting meet

1002
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:50,780
for kids. And it was all kids from like, I think ages like seven or eight, up to like 15. And out

1003
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:55,180
of everything we've done on that channel, and everything we did with Mark's YouTube channel,

1004
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:59,740
that was the most fun I've ever had. Just hanging out with kids that were like, you know, between

1005
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:04,940
the ages of eight and 15, and having them say, Mark Bell changed my life. He wasn't able to make it.

1006
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,940
He had like something else going on that day at the gym. But to go there and be able to interview

1007
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,660
those kids and I would say, Oh, Mark's brother, they would get so excited that I was Mark's brother.

1008
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:19,020
Like, no way, you know, Mark, my kids, my brother, like, no way you grew up with them. And to me,

1009
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,580
it's like the joy of seeing these kids get involved in powerlifting was just exciting.

1010
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:27,100
You know, I did a seminar there. And it was incredible to see the way these kids can move.

1011
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,860
I was like, Oh my God, I was like really apprehensive about doing the seminar. It was like,

1012
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:36,300
what is that going to look like? I go to all these CrossFit boxes. And I get asked to come in and

1013
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:40,780
teach a seminar on how to squat bench and deadlift and takes me hours and hours on end,

1014
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:45,180
because it's very, very difficult to teach people how to squat, meaning to teach adults how to

1015
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:49,580
squat who haven't who are tight in the hips. Yeah, tight in the hips. Maybe they don't have

1016
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:54,620
a lot of experience lifting or they just have bad experience lifting and they haven't learned

1017
01:21:54,620 --> 01:22:00,460
enough yet. Getting with these kids was crazy, though. I was so shocked. Their form on everything

1018
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:05,900
was impeccable. I was like, Holy shit, because he runs a tight ship down there. He has the kids.

1019
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:11,100
The first thing that you see when you walk in is, first of all, it says parents, please wait outside

1020
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,020
for your child. They don't allow the parents to hang out in there. If you want to come in and check

1021
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:19,500
the place out for a minute to make sure there's not a bunch of creepers around you, obviously you can.

1022
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:24,940
But they want you to drop your kid off there. And the second thing that you see

1023
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:30,220
is there's a room where kids go and they do their homework. And so it sends a message like, you know,

1024
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,740
you're you're stopping here first, you're going to do your homework first, we're going to check in

1025
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:37,580
with you, make sure you got all your stuff done. Then we're going to go lift weights.

1026
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,580
I have a feeling his kids are going to end up at this gym. Well, it's interesting.

1027
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:49,340
In Ramona. So when I remember when I saw my boy who I have a one year old and a four year old,

1028
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:53,420
and then I who are both boys, and then I got a 10 year old girl, or almost 10 year old, and the

1029
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:58,060
boy who's four, because he still isn't in school, meaning he's only in like, you know, whatever,

1030
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:04,380
like goof off school. He doesn't actually he never sits in a chair. So any time I watch him

1031
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:08,860
squat to pick something up, I go, Oh, stop there. I got to get a picture. Yeah, because it's like

1032
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:14,300
form is great. The form is it's ridiculous. Your heels are down. Knees are open. Oh, my God.

1033
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:19,100
Actually, that's like he looks like a little power. He looks like a little Hercules. Yeah.

1034
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,700
And then conversely, my daughter who used to be able to do that now, you know, she's whatever,

1035
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:27,180
just finished fourth grade. Her squats worse than mine. Like her form is horrible when I say,

1036
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,020
Olivia, get down and squat for me. That's something I look at all the time. And I say,

1037
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:36,060
how do we how do we maintain that in our children? Like how I wish I could have maintained that. And

1038
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:39,580
I think that that's something that somebody needs to figure out. Well, I mean, I think the answer is

1039
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:43,740
we're born with it is the first. Yeah, sure. We are all born knowing how to hip hinge. Exactly.

1040
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:49,260
And I would argue that sitting is the thing that cripples us. It's a big part. And so how do you

1041
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:53,260
maintain it? Well, you can't eliminate sitting, but you can minimize it, right? So if every kid

1042
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,180
had a standing desk in school, for example, that's a step in the right direction, because

1043
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:01,500
most of that sitting comes at school. And then secondly, it's like how you teach people the types

1044
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:06,540
of exercises to do. There's people working on the standing desk thing. Our friend Kelly Starett is

1045
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:11,660
leading that charge. Kelly and Juliette Starett leading the charge to have kids have stand up desks

1046
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:16,700
and they're doing programs where they're raising money to make that happen. Do you know Kelly

1047
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:22,140
Starett, mobility, what he's a crossfit guy. And they've had great success. They find that kids do

1048
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:27,820
better in school when they stand too. So they've been another big element of, you know, having

1049
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:32,540
children progress with some of those things rather than go backwards would be to simply have the

1050
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:37,820
physical education, you know, have a little bit more emphasis than it does. It used to a real

1051
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:43,180
physical education and now you can't really do it anymore. Kids can't do pull ups or pushups or run

1052
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:48,460
a mile. And everyone should remember the president should be able to do some version of that. I'm not

1053
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:53,660
saying everyone should be like super proficient at it, but you know, when you start in kindergarten,

1054
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:59,020
you learn your ABCs, you start to learn some math and as you keep progressing, your English progresses,

1055
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:04,380
your math progresses, you learn more stuff about history. It starts out with like George Washington

1056
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:09,340
and you progress to learn more about American history and so on. But when it comes to the physical

1057
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,860
education, not much really changes. It's like, it just is like playing and then it goes into like a

1058
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,700
little bit more stuff and then it just completely fizzles out. And now it's a lot of times not even

1059
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:24,140
in school anymore. We used to have that presidential physical fitness thing, right? And it actually was

1060
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:28,620
like a program that made sense, but then they just completely like discontinued that kind of stuff. And

1061
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:34,540
I think that like getting kids to be active, they're at school all day and then like gym class is like

1062
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:40,220
nobody wants to get dressed for gym class and nobody does anything. A lot of times kids take the kids

1063
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,300
out for a walk or something, you know, I mean, I don't know what's a ball around with a kid. I

1064
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:49,180
would kick a ball around with a kid that I mean, if they're five, six, seven, they're not going to

1065
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:52,940
turn that down. I do this stuff with my daughter when she comes in the gym with me in the morning

1066
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:57,020
because in San Diego, I just work out at home. And one of the things I've got her doing, which is a

1067
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:02,780
competition, is what's her, how long can she dead hang in a chin up? And she's, you know, I forget

1068
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:06,700
what her record is now, but it's like, you know, the first time she did it, she could only hold 17

1069
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:11,340
seconds or something like that. And now she's like over two minutes dead hanging. Really? Yeah.

1070
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,500
She's a savage. That's pretty good. And you know, she's light as a feather. Yeah, but that's still

1071
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:20,140
pretty cool. Right. So so now I can't hang for two minutes. I die after 30 seconds. Well, the fact that

1072
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:24,140
she's getting an idea of what that's doing too. Well, and the funny thing that I love about doing

1073
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:29,260
it is explaining to her the mental fitness. So that time she failed at 17 seconds, she just went

1074
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,420
from hanging to failing. And I was like, Olivia, I didn't even see you shaking. I didn't see you

1075
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,060
suffering. What the hell is going on here? Like, yeah, yeah. Like, I don't think you understand the

1076
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:43,900
purpose of this exercise. You are trying to test the limit of what you're capable of by definition

1077
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,220
that is going to hurt. And the other thing, oh, this is funny. Maybe I was wrong. That actually is

1078
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:53,260
interesting. A kid doesn't register. Super healthy though, too, because sometimes in competition,

1079
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,540
a kid may be more discouraged to swim next to the other kid next to them because they're like, I

1080
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:02,220
don't, I just think if I try harder, I'm not going to get any further ahead. That kid's still going

1081
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:07,660
to whoop my ass in this. It's just her versus her, which is cool. Yeah. And then I even once

1082
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,420
she started to get the bug in her and she wanted to do it every day, she would go in and do it.

1083
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,860
And I was like, look, Olivia, you got to take a couple of days off. Like if you really want to

1084
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:19,100
hit this, you need to rest and recover a little bit and we'll start planking and doing all those

1085
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,500
other things. So, you know, I hope Olivia, you need your electrolytes and we need to get you on some

1086
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,140
PCA. How many egg yolks have you had today? Olivia, if you really want to do this, we're

1087
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:32,380
going to push it. You're going to be the Olympic hanging champion. So what your first experience

1088
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:38,860
with bodybuilding was when now this is it. This is your first one years old. So I'm dying to know,

1089
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:44,220
like, can I not look like a pathetic guy? Like what would I need to do if I wanted to be half

1090
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:50,380
as jacked as you bodybuilding is amazing. You can make changes really, really rapidly, make changes

1091
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:55,740
really, really fast. For me, I'm very fortunate. I'm around a lot of people that have a lot of

1092
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:01,100
great information and so I have the ability to have some accelerated success with the amount

1093
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:07,420
of people that are surrounding me in this effort. But the diet is interesting. The cardio is

1094
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:12,700
interesting. We're in a country that's so fat that there's like studies that show that cardiovascular

1095
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:17,740
training is bad for you. That shows like it increases your estrogen and your cortisol so

1096
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:24,860
much you can't release fat. I mean, just some of these things are it's really crazy to think that

1097
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:29,740
people are trying to even study something like that. When you look at bodybuilding,

1098
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:36,460
bodybuilders for years have done these certain things very specific ways and it works time and

1099
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:42,380
time and time again. It just continues to work every single time. Bodybuilders are, you know,

1100
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:47,420
partially responsible or probably largely responsible for ketogenic diet, even sticking

1101
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:52,540
around the first place because they will always introduce some form of low carbohydrate living.

1102
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:59,100
That's how I learned about it many years ago. But the discipline to do all the things

1103
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:05,340
that you don't want to do when you normally don't want to do them is really, really powerful.

1104
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:12,540
Stopping yourself from eating extra. Jay Cutler came into our gym recently. He's four time Mr.

1105
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,380
Olympia and he said on a podcast that he... Can you explain to people what the difference is

1106
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:21,020
between Mr. Olympia and any other bodybuilding contest? Yeah, the Mr. Olympia contest is the

1107
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:26,380
Super Bowl. Yeah, that's what Arnold Schwarzenegger was seven times. That's what he was famous for

1108
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:31,180
during the eight's and those guys. So, you know, this isn't just some schmuck. This is a...

1109
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:37,100
This is the world's best bodybuilder for four years. Yeah. He said he ate seven times a day.

1110
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:42,140
And I just sat there and went, wow, that's a lot of dedication to eat seven times a day. That means,

1111
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:46,220
you know, all your meals are prepped and everything. And he said he ate the same food

1112
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:51,660
at the same time every single day. He did his cardio at the same time. He did his weightlifting

1113
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:57,180
at the same time. He would go tanning at the same time. He would get a hot tub, get a massage and so

1114
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:02,380
on and go to sleep. All, you know, all these things were regimented out. So that way he never skipped

1115
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,020
a beat and that way he could be precise and that way he could be the best. As he was talking about

1116
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:12,700
all these things, I kept kind of dwelling on that seven meal thing because I've tinkered with some

1117
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:18,380
intermittent fasting and I've teetered with some different things, but I was fixated on that. I'm

1118
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:23,500
like, as I got into this bodybuilding stuff, I started asking some other guys. I'm like,

1119
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:29,660
well, can you do this? And can you do that? They're like, no. I'm like, well, I can have like,

1120
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:36,140
I'm supposed to have like 150 carbs a day, 65 grams of fat, 350 grams of protein. I'm like,

1121
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:40,540
can I just have like a hundred grams of protein in one shot and have like a big steak meal? They're

1122
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:46,540
like, no. And I'm like trying to figure out all these loopholes. They're like, there's no loopholes.

1123
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:52,060
This is the way it's got to be. It's 50 grams of protein at every meal for seven meals. That's

1124
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:57,180
350 grams of protein. That's what you're supposed to do. And so I finally got it through my fat

1125
01:30:57,180 --> 01:31:01,260
head that that's what I'm supposed to do. But these things are lined up in a very specific manner.

1126
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:06,380
Now, when I went and started to try to look and poke around and figure out how many times a day

1127
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:12,380
the average person eats, it was 15 times a day. Because there's so much snacking.

1128
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:17,580
There's so much snacking. And I just never, I never even thought about it, but I'm like,

1129
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:26,940
I'm on a diet all the time. I'm always trying to lose weight. And boy, do I sabotage the fuck out

1130
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:31,420
of myself because I do that all the time. I'll grab, you know, and it's stuff that's, you know,

1131
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:36,860
within this reasonable, healthy menu. Sure, sure. It's a handful of almonds or whatever it is.

1132
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:40,460
Cheese stick. And you think you're so hungry and you think you need it to recover and you think you

1133
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:45,820
need it to be jacked, but you just don't. You can actually handle eating a lot less than you're

1134
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:50,300
currently eating is one thing to know. And you can actually handle a lot more training.

1135
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:56,540
Now I'm not trying to suggest that you just get in this crazy mode of overtraining and develop,

1136
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:01,900
you know, body dysmorphia and all these things. But I do think you could probably push yourself

1137
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:09,100
a lot further than you know, currently. And when you, if you go from not implementing bodybuilding

1138
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:14,220
stuff to implementing bodybuilding stuff, it makes a huge difference. I know you've been on

1139
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:19,820
Joe Rogan's podcast. We've been fortunate enough to be on this podcast as well. He's the perfect

1140
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:24,700
example. You take somebody like that already has a good structure or yourself. And you mentioned

1141
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:29,820
kettlebell training and mentioned some different things. You were speaking with Daniel Rago and

1142
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,700
telling him some of the things that you've been doing. I know and Daniel knows because we train

1143
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,420
with Michael Hearn that if you implemented some bodybuilding stuff or not even some bodybuilding

1144
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,460
stuff, if you if you just embraced bodybuilding period, you'd be able to look so much different

1145
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:49,660
four weeks from right now. So give me an example, like a practical example. Probably up your protein

1146
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,820
too. That's usually one. I don't know what it is now. So I can't really say that. But right now,

1147
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,500
I'm in ketosis. So my protein is pretty low. It's probably about 100 grams a day.

1148
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:02,940
Yeah, you probably want more like one point seven. So the science that I've heard, you know,

1149
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:08,300
one point seven grams per kilogram of body weight will elicit muscle growth, right? So we need at

1150
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:14,460
least that much. For me, it's 135 grams. So I think it's just like finding that number, sticking to

1151
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:19,500
that number and like marks that incorporating some bodybuilding stuff. For me, the changes with extra

1152
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:24,940
protein happened immediately. And like he'll tell you, it just changed. It was like one day,

1153
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,580
I was skinny fat. Next day, I was muscular. And it was kind of kind of like that. But you

1154
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:35,900
had is this rule of 50 grams per meal times the seven meals. I mean, presumably that's because

1155
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:40,620
amino acids have a relatively short residence and you've got to kind of keep the exposure to those

1156
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:45,020
things high for a longer period of time, right? And I at least get the hypertrophy, right? And

1157
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:49,660
that's specifically for me. That's for my body weight. That's for the energy expenditure. That's

1158
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:55,740
for my age with a general understanding of what I can do in the gym. I mean, maybe taking a step

1159
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:59,340
back because I don't know. I weigh 230 pounds. But you're getting close to competition. So

1160
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:03,900
you want to show up at the competition weighing what? You personally? I'm just going to kind of

1161
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:09,100
end up where I end up, but I would imagine it would be another 10. There'd probably be another

1162
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:15,180
eight to 10 pounds of actual weight loss before now and then. And they'll probably be another

1163
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:19,820
five to 10 pounds of water weight that's dropped. I don't really know what they have in store for me.

1164
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:24,060
But I guess estimate your body fat percent will be on the day of. Oh, I don't have any idea. But

1165
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,860
I think I'll probably weigh about 215 pounds or 210 pounds. I think actually really the lower,

1166
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:34,700
the lower that I weigh, I feel like the bigger that I'll probably look without getting, you know,

1167
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:39,420
getting out of hand with that. Then I'll start. And at the peak of your building phase before you

1168
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:44,060
begin this taper, how much did you weigh? I didn't have one because I was just kind of. You just came

1169
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:47,980
straight out of powerlifting and. Yeah, I just kind of got shoved into it because I was, I was

1170
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:53,260
dropping some weight, but I was probably about 240, 245. So that's, that's what I'm talking about.

1171
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:59,820
It's the difference has only been, it's only been about 10 pounds, but it's crazy because like even

1172
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:05,580
just on my YouTube channel, we posted a video a few days ago, but it's from about three,

1173
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,100
about two, three weeks ago when I started all this. And it's me working on some posing.

1174
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:15,340
I just flat out look fat, you know, compared to now, obviously not fat, but it's just fat,

1175
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,620
flat out look fat. Yeah. Mark is like you said, he's got, he's in a position where he can talk

1176
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:24,860
to some of the best people in the world about training diet and nutrition. And what he was

1177
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:31,740
doing was a podcast with a Hani Rambad, who is the nutritionist for Phil Heath. Who's a.

1178
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:35,980
Phil wean will win last year. Yeah. So he's now won seven consecutive.

1179
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:41,020
And how many did Ronnie Coleman win? Eight. Eight. That's the most. Have you seen

1180
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:45,180
Ronnie Coleman's documentary? I know that it exists. I should mention that because it was a

1181
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:50,860
really great story. I thought Lee won seven. Oh, did Lee win eight? You're right. 84 to 91.

1182
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:56,140
And then Yates won like six or both those guys won eight. Yeah. So Mark's working with

1183
01:35:56,140 --> 01:36:01,420
honey Rambad, who's helping him do his diet and stuff, which I think is amazing to be able to

1184
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:05,500
have access to like the top people in the world. And he was working the other day with Charles

1185
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:10,860
Glass doing posing and Charles is known as the godfather of bodybuilding. He's at gold's gym

1186
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:15,900
every day. He trained Dexter Jackson for the 2008, you know, Mr. Olympia contest as well as like a

1187
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:20,700
ton of other amazing person to, you know, he's been helping us both a lot. You hear different

1188
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:25,660
things about the guy, but he just he trains at four o'clock in the morning. He wakes up at about

1189
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:30,860
two thirty. He eats at three. He makes sure he gets his ass to the gym when he gets when he gets

1190
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:35,740
to the gym. He's not full of like motivational talk or anything like that. But a lot of times

1191
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:41,020
one of his first questions will be, would you eat this morning? And if somebody says they didn't

1192
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:45,020
eat anything, he's just kind of he doesn't even really say anything. He just kind of like walks

1193
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:50,460
off. But he's just it's almost like, oh, I guess you're not all in, you know, I guess you're not.

1194
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:54,860
I guess you're not as into this as I thought, because this is this is the method that we're

1195
01:36:54,860 --> 01:37:00,060
going to use. So the nutrition is clearly important. And I mean, if there's one thing that's

1196
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:06,780
clear and everything you're saying, it's just how empirically wise this this sport is, right?

1197
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:11,660
I can't even eat at a restaurant because I can't afford to have any oil or can't I mean,

1198
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:17,100
there cannot be I can't have a day where I have 120 grams of fat. It's I'm supposed to have,

1199
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:21,500
you know, 65 grams of fat in a day. And if for some reason something was off and I had

1200
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:28,380
70 or 80, it wouldn't be the end of the world. But I'm supposed to wait by percentage of macro,

1201
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,340
what percentage of your calories are protein fat carbohydrate right now? I don't really know that.

1202
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,860
Daniel would have to run the math over there. But Daniel, can you run those numbers for us, man?

1203
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:44,460
350 and protein 65 grams of fat and 150 grams of carbohydrates. Sometimes the carbohydrates are up

1204
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:53,100
a little bit from there, but the fats are 65. And you said the carbs 135. 150. Awesome math going

1205
01:37:53,100 --> 01:38:00,060
on. But you know, it's like I said, it's very specific and carbohydrates. Just to try to clear

1206
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,100
everything up for people that are listening, because I know you're a keto proponent, and we

1207
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:08,860
love the ketogenic diet. Ketogenic diet has always worked really well for me because it's allowed me

1208
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:14,300
to keep control over the amount of food that I eat. It's one of the few things that has burned

1209
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:21,660
off my hunger. It's one of the few things that have burned off my cravings. It's the only thing

1210
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:25,500
that has ever done that before. Where in the bodybuilding cycle,

1211
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:31,340
2600 calories, what's the percentage is the macros. We're getting some information from

1212
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:37,580
Daniel Arago off screen here. For those that are interested. Oh, yeah, yeah. What's a Peter want

1213
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:42,620
to know the macros for the fats probably. So it's 2600 calories is what you're saying.

1214
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:47,820
Not a whole lot of calories. But you know, one thing on that is I don't feel deprived at all.

1215
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,700
I feel like I'm eating because I'm eating every two and a half, three hours. And everyone keeps

1216
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:57,500
talking about how brutal it is, how hard it is. And I know that it'll get worse because you do

1217
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:01,660
start to calorie restrict. And they, you know, everyone says like the last two weeks kind of

1218
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:06,620
feel like a zombie. But I've been feeling really good. And as I mentioned earlier, the progress is

1219
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:11,980
the motivation is every day I see something new or different on me. And I'm like, Wow, I just didn't

1220
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:16,940
even have any idea I could do any of this. I've tore both my biceps. I tore my pec three times.

1221
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:23,500
I tore my hamstring. I've torn a bunch of stuff. And I never tried to consider to really bodybuild

1222
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:29,820
because I was like, man, if I died down, I'd look weird because I've torn all that shit off my body.

1223
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:33,020
People kept asking them for years, when are you gonna do a show you should get, you know,

1224
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:36,380
you're getting lean. I kind of thought I was done. I was done powerlifting. I didn't have a

1225
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:40,060
lot of direction and wasn't sure what I was going to do next. And so this challenge came,

1226
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:46,220
uh, it came at a perfect time. And I don't, the challenge came from a podcast with honey, right?

1227
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:49,980
Yeah. That's right. He was like, he was on his podcast and he said, well, why don't you do a show?

1228
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:54,620
You look great. Well, he said, he said, he said it even more than that. He was like, I signed you

1229
01:39:54,620 --> 01:40:01,340
up for one. Yeah, you're doing it. So where does the ketogenic diet make sense for the bodybuilder?

1230
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:07,180
What phase of, you know, is it when they're trying to get leaner? Yeah. I see. So for,

1231
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:13,740
for, for some of the like pro bodybuilder guys, the ketogenic diet probably doesn't play into

1232
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:20,140
anything they really want to mess around with, unless they've been destructive for a while

1233
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:25,500
with their behavior. Like if they, if they have eaten, if they've gone way off the rails

1234
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,860
and eaten, but a pro doesn't do that professional bodybuilder, somebody who's being serious, who's

1235
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:35,500
trying to win money at these shows, they would not be somebody that would be doing that. So they

1236
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:42,300
wouldn't even need to utilize a ketogenic diet where ketogenic diet would play into where it

1237
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:48,780
would really help even somebody like myself, former fat kid is it'll help me to kind of continue to

1238
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:53,820
tighten up. And it will also give me some mental freedom. I think one of the worst things you can

1239
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:59,660
ever do, whether it's business or any aspect of your life lifting is get stuck in one thing.

1240
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:03,500
Cause you thought of times you're, you're focused in on that one thing and you can't see anything

1241
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:09,020
else. And so if you were always just doing a bodybuilding diet and if you were always utilizing

1242
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:14,940
cardio for 45 minutes every day, all these things would become less effective. So where the ketogenic

1243
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:21,900
diet can come in, you could utilize the ketogenic diet to become technically, uh, works out pretty

1244
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:27,020
good on paper, but I don't know how it works in theory would be, you could become more sensitive

1245
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:32,460
to carbohydrates by dumping in a ketogenic diet at certain points and changing up the style of

1246
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:37,260
exercise that you do for awhile. Bodybuilding competitions, obviously Olympia is not a drug

1247
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:42,460
regulated competition, correct? So you can't compete at that level without lots of drugs.

1248
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,340
What about at the level outside of Olympia? So like this competition you're doing, is it a,

1249
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:52,300
is it considered a drug free competition? I don't even know much about, I've never even been to a

1250
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:57,580
bodybuilding show. So this, this is all very new to me. I, I've only caught the tail end of a

1251
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:03,740
bodybuilding show at the Arnold classic where, you know, I went to go see Brian Shaw and some of

1252
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:07,660
the bodybuilding stuff was finishing up and it was, it was impressive. I mean, it was, it was

1253
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:11,660
pretty crazy to see those guys. Cause those are some of the best, uh, that's effectively the

1254
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:16,940
Olympic level. That's Olympia level bodybuilding. You got Dexter Jackson up there. It was 51 or 52

1255
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:22,380
years old. I mean, there's some real savages there, but, uh, yeah, I don't even know. Like I, I know

1256
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:27,820
the posing I've been working on that, but I don't know like the categories and I barely know.

1257
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:33,420
So for this competition, are you using anabolic steroids or diuretics or any of the other sort

1258
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:39,020
of aids that one would use as in bigger, stronger, faster? You know, I talked about utilizing them

1259
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:44,140
from the time I was 25 and I've been using them. I, you know, I've been, I say in the movie, uh,

1260
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:49,180
I'm going to probably be on and off them the rest of my life. And that's what I believe it's

1261
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:55,020
direction I chose when you choose a certain thing and you like the result of it. Like,

1262
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:59,580
I don't feel like there's any reason to go back. And for me, for now as well, you know,

1263
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:04,780
I get it prescribed, which is a kind of added bonus to making sure that it's like, I guess more on

1264
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:09,020
the up and up, but to me, it doesn't really make any difference whether you grab it from some dude

1265
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:13,500
at the gym or whether you get it from a doctor. I actually think that the, I think that, uh, you

1266
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,060
know, there's, they're not going to be all that regulated anyway, no matter, no matter how you

1267
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:23,100
slice it, but, but what are the, again, I don't know anything about how body builders use steroids.

1268
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:28,860
What are the, what are the, you know, body mass is the main thing. So people get confused about

1269
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:33,740
what they actually do. People get confused about what steroids do. I think people think that,

1270
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:39,420
that steroids automatically make you strong and they don't necessarily automatically make you

1271
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:44,860
strong. What they do in most cases is they allow people to gain more weight. Now there's some cases

1272
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:49,500
where people don't gain a whole lot of weight and they do gain strength, but if you don't continue

1273
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:55,980
to gain weight at some point, that strength will only level up so much. So when you introduce

1274
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:01,420
steroids, steroids don't multiply on top of themselves. They only work to a certain level.

1275
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:06,620
So you're, you're on level one with your lifting and you progress and your genetics and everything

1276
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:11,020
allow you to get to level four. You take steroids and maybe over a period of time, you get to like

1277
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:15,420
level six, but you're still not going to be able to get to level eight, nine or 10 where these guys

1278
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:20,780
like Jay Cutler and some of these mammoth people are because of their genetics, because of their

1279
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:25,900
environment as children, because of X, Y, and Z, you're probably just never going to be able to

1280
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:30,220
level up to their potential. But which is an important distinction because I think a lot of

1281
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:33,900
people, your starting point as well, a lot of people look at, you know, let's just make

1282
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,700
Phil Heath because he's the best in the world today and you're going to think it's all drugs.

1283
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:41,020
It's all drugs, but I don't think people understand like I could inject a human being

1284
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:46,140
with every anabolic steroid period. Like let's get the world's supply of anabolic steroids and

1285
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:51,980
inject it into me. Yeah. I couldn't look one 10th of what that guy looks like. Right. And the best

1286
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:57,340
coaching and the best whatever people like to make things easy and simplify it and they can't come

1287
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:02,380
close to Phil Heath. They can't even come close even with a ton of drugs. So they just want to say,

1288
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:06,460
oh, it's just steroids. It's not, it's not like, oh, this guy works harder. This guy's better.

1289
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:11,820
And I do think that steroids cloud the sport. I do, I do think that if there was a way to get

1290
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:16,540
steroids out of the sport, that it could be more popular across the mainstream. However,

1291
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,460
well, it's part of the reason why it has become more popular because they do have like men's

1292
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:23,900
physique and they got some of these different categories. Now where you're seeing, you're

1293
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:27,500
seeing more men and women. It's gotten more main, more mainstream with some of that stuff.

1294
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:32,380
The body types don't look as crazy, right? Yeah. Now there's a, um, a category called

1295
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:37,820
classic physique. And it's like, it's interesting because like in the very first year of classic

1296
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:43,820
physique, my friend, Danny Hester, he won Mr. Olympia classic physique. He's about 190 pounds.

1297
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:49,420
He looks awesome. He's always, he always looks awesome. He's about my height, 190 Jack shred.

1298
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:52,940
It looks amazing. And then the next year, the guy that wins, it's like 240. You know what I mean?

1299
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:57,260
You're like, this is not classic physique anymore. Like, yeah, like what happened to the

1300
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:02,060
little guys that were in great shape, you know? And the guy that won looked, he looked amazing,

1301
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:07,340
but it's, and it's a different look than the bigger bodybuilders, but it's not like,

1302
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:11,900
it's not yet a natural thing. It's not like one guy is natural. One guy's on. It's like,

1303
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:16,060
they're just on different levels, right? Yeah. So classic doesn't mean drug-free. It means

1304
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,740
you're trying to produce a phenotype that is, you're trying to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger

1305
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:24,300
is like, what's funny is like now they have a category. Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr. Olympia

1306
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:28,140
seven times. He was considered in the Guinness book of world record, the greatest male physique,

1307
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:32,140
which is just a title he gave him. He couldn't win a California bodybuilder. That's what I'm saying.

1308
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:37,340
He can't win anymore. Like so, so they, if you look like Arnold, you'd win classic physique now,

1309
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:41,340
which is kind of crazy. So who's your favorite seventies, eighties bodybuilder?

1310
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:46,620
Frank Zane, Mike Mencer, Mike Mencer. Yeah. And Arnold. Arnold's a really big, uh,

1311
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:51,420
influence fan of Dorian Yates too. You know, we blood and guts. A lot of that was my,

1312
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:56,860
he was, he was later, right. Um, nineties. Oh yeah. And Mencer and Yates actually have quite a bit in

1313
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:01,660
common. They trained, they trained together too. And, um, I trained with Mike Mencer when I first

1314
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:07,500
came out here, when I moved out here in 93, like you see people at the gym and your meat head. Uh,

1315
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,340
first thing I did was I'm training with Mike Mencer. Yeah. I don't care. He blew out my knee

1316
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:15,580
because he had me do these crazy squats in the squat machine and it messed up my knee for like

1317
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:20,460
six months, but it's, I still had got to train with him that which was cool. But at the time I

1318
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:24,940
got to train with him, I showed up at the gym and he was outside smoking a cigarette and he's all

1319
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:29,580
fat. And it was just like, Oh, this is Mike Mencer now. This is what he is, you know? And it's like,

1320
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:34,940
you know, a lot of times in life, especially me, I've met all my heroes and pretty much everybody's

1321
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:40,220
let me down. So it's just the way life is. I guess. Have you ever met a hero that where they exceeded

1322
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:47,260
your expectation? Um, I don't know. Let me see. Have we? Yeah, we have many times. I'm sure,

1323
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:53,580
I'm sure we have. Yeah. Ed Cohn, Stone Cold Steve Austin's one of my favorite people in the entire

1324
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:58,220
world. He's amazing. He's so intelligent. Joe Rogan's. He's so well researched. Like he just,

1325
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:02,140
he's just awesome to be around. Like there's, there's people like that. I think where we,

1326
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:06,380
Jay Cutler was like, the rock, the rock is an amazing dude. Like when you meet the rock,

1327
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:11,180
you're like, well, it's all probably just an act, but the rock will look you in the eye,

1328
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:15,260
shake your hand and say, how's your mom doing? Like, and he means it, you know, and you could,

1329
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:19,820
you could feel that he means it. And, uh, and that's important, especially when you're that

1330
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:23,180
big of a celebrity and stuff like that, you know, one of the things I struggle with, and I was

1331
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:28,220
actually talking about this a little bit when I was on Joe Rogan's show, I've been pretty vocal

1332
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:33,820
and open about my view that once I really spent like five years learning everything there was to

1333
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:38,460
learn about anabolic steroids, I came to the conclusion that, well, I can't speak to what

1334
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:42,860
happens in bodybuilding because I think that takes it to a different level, but certainly within the

1335
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:50,220
level of how they're used in cycling or, you know, more physiologic levels of use, I can't see any

1336
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:55,260
evidence of harm. Now, EPO is different. You can certainly take too much EPO and cause problems,

1337
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:00,540
but once you start talking about testosterone, stenazolol, oxandrelone, these drugs that are

1338
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:04,620
typically used in sports, again, I was having a very hard case. I'll give you, I'll show you

1339
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:11,340
right here, my tricep. It's torn. I was bench pressing 455 after it, my triceps hurt a little

1340
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:16,540
bit. They were sore. And then I popped my tricep. I've never been hurt lifting in my entire life.

1341
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:20,140
At the time I was on a ton of juice. So you're, you're arguing with me that you just didn't have

1342
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:26,540
the tendon strength necessarily. And I attribute that to steroid use for sure. 100%. So to say

1343
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:30,700
that there's no ill effects of them or no side effects or no, I guess I'm thinking more of the

1344
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:37,100
cardio metabolic liver, kidney, cardio. No, but can you injure yourself? You know, Joey Diaz, one

1345
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:40,780
of my favorite people in the world. He's hilarious. He says, he's like, you see these guys in the gym

1346
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:44,860
and they're like 50 years old and they used to take steroids and now they just like, like a bag of

1347
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:48,940
shit. You know, it's like, I kind of agree with that statement too, that there are a lot of people

1348
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:55,340
that have taken steroids and abused them and gotten really crappy skin and crappy, like just,

1349
01:49:55,420 --> 01:50:01,260
you know, things that, uh, that don't look good, not aesthetic and probably not healthy. I'm sure

1350
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:05,820
that they've driven a lot of people's blood in a bad direction, which could, which could lead to

1351
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:10,220
other things possibly. Right. But, but not definitely. So I think that's where we're

1352
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:16,860
looking at like the detrimental effects of steroids would be among, it's like among the users that are

1353
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:20,620
losers. If that makes sense. It's like, it's among the users that, that aren't paying attention to

1354
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:25,580
everything else. Yeah. And I guess under medical supervision though, when you're again doing these

1355
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:30,140
things within physiologic doses, which is pretty different than what the average person is doing.

1356
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:36,060
We're talking like something that a doctor would prescribe. Yeah. Well, you know, for example,

1357
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,260
you take somebody whose testosterone is like two standard deviations below the mean and you

1358
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:46,060
revert them back to the mean or median level of testosterone. If we're going in that respect,

1359
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:50,380
I would have to go back and say that you're a hundred percent right. I haven't seen anything

1360
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:56,060
like even a muscle tear on a normal dose, but I was, I was using pretty good doses. I was just

1361
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:01,740
trying to, well, at the time I was using trend balloon and I was using testosterone together.

1362
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:05,100
And then I was taking some other oral stuff. It was like right after I got out of rehab,

1363
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:09,900
like I gotta get jacked, you know, and like, and it's funny cause they tell you in AA that if you're

1364
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:14,140
on steroids, it affects you from the neck up and you're not allowed to take them. So people got on

1365
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:20,620
my case about and how much testosterone just 200 milligrams a week. I've always stuck to the

1366
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:24,940
200 milligrams. I never really went above that because I never wanted to get like puffy, you

1367
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:29,340
know, which is interesting cause I don't think I've, if I've ever replaced a person's testosterone,

1368
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:34,060
which I've done many times exogenously for patients who are low, I've never had a patient

1369
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:39,260
that high and 200 is not high from a performance standpoint. I've seen guys show up. What is it?

1370
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:43,420
Usually a hundred. I mean, yeah, if I'm going to start a patient again, I'm, I have, it's much more

1371
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:47,100
complicated. I need to know their sex and we're binding globulin, their estrogen, their free

1372
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,300
testosterone is really what we're trying to fix. But very unusual that I would ever start a patient

1373
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:57,420
anything more than 50 milligrams twice a week. It's interesting cause everybody I know is on the

1374
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:01,980
same, goes the same doctor has the same dose. So it's, it's just the, well, and again, it's a very

1375
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:05,500
different, it's a very different thing. I'm where I try to optimize for me. My interest in replacing

1376
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:09,900
testosterone is resolving insulin resistance, preserving muscle mass. Like it's a, it's a bunch

1377
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,060
of other things. It's interesting that you say that and it actually gives me a lot more confidence

1378
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:19,100
in going to somebody talking to somebody like you. It's like, I just know almost everybody that's on

1379
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:26,940
testosterone. They all take 200 milligrams. Like I don't think I've, I think I've once had a patient

1380
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:31,980
take a hundred twice a week. So I think it would, I think when you're saying it is like, oh wow,

1381
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:36,140
you actually, you actually don't give everybody the same dose. You know, first of all, I don't even

1382
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:40,540
like, I mean, most, most patients that I need to replace testosterone in, which is still a

1383
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:47,660
minority of patients, I'm not using testosterone, right? My first goal is can you get them to

1384
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:52,380
endogenously make testosterone? So, you know, the way I, I have a, and what are you utilizing to do

1385
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:56,940
that? Yeah. So I start with the final thing I care about is free testosterone. So a free testosterone

1386
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:02,460
is low and I define low as somewhere between one and two standard deviations below the mean of our

1387
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:07,260
reference range in the lab and symptomatic. So you have to have these two things in my opinion.

1388
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:12,380
So if, if the number's low, but I see no evidence of symptom, meaning they're not having a difficult

1389
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:15,900
time maintaining muscle mass. They don't have too much adipose tissue. They're not insulin resistant.

1390
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:20,140
Labitos fine. All of these things. Then I don't believe in fixing the number, but let's assume

1391
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:24,540
you have someone who's symptomatic and who's low. So free testosterone is low. The next question is,

1392
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:29,260
is free testosterone low because testosterone is low or because sex and we're binding globulin is

1393
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:33,660
high because free testosterone, which is what matters is proportional to testosterone and

1394
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:37,500
inversely proportional to sex and we're binding globulin. So once you answer that question,

1395
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:41,020
if sex and we're binding globulin is too high, you have to investigate why. And there are really

1396
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:48,060
only four reasons for it. Insulin, thyroid hormone, estrogen, and genetics. So you, you do your

1397
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:52,700
investigation. You figure out what's going on. If testosterone is too low, the next question is,

1398
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:57,260
is it too low because you're siphoning too much of your testosterone into either dihydrotestosterone,

1399
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:03,100
DHT or estradiol? Yes or no. If yes, you can block both of those, right? You have five alpha

1400
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:07,740
reductase inhibitors. You have aromatase inhibitors. If it's low, not because you're siphoning too much

1401
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:11,980
away, then the question is, are you not producing enough? And if you aren't producing enough, are

1402
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:16,140
you not producing enough because you don't have enough DHEA, which is a substrate, or do you not

1403
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:21,660
have the pituitary signal? Is your FSH and LH too low? So there are actually nine steps in

1404
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:26,860
understanding someone's testosterone and free testosterone level. And we can actually impact

1405
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:32,620
every single one of those steps pharmacologically if we're trying to put this in service. So,

1406
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:35,340
so yeah, it's a, it's a much different approach when you're doing it for medical management.

1407
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:40,460
This kind of blows my mind too, because I'm going like, wow, there's now, so this is like, you know,

1408
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:44,620
you learn something new every day. It's like, I'm just used to people taking 200 milligrams of

1409
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:49,260
testosterone. Now you just turn me on to nine different ways that I can increase things. You

1410
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:54,220
know, it's like, right. You can give a person, you can give them something that stimulates LH or FSH

1411
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:59,740
production. So there's a pre-hormone that's a synthetic hormone that mimics, well, it mimics

1412
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:04,300
basically an estrogen molecule at the hypothalamus that then tells the pituitary to make more FSH

1413
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:08,540
and LH. That in many ways is a... And now you're putting this into practice clinically and you're

1414
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:12,860
seeing awesome results with it. Yeah. And this is funny, this is one of those things that we learned

1415
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,260
sort of from people who were doing this, but it's now actually become, I mean, I would hesitate to

1416
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:21,580
say mainstream because I don't think people are fully mainstream in understanding this, but now

1417
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:25,900
you're seeing this stuff published in medical literature that says, hey, there are really

1418
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:30,300
reasonable safe ways to increase a person's testosterone without even giving them testosterone.

1419
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,540
Well, you can also start with... I'd be more interested in that.

1420
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:37,740
Even without supplementation, right? There could be certain foods, right? There could be certain

1421
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:43,260
foods to avoid. Maybe somebody doesn't have a sound diet. I mean, a sound diet has to throw you out.

1422
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:47,500
To me, the first step in evaluating a male for hypogonadism, which is just the technical term

1423
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:53,260
for low testosterone, especially if the... So this is a not uncommon finding. The guy has low

1424
01:55:53,260 --> 01:56:14,680
free testosterone, but his estradiol is not too high. His sex and

1425
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:21,320
testosterone is low. So that tells you where the problem is. The problem is in the brain.

1426
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:28,120
And the number one diagnosis for that is sleep deprivation. So when I finished residency,

1427
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:36,600
I didn't measure free testosterone. I only knew my total testosterone, but it was 220. That was

1428
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:43,320
on a scale where two standard deviations below the mean was 350. Two standard deviations above

1429
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:50,280
the mean was 1200. And I'm 220. Yeah, after my hip replacement, I was 49. That's when I got on it.

1430
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,960
Yeah, 49. I mean, most women have a higher testosterone. My doctor just said,

1431
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,680
I don't know how you get out of bed. I don't know. I just do. So in my case,

1432
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:05,320
my testosterone went from 220 to about 650 by just sleeping. Once I went from not sleeping

1433
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:10,440
four hours a night, boom, that improves. A lot of Americans are not sleeping because they're obese,

1434
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:14,920
because they're heavy. So if they could figure out a way to get momentum, get the diet straightened

1435
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,240
out, get to sleep a little bit better, they could start heading the right direction too.

1436
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:25,800
Yeah. And the other thing is cortisol. So if you have hypercortycelemia, that is going to negatively

1437
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,440
impact testosterone production directly and indirectly. What is hypercortisol?

1438
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:35,240
High levels of cortisol. That's all it is? Yeah. Yeah. In medicine, we have to come up with

1439
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:38,840
fancy ways to say things because it makes us feel smarter. So if you have too much cortisol,

1440
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:43,080
one, you have a shunt, right? You have something called a pregnealone shunt or steel, where you

1441
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:49,320
start to steal precursors of testosterone to make more cortisol. So that's depleting you of substrate

1442
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:54,840
to make this. But I think perhaps the more sinister issue is these high levels of cortisol

1443
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:00,600
impair you from entering what's called delta wave sleep, which is where you make the FSH and LH to

1444
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:04,600
make the testosterone. You only make this stuff when you're sleeping. What about, you know, there's

1445
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:09,320
a lot of doctors that are like are prescribing stuff to people and they'll prescribe some of

1446
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:15,240
these cholesterol, you know, medications. Statins. These statins. Yeah. They're probably damaging,

1447
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:21,240
right? I mean, some of these things are probably damaging towards just a natural male testosterone

1448
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:28,040
and even with the females and stuff. Aren't these things kind of plaguing us a little bit too?

1449
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:32,680
In theory, you could make an argument that says if you take a statin, which is inhibiting cholesterol

1450
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:38,840
synthesis, and given that you need cholesterol to make sex hormones, that should be depleting them.

1451
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:43,800
But we don't actually see that in the data. So even though it's a no, you don't actually see that now

1452
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,960
that doesn't mean that at extreme levels, it won't show up. I think I've been saying that for years.

1453
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:51,640
Well, like it blocks your cholesterol and that's what makes your hormones. It turns out that's

1454
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:55,400
probably overly simplistic. The body is more complicated and more rigorous than we give it

1455
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:01,960
credit for. So the body will prioritize its use of cholesterol for two things above all else,

1456
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:06,840
which is forming cellular membranes because cholesterol is what gives a cell its fluidity,

1457
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:13,160
membrane fluidity, and then hormone production. So particularly glucocorticoids and sex hormones.

1458
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:19,960
So does that mean that you couldn't statinize a person into the next millennium end up suppressing?

1459
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:24,840
No, it doesn't. You probably could. But I think at the levels that most people are taking them,

1460
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:29,640
the evidence would not actually suggest that we're inhibiting endogenous testosterone production.

1461
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:33,480
I think with what I do, I was made the movie Prescription Thugs and then all of a sudden,

1462
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:38,360
I'm like, statins are bad. Stay away. And then I listen to you talking. You had a really

1463
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:42,200
intelligent conversation with Dr. Kraus. Ron Kraus.

1464
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:46,280
Ron Kraus. And the guys are all talking about statins the whole time. Like,

1465
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,560
wait a second. These guys don't know that they're bad. And I'm like, well, these are the guys that

1466
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,720
actually know what they're talking about. They treat people every day. And so it kind of opened

1467
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:58,920
my mind back up to statins. So I think a lot of times when we're doing research or we're trying

1468
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:04,680
to find out the truth or whatever, I was like, oh, statins are all bad. And I just think all one

1469
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:09,560
way. And I'm trying to not think that way about things. Like where I'm thinking nothing's all bad,

1470
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:13,720
nothing's all good. And that's kind of the way to bring this thing full circle as we probably wrap

1471
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:17,880
up so we can let you guys get back to your day. At the outset, I said you kind of in many ways

1472
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:24,280
opened my eyes to revisiting something that I just assumed was dogma. Steroids are bad. If you have

1473
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:28,360
one milligram of testosterone, cypionate injected into a human being, you will kill them. That was

1474
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:34,280
my view. And then I come away from bigger, stronger, faster. And I'm like, maybe I got to

1475
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:38,520
rethink this. Now it's not to say I have any understanding or expertise of how steroids are

1476
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:43,000
used in bodybuilding or things like that, where I suspect they can still be harmful if abused,

1477
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,240
but certainly within medical, physiologic levels. Yeah, where is it relative to your life and to

1478
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:53,480
your patients? I now, I honestly believe that anabolic steroids when used at physiologic levels

1479
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:59,480
are safer than Tylenol. Yeah, absolutely. You know, are far less toxic and frankly,

1480
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:04,440
you know, far less likely to lead it to morbidity. And so similarly, maybe you'll leave this

1481
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:09,480
discussion thinking, okay, maybe it's not statins are all bad. Maybe the idea is they got to have

1482
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:14,680
a time and a place. The overall overarching thing I've learned from making this movie about nutrition

1483
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:19,480
that Mark and I are working on right now is that nothing is all good and nothing is all bad. And

1484
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:24,520
Mark has been really illustrating that to me as we go through, he goes, see, carbs are all bad,

1485
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:28,280
right? See, they're all bad. And it's like, well, no, now I can see how you can use them as a tool,

1486
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:32,440
right? And then statins are all bad. No, no, now we can see how we can use them as a tool and we

1487
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:37,080
can keep people alive longer. And certain people, you might need this tool only for a couple of

1488
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:41,640
weeks to get you to this point and then you can get off of it or whatever. Like it's, it's allowed

1489
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:47,000
me to think more openly about everything that we put in our bodies and everything that we do to

1490
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:51,800
try to be better. Yeah. That when we were inhaling some food before this and you shared your salmon

1491
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:56,920
with me, which was fantastic by the way, especially with that Himalayan sea salt, that was damn good.

1492
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:01,400
I can't take credit all the way to the Himalayas for that. Yeah. The wife, he cooked that up too.

1493
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:05,560
So that was wonderful. But that was a great example of, I mean, again, I know you're in the

1494
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:09,640
midst of a bodybuilding competition prep, but it was beautiful to just see how regiment it's like,

1495
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:13,560
I'm going to have this many grams of salmon. I'm going to have this many Japanese sweet potatoes.

1496
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:18,840
And it's like, you know what? In this moment, these molecules are the tool I need. And I think

1497
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:26,120
that's the takeaway to me is a statin, a carbohydrate, a whatever, it's a tool. And, and the key to me,

1498
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:30,200
if you want to be a great carpenter in life, which I think is should be our, all of us should want to

1499
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:36,440
be the best carpenters in life is have the most tools, know how to use each tool and know when to

1500
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:42,920
use each tool. And when I have patients say to me, doctor, I am morally against fill in the blank.

1501
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:49,560
I am morally against statins. I am morally against supplements. I am morally against XYZ. I say,

1502
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:53,960
okay, I'll never force you or try to talk you into doing anything. But that's sort of like a

1503
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:59,480
contractor coming to my house to rebuild it. And me saying, I just don't want you using the Phillips

1504
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:04,840
screwdriver or the saw. You can do anything else, but don't use those too. That's strike. Can he still

1505
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:10,520
build the house? Of course. But I've just taken away two tools and a lot harder in the hands of

1506
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:16,840
a good carpenter that, that, you know, that seems like a bad idea. So you guys have opened my mind

1507
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:23,720
up to a set of tools known as steroids. And you opened our minds up. Well, very well. Open your

1508
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:29,160
mind. Guys where, so, so tell me when, when's the doc going to come out? So we don't know. I mean,

1509
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:33,960
one question I should just say, a lot of people ask us, when's it going to come out? And they also

1510
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:38,040
ask us like exactly what it's going to be about or what we're trying to say. And I can tell you,

1511
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:44,600
I don't know either answer at all. I have no idea. So every film that I do is a journey. I never know

1512
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:49,160
when it's going to end. It makes a lot of people that work with me mad. And I just say, well, like,

1513
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:53,320
that's just how I do it. Like if you go, okay, we're going to make this movie. We're going to film

1514
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:57,800
for six months and we're going to edit for three months and then we're done. And you, you can do

1515
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:04,040
that. That's like a way to, to do it. But I feel that for example, Mark and I started this movie.

1516
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:08,840
He had no idea he was going to do a bodybuilding show. So, but that's got to be in the movie. That's

1517
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:13,800
awesome. That's like a really cool thing that's actually happening. So what if I just decided like

1518
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:18,600
in the beginning of the movie, when we first started filming, I decided I only want to film

1519
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:24,040
this, then we wouldn't have this whole bodybuilding thing, which could end up being what adds a layer

1520
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:28,680
to it that makes it connect all the dots for people. Totally makes it more nuanced. Or whatever,

1521
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:33,240
right? So we don't really know. But I would say that in general, we're planning on it just coming

1522
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:38,200
out next year, because we're not worried about it for this year. And we're just planning on making

1523
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:44,280
the best thing that we can. And so we like to encourage everybody, like people send me a lot

1524
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:49,160
of information and people give me a lot of tips and I'm open to all of it. I listen, I listen and

1525
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:54,280
read all my comments and everything because I'm open to whatever's going to make the best film.

1526
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:59,720
I'm not trying to set out to make one specific thing. So between when this comes out and when

1527
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:04,040
this film comes out, what is the best way for people to reach you, Chris? They can just find me

1528
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:09,160
on Instagram at big strong fast. That's kind of the one thing that I check all the time. So okay.

1529
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:13,800
And what about you, Mark? Twitter, too. You can't get a hold of me, because I've got too much shit

1530
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,520
to do. But one thing I want to encourage everybody to do is really simple, because nobody ever knows

1531
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:23,000
where to start. And we don't get a lot of answers, because people that are smart don't give you

1532
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,280
definitive answers, because that's just the way it goes. Just try to start walking. You know,

1533
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:32,280
almost all of us are lucky enough to have the ability to put one foot in front of the other.

1534
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,600
Try to go for a 10 minute walk every day. Talk to your son, your daughter, your mom, your dad,

1535
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:45,160
if they live close by, or if you can get a second with them. Do it after lunch, do it after dinner.

1536
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:50,040
Preferably, it'd be great if you can do it more than once a day. But it's just a great place to

1537
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:53,880
start. A great way to clear your mind. There's a lot of shit going on nowadays. If you have

1538
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:59,560
an hour and a half, or whatever it might be, to be on Instagram all day, you certainly can carve

1539
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:04,280
out 10 minutes for yourself every day to go on a walk. Really, really simple, easy thing to do.

1540
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:07,320
And because people aren't going to be able to reach out to you directly, they want to be able

1541
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:10,600
to take advantage of the amazing stuff you've already done. What's your YouTube channel?

1542
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:16,520
Yeah, it's the YouTube channel is Super Training 06. You can also check out my Instagram, which is

1543
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:21,240
at Mark's Melly Bell. And you can also check out my website, which has all my products,

1544
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:26,280
Slingshot, the hip circle, some of the stuff you've seen, which is markbellslingshot.com.

1545
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,240
One thing that we haven't talked about, but it'll leave it up to people to go watch it,

1546
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:36,040
is my new film, A Leaf of Faith, which is about Kratum.

1547
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:37,560
That's right. We didn't even get to that.

1548
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:42,440
Well, we didn't really get to it, but I'll explain it really quick. Kratum is a plant that comes from

1549
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:48,120
Southeast Asia that a lot of people are using to get off of opioids. And they're also using it just

1550
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:53,000
to feel better. Like for me, every day I use it as a pre-workout. It just makes me feel great before

1551
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,880
I get in the gym. I've gotten a lot stronger because of it. I've gotten in better shape because

1552
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:03,640
I can focus better. So A Leaf of Faith is available on iTunes. It's available on Google Play,

1553
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:07,080
YouTube, and Amazon right now. It's not on Netflix yet?

1554
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:12,840
It's on Netflix on August 27th. And then when it comes out August 27th, I think that's going to be

1555
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,640
sort of the real launching point for it because with all my movies, I put them on iTunes and they

1556
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:21,720
go around. When it gets to Netflix, that's when people start talking about it. So I'm excited.

1557
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:26,600
Yeah. It's a good segue into he and I have created a product together because we believe in Kratum

1558
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:32,120
so much. It's helped us so much. It's helped us manage pain. It's helped us to continue on our

1559
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:37,800
diets even. Sometimes in life, you just need something else to do. You need your mind to be

1560
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:43,640
a little bit distracted from your day-to-day grind. And it's a great product. It gives you some euphoria.

1561
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:47,240
It's helped me with creativity and business and stuff like that. And the product is going to be

1562
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:51,720
called Mind Bullet and you'll be able to get it at mindbullet.com. All right. So we're going to link

1563
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:56,840
in the show notes to where people can find you, Chris, on social where they can see all the stuff

1564
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:00,200
you've put out. I'm actually really excited to hear. I didn't even realize I'm embarrassed to say

1565
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:03,880
that you had this YouTube channel with all of these videos because I'm always looking for ways

1566
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:09,160
if I can't plug one of my patients into a trainer that I trust to teach them the correct mechanics,

1567
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:13,160
I actually don't want them to just learn to squat on their own. I kind of want them to be able to

1568
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:17,000
see how it's done. So this will be a great reference as somebody that's contributed content

1569
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,240
to Mark's YouTube page. I could say that he puts in more effort and time than a lot of people that

1570
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:30,360
I see that are putting out videos. They put out almost, is it a video a day? They crank at like a

1571
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:35,560
breakneck speed to like, it's like a movie studio over there. So he's just constantly cranking stuff

1572
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:40,840
out. And it always features like all these people from the fitness industry that people love to see.

1573
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:45,960
And he's always got great information. So I commend him as a filmmaker. I'm giving my brother

1574
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:49,480
props for having a great YouTube channel. We spend probably over a quarter million dollars a year

1575
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:54,360
just on our YouTube channel just to get information out there. Obviously, it promotes the brand,

1576
02:08:54,360 --> 02:09:00,200
promotes the product, but it's I really love trying to get that information out there to arm people,

1577
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:04,440
give people, you know, give people information that they need. Anybody listening to this podcast

1578
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:08,680
that ever wants to come check out Super Training Gym, Super Training Gym is free. I can't always

1579
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:13,000
guarantee that I'm there. But if you want to look up that Instagram, it's at Super Training Gym as

1580
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:20,040
well. Hit up whoever answers questions on there. And they will let you know if and when I'm around

1581
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:24,040
and when you can come in. But the gym is free. In and of itself, that is just an unbelievable

1582
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:28,760
service. Guys, I want to thank you both not just for your generosity and time today, but obviously

1583
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:34,360
more importantly for all the work you guys have been doing over the past decade plus to share what

1584
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:39,400
you've learned with not just me. I'm personally grateful for that. But obviously by extension,

1585
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:46,520
many more people. So we're very grateful as well. We're huge fans right back at you. And I love your

1586
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:51,080
podcast. So I'm excited to be on it and be part of it. Well, you guys are part of the inaugural set.

1587

exclusive. We're in good company. Sucking, sucking podcast. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Peter.
