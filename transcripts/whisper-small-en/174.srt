00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:13,840
Lawrence, thank you so much for coming over. I love being able to interview people in person.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,120
So to have somebody that's from Austin and to be able to sit down with you is really exciting

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,120
today. Well, it's a pleasure to be out and about even under the constrained circumstances that we

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,960
find ourselves. This is a topic that I think many of my listeners are going to kind of wonder

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,400
what does this have to do with longevity because that tends to be what I speak about. But as we sit

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:43,160
here basically minutes away from effectively the 20th anniversary of certainly the most

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,040
pivotal moment for many of us in our lifetimes, of course, you were also alive

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,800
during some of the other pivotal moments in our history. I think for many of us, we just sort of

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,120
can't believe how fast 20 years has gone by. So I kind of want to just start with maybe a silly

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,360
question, but what do you remember of that morning, that Tuesday morning? Where were you?

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,840
Back then I had breakfast with a bunch of colleagues that were learning Spanish. And so

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,600
we would speak Spanish at breakfast and every Tuesday. And after breakfast, I got in the car

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,040
and NPR was on and they had reported one plane had hit the World Trade Center. And by the time I

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:39,160
got home, the second plane had hit. And I hadn't had written about terrorism already. So I was

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,480
aware that this was probably a terrorist attack. It wasn't a surprise to me that it was a terror

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,280
attack. Of course, it was an immense surprise that it was such a dramatic strike.

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,400
Had you heard much about Al Qaeda before this? Were they familiar to you?

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah, I had written a movie called The Siege with Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis, and

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Annette Bening. And it was about what would happen if terrorism came to America. That was

21
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,960
the question I asked myself. And it already happened in London and Paris, of course,

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,920
Tel Aviv. So I suppose it happened in New York. And this movie came out in 1998.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,800
And in August of 98, a couple of months before the movie actually opened,

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,200
there was the first big strike by Al Qaeda against American embassies in East Africa.

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:46,920
And 224 people were killed. And that was scarcely remarked. And I don't even think that

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,640
during the elections, the terrorism was mentioned. Campaigning had already begun for the... Well,

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,400
the midterms were underway. So it wasn't a central issue. It happened over there.

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,640
We still had this sense of invulnerability in America. And I think that's why it was

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,480
unnoticed. But there was another bombing that same month in Cape Town, South Africa,

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,320
at a Planet Hollywood restaurant. And two people were killed, two British tourists,

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,480
and a little girl lost her leg. And an Islamic group called... I've forgotten what the name was.

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,720
An Islamic group claimed credit saying that they were protesting the trailers that had appeared

33
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,360
in movie theaters for the siege. The movie hadn't even come out yet and people are already dead.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,040
And that was a scarring experience for me. I didn't feel that my movie was responsible

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,400
for people getting killed. But had the movie not happened, they'd probably be alive.

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,880
And so terrorism touched me right off. And it's three years before 9-11,

37
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:15,480
there was a lot of anger in the Muslim community about being depicted as terrorists because it was

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,720
a... having spent a lot of time in Egypt and so on, I sensed that if you're going to make a

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,360
plausible terrorist action, that would be the source of it. But there were pickets outside the

40
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,280
movie theaters. I mean, and people don't like to go to the movie when there are pickets. So

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,160
you know, there's always another show. So it didn't do well. It was a bomb. And then after 9-11,

42
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,120
it was the most rented movie in America. And I think it was because in the movie,

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,520
yes, there is terrorism. Yes, it happens in New York and it presages so much of what actually

44
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:57,160
did happen, but it had an ending. And it turned out all right. And I think after 9-11,

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,000
people were desperate for something that would give them a little hope.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah, I was talking to my wife this morning. She was so bummed she couldn't be here to meet you

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,680
because she's such a fan. So we'll have to figure out a way to do something another time. So,

48
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,400
because she was really bummed to not be here. But I was talking about how it's not clear to me,

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,000
because I've never really talked about it with anybody else, what the impact is like collectively

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,920
for the average person, right? So, you know, my story is like everybody else's, which is I can

51
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,680
remember in crystal clarity, every detail of that morning, I was a surgical resident at Hopkins.

52
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,560
I was down in the pediatric trauma bay. A kid had just been hit by a car. So I was tending to this

53
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,800
kid, you know, getting x-rays, doing all the things. He turned out to be totally okay, but

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,400
just making sure he didn't have broken bones. And I remember a person, I remember who they were

55
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:01,960
walking in and saying, a plane just hit the world trade center. And I assumed it was like a Cessna

56
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,720
that had hit the trade center in the fog. So it was sort of like, my only thought was, oh,

57
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,320
it must be a foggy day up in New York today or something. Didn't think anything of it,

58
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,800
kind of went right back to work. And then of course, you know, some odd 40 minutes later,

59
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,920
second plane hits, all of a sudden now the TV's on in the ER and we're all seeing what's going on.

60
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,040
And then, you know, for the next 48 hours, none of us left the hospital because we were sort of

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:33,800
waiting. Would there be survivors coming? Obviously there were none. But the part I never

62
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,000
really understood is how much of a lasting impact it had on me for reasons I can't explain. I didn't

63
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,760
know anybody who died that day. I didn't even know any of the first responders or people who were

64
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:54,760
traumatized as survivors. And yet for at least 10 years, I had horrible dreams about being on,

65
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,760
was it United 93, the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania. I had dreams of being in the

66
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:11,000
cockpit as it was nose diving in the ground. You've spent time talking about this with people.

67
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,880
Is that an experience that you've seen in the normal person who's not,

68
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,840
who wasn't physically or directly touched by this?

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,240
In some ways it's a generational divide. You know, we're old enough for it to have deeply

70
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,480
affected us personally. And I think every American was profoundly affected in one way or another.

71
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,280
For one thing, there was this sense of invulnerability. It was a smug feeling about

72
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,160
we exist in the world, but apart from it, you know, things that happen out there in the rest

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,680
of the world don't really touch us. We meddle in wars and so on, but it never comes to the homeland.

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:02,120
And that was so punctured. It was so disillusioning. And that we're a regular country and we're

75
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:13,000
vulnerable. And that was shattering. And I don't think anybody who was cognizant at that age

76
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,200
I don't think anybody walked away feeling the same. Now it's interesting to me because,

77
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,880
you know, the culture changed around that event and young people don't know what America was

78
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,480
before 9-11. They only know, you know, the country that we've become. And I reflect on,

79
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,080
you know, when I was like in high school,

80
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:45,400
I remember I took a date to the airport in Dallas. It's called Love Field, but not for that reason.

81
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,240
But back then, when you didn't have any money and you wanted to entertain your date, it was,

82
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,760
you know, a plausible place to go. And so we went, walked out on the tarmac where an American

83
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,640
Airlines plane had flown in. We decided he'd just come from Paris. So we sat in the first

84
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,040
class compartment and a stewardess, as we call them then, served us a snack. And then we went up

85
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,480
in the FAA tower and, you know, come on in kids. And so we sat down and watched them, you know,

86
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,960
landing planes. And that was America. There was a sense of freedom and, you know, we talk a lot

87
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,480
about freedom, but that was really freedom that you could, teenagers, you know, just wander in

88
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:40,120
and see things and this unguarded feeling that Americans had, that we were not threatened.

89
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,240
And now the airport experience, if you can just compare that,

90
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:55,480
nobody, you know, young people, even people in their, you know, mid 20s now, or even 30,

91
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,360
don't really know America beforehand. They don't know that you could go into an office

92
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,600
building without having your picture taken, or you could go visit the Liberty Bell in

93
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,720
Philadelphia without having to take off your belt in your shoes. You know, we've built up a security

94
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,040
state and we've been so deeply involved with the rest of the world in an antagonistic manner

95
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:24,200
since then. And that has become normal, but it's an aberration in our history. And, you know, I

96
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:32,760
think that, you know, I would like for us to try to remember the country we were and aim to steer

97
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,880
towards that. Because if you forget the memory, if you lose the memory of the country that we were,

98
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,680
then I don't think we can ever get back to port. It's funny you mentioned that story about being

99
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,200
at Lovefield. One of the memories I have is anytime my dad would travel, and I'm sure my parents will

100
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,440
come up during this discussion because they're immigrants from Egypt, which plays such a central

101
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:04,360
role in the story we're about to discuss. But it was not uncommon for my dad during flights,

102
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,600
you know, if he was going somewhere and he was returning to Toronto, which is where we live,

103
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,960
he would spend most of the flight in the cockpit just playing patty cakes with the crew because he

104
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,120
was such an outgoing guy. And I'm not making this up. There were times when he would bring the entire

105
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,640
crew home and prepare a meal for them because he was, you know, he cooked, you know, in a restaurant.

106
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,480
So there were times when he would show up with eight random people from Air Canada who were coming

107
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,960
to our house because they had, you know, a night layover in Toronto and they'd be coming over for

108
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,800
dinner. I mean, like think about how bizarre that is in the context of the world we live in today.

109
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,840
In the context of the world we live in today. Yeah. We're not unique in that, but other

110
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,680
countries have been putting up with this kind of defensiveness for a long time. And so it's a bigger

111
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,880
challenge in America. And, you know, there's no doubt that we needed to be on guard and protect

112
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,880
ourselves and ramp up our defenses. And, you know, but the truth is, you know, we've in trying to

113
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:17,640
create security for us. We've created a security state that is such an abridgement of our freedom

114
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,200
that we are doing to ourselves. You know, we're doing it to protect ourselves, but at the same

115
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,520
time we're the ones that are holding the handcuffs. And it's an abridgement of our freedom in a profound

116
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,760
way that I think that people who talk a lot about freedom don't really appreciate. So how long after

117
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:44,120
9-11 did the idea come to you that you were going to put in the type of profound research

118
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:51,480
that ultimately led to the looming tower, which I think came out in 06? That's right. It was immediate.

119
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:03,560
You know, I knew this was the story of our lifetime. It was not clear that day that it was Al-Qaeda

120
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,640
but it was pretty clear to me. I mean, I had in my movie, The Siege, I depicted something like that

121
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:20,600
kind of organization. And if you remember, the phones were out in Manhattan that morning

122
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,760
because the cell tower had been destroyed. I do remember that because I had at the time my

123
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:32,600
girlfriend, who was an architect, lived in Manhattan and I couldn't get a hold of her for a day and a

124
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,720
half. And I had a couple of friends from medical school who were residents there, couldn't get a

125
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,640
hold of her. Very strange situation. Yeah, it was unnerving. And so I sent an email to my editor at

126
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,200
The New Yorker, David Remnick, and I said, put me to work. I've been kind of straying from the

127
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,880
reservation, working on movies and things like that. So that afternoon, the phones came back on,

128
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,720
at least for The New Yorker. And we had a conference call with, I guess, about a dozen

129
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,400
New Yorker writers. And like me, scattered around, Jeff Toobin, I think, was in the Bay Area.

130
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,520
Jeff Goldberg and Jane Mayer were both in Washington. And we're all checking in.

131
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,440
And what do you want us to do? And what David asked us to do was to find stories,

132
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:38,040
human stories that can form part of a narrative that he would weave together. And I felt that

133
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:46,680
a handicap in Austin. But somehow I found this young man named Kurt Yeltsin. He was a reporter.

134
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,960
He was supposed to have been on the top floor of the World Trade Center at the Windows on the

135
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,080
World restaurant, on the 101st floor, before a conference that his magazine, which was called

136
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:11,080
Waters, was an investment magazine. He had an appointment there at nine o'clock. And he slept

137
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,960
through the subway stop for the first time in his whole life. And so he turned around,

138
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:29,000
got off on the Chamber Street exit, ran into the World Trade Center. The Trade Center's elevators

139
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,160
were up a flight of escalators. So he ran up the escalators and into an elevator. And there were

140
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:44,200
like 200 elevators in the two towers. And you had to change floors. So he ran into the elevator. And

141
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,560
an elevator operator was holding the door for this woman who was taking her time, walking across the

142
00:15:51,560 --> 00:16:00,200
lobby. And Kurt was very anxious because he was late. And as she stepped into the elevator,

143
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,800
he noticed that she had a rose tattoo on her ankle. And he thought to himself, oh, wow.

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,160
And then the plane hit. And in the doors to the elevator accordion, and nobody knew

145
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,600
what had happened. Was it an earthquake? The building had been bombed before by a precursor

146
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:33,000
of Al-Qaeda. So there was that. But Kurt stepped out of the elevator. And he looked around in the

147
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,040
lobby. And there were objects lying there, concrete objects. He said the size of an alarm clock and

148
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:50,840
some like the size of an office chair and just lying on the ground of the lobby. And it was eerie.

149
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:01,560
Remember, he had to go up a flight, but he was confused. And he saw daylight. And he went towards

150
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:11,080
that. And it was a door that led to a patio. And he walked outside and there were hundreds of shoes

151
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,960
on the ground and something else that he thought was luggage, but turned out to be human torsos.

152
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,560
And then something landed right beside him. And so he went back in. And his story of

153
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,960
escaping the Trade Center and making it home to Queens became the

154
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:42,680
bookend of the New Yorker's black issue. And that's what got me started. It was, I gotta say,

155
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:51,240
incredibly wrenching to hear his story and pasted it together over a number of interviews. And I

156
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:02,920
would interview him. And then my wife would type up the notes and a lot of weeping going on. But

157
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:12,120
I knew from then that I was on the case and that whatever portion of my life was already

158
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:21,640
spoken for. A couple of months later, I signed a contract February for a book that was supposed

159
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,680
to be turned in a year later. And I scratched out February and wrote March or something April. I had

160
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,560
no idea. I turned it in five years later. So I had no idea what I was getting into, but I just knew

161
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,160
that I was going to go all the way to the end of this.

162
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,840
Yeah. Those stories, by the way, are so interesting to me. I only know one,

163
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,400
which is a friend of mine's ex-wife was supposed to be on one of the four flights. I don't remember

164
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,800
which one, but she missed the flight. So she overslept, she got to the airport, but didn't get

165
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,120
through security and time. So by the time she got to the gate, they had already shut the doors.

166
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,360
I think the plane was even pulling away. And so you have this moment where you're so upset,

167
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,040
in that moment, can't imagine a greater tragedy, right? Whatever it is she was going to do,

168
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,800
what an inconvenience to, because it was a cross country flight. And then of course,

169
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,920
to realize that that saved your life. Those stories are, there's hard to process.

170
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,800
And what you're doing here is that somebody else may have gotten that seat.

171
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,000
And so there's another side of those coincidences.

172
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,360
Right. The person who would have only made that flight by standby or something.

173
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:47,080
Well, your book is really two stories. It's really a book of two parallel stories that are

174
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,160
each one very difficult to get through. If I'm going to be honest, I've read your book

175
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,160
two and a half, three times basically. And it gets more frustrating the more you get through it,

176
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:08,760
because you pick up new things in it that just seem so difficult to swallow. But at least the

177
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,440
way I sort of read the book is it's basically the history of Al Qaeda. How did this organization

178
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,800
come to be? Because most people, when they think of Al Qaeda, they of course think of Osama bin Laden.

179
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,520
But there are more actors to it. And there's a long history that goes back to Egypt. And as you

180
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,200
and I were speaking a little bit before we sat down, so much of what you wrote about resonates

181
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,960
with things I knew about my childhood, because we used to go to Egypt every year. And then there's

182
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,640
this parallel story that's perhaps the most upsetting part of the book, if that's possible,

183
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:53,320
which is the story about the intelligence. I remembered shortly after 9-11, Thomas Friedman

184
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,880
wrote an article in the New York Times that said, this was not a failure of intelligence. It was a

185
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,800
failure of imagination, implying that it's not that our intelligence community failed us. It's

186
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,920
that we could have never imagined this. But I don't know that I can agree with that after

187
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:18,760
reading your book. One bit, I think this was a catastrophic failure of intelligence. So maybe

188
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,160
we'll start with the former. And it seems that a good enough place to start would be Saeed Qatub.

189
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,720
So who is this character and why is he an important figure in the creation of Al Qaeda?

190
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Saeed Qatub was an educator in Egypt and very cosmopolitan in his way. And he was religious,

191
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:56,520
but he wasn't at the beginning fanatical. But he was a member of the Muslim brothers,

192
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:07,080
which was outlawed in Egypt. And Nasser came into power in 1952 and the officers revolt. And

193
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,280
looking around for partners, he decided that maybe the Muslim brothers could be co-opted.

194
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:22,760
And so he tried to enlist Saeed Qatub in his governance. And Qatub signed on for a little

195
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,320
bit. But the truth is, the Muslim brothers had a goal, which was not to have a military

196
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:37,320
dictatorship, but an Islamic one. And they never really came to an agreement.

197
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:48,680
And Saeed Qatub actually wasn't thrown out of the country. Some friends arranged for him to get out

198
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:55,640
of Egypt at a time when it was really difficult for him. And he got a job teaching in Greeley,

199
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:05,720
Colorado at this little college. And I visited Greeley, and I don't know how different it was

200
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:18,200
in 1940s when he first went there. But I think it's a town that reminds you of America as it used

201
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:27,080
to be. Lots of green lawns, innumerable churches, just a scrubbed up Norman Rockwell type of town.

202
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,680
And Qatub hated it. He just thought it was the worst excesses of America. I mean,

203
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:43,160
if only he knew. But he was shocked by the behavior of the women. He was very threatened by them.

204
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,360
And he was-

205
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,880
I mean, imagine he'd gone to Vegas or something, right?

206
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,920
He did spend a little bit of time in New York, which was interesting for him because his brother,

207
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,640
who was in Mecca, came out of Mecca to allow me to interview him, said that he had never met a Jew

208
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,560
until he got to America. And yet he hated them. There was the unseen enemy. And then suddenly,

209
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:18,280
he's in Manhattan, and he's encountering Jews all over the place. And then he goes to Greeley.

210
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,360
It was a turning point for him. He came back and wrote a very influential article about how

211
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:36,200
dangerous America was. And this was at a time when America was seen as the one non-colonial power

212
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,600
by the developing world. And it was held in very high esteem. And yet that was an opening shot.

213
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:51,080
Then came the revolution. And Nasser reached out to see if he could bring him into the government.

214
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,440
And that didn't work out at all. They had totally different aims for the country. Nasser,

215
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:05,880
not obviously a secularist, but probably, but he saw the powerful trend of Islam in the country.

216
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,480
And he wanted to tame it in some way. And he thought by co-opting site, Qutb might be able to.

217
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,400
And Qutb had written every Friday in the newspapers, not just in Egypt, but all over the

218
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:29,960
Arab world, they would publish his commentaries on Islam and the Quran. So he was a figure of note.

219
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:39,400
And at the time Egypt was mostly Sunni? Egypt is divided into almost entirely Sunni

220
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Muslims and Christians. The Shiite minorities, insignificant. But there is about a 10%.

221
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:58,120
Nobody really knows, but there's a smaller population of Christians. And like a lot of

222
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:06,760
Islamic countries, there's little to choose from on the religious banquet. And the option is to be

223
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:15,880
more or less religious. And piety is how you advance in a deeply religious society as

224
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Egypt was and actually became much more so. When I lived there in 69 to 71,

225
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:36,120
my female students were not covered. Even at Cairo University, it was rare to see women with

226
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:44,120
head coverings. And I was teaching at the American university at the same time, I'm in Elza water.

227
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,520
He was a medical student at Cairo University. And he was part of an effort to get women to cover

228
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,920
and to become more obviously religious. So it was a country in transition.

229
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:07,240
It's interesting. So you were there. My mom left Egypt when she was 22. And the day she flew out,

230
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,800
it was her first time leaving the country was September 28th, 1970. And so when she departed

231
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,400
from Cairo, Nasser was the president and a young president. He was in his fifties. When she landed

232
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:30,840
in Copenhagen on the news, Nasser was dead. And she was in such shock because Nasser was like kind

233
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:37,560
of a God to her generation. And he seemed indomitable. It just seemed like this is a person

234
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:45,720
who will be president of Egypt forever. So you were there exactly in the middle of that transition

235
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:54,520
from Nasser to Sadat. What did it strike you as the implication of that was in terms of

236
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,360
either the secularization of Egypt or the move towards this more religious state?

237
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:10,280
You have to understand what Nasser stood for. In Egypt, he was the first Egyptian

238
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,080
to rule over Egypt since- 2500 years.

239
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,520
Yeah, at least 2500 before Cleopatra and all the Greeks who took over as a pharaonic figures,

240
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:30,520
even King that they overthrew was Turkish. So suddenly you have an Egyptian,

241
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,280
not just an Egyptian, this glamorous, very handsome, compelling figure.

242
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Extremely charismatic and an unusual figure in the Arab world. In fact, his appeal was so broad.

243
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,200
Egypt essentially annexed Syria. It was the United Arab Republic, but the Syrians had very little.

244
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,920
They just wanted to throw in their lot with the most powerful figure in the Arab world.

245
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:15,320
So his sway was unbelievable. It was so powerful that even the hideously mismanaged war against

246
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:22,440
Israel in 1967, which the six day war, you might have well called it the six hour war because it

247
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:30,600
was over as soon as the Israelis bombed the Egyptian airplanes. It was a catastrophe.

248
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:43,320
And yet he survived that. So the idea that there would be a day without Nasser was just not

249
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:51,560
something that occurred to Egyptians. And I remember when it happened, he was actually

250
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:59,640
moderating a peace conference with the Palestinians at the time. And he had a heart attack.

251
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:11,400
And I had a cook who came to my apartment that morning and he said,

252
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,160
the people are like sand in the street. Remember the night that the news came out.

253
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:28,440
I had not heard the news before hearing the eulolating all over. It was eerie.

254
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And because it wasn't a singular sound, it was like a vast sound. And so as Americans, we were

255
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,080
counseled not to go out. I don't think that anything would have happened to us, but the

256
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:54,760
streets were weirdly empty. And Cairo always had a problem with pollution and noise. Suddenly it

257
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:03,880
was dead quiet. The atmosphere clarified. It was beautiful, but unsettling. And for three days,

258
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:13,400
you just didn't see anybody. And then they had the funeral. And we went up on the roof.

259
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,640
We lived in Zimalik, which was an island in the middle of the Nile. We were right across from

260
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:30,440
the Russian news agency Novosti. And so we were up on top of the roof and you could see the

261
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,680
parade forming. It started at the end of Zimalik. There was a revolutionary tower.

262
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,760
There's a story on that. The CIA tried to bribe Nasser with $10 million. And he used it to build

263
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,760
this tower, the revolutionary tower on the island directly across from the Hilton so that

264
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,080
Americans could see where their money went. So that's where the parade started, the funeral

265
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:10,280
cortage. And they were going to cross the Khasser El-Nil bridge. And there were all the

266
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:17,000
dignitaries around the world. And what we could see was just a mass of uniforms and suits and

267
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,360
stuff like that. But we could also see this immense crowd of people on the other side of the

268
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:31,800
bridge. And they rushed in towards the cortage. And in the middle of the bridge, they met the

269
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:43,400
mourning chirines and the dignitaries. And in the front of the cortage, there were police with

270
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:53,000
batons beating a path through people. And the turmoil was so great that from where we were,

271
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:02,360
which was a mile away maybe, we could see the bridge trembling. And I've often thought about

272
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,720
how soldiers have to break ranks when they cross a bridge because of- Right. Otherwise,

273
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,280
you get the Tacoma Narrows effect. Yes. So I worried that the bridge might actually crack,

274
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:21,080
but they beat their way all the way through the mobs in the streets. And I thought,

275
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,920
this country will never be the same. And it really has never been. I will qualify that by saying,

276
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:38,440
it has never been, although it has always been ruled by military forces, military figures,

277
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:48,520
with the brief exception of the Muslim Brotherhood president. And then who becomes

278
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:58,360
president is Anwar Sadat, who was regarded as a joke in Egypt. He had been in the officers'

279
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,920
coup, but he missed the revolution. He was at a movie. It was a double feature, but he missed

280
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,560
the revolution. And that was a story that hung around Anwar Sadat. And people thought he was a

281
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:19,160
fool and he wouldn't last. And he turned out to be a significant figure because of him,

282
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:27,960
Egypt and Israel are at peace to this day. Everybody underestimated him, but he had been

283
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:37,160
in Nasser's shadow all that time. So it marked a turning point. And it was Sadat who expelled the

284
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:46,040
Soviets. Up until that point, Egypt had been a kind of Soviet military base and the US and

285
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,800
Egypt didn't have diplomatic relations. There were only a handful of Americans actually there

286
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:02,200
when I was living there. Now, four years prior to Nasser's death, he had Qutb executed. But you

287
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,640
get the sense that he was, that was reluctant. I think he understood that that execution would

288
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,040
make a martyr of him. And there's probably nothing worse that you could have done than have made a

289
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,680
martyr of this man. Didn't he have Sadat then as either prime minister or vice president,

290
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,280
almost try to get Qutb to just ask for some sort of forgiveness so he could save face and not

291
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:36,360
execute him? Qutb was a hard case. He would rather die than renounce his stance. And he told Sadat

292
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:44,840
that. And he called their bluff. It cost him his life, but it also gave birth to this movement

293
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:52,120
because once Qutb was dead, he became a symbol of the oppressiveness of the Arab regimes.

294
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,280
The dictatorships that spanned the entire of North Africa all the way to Turkey.

295
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,880
And what was the alternative? The only alternative that people could see was the Muslim Brotherhood

296
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,640
or some other form of Islamism. So it was Qutb's death that inspired, for instance,

297
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:27,800
Ayman al-Zawahri. Ayman al-Zawahri, his uncle, was Qutb's lawyer and had been his teacher.

298
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:36,840
He was a dear friend of Qutb. And just before Qutb was hanged, he gave Zawahri's uncle his

299
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:50,920
Quran, which was incredibly treasured. And so when Ayman al-Zawahri was 15, he started a cell

300
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,800
to overthrow the Egyptian government. That'll show you the level of commitment that Al-Qaeda

301
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,640
was born in. And there's something else that's very interesting that I remember,

302
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:09,880
as I mentioned to you, so much of reading your book put into context so many stories that I had

303
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,160
heard growing up that seemed at the time disjointed because they sort of lacked the clarity of the

304
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,600
full arc. But one of them was how Sadat upon immediately becoming president basically freed

305
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,760
many of the prisoners that Nasser had put away. So it seemed that Nasser had a much clearer

306
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,080
understanding of the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. And I guess the question is,

307
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,520
what is it that Sadat hoped to gain by freeing these individuals?

308
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:52,200
Sadat, unlike Nasser, was very pious and he thought nobody was more pious than he. He called himself

309
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,080
the first man of Islam. How about that? And he thought because he was religious that he would

310
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:07,800
have standing with people in the Muslim Brotherhood. He totally underestimated

311
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:18,200
the fanaticism that had grown up in those prisons. And not just because of Said Qutb, but

312
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,960
one of the things that radicalized Qutb was when he was in prison, soldiers came in and shot

313
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:34,440
prisoners in their cells. And his question to himself was, what kind of Muslim would do this

314
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,840
to another Muslim? And his answer was, they are not Muslims. And so essentially,

315
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,680
there's a phrase in Arabic called takfir, which is to expel someone for their disbelief.

316
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:59,880
And so he created the precedent that unless you believe as I, we do, you're not a real Muslim.

317
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:10,120
And once that door was opened, it led to the idea of terrorism. And that's where Zawahiri and

318
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,360
bin Laden got permission to become the terrorists that they became.

319
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,520
How far back does that precedent go? If you go back to Muhammad, where is the first sign

320
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,560
that it's okay to kill someone if they don't believe what you believe?

321
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:43,000
Well, the question of killing someone, there was a lot of tribal warfare before Islam. And

322
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:52,040
Islam was really in part an effort by Muhammad to unify Muslims, to stop fighting each other.

323
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,280
And Islam, one of the meanings is submission, submit, accept your place.

324
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,640
But that didn't stop a lot of the infighting in Saudi Arabia, in particular, the Iqwan,

325
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:24,440
were wildly fanatic tribesmen that the first king of Saudi Arabia enlisted in his battle. But then

326
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,120
in order to subdue them, he had to bring in British warplanes and machine guns to shoot his

327
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:39,160
own soldiers of the cross, so to speak. In modern era, it was bin Laden who looked out at

328
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:49,720
in the Takfiri universe. There was a kind of doctrine that came from some of the discourse

329
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:59,000
that first of all, you have to attack the near enemy, and then the far enemy. And the far enemy

330
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,080
being the West and the United States, but the near enemy being dictators like Mubarak and so on,

331
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:14,920
the royal family in Saudi Arabia. So the heretics, the heretics, the Shia, the Jews, the West,

332
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,720
those would be the four stated enemies. Absolutely. In basically in proximity.

333
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,680
Yes. But first of all, tend your own house. Well, it was bin Laden who looked out and said,

334
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,400
the far enemy is not far. America is right off our shores. There are bases in Saudi Arabia.

335
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:42,680
You cannot call them the far enemy anymore. So using the permission that he had been given

336
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,120
to wreak havoc and kill people at will, bin Laden turned on America.

337
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,400
So going back to the early 70s, so Zawahiri is in school. He's going through medical school.

338
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:06,840
Sadat sort of saves face during the 1973, the Yom Kippur War. Sadat is sort of romanticized in

339
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:17,480
the West. But what was the view inside Egypt of Sadat in the sort of mid to late 70s? Was he

340
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,800
basically ostracized in the Middle East for creating peace with Israel? I mean, that can't

341
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,200
have been popular with the other Middle Eastern nations, correct?

342
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,040
It wasn't popular in Egypt either. Well, let me qualify that. There were people that were tired

343
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:40,200
of strife and wanted to make peace. But the rhetoric in the Middle East, the rhetoric in

344
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:47,160
the Middle East at that point was that Israel had to be destroyed. And here was Amor Sadat saying,

345
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:57,480
no, we're going to make peace with Israel. First, he had to demonstrate that he was willing to go to

346
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,400
war because the Israelis were so complacent they didn't see a threat. And actually, I don't think

347
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:11,400
here, Sadat doesn't get enough credit for the daring. There was a kind of maginot line that

348
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,440
the Israelis had built. They'd taken all of Sinai. Sinai, yeah.

349
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,960
And along the Suez Canal, they built this sand fortress that extended a whole length,

350
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:32,120
cliffs of sand topped by artillery and little caves inside with machine gun emplacements and

351
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:42,760
stuff like that. It looked really formidable. And Sadat managed secretly to create this army

352
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:51,720
and invasion force. And how do they bring down that castle of sand with fire hoses?

353
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,960
It was amazing how the sand just melted away, but they had these high pressure fire hoses they'd

354
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:05,240
gotten from Germany. And within a few hours, they had managed to cross the Suez Canal,

355
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:13,240
which the Israelis thought was totally impossible. And it was in kind of a mirror of the 67 war.

356
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:24,280
Egypt was essentially defeated by Ariel Sharon's army, which surrounded them. But

357
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,760
they had made the point. And at that point, Sadat was a real hero.

358
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:42,600
He gave pride to the Egyptian people who felt so humiliated. And one of the things that

359
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,920
he had to counter was the lessons that the Egyptians had drawn from the 67 war and the

360
00:44:51,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Israelis. The Israelis thought, well, we really are God's people. Look at this. Just before the

361
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,480
war, we were digging trenches for mass graves in the public parks. And now we've conquered

362
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,440
all of our Arab neighbors within six days. Just unbelievably thrilling.

363
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:23,160
And so what lesson did the Arabs, and particularly the Egyptians, take, which is we're not God's

364
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:33,320
people. Why would he let this happen to us? And the answer was, we are not religious enough.

365
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:41,560
And so that answer resonated with so many people. And the 67 war was a huge

366
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,680
influence in driving people into radicalism. And that was something that Sadat

367
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,080
didn't fully take into account. And of course, eventually that radicalism would focus on him.

368
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,440
And so what did you describe him as? I thought that was just hilarious. He described himself

369
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:07,320
as the first man of Islam. Yeah. The funniest concept ever. Because the reality of it is,

370
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:14,280
he would, at the end of his, as we drew close to the end of his life, he would completely turn

371
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:21,000
around and say, no religion in politics, no politics in religion. He saw the damage that

372
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,760
this religion was causing and said, we must separate this church and state. And is that

373
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,200
ultimately what led to the fatwa being brought against him? Well, peace with Israel was a part

374
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:47,320
of it. There was also, he was chiding. He was really pharaonic in his behavior, which is not

375
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:57,000
unusual in people that rule over Egypt. But he derided women who were covered as saying that they

376
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,720
were wearing tents on their head. And that really offended a lot of Islamists. And his wife, I

377
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:11,240
believe had pushed for the right for a woman to have a divorce. So they were really trying to

378
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:19,080
bring modernity to Egypt. And it was ultimately the nail in his coffin. It was a similar path

379
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,960
that the Shah of Iran had gone through. Yeah. I was going to ask you about that because the Shah

380
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:32,840
was basically overthrown in 79 or was it 78? It was 79. And that year was a catastrophic one

381
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:39,480
for Islam and for Muslim countries. It's the year that the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. It's

382
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:46,920
the year the Shah was overthrown. And it was the year that Camp David peace accords were signed.

383
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:59,000
And I should also say it was the year of the attack in Mecca where radical Islamists took over

384
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,080
the holiest place in Islam. And Saudi Arabia needed the French to come and help. Yeah. They

385
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:11,800
don't like to admit this and there's still no toll. We don't know how many people died, hundreds

386
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,920
or thousands. We don't know. But there were snipers up in the minarets and so on. And

387
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,600
underneath the plaza, there's a warren of rooms and they had stored weapons and food in there.

388
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:33,080
And so there were plans maybe to flood them out. But they were holding hostages. And

389
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,160
we don't really know what happened. But what we understand, when I was researching this as

390
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:49,800
carefully as I could, they bore holes in the plaza and dropped grenades down. So a lot of

391
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:58,760
innocent people were killed and then dozens were arrested and executed. But it was a trauma

392
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:09,480
on the scale of 9-11 in Saudi Arabia. And out of that came a bargain between the royal family and

393
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:17,640
the clerics, which was the royal family needed permission to attack the mosque.

394
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,840
In Islam, it's so holy that you're not even supposed to mow the grass. Every living thing

395
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,080
should be untouched. And here was a situation where totally out of control,

396
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:43,720
thousands maybe of people would be killed. And the royal family did not feel they could do this

397
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:53,000
without a fatwa from the leading clerics. And in return, the royal family agreed to allow

398
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,320
religious figures greater standing and more power within the society.

399
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:08,600
So upon that, Saudi Arabia immediately became far more conservative. And the clerics took control.

400
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:16,600
And you began to see the religious police in the streets and so on. And Saudi Arabia

401
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:29,000
had been on a path not to liberalism, but a more stable society that was somewhat moderate.

402
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,840
But not fanatic. But there were people... Once the religious authorities acquired power,

403
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,800
they used it, but they also became far more fanatical themselves.

404
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:52,280
So the name of the organization that ultimately assassinated Sadat was Al-Jihad, correct? This was

405
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,120
the one half of what would become al-Qaeda. Right. The American intelligence called it

406
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,600
Egyptian Islamic Jihad, but in Egypt, it's just called al-Jihad.

407
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,200
How much of a role did al-Zawahri play in that?

408
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,600
In the assassination? He was a small role. He transferred some guns. He was still a...

409
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,160
He was still a practicing physician.

410
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:24,440
Yeah. He was still a young man, but he had been able to organize police officers and

411
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:32,680
soldiers and stuff like that into his cell. But he wasn't central to the assassination itself.

412
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,040
That's one of my... Of all the turmoil that we've discussed so far in the Middle East,

413
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,160
the first one that really... That is sort of ingrained in me is when Sadat was killed.

414
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:53,720
So I remember that day very clearly. I was eight years old and I remember it so well.

415
00:51:53,720 --> 00:52:00,680
One of my uncles was one of the generals standing with him when he was shot. As you recall,

416
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,400
everybody but Sadat realized what was happening and they all hit the deck. And Sadat actually

417
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:14,440
thought it was part of the parade and he actually stood to greet these soldiers who of course were...

418
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,240
I interpret that differently.

419
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,760
I know you did. In the book, you thought he was standing to receive his execution.

420
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:22,920
Yeah.

421
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,560
My uncle always said that he felt that Sadat actually thought it was part of the parade.

422
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:36,600
Well, who knows what thoughts were going through his mind, but it was chaotic.

423
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,840
These guys jumped off the truck and it began firing and throwing grenades.

424
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,960
Most of which didn't go off, which was sort of a miracle. A lot more people would have died.

425
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,560
A lot of people would have been killed.

426
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:57,800
I don't know why everybody on that reviewing platform wasn't dead, but they came for Sadat.

427
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,280
When I looked at the news footage and the stills of that, it looked to me...

428
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,480
The stills are harrowing.

429
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,800
Yeah.

430
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,120
Yeah. He's standing in attention as he's being shot.

431
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,240
It looked to me like he was going to go out unintimidated.

432
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,680
And maybe you might be right.

433
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,320
That would have been part of his character. And of course, he was so vain. He had his new

434
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:29,240
Italian-made uniform and he didn't want to ruffle the lines of the uniform with a bulletproof vest.

435
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,200
With a bulletproof vest.

436
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,040
He was unprotected in that way.

437
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:42,520
You talk about how the men that were charged and even not charged, basically the men that were

438
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:50,760
imprisoned following that were tortured. And that out of that torture came a lot of the

439
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:59,400
humiliation that ultimately fed what would become the terrorism we all learned about 20 years ago,

440
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:05,640
for the first time, many of us. What happened to those men? And what did your research uncover

441
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,000
about what that period was like following the assassination of Sadat? It wasn't long after.

442
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,120
I mean, Mubarak would have been immediately instated as president.

443
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:27,160
I think we don't understand clearly the role of humiliation in human affairs,

444
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:35,400
but it's very powerful. And going back to the 67 war, the humiliation, I think, gave birth to this

445
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:46,760
rise in radicalism in Egypt and elsewhere. And torture is deliberate humiliation. And we don't

446
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:54,200
really know what happened to Zawahiri, although he was probably electrocuted and stripped naked and

447
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:07,080
humiliated in every possible way that you can imagine. And you can emerge from that totally

448
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:20,200
broken, or you can emerge full of rage and willing to do anything to exact revenge. And I think that

449
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,960
prison population was divided along those lines. There weren't people that weren't affected by it.

450
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,800
There were people that were either broken or turned into something else. And that something

451
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:42,200
else became the seeds of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda really began as Zawahiri's organization. It was al-Jahad.

452
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:50,680
And when they got out, they were on a rampage. And they were killing people as fast as they

453
00:55:50,680 --> 00:56:00,360
could. And they tried to kill the prime minister. They did kill some people. They accidentally

454
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:08,120
killed this little schoolgirl named Shaima. This is a characteristic

455
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:17,160
jihad action. So carelessly did they plan this assassination of the prime minister. They just

456
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:25,640
put the bomb outside a girl's school. And the only person killed was a schoolgirl. It could have been

457
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:34,840
dozens of them. But the city, Cairo, was infuriated. And there were marches in the street,

458
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:45,640
and protests. And Zawahiri actually complained because he felt offended that they were subject

459
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:58,840
to so much abuse. And yet it was pretty clear that Shaima was a step too far for jihad. And

460
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:07,480
actually, one of the killers lives now in London. He got political asylum because of the fact that

461
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:15,080
Egypt had a death penalty. And the British would take in anybody who was under a death penalty. So

462
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,200
Shaima's killer is living in London. Still? Last I talked to him, he was still there.

463
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,360
Something else that you point out in the book that I thought was so fascinating,

464
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,240
because it's so obvious once you stated it, but I'd never really understood it, which was,

465
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:41,480
why couldn't the real resistance take place in Egypt? But you point out that

466
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,320
the topography is not amenable to it. You can't really live away from the Nile.

467
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,920
The moment you get too far off the Nile, you're in the middle of the desert. It's not amenable

468
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:01,320
to guerrilla warfare. And the military had too strong a hold over the Nile from upper Egypt,

469
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,640
all the way to the Delta and into the Mediterranean Sea. So basically, if they were going to create

470
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,200
an army, they needed to do it outside of Egypt. And it seems that Zawahiri realized that

471
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,800
in the mid 80s, if they're not the early 80s, correct? And is that about the time that he left?

472
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:30,360
Yeah. He went to Afghanistan first as a medical doctor, answering a call that many heeded. And

473
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:40,440
then he came back and he affected some Afghan outfits and so on. But I think he was very

474
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:49,400
stirred by that. When the Soviets invaded, it was an electric alarm in the Muslim world,

475
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,800
an Islamic country was being occupied by a secular government.

476
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,600
And... What was Russia's intention? I guess the Soviet Union's intention.

477
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:08,440
It's a really good question because you could say that they were trying to beat a path to

478
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:20,760
the Mediterranean. But it's a long way. It doesn't go directly there. So they might have

479
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,280
done better going through Pakistan. And Pakistan was nominally allied with the United States,

480
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:34,840
so that might've been problematic. But the Soviet Union was an expansionist power.

481
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:44,520
It was crazy. If you remember that period, there was a lot of turnover in the leadership.

482
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:54,520
I think that there was confusion about who's in charge. It didn't make any sense at all.

483
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:01,400
And the Carter administration, Brzezinski was a national security advisor. And

484
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:09,000
he saw that as a huge opportunity to give the Soviets their own Vietnam. And essentially,

485
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that's what we did. We supplied the Mujahideen with weapons and then finally with stingers,

486
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,760
which brought down the helicopters. And the Soviets didn't want to go

487
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:28,280
mano a mano on the ground. And so once they lost that air cover, they were essentially defeated.

488
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:37,240
Which now brings us to the other half of the Al-Qaeda duo, Osama bin Laden. I think it's

489
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,360
well known by many people who have paid attention to the stories of Al-Qaeda that he came from

490
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,120
unbelievable wealth, unbelievable privilege. But maybe for folks who aren't quite familiar with

491
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:56,200
his lineage, who was Mohammed bin Laden and why did he have such an empire? What were the

492
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:03,800
circumstances of Osama bin Laden's upbringing? Mohammed bin Laden came from Yemen. And there

493
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:12,680
are stories about how he got there. But essentially, I think the most credible is he kind of hitched a

494
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:20,520
ride on a boat that took him up to Jeddah. And he was a laborer. He was blind in one eye. He was

495
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:31,080
illiterate. And he put himself to work as a handyman and then did some work for the Americans at that

496
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:41,320
time working on a Ramco building up the Saudi oil reserves. And there were American companies in

497
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:48,760
Saudi Arabia who were essentially beginning to build the kingdom itself, the roads, the hotels,

498
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,800
and so on. So it was a good time to be in that business. And Mohammed bin Laden, the king didn't

499
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:02,760
really trust the Americans. Who was king then? Was it Faisal? No, this was before Faisal.

500
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:09,560
Did it was Abdul Aziz? Well, I think it was Abdul Aziz when Mohammed bin Laden first got there.

501
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:18,280
It was the first king of that lineage. And he built a... I don't know if he built the whole

502
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:25,800
palace, but the king was infirm. And if you remember, in the meeting between

503
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:35,240
Roosevelt, President Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz in the Suez Canal, Roosevelt gave him a

504
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:45,720
wheelchair. And so the king liked having the wheelchair, but he lived upstairs. So he got

505
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,920
Mohammed bin Laden to build him a ramp so the car could drive him upstairs. And so that was

506
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:00,200
a display of the genius that Mohammed bin Laden had. And then there was a goal that

507
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:12,200
had been from the very beginning of the kingdom to try to unify the two sides of Saudi Arabia.

508
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:20,760
The western portion was divided by a mountain range. And on the other side of it

509
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,600
was the Holy Lands, Mecca and Medina and Jeddah, one of the major cities.

510
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:39,080
But it was cut off by the Sarawat mountain range. And when Faisal became king, he was trying to get

511
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:46,040
a contractor who would build a road that would unify the kingdom. And the main contractors

512
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:53,640
looked at this steep cliff face and just, it was daunting. How would you do that? And so

513
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:03,880
Mohammed bin Laden, this one-eyed illiterate Yemeni laborer, gave a bid to the king. It didn't turn

514
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:13,240
out to be accurate. And the king accepted. And so the legend is that he pushed a goat over the edge

515
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:21,320
of the cliff and followed him down this cliff face, marking the path. And that's the path that

516
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:31,960
this road, I drove down it, I drove up and down it, but it's very windy. And oddly enough,

517
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:38,360
beset with chimpanzees. So there are a lot of animals along the way, you have to be careful.

518
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:45,400
But it's a two lane road that goes down, but that was one of the most important roads in history,

519
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:51,720
because it unified the kingdom and it made Mohammed bin Laden the most famous non-royal

520
01:04:51,720 --> 01:05:00,840
figure in the kingdom, a real hero. And he took advantage of his celebrity, he had a lot of wives.

521
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,320
How about 45 children?

522
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:11,400
Well, 52, I think. I think bin Laden had 52 brothers and sisters, so maybe 53 total. And

523
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,520
some of the wives he would marry on Friday and divorce on Sunday. So there was that kind of

524
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:27,240
arrangement. But typically in Saudi Arabia, under Islamic rules, you're awarded four wives.

525
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:34,360
And the fourth wife is always a little bit of a threat to be discarded. And it was the fourth

526
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:47,480
wife that was the mother of Osama. And she was Syrian. And she was an Alawite, which is the

527
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:55,480
sect that Assad, the ruler of Syria, is a part of some minority sect that is thought to be heretical

528
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:07,240
inside Sunni Islam. So that was by itself a mark against Osama. And his father divorced her.

529
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:17,400
But he arranged marriage for her and one of his trusted employees, who actually Osama became close

530
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:25,160
to. And they lived in a little house in Jeddah, off a street that's called Makaroni Street,

531
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:33,560
because there's a pasta factory nearby. And that's where he grew up. He was always pious. It wasn't a

532
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:41,720
conversion. He would play soccer and he would wear long pants. But he must have had some influence

533
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,440
on these other kids, because eventually they adopted his long pants strategy. And

534
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,800
even when he was fasting, which he'd fasted two days a week, emulating what he thought the prophet

535
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:02,360
did. And we're talking about bin Laden as a teenager. Absolutely. He would make sandwiches

536
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:10,520
for his soccer mates, even though he wasn't eating them. And then they serve cakes and then play

537
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,360
Islamic games, guess the names of the prophet's companions and that sort of thing.

538
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:28,920
Even though music is frowned upon, instrumental music is frowned upon in Saudi Arabia.

539
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:37,480
He led this acapella singing and I tried to get, he taped some of them and I tried to find some

540
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:43,320
tapes of bin Laden singing, but I never could lay my hands on anything like that.

541
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,680
Did you have an insight as to why he was so pious?

542
01:07:48,120 --> 01:08:01,960
Well, I think that if you want to stand out in a very religious society like Saudi Arabia,

543
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,320
you can become less religious or more. And in his environment,

544
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:19,320
he was not going to become less religious. So I think he always had the idea that there was an

545
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:28,600
achievement by becoming more of an authority. I mean, you have to bear in mind, his father was

546
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,920
an exceptional figure. He died in an air crash and bin Laden was young when that happened. But

547
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:44,040
very few people in Saudi Arabia in all of history have achieved the kind of status that Muhammad

548
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:51,320
bin Laden did, someone who is not in the royal family. I mean, that was exceptional. And I think

549
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:59,800
that Osama being the son of the fourth wife and then cast out of the inner circle

550
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:08,280
when the father divorced his mother, he always wanted to distinguish himself. And there was a

551
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,440
hoard of other children around to compete against. And Osama was adventurous.

552
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:27,560
Some of the other sons were adventurous, but I think one of them died nearby here in Central

553
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,400
Texas. He crashed an ultralight plane in a power line. So it wasn't just Osama that was

554
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:45,320
an adventurous type. But early on, he was racing horses. He was

555
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:55,880
he drove very fast, not professionally, but he liked to drive and he was careless. He had wrecks

556
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:04,840
a lot. But he had his kind of impunity around him. And he liked to go out and camp in the desert by

557
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:15,640
himself. He was forging an independent identity, even as a very young man. He was drawn more deeply

558
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:23,240
into Islam in his school. Apparently, there was a I think it was a gym teacher who was in the Muslim

559
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:32,280
brothers. And he impressed Osama. And so that probably drew him more into Islamic politics.

560
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:41,400
And he met other people that would be important to him inside what was a secret cell of his Muslim

561
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:47,880
brothers in Saudi Arabia. Do we know if he was influenced by Saeed Qutb's writings? Oh, yeah.

562
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:58,680
There's no one who wasn't. You have to start with that. But Saeed Qutb was a big figure. And when

563
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:07,000
he was in the university, there were lots of discussions about Qutb. And there was another

564
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:15,400
head of the Muslim brothers in Egypt who had a bit of a contrary view. And sometimes Osama would take

565
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:22,600
one perspective and sometimes the other, but they were essentially arguing over Qutb. And so he was

566
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:29,080
a huge figure. He might have met, no, I guess not. Because I would have asked Qutb's brother,

567
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:40,120
Muhammad, if he had ever met Osama, but I don't think so. So when did Osama first go to Afghanistan?

568
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,960
Well, he... Early 80s, mid 80s? Yeah. Well, the invasion...

569
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:55,080
invasion 79. So Osama went to Afghanistan. He said he went as soon as he could. There's no

570
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,480
evidence he went there in the first year or two, but he might have been, but there's just no evidence

571
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:10,920
of it. And he was inspired. He didn't stay long. He came back, but he became a conduit for money.

572
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:20,520
He was a bundler. And Abdullah Azam was the sort of godfather of the Arab participation in the war

573
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:32,600
against the Soviets. And bin Laden hooked up with him. And Azam just saw this tall, enigmatic

574
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:39,800
Saudi with a lot of money and a lot of prestige and just saw him as a cash machine, which he was.

575
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:47,080
I mean, he played a huge role in raising money for the war against the Soviets.

576
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:53,960
And that was his main task for the most part until he actually moved to Afghanistan and

577
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:06,680
decided to form an Arab wing of the war. And it was totally feckless. I mean,

578
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:12,680
it was worse than feckless. It got in the way. Arab, Afghan warlords complained about it.

579
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,760
They didn't know what they were doing. Essentially, they were just putting young men without any

580
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:24,440
training at great risk and affecting no real change in the war. But from the perspective of

581
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:33,160
Saudi Arabia, here was a Saudi, not a prince, but Prince Ling in the sense that he was the son of

582
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:41,160
the famed Mohammed bin Laden. And the idea that Saudis would actually go out and fight

583
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:53,800
was really titillating. They weren't allowed to fight. There was a nominal army, but essentially

584
01:13:53,800 --> 01:14:00,600
there was no military tradition. What was the scale of this? So how many Mujahideen fighters

585
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:09,480
were there? Well, I don't remember the exact number. There were fewer than a hundred, I would

586
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:19,800
say. But you also have to bear in mind that young Saudi men would sometimes fly up from Saudi

587
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:26,440
Arabia for a few days. They would be given a gun. They would go out and they'd be not facing the

588
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:31,240
enemy probably, but they'd go out and shoot up a tree or something. And then they would go home

589
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,160
and say that they'd been fighting in Afghanistan. So it's sort of hard to-

590
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,560
And the US had no forces there, but the CIA was providing weapons to the Mujahideen, correct?

591
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:53,720
Right. And they were also supplying money. Unfortunately, we landed on this guy named

592
01:14:53,720 --> 01:15:03,880
Hamet Ghul, who was a general in touch with the Afghan warlords. And he would parcel out the money

593
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:13,800
among the seven warlords, the CIA to call them the seven dwarfs, but he picked the most radical

594
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:20,760
of them. So the money that came from American taxpayers went to empower people that would later

595
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:27,640
become allies of the Taliban. Now the Taliban didn't exist yet, correct? The Taliban were kids

596
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:41,080
in school. The Taliban, the word means students in Arabic and I guess in Urdu. And especially for a

597
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:51,560
young Afghan boys, and Pakistanis as well, parents didn't have any money. They would be sent off to

598
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:59,080
these madrasas, many of them on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. And especially after the

599
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:05,320
Soviet invasion, there were a lot of orphans and there were a lot of families that were unable to

600
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:12,680
provide for their kids. So they send the boys to these madrasas where their main task was to

601
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:23,320
memorize a Quran in a language Arabic that they didn't speak. And oftentimes these boys would be

602
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:31,720
abused, especially, you know, warlords and so on would take advantage of them. And really the

603
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:44,920
Taliban came to power when there was a battle, a personal duel between these two Afghan commanders

604
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:54,280
over a boy. And that was when Mullah Omar, who had come to be the leader, who was a minor cleric,

605
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:04,840
got on his motorcycle and began to organize. And that's where the Taliban arose. It's an odd culture

606
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:15,400
because there's some pictures of these boys, you know, it's beginning as they begin to form into

607
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:24,520
a military force, but they put on cosmetics. They look very feminine, you know, with eyeshadow and

608
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:31,880
lipstick and so on. And so there was a... It's hard to characterize it because I can't say that I

609
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:40,360
understand it, but you know, there was, I think in terms of absenting women so much from society

610
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:50,680
that these boys were sexualized. And once again, I think humiliation played a role and hard to

611
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:57,640
quantify, but I think impossible to ignore. And then the Northern Alliance at this point,

612
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:09,320
as part of the Afghan government? Oh, I don't really know. I mean, the government went through

613
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:16,920
several iterations and coalitions, but the Northern Alliance would have been opposed to...

614
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:25,160
The Northern Alliance was a Pashto organization, so they would have been inside the tent of government.

615
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:35,800
So when did Zawahiri and Bin Laden meet? Nobody knows. You know, I wish I tried really hard to

616
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,360
find that out. And I asked many of Zawahiri's colleagues.

617
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,720
Most people think that they met somewhere along the line in Jeddah where Bin Laden lived, and he

618
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:59,320
was raising money for the Majjah Dine. And Zawahiri went there ostensibly to practice medicine at this

619
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:09,960
Muslim Brothers' coalition of doctors and so on. So it's totally plausible. It could have been

620
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:21,560
shortly after that in Peshawar in Pakistan, where Bin Laden set up shop. So it's one of my great

621
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:28,040
frustrations that I was never able to chronicle the moment when these two guys ran into each other

622
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:37,560
and what they thought about each other. So as the Soviets ultimately withdraw, which is what,

623
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:44,120
89-ish? Yeah. On some level, I think, though probably not justified, Bin Laden feels like a

624
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:51,560
bit of a hero. Oh, yeah. He glorified himself. Although by all accounts, he really hadn't done

625
01:19:51,640 --> 01:20:00,520
much. He mucked it up, really, is what he did and got a lot of kids killed and just young men.

626
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:12,600
But in terms of victories, no, he had none. But what he did accomplish was to create a legend

627
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:20,680
around himself and around the era of Majjah Dine. And it's fascinating to me as a person that's

628
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:30,200
always been intrigued by religious beliefs, how these legends spread and how they fortified his

629
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:38,120
image. There was the idea that if you fell in battle, your body wouldn't putrefy. And

630
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:50,440
the green birds would come circle your corpse. And I remember I asked Jamal Khalifa, who had been

631
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:58,760
Bin Laden's best friend for much of his life and his brother-in-law and had been in Afghanistan

632
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:08,760
with Bin Laden. Really? Do you really believe? Oh, absolutely. I saw it with my own eyes.

633
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:22,280
It can't be true, but it's hard to deny someone who speaks with such conviction. And so that was

634
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:27,960
the kind of thing that young people, not just in Saudi Arabia, but throughout the Muslim world,

635
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:36,120
would be hearing the stories of these fighters and their mighty men. And they live in caves and

636
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:43,640
they fight these technological powers and they win. And they are our Muslim brothers and we

637
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:50,600
should be doing the same thing. And not only we have to contribute however we can. So in the mosque

638
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:57,240
and even in shopping centers, there would be cans for contributing to the effort. And so people did.

639
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:10,280
It was a very popular effort and Bin Laden was very central in his name and his identity became

640
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:19,560
central to that cause. I call him Saudi's first celebrity because there wasn't a category for

641
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:27,960
Bin Laden. He wasn't royal. In Saudi Arabia, there is a true of other Muslim countries to

642
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:34,280
some extent, but there's a prohibition on human forms. You're not supposed to have pictures of

643
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:43,640
people or animals for that matter. But there are pictures of the king and princes all over the place.

644
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:52,200
And I remember when I was there, there was a legal battle going on over the Starbucks image.

645
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,520
Because it's like a human form.

646
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:04,440
Yes. But finally in the courts they decided she's a mermaid. And so she's neither animal nor human.

647
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:10,200
She's a mythological creature. So Starbucks was allowed to keep their logo. But that's how

648
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:18,280
seriously it's taken. But here's Bin Laden. He's not nobody. He's Mohammed Bin Laden's son,

649
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:30,280
but that's not an unusual category. He has 20 something brothers, but there's nobody like him.

650
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,360
He can go to the mosque and make a speech and people would pour out to hear him.

651
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:45,720
He wasn't charismatic in the traditional sense, but he had a kind of an ethereal air about him.

652
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:55,640
He was an enigmatic, intriguing, very handsome, very tall, just had a kind of elegance about him.

653
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:03,640
And that turned out to be a real pain in the ass for the royal family because they weren't used to

654
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:11,240
having a rival power. Someone who had a voice of authority and Bin Laden even at a very young age

655
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:21,800
was that person. Now, I guess it would have been the summer of 1990 when Saddam Hussein

656
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:29,800
invades Kuwait. Right. And although I guess we wouldn't know it at the time, you could argue that

657
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:37,000
was certainly one of the greatest factors that would ultimately lead to 9 11 though it wasn't,

658
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:42,680
you can only know that in retrospect. Right. And it's peripheral in that, I mean,

659
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:50,600
we wouldn't understand it from our point of view because America and other allies rushed in to save

660
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:57,800
Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden was trying to keep that from happening. And so he went to the minister

661
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:05,560
of defense and said, I'll take care of this. I'll bring my al Qaeda guys, which were

662
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:16,440
several dozen maybe. And together with my father's earth moving equipment, we will

663
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:24,760
enlist the people and we will repel the million man Iraqi army. And the minister of defense just

664
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:30,920
didn't laugh him out of the office. It wouldn't be polite, but he was not taken seriously.

665
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:38,120
The first time I heard this story, by the way, was I had the privilege of meeting Prince Turkey,

666
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:48,440
spending a week with him actually. Really? And he told this story, which was how Bin Laden

667
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:56,600
was adamant that he based on his victory in Afghanistan, which again, means he believed his

668
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,200
own hype. I think so. Right. Like he, he actually thought that he moved the needle in Afghanistan.

669
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,800
Well, he defeated the Soviet. So what would the Iraqis be by comparison? That was what was going

670
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:17,080
on in his mind. Right. And the disconnect from reality, but how humiliated he was when

671
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:25,560
not only was he not the one that was going to defend his country, but these filthy Americans

672
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:33,160
were going to come in and do this, which included women, Jews, Christians, you know,

673
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,600
and they were going to spend quite a bit of time there. Right. This was, even though it didn't

674
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:43,320
take long to get Saddam Hussein to retreat, you still had to maintain no fly zones. You still had

675
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:49,240
to maintain a military presence there. I'll stop you a bit on that because

676
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:56,600
we didn't need to stay in Saudi Arabia. There were other bases in, you know, Qatar and UAE,

677
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:03,960
you know, we could have gotten away, but the Saudis had very nice bases. And, but it was

678
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:10,280
the lingering, I mean, we promised we were going to leave when the war was over.

679
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:16,360
Yeah. So that's a good point. It was promised that the US would leave. Why did they not?

680
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:23,160
They were comfortable. You know, and I think probably the royal family felt happier having

681
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:29,800
an American presence there because the Saudis have always been insecure about their, you know,

682
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:35,880
they're sitting on this golden egg and, you know, everybody around the world wants a piece of it. So

683
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,280
the Saudis, suddenly they've got the American military there. And that's not the worst thing

684
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:47,320
in the world in their opinion, but for Bin Laden and for other people, you know, there's a, you

685
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:55,000
know, there's a saying attributed to the prophet, which was there shall be no two religions in

686
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,480
Saudi Arabia. Well, you know, there are more than two religions and there were at the time of the

687
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:11,160
prophet, but Bin Laden took this to mean only Sunnis of his particular stripe should live in

688
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:18,600
the kingdom and everybody else has to be expelled. And it was such a huge thing to have half a

689
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:27,800
million Americans and other nationalities, most of them not Muslim, living in their country,

690
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:34,360
protecting how humiliating once again, you know, is it that you have to turn to these other powers?

691
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:40,760
We're not strong enough to do it ourselves. That, you know, for Bin Laden, that was, you know,

692
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,440
big motivating force. That's when he really sort of turned his attention to America.

693
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:55,000
And this is where as he and Zawahiri are getting closer, there's a bit of a difference between

694
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:01,560
them, right? Which is at this point, Zawahiri is still really focused on overthrowing Egypt,

695
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:10,040
overthrowing what he views as these horribly immoral, corrupt Arab leaders. But Bin Laden

696
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:15,640
is thinking far beyond that already. Yeah. It wasn't just Zawahiri. I mean,

697
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:21,880
there were a lot of nationalist groups in the Arab world focused on changing their countries.

698
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:29,320
And what Bin Laden did was to create a coalition and then redirect them to become an international

699
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:37,880
terrorist group rather than just be stuck in their nationalist orbits. And Zawahiri was one of those

700
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:44,120
people. You know, given his druthers, he would have just spent time trying to overthrow the

701
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:51,000
Egyptian tyrants. And as you characterize, you know, the corrupt, ruthless leader, that was true.

702
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,320
He was right about the nature of the rule, but he was wrong about the solution.

703
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,440
It's funny, I always talk to my parents about this stuff, you know, when Mubarak was like entering

704
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:12,600
his 573rd term as president, right? And I always said, you know, why, and I would ask naively as

705
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,960
sort of a youngster, I was like, why can't Egypt have an actual democracy? Like, why do these

706
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:23,960
elections have to be rigged? And my parents for right or wrong, and you have to remember,

707
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:29,640
my parents have a very different view of Egypt, right? So my mom views Egypt fondly, right? Left

708
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:37,880
reluctantly, loved Nasser. My father on the other hand couldn't wait to get out, despised Egypt,

709
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,760
never looked back, hates everything about it, and is the classic immigrant who wants to come to the

710
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:52,040
West and, you know, just hates the corruption, hates the socialism of Nasser, right? Nasser wanted

711
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:58,840
to take every, wanted to socialize the country. But they both agreed full stop that a country like

712
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:04,520
Egypt had to be ruled by a strong man. Like their view, again, I don't know if this is true, but

713
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:10,680
their view was you could never take democratic principles and just lop them into an Egyptian

714
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:19,080
society. Like it needs an iron fist to rule it, and Mubarak was the least bad option. That was

715
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:26,760
basically the way they thought of him. What's your view of an autocratic leader of that era? I mean,

716
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,520
do you think that my parents in their assessment were correct of Egypt?

717
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:38,120
You know, I was wrong about Egypt. I thought it was ready for democracy. And

718
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:48,280
they had a parliament back during the era of the king, you know, so there was, even though

719
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,120
it was somewhat forgotten, but there had been, you know, deliberation laws were passed, you know,

720
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:02,200
it had the appearance of being a constitutional monarchy because the king was so indolent

721
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:13,240
that he couldn't stir himself to do anything. But my analysis was this is a sophisticated country.

722
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:24,280
People have, it's a country that is never going to dissolve. Like, you know, Iraq may fall apart.

723
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:30,200
That's not going to happen to Egypt. It thinks of itself as eternal. And so it's always going to be

724
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:35,960
one thing. It's always going to be the most significant Arab country and they know it. So I

725
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,360
thought, well, yeah, this is, I was all for the- You were very optimistic in 2011. I was.

726
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:46,120
I wrote a lot of, I read a lot of what you wrote. And I had been affected. I went back to Egypt to

727
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:52,120
make a speech or a couple of speeches. I spoke at the American university in Cairo, where I used to

728
01:32:52,120 --> 01:33:02,920
teach. And I spoke at the Cairo university where Barack Obama went to make his famous outreach

729
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:13,320
speech to the Muslim world. And I remember, this was back during the election. This was before the

730
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:20,600
Arab Spring started. But, and during the primary season when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and,

731
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:30,280
you know, were running for office. And I was asking the kids, if you were an American,

732
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:36,040
who would you vote for? How many here for Hillary Clinton? All the girls in his job raised their

733
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:41,960
hand. And how many for Barack Obama? A lot of other people. How many for John McCain, one guy

734
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:49,480
from the embassy? And so, but they were totally into the idea of democracy. They were excited

735
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:57,160
by what they were seeing and that there could be revolutionary non-violent change was on their

736
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:06,920
mind. And one young woman said in this very plaintive voice, what happened to us? I mean,

737
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:14,760
every Egyptian lives with the weight of history on the shoulders. You look at the pyramids and,

738
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:20,600
you know, Egypt was the center of civilization. Absolutely. And it really was, you know, I mean,

739
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:33,800
China, you know, but it was so powerful and so much art and, you know, just, and then a long slide

740
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:42,280
into, you know, being just a tourist kingdom. So what happened to us? And also such an important

741
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:49,560
pillar of science too. I remember as a student, as a youngster, I hated school, despised school,

742
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:55,960
didn't do well in school or anything like that. And ultimately I turned that around, but a lot of

743
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:00,520
it had to do with something my mom would say to me repeatedly growing up, which is she would say,

744
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:04,760
because we're Coptic, right? So she would say, you know, we're defendants, we're descendants of

745
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:12,200
the pharaohs. Like, you know, you are a pharaoh. Science and engineering is in your blood. Your

746
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:17,080
ancestors built pyramids, you know, and she would just say these things, which when you're a kid,

747
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,920
you kind of start to believe it after a while. It's like, well, you know, maybe mom's right.

748
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:31,320
Maybe I am smarter than I think I am. But it's also a society that does have a very scientifically

749
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:39,000
literate population. Like you would think this shouldn't be hard to do. Well, when I was thinking

750
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:47,080
about that question that she posed to me, that young woman, I thought when I was teaching in

751
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:55,560
Cairo, Egypt was a part of what we call the developing world. You know, these were countries

752
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:05,640
like India, South Korea, Singapore, you know, just so many of what these countries that became

753
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:15,080
the Asian Tigers, you know, they roared past Egypt. And I thought the answer I gave her was

754
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:23,080
her question made me think of my father and his generation. He had come out of the dust bowl in

755
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:32,360
Kansas, you know, broken farms, you know, just really poor. And he went on to become a banker

756
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:38,360
in Dallas, small bank, but he spent seven years in wartime in World War II and Korea. And he and

757
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:45,080
his generation built the most powerful country and economy in the history of the world. And I said,

758
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:52,440
it takes a generation. And there are generations like that right now in South Korea, in India,

759
01:36:52,440 --> 01:37:01,080
in places like China that are making their country great. But it can't be done by an individual. And

760
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:07,560
I think that's my argument against tyranny. It takes a generational commitment. And they have

761
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:13,640
to have influence. They have to know that they are a part of an enterprise and they can't be

762
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:23,480
suddenly ruled out. And that is the failure of tyranny, I think, is essentially those kinds of

763
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:29,960
people that would be transformative for a country or not given the chance to be the kind of leaders

764
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:36,440
that they could be. What role does religion play in this? And specifically, what role does Islam

765
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:43,880
play in this? Is there something about Islam in its current level of maturity, which maybe is akin

766
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:52,440
to Christianity a thousand years ago, that is standing in the way of the progress you speak of?

767
01:37:53,240 --> 01:38:01,320
Well, Islam has many manifestations. And so it's different in Indonesia, for instance,

768
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:10,120
the largest Muslim country, a far more successful country than Egypt or Saudi Arabia, Turkey also.

769
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:18,600
But there are manifestations of Islam that are really, really harmful. And

770
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:26,840
people are encouraged to adopt a kind of submissive attitude. And of course, Islam means

771
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:35,400
submission. So there's a literalism about it. And then if you don't believe in it,

772
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:41,720
you have tyrants who will beat you into submission. So there are two very powerful forces. You have

773
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:47,640
dictatorships that are ruthless, justifying themselves on the basis of religion.

774
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:55,640
And then you have actual religious texts that urge you to be compliant. And tyrants are

775
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:06,040
quite adept at using those kinds of instructions. I don't think it's true that you can't have a

776
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:12,200
modern country or a democracy in an Islamic country. I think Tunisia has been struggling to

777
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:21,560
do that. And they've had some turmoil recently. But you see that people in Tunisia want to have a

778
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:32,760
democracy. And they feel like they can be trusted with one. But it's a blight on the Islamic world.

779
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:41,080
And you have tyrants from Morocco all the way to southern China. And it's something that I hope

780
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:45,960
that that religion outgrows at some point. Yeah, I sometimes just wonder if it's really a

781
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:54,600
time scale problem. And we can't think about this in decades. Well, I certainly think that's true

782
01:39:54,600 --> 01:40:01,080
because I've already spent decades hoping for change and just not seeing it blossom.

783
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:12,120
Egypt is, when I was there, was far more secular, far more accommodating. When I was there,

784
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:22,680
the Soviets were essentially an occupying force. And the Egyptians really longed for a relationship

785
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:29,480
with the West. They liked Americans, even though we were essentially persona non grata.

786
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:37,480
They liked the fact that we horsed around with people. We would talk to the help. We were

787
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:48,520
Democrats in person as in spirit. We liked being around people, whereas the Russians in the

788
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:56,680
news agency across the street, they were incredibly insular. And I remember it was odd

789
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,480
because I used to play doubles with one of these Soviet guys. I called us the big powers.

790
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:09,000
But they would have these parties on Saturday night and you could hear them playing Teresa

791
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,240
Brewer records. Put another nickel in. And they would be sitting on couch with their drinks,

792
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:20,200
just sitting around glumly. And then around one in the morning, they would spill out into the

793
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:29,560
street all drunk and singing. It looked awful, but the Egyptians just hated them. And it was a great

794
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:34,760
time to be an American in Egypt. Whereas after 9-11, it was entirely different. The governments

795
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:42,760
were friendly, but the people were very upset with America. And it seemed odd to me because, I mean,

796
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:52,920
you attacked us. A strong motivation for me was to go back to Egypt and find out what happened.

797
01:41:52,920 --> 01:42:01,480
Because I remember it so fondly. I just had a great time living in Egypt and teaching these

798
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:09,000
young Egyptians and also Palestinians and Jordanians and some Africans. And what's the answer you have?

799
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:18,760
You talked a little bit about your mom and how she believed in conspiracies and things like that.

800
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:28,680
I asked this one Egyptian woman who was saying that the Americans did 9-11 to themselves.

801
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:37,640
I heard that a lot. I said, how can you believe something for which there's absolutely no evidence?

802
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:45,640
You say that, but there's nothing you can point to that shows that there's any evidence or

803
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:54,600
motivation. And she said, well, in Egypt, nobody's ever told us the truth. And so we have to try to

804
01:42:54,600 --> 01:43:02,040
imagine for ourselves what it is. So the question we always ask is, who benefits? And in this case,

805
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:07,800
we think America has been waiting for the opportunity to attack the Arab world. And so

806
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:13,720
you created this excuse for yourselves. Well, that was her thinking. And that's how conspiracies

807
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:20,680
nurture themselves on these kinds of rationalizations that float above the world of

808
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:25,400
truth and evidence. By the same logic, obviously, the CIA killed Kennedy because

809
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:30,520
had to figure out a way to get into Vietnam. So let's go back to our good friend,

810
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,560
it's the early 90s now. He's been humiliated by his own government who have said thanks,

811
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:46,120
but no thanks. We're going to have the Americans help us out here. He goes to Sudan of all places.

812
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,440
What happens in Sudan? Why doesn't he end up just settling down in Sudan and

813
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:00,760
living the rest of his years there? Oh, I wish he had. At 92 to 96,

814
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:08,520
Al-Qaeda became essentially an agricultural organization in Sudan. Ben Laden in Sudan

815
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:16,120
probably was the largest landowner. He owned a considerable amount of property. And he would

816
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,840
do jobs for the Sudanese government, build highways and stuff like that. And they would

817
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:38,040
pay him with land. Whenever I think about Sudan, I went there to try to understand that period in

818
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:50,200
his life. And I was trying to penetrate Sudanese intelligence. And so I was recruiting some names

819
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:56,200
of people that I'd been given. And I finally got made some relationships and they took me around

820
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:04,280
and showed me Ben Laden's house and so on. And this was a time when I had been traveling a lot

821
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:13,800
and I had injured my back. And it was very painful to take those long airplane flights.

822
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:18,440
And I took one of those big exercise balls where you had to blow up and you'd have to un-blow it

823
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:28,040
when you left the country. But in order to ease the pain. And so one day, one of my Sudanese

824
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:38,840
contacts knocked on my door at a hotel that called itself the Hilton. And Ahmed was the intelligence

825
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:47,560
agent. And he had this guy with him who was kind of plump. And he had one of those conical Indonesian

826
01:45:47,560 --> 01:46:00,280
hats that Muslims wear. And so come on in and Ahmed was very tired. And he sat on the edge of

827
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,840
my bed and his eyes were bobbing. And I said, Ahmed, just lie down. So he falls asleep and he

828
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:12,600
leaves me with this al-Qaeda guy. And I got my ball and I give him the office chair that's in the

829
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:21,880
room. And so, who are you? And he said, well, you can call me Loay. And that was frustrating. But

830
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:29,000
I started asking him about Ben Laden. He seemed to know everything. And he especially in Sudan,

831
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:39,160
he knew all about Ben Laden's enterprises. He started raising seeds. He had for a while

832
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:45,880
a bicycle importing company. Bikes are usually used in Sudan because the roads are all sand.

833
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:51,960
But he had all these different enterprises and this guy knew everything. But he also knew all

834
01:46:51,960 --> 01:47:03,400
about fighting the Arabs, Mujahideen in Afghanistan. And yet I was at sea. I didn't really know who he

835
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:10,360
was. And so I went back to the US and started triangulating and I found Mohammed Loay

836
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:19,560
by Azid whose al-Qaeda name was Abu Rida al-Suri. And he was the guy who took the

837
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:25,400
notes at the founding of al-Qaeda in May of 1988. It's his handwriting. I thought,

838
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:34,520
oh, God, I didn't have any idea who I had. And so I flew back to Sudan and he wouldn't see me.

839
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:42,440
And that was, you know, so then I began to court him, you know, and finally he agreed. And I flew

840
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:52,120
back and I said, Loay, why didn't you see me last time? It means a lot of trouble to come to

841
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:56,680
court to him. And he said, well, I didn't know how seriously to take you. The first time we met,

842
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:04,360
you were sitting on a balloon. That was my first al-Qaeda interview. It was a real triumph.

843
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:10,680
But those years in Sudan, at least according to Loay, you know, they were kind of wonderful

844
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:20,120
years for al-Qaeda because they weren't fighting anybody. Bin Laden still had money and he was

845
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:29,400
generous in handing it out. They would have celebratory dinners and they had soccer teams.

846
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:34,920
They played, you know, they had their own little league and, you know, people had dormitories and

847
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:41,560
stuff like that. People got money to get married. They were settling down. It was the US State

848
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:49,240
Department that decided this can't stand. And so they put pressure on Sudanese government to

849
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:55,480
expel Bin Laden and the Sudanese government did that. Based on what? He was a potential

850
01:48:55,480 --> 01:49:01,880
terrorist, a funder of terror anyway. What hard evidence did the State Department have at that

851
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:11,640
time? Really none. There were suspicions. About that time, the CIA had opened up an office on

852
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:17,400
Bin Laden or a file in any case. This was before the creation of Alec Station? That's where Alec

853
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:26,280
Station came from, which was really the first sort of off campus in the US station. But it was

854
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:34,840
off campus and ignored by the CIA. They called the people that worked there the people on the

855
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:40,200
island of lost toys. You know, there were people that were kind of pushed out of their own

856
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:46,680
departments and, you know, that was the team, the original team. That team was led by Shore.

857
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:56,280
Michael Shore. And what is it about him that brought him to lead Alec Station? What was his

858
01:49:56,280 --> 01:50:07,480
conviction? Well, Shore is a loose cannon to put it. Well, certainly today he's about as off the

859
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:14,040
rails as they come. He wants to shoot Democrats. Yeah. But at the time, what was his conviction

860
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:19,560
about Al Qaeda? Well, he was right about it. Yeah. You know, he was right that it was,

861
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:27,000
you know, it was a terrorist organization that could strike America and intended to.

862
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:34,920
He was right that they had reasons. And I mean, you think you have to give Michael Shore your

863
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:41,400
credit for seeing into the mind of Bin Laden and his followers and seeing how they looked at the

864
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:50,520
world. It's so foreign. I mean, when 9-11 happened, the idea that a man in a cave in

865
01:50:50,520 --> 01:51:00,200
Afghanistan would attack America was comical and Shore didn't think so. So he was, you know, he was

866
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:08,840
not a prophet, but he was an analyst that could look at the tea leaves and see what could actually

867
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:14,440
happen. And nobody took him seriously. That's another beautiful parallel in your book, right?

868
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:22,680
We've gone through kind of the history of the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jihad, Al Qaeda. We haven't

869
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:29,480
quite got to the point where Al Qaeda and Al Jihad become one entity, which will happen in the late

870
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:37,160
90s. But as we move to the intelligence side, which is the harder part, I think, to wrap one's

871
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:43,880
head around. You also have these two parallels between I-49 and Alex Station and these two

872
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:53,720
personalities between Michael Shoyer and John O'Neill, which are both right, but because of their

873
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:06,680
remarkable disdain for each other, tragically both let this thing slip. So maybe let's now

874
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:14,920
shift for a moment and talk a little bit about Alex Station and I-49, the CIA and the FBI,

875
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:21,960
which by around this point in time, the mid 90s, are starting to kind of pay attention to this

876
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:27,160
threat. Yeah. You know, when you're talking about it, I reflect on the fact that the siege

877
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:35,720
was built on this same premise. That, you know, my mission was to write a movie about a woman in

878
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:43,640
the CIA. That was the assignment. Annette Bening became the woman in the CIA. And then what was the

879
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:52,520
Soviet Union had fallen? What was the problem? You know, and I realized the CIA had a real life

880
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:59,240
enemy. It was the FBI. And so that's what the movie's about. So maybe I was already primed to

881
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:09,240
see it that way, but I'd heard about the antagonism. But as an American, I can't tell

882
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:17,480
you how disappointed I am in our intelligence agencies and their failure to protect our country.

883
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:24,040
That's their mission. But they got so caught up in their institutional and personal antagonisms

884
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:31,880
that they allowed 9-11 to happen. And John O'Neill lived a big life. You know, he was a

885
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:39,640
flamboyant. You would never think of an FBI agent. I mean, to me, FBI agents were kind of like

886
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:46,360
Mormons in terms of their dress and their sober demeanor and so on. At least the stereotypes.

887
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:52,760
John O'Neill wore these Gucci suits and he had these transparent black socks and

888
01:53:52,760 --> 01:54:00,200
kind of almost ballet slippers. And he had an office that he had personally decorated. Most

889
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:08,200
FBI offices or the furniture is all made in prisons. So all of that goes out. And in comes

890
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:19,240
this luxurious office. And he always has fresh flowers and he has on his coffee table this book,

891
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:27,720
Tulips, the flower that drives men wild. I mean, this is not your typical FBI agent. And he set

892
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:36,040
out when he was assigned to New York station to conquer the city. He wanted to meet everybody of

893
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:44,600
any importance. And he did. He gave his new secretary a Rolodex with all the names of the

894
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,000
people that he wanted to meet in the next six months. And he went down that list. So he had

895
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:57,400
tentacles in every part of the city. And he thought of himself as a sheriff. And he,

896
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:08,360
you know, when the embassy bombings happened, the FBI was given the task of trying to find out,

897
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:13,000
you know, if it was a crime against America. Yeah. We should probably take a moment to make sure

898
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:21,000
people understand the difference in the mission of the organizations, right? So the FBI is law

899
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:29,800
enforcement. Right. So think police, right? They're the top police force. The CIA is intelligence.

900
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:39,400
Right. And it's easy to see, I suppose, how they can have different priorities. Yeah. So let's use

901
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:44,280
this example that you're going to talk about, which is the bombing of the American embassy in

902
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:52,120
Kenya, which was 98. Yeah. Okay. Now 224 people were killed. Yeah. A number of them Americans.

903
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:58,360
And more than a hundred people were blinded by the flying glass. I mean, it was a horrible,

904
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:06,760
horrible tragedy. When Americans are killed on foreign soil, is that clearly in the purview of

905
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:12,600
the FBI? Yes. That is law enforcement. They have to get permission from the country.

906
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:20,360
Yeah. That they're going into. But in a country like Kenya, which is an ally. Right. This is a

907
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:26,680
relatively straightforward request that the United States FBI would be able to go in there,

908
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:32,920
conduct a criminal investigation. Right. And bring to justice people to stand trial in the

909
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:39,480
United States. Yeah. That is completely within the law. And so that's the way it's supposed to work.

910
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:46,760
The FBI being the world's premier policing organization, it's supposed to be on the case.

911
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:57,560
And so as it turned out, there were only six agents in the 50,000 member FBI who spoke Arabic.

912
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:06,920
And one of them was Ali Sufan, born in Lebanon. And it was during this period of time that

913
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:15,880
Sufan began reading Al-Qaeda literature and piecing together what was actually going on.

914
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:22,920
And he's the one who wrote a memo that got to, he got O'Neill's attention that,

915
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:32,680
you know, that this was probably the mover behind that. And O'Neill had an eye for talent.

916
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:38,600
And he reached out and just grabbed this young man and brought him in, put him on I-49 squad.

917
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,680
Somebody who would be his eyes and ears in the Arab world.

918
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,920
When did I-49 get formed? I don't know. I'm not sure exactly when it was.

919
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:56,120
And was it specifically anti-terror? Yeah. That was his goal. But I-49 squad was made up of a

920
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:01,880
lot of people. At the end of the Soviet Union caused a lot of disruption in our intelligence

921
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:08,360
agencies because they've been, you know, guys on the I-49 squad, some of them spoke

922
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:19,800
Russian, some spoke Eastern European languages, Polish and so on. And their mission was to

923
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,600
recruit people that were in the embassies in New York and so on to try to, you know,

924
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:30,840
and then suddenly all that fell apart. And so there was then the rubble of the absence of the

925
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:38,520
Soviet Union. I-49 squad was built up of enlisting a lot of people who had no experience in dealing

926
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:46,680
with the Arab world. There's a very interesting parallel between the transition in both human

927
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:54,680
capital and military capital. We're going to talk about the USS Cole, but you're very deliberate in

928
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:59,720
the way that you write about it, the way you write about the bombing, which is you describe

929
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:09,960
in excruciating detail the strength and might of that ship. And you're deliberately vague about

930
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:16,760
the skiff that blows it up to demonstrate, I think, the enormous asymmetry that took place.

931
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:24,840
The point being this USS Cole was an unbelievable warship for traditional warfare. Right.

932
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:33,960
And yet was defenseless against guerrilla warfare. Right. And that basically means there was kind of

933
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:40,200
this decade lag after the Cold War where the military industrial complex had not adopted

934
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:45,320
to what the new warfare was. But I think what you're saying, which is you got six people that

935
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:52,840
speak Arabic and the entire FBI and the CIA, you know, also has their, you know, tentacles back in

936
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:59,560
the Cold War. Well, that's basically the same thing, right? It's the human and intellectual

937
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:06,600
skill set that's for the wrong war. And it seemed like it just took a while to catch up. Unfortunately,

938
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:11,400
it didn't catch up. Right. I mean, I think that's part of the story. It never did. And the the Cole

939
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:21,880
bombing was a very telling moment. You know, October 20th, I think. Two weeks before the election.

940
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:29,960
Yeah. And this is not really bemarked upon in the campaigns, but 19 sailors died.

941
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:38,920
And the ship, you know, it was a stealth vessel, you know, but there was no hiding it. It was in

942
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:45,720
the middle of Aiden Harbor in Yemen, which had no business being. I mean, Yemen is far from an ally.

943
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:51,960
And, you know, the whole area was riddled with, you know, jihadis and, you know, people that were

944
02:00:51,960 --> 02:01:01,080
intent on doing harm to the U.S. And there was this very appealing target. And there was a failed

945
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:11,000
attempt to bomb it. The little skiff was overloaded with the with explosives and sank. But then then

946
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:19,880
they pulled it off. And in some ways, it prefigured 9-11. You know, that kind of imbalance of forces

947
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,760
that you were talking about, you know, the, you know, the coming out of the blue, who would who

948
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:31,800
would ever have expected it, you know, that was common. It's always been common. And, you know,

949
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:36,360
ports that, you know, little boats would come out and try to sell trinkets and stuff like that,

950
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:44,360
or deliver food. And so the sailors were used to seeing boats coming toward them. But they had no

951
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:51,160
idea, you know, they were waving at the people that were about to kill them. What was involved

952
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:57,720
operationally for Al Qaeda to pull off the embassy bombing in Kenya and then the USS Cole? Because

953
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:04,600
obviously they were they were prologue to 9-11. They were practice runs. They were never the end

954
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:14,280
goal. Well, I mean, I guess you could argue Bin Laden. Bin Laden's objective was to draw the US into.

955
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:18,200
Yeah, I think he thought after the embassy bombings that he that would do the trick. And,

956
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:23,400
you know, it was infuriating to him that we ignored it. So and then the coal bombing,

957
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:28,760
same thing. It had to be something more spectacular to get America interested in him.

958
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:34,760
And the embassy bombing took place after Al Jihad and Al Qaeda had merged.

959
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:41,560
Yeah. You know, they and some of the operatives, some of the main operatives in the embassy bombings

960
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:51,720
were the watery's men. So the it was, you know, both of these were, you know, catastrophic events

961
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:56,680
that for whatever reason, America was not prepared to pay any attention to.

962
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:03,800
Why do you think that is with all the benefits of 21 years of hindsight? Why is it that

963
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:13,480
neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore during their entire campaigns, including, right, you know,

964
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:20,840
including a campaign that included the explosion on the USS Cole? No. Why was this? Why was this

965
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:25,880
not a priority? If it had happened here would have been a different story, but it happened elsewhere.

966
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:30,120
And I think that's what, you know, that's one of the reasons Americans were so vulnerable,

967
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:36,040
is our own hubris and in the sense of isolation that we have historically always felt.

968
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:39,480
But why wasn't it enough that it had happened abroad? They were still U.S. lives.

969
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:45,560
Yes, they were. And they should have been counted more dearly, but they weren't. And I, you know,

970
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:51,400
it's similar with our wars, don't you think? You know, I mean, we have wars, people die.

971
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:57,480
Sometimes there is a tribute to them in the paper and you see their pictures, but not often.

972
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:03,320
And so it's the cost of doing business. You know, we are not as...

973
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:14,280
There's a gap between our role in the world and the people we think we are. And I think this was

974
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:22,760
especially true before 9-11. The reason Bin Laden attacked us is, you know, he felt surrounded.

975
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:31,160
He felt America was encircling the Islamic world and they were under threat. And why would we do

976
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:38,840
that? Well, obviously our goal would be to destroy Islam. And then there was at the same time, this

977
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:47,960
mandate he had in his mind that Islam has to rise again once it was the superpower. It went all the

978
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:59,400
way into middle Europe and to southern China. It was an expansionist power and that it should

979
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:05,480
resume that role. So there was the sense of being threatened by the superpower and the feeling that

980
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:13,720
Islam should replace it. And that was, I think, the dynamic that was driving him. And nobody in...

981
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:21,800
I can't say nobody in America, but very few people in America would have imagined that such

982
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:30,600
preposterous dreams would motivate somebody like Bin Laden and actually be able to put into effect

983
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:39,800
an attack on this nation that was seemingly invulnerable, that was so distant, how could you

984
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:47,400
even reach it? And how could you touch it in a way that would make it suffer? Yes, Bin Laden wanted

985
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:55,720
America to suffer. And he also wanted to humiliate America because I think he understood the power

986
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:04,920
of humiliation. Now, going back to O'Neill and Scheuer, they agreed on one thing, which was

987
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:13,240
Osama Bin Laden was a really bad actor and needed to be taken seriously. In fact, you could argue

988
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:19,400
that no two people believed it more than these two. I think that's fair. One who headed the CIA's

989
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:26,120
Alak station, which was in charge of anti-terrorism, and the other I-49, which was the FBI's response

990
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:32,840
to that. But beyond that, they didn't see anything eye to eye. Fundamentally, O'Neill believed that

991
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:37,800
Bin Laden and other operatives of Al Qaeda should be brought to justice in the court of law in the

992
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:46,520
United States. Scheuer and colleagues believed these people should be assassinated. An attempt

993
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:53,960
was made to assassinate Bin Laden in 1998 after the bombing in Kenya. It was a bit of a debacle.

994
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:59,480
It didn't amount to anything. Why is that? Was it failed intelligence? Well,

995
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:06,360
one thing, here's the thinking that was going on inside at that time, Clinton White House.

996
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:12,760
They hit us twice. Well, we should hit them back twice. This is the kind of thing you do

997
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:22,600
with nation states, parallel responses. We'll bomb training camps in Afghanistan, and we'll hit

998
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:29,240
this factory in Khartoum that we think is manufacturing poison chemicals for Al Qaeda.

999
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:35,640
Actually, it was making veterinary medicines, and it was one of the main factories in the whole

1000
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:41,640
country, a very poor country. We killed a night watchman. It just had nothing to do with any of it.

1001
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,920
We bombed the camps in Afghanistan. Fingers crossed Bin Laden would be there. Well, he wasn't.

1002
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:55,480
He was on the road to go there and then changed his mind, and they went somewhere else. So,

1003
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:02,280
it might have happened, but it didn't. But the point was, look what we can do. You hit us,

1004
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:10,840
we'll hit you back. Well, that's exactly what Bin Laden wanted. The failure of imagination that

1005
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:16,360
you referenced, there was a failure of imagination, but it was coupled with

1006
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:28,280
prejudicial ideas about who we're dealing with and a tremendous absence of knowledge about the

1007
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:34,040
cultures that our adversaries came from. So, we just didn't understand, and we couldn't understand

1008
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:39,000
their language. We didn't know what was going on. And so, yeah, it is not a surprise that our

1009
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:46,760
imaginations didn't rise to the task because we didn't know who we're dealing with, and we could

1010
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:51,560
not figure them out, nor did we really spend very much time worrying about it. Let's just deal with

1011
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:58,440
them as if it was Russia that did this, and we'll strike them back proportionally. And

1012
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:08,040
Clinton did have the idea, he spoke to one of his military commanders about sending in ninjas,

1013
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:15,400
dropped, rappelled down from Cobra helicopters, and that sure surprised Bin Laden. And

1014
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:21,720
on balance, it wasn't a bad idea. That was probably the right thing to do, go directly in there.

1015
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:31,960
But we were still in the remote control phase of our imperial rule. And

1016
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:39,000
I think that that's partly why we didn't take the embassy bombings seriously.

1017
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:48,840
That's not the way we do things. We send drones over, or we send F-16s, or we send bombers over,

1018
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:54,680
and we do it remotely, and we don't dirty our hands, we don't bloody our hands.

1019
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:02,840
And so I think people just thought it would be a nuisance, and that we would take care of it.

1020
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:12,040
So as the coal, as the planning for the coal bombing is underway, the planning for 9-11 is

1021
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:19,800
also underway. These were parallel, not serial operations. Two men come to the United States,

1022
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:27,000
January 15, 2000. Who are they? These men are Khalil al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.

1023
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:33,400
Saudis. There's two Saudi guys. They scarcely speak any English at all.

1024
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:42,600
They had been in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with the coal bombers. And so the coal bombers went off to

1025
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:50,360
do their thing, and then they fly, first of all, to Thailand, and then they fly into LA.

1026
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:59,480
And so how can they do anything? You know, they're in a country they don't understand.

1027
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:06,120
They don't speak English. You know, their mission is to go train as pilots, but they would not

1028
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:11,560
qualify because they couldn't even speak enough English to go into a class. So this is the first

1029
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:23,480
mystery. What are they doing here? And as it happens, that very day that they arrive, there is a

1030
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:33,400
Saudi figure named Bayoumi, Omar Bayoumi, who happens to be at the Saudi consulate in LA,

1031
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:40,520
talking to the Minister of Religious Affairs. That's kind of significant because, you know,

1032
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:48,600
they are the, as a result of the Mecca catastrophe, Saudi put, Saudis put

1033
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:54,440
these imams and consulates all over the place, and they had a lot of authority. So anyway,

1034
02:11:55,080 --> 02:12:01,640
Omar Bayoumi leaves the Saudi consulate, and he goes to a Middle Eastern restaurant,

1035
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:07,960
where he happens to overhear these two guys speaking in a Saudi accent. It's, according to him,

1036
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:14,680
and the Saudi government, a total coincidence. Do you believe that? No, not at all. No, I think,

1037
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:23,080
in, you know, the families of the victims of 9-11 are suing the Saudi government, trying to get

1038
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:28,760
more information about the people that are involved in that. And Bayoumi is one of the

1039
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:35,240
people that they have on their list of people to talk to. But Bayoumi is such a generous fellow

1040
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:42,520
that he offers to help them find a housing in San Diego, where he has a place. And so he fronts

1041
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:49,720
them some money. He sets them up in San Diego. Bayoumi and other people in his circle begin

1042
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:58,120
receiving money from the wife of the Saudi ambassador in Washington, DC, ostensibly for

1043
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:03,960
an operation for the wife or, you know, these, you know, but it's significant thousands and

1044
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:17,320
thousands of dollars. And Bayoumi takes these two guys, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Midhar, to meet a cleric

1045
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:25,960
in this Saudi mosque in San Diego, who is Anwar al-Alaki, who later becomes, you know,

1046
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:36,360
the voice of radical Islam. We finally killed him in Yemen. But whether he was an al-Qaeda connection

1047
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:43,000
has never been established, but wouldn't it make sense, you know, in any case.

1048
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:49,480
And what is your thought on the money that was coming directly from the wife of the Saudi

1049
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:59,240
ambassador? The ambassador Bandar was very close to the, you know, the Bush White House. He was,

1050
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:05,960
he was sort of the dean of the diplomatic establishment. So there was a plausibility

1051
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:10,920
thing. How, you know, would you really see such a thing happening from the ambassador himself?

1052
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:21,560
But it stands that, you know, these Saudis were getting money sent to them in San Diego by Bandar's wife.

1053
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:30,520
And now his daughter is the ambassador of the U.S. So, you know, that has never been, I think,

1054
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:40,440
satisfactorily accounted for. Another thing that's going on, you know, they arrived in January 15th,

1055
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:50,760
and in March the CIA finds out that they're in the U.S. Probably, you know, Prince Turkey, you know,

1056
02:14:50,760 --> 02:15:00,040
Prince Turkey told me that he had informed the chief of station in Riyadh, the CIA man in Riyadh

1057
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:10,120
about that. So that's probably where it came from. So in March, this is 21 months before 9-11,

1058
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:16,680
almost two years. The CIA knows that Al Qaeda is in America. And this is at a time when they're,

1059
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:20,680
they say their hair's on fire about, you know, about Al Qaeda, that we're under threat,

1060
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:27,320
they're going to the White House. And yet they know that Al Qaeda is in San Diego. And moreover,

1061
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:38,600
Midhar's wife is in Yemen. She comes from a very Al Qaeda, jihadi family. Her name is

1062
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:48,920
Hoda Al Hada. And the Al Hada household, because it's such a hotspot, we've got wires on the phone.

1063
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:52,040
We've got the phone. Yeah. So I think it's on-

1064
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,920
The CIA is listening to the phone calls.

1065
02:15:54,920 --> 02:16:04,520
14 occasions the NSA is getting calls to this Al Qaeda house in Yemen from San Diego.

1066
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:10,920
Do you have to draw a picture? You know. What's more disturbing than this

1067
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:19,880
is that in October, after the coal bombing, when Ali Sufan is questioning

1068
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:27,640
Cuso and the other suspects, he asks specifically, well, he kind of, I think through that questioning

1069
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:36,280
comes to learn of the meeting that took place in Malaysia. And asks explicitly on at least

1070
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:45,720
three occasions for information from the CIA about these two guys in the US. And he is stonewalled.

1071
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:53,160
It's not casual either. A request like that goes to the director of the FBI who sends

1072
02:16:54,360 --> 02:17:00,840
a letter to his counterpart, the director of the CIA, formally requesting information

1073
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:07,880
about, in this case, this meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Do you know anything about it? No,

1074
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:14,040
is the answer. No information. In fact, the CIA actually covered the meeting. They

1075
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:19,640
recruited the Malaysian police to take photographs and stuff like that. So they got pictures of the

1076
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:31,400
participants and they hide this information from the FBI. And going back to the mission

1077
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:38,760
of each of these agencies, the story about the siege was who was fighting. They were fighting

1078
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:44,680
over who had control over terrorism in the United States. And in real life, the FBI won that battle.

1079
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:52,120
So they have the authority. The CIA is not supposed to operate in our country, but the FBI

1080
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:57,480
has the authority, has a warrant on Al-Qaeda and bin Laden and all his followers.

1081
02:17:57,480 --> 02:18:03,080
So how is this not, in the clearest legal sense, obstruction of justice?

1082
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:11,080
It is obstruction of justice. The CIA obstructed justice when Ali Safan was investigating the

1083
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:17,320
coal bombing. They hid information about the planning and they hid information about the

1084
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:24,360
Kuala Lumpur meeting. This is a murder investigation. 19 sailors.

1085
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:30,920
So at this point, Michael Shurer is gone, correct? He has been relieved of his duties at

1086
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:37,640
Alex station. What led to that? Well, he was relentless in pressing

1087
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:46,440
the agency and trying to get rid of bin Laden. There was a moment where he thought bin Laden

1088
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:55,560
might be at one of the camps in Afghanistan. And he said, and the reason that he might be there

1089
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:01,960
is that a lot of the royal family from the UAE was coming to do a buster hunting,

1090
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:13,800
this endangered bird that is popular. And so let's bomb the camp and we'll kill all the princes,

1091
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:19,160
but we might get bin Laden. Well, that was the kind of thinking that Michael Shurer was capable of.

1092
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:23,880
Yeah, which again, the UAE is an ally. I mean, it would be hard to fathom that.

1093
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:29,320
Yeah. And we were just at that moment selling them a whole fleet of F-16s. So there was a

1094
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:36,200
financial investment in not doing that as well in addition to the absurdity of the scene. But

1095
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:42,200
that's the kind of thing that Shurer would propose. So who took over Alex station when Shurer was

1096
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,560
terminated? The woman that took over the station

1097
02:19:48,440 --> 02:20:03,400
is an FBI view, a villain, but she and Shurer later married. And so it was an office romance.

1098
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:08,440
It was an extension of Shurer anyway. Now, one of the things that's interesting about

1099
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:14,440
Alex station is it had a number of I-49 agents that sat within it physically. So these are

1100
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:20,280
FBI agents that are sitting inside Alex station, but they were kind of handcuffed because they were

1101
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:26,360
privy to the information that the CIA had, but they weren't permitted to share it with their

1102
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:32,920
colleagues at FBI. One of the things that struck me as odd is that none of them broke rank, right?

1103
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:39,640
Like you see in Edward Snowden, you know, a decade later, who, you know, goes completely rogue and

1104
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:45,080
decides for right or wrong, this is his conviction. This is what he's going to do about it. This is in

1105
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:51,640
the life. This isn't the best interest of American lives. And yet amazingly, none of the FBI agents

1106
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:58,040
sitting inside of Alex station who presumably saw what was happening, didn't think I'm willing to

1107
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:05,640
jeopardize my job here and maybe face criminal charges to get information because they saw the

1108
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:12,920
wires coming in. They saw the requests repeatedly from the FBI, from Sufan saying, who are these

1109
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:19,640
people? What happened in Malaysia? Why is money leaving to go to these people? Why is this money

1110
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:24,440
coming to the United States? I mean, did you ever get an insight into why the FBI people inside

1111
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:32,360
Alex station were, were, were muzzled? You know, there was a, it was more of a legal

1112
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:39,000
conceit. They called the wall. And the idea was that information should not travel from the

1113
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:48,280
intelligence world into the criminal one and vice versa. There was really no law. There was,

1114
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:54,360
people thought it was a law, but there was a, it was a custom and an FBI had its own intelligence

1115
02:21:54,360 --> 02:22:02,280
division. And so it was part of the, just is like grand jury testimony. You know, it's not supposed,

1116
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:09,000
it's supposed to be sealed, you know, it's kept, kept pure and secret. But

1117
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:17,160
when you're faced with something like that, the only alternative, you know, is to break the law.

1118
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:22,200
And there can be very serious consequences and it's a lonely thing to do. But that's really the

1119
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:31,720
only thing you can do. What I can tell you is how broken those people are by what happened.

1120
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:41,240
They knew what was going to, they knew what was underway and they lost their boss. You know,

1121
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:49,640
John O'Neill died as a consequence of their reticence to say anything. I'm not holding them

1122
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:58,120
responsible for 9-11, but I do hold the CIA responsible for it. If they had been transparent

1123
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:08,040
with the FBI, if they had said, we have these Aikaida members in America, the FBI had the authority,

1124
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:13,080
they had the warrant, they had everything. They could follow them. They could tape them. They could,

1125
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:19,960
you know, clone their computers and they could arrest them. There were all these things that

1126
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:31,960
they could do, but they were kept in the dark. And of course, the question is why? And I've asked,

1127
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,040
you know, I- How many people in the CIA were you able to interview?

1128
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:49,320
Uh, they were actually working in the CIA. There was a moment where I think it's

1129
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:58,440
time has passed enough that I can say this. I wrote an article about Iman Elzawari for The

1130
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:11,800
New Yorker and the CIA asked to talk to me. And so I was picked up by an FBI agent who worked at

1131
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:17,960
the CIA and driven to CIA headquarters and gone up the seventh floor and there was a conference

1132
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:31,080
room and I met with Alex Station. They were about 20 something people there. And the meeting started

1133
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:38,040
off in Arabic. And I said, Kula hah dah hai na bakadam aarvi? You know, everybody here speaks

1134
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:45,160
Arabic and they had learned it in the last couple of years. I was impressed by that. But I was not

1135
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:50,040
impressed with their intelligence. You know, I was a reporter on the ground, you know, going

1136
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:58,520
around talking to people and I wasn't trying to hide information from the CIA. I published it.

1137
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:04,040
You know, it's not what I find out. I want people to know. So I didn't feel like I was betraying

1138
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:12,200
sources or anything like that by talking to the CIA. What I did want was a little bit of information

1139
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:19,080
from them in return. And what they confided was that Bin Laden was alive. At that time, there was

1140
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:27,640
a lot of talk. What year was that? I'm guessing it was 2003. It might have been earlier than that

1141
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:37,240
because I went to Egypt in, I guess in the fall. It must have been 2002. Bin Laden was keeping his

1142
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:45,640
head down. And so, you know, there was a lot of talk that maybe we got him or that he was sick,

1143
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:54,680
you know. But, you know, the intelligence agencies, at least my experience with American

1144
02:25:54,680 --> 02:26:04,520
intelligence agencies, is that they tend to trust information that has been stolen. In other words,

1145
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:10,760
you know, wiretaps, you know, stuff that people are saying not knowing supposedly that they're

1146
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:18,120
being listened to. Reporters have a different posture. We go out and talk to people and ask

1147
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:22,760
them what they're up to and why and, you know, where'd you come from. And, you know, those

1148
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:29,000
sorts of things you don't normally get on transcripts. And so they apparently taped my

1149
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:38,120
phone. You know, one of my sources said he read a conversation I had, came in on his laptop at the

1150
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:48,360
agency. It was a conversation I'd had with Zawahiri's cousin. And so the legal authority they had to

1151
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:55,320
tap your phone was because of who you were speaking to? You're not supposed to tap Americans.

1152
02:26:55,320 --> 02:27:08,600
So that was, if that had been a tap on my line, then, you know, if I were talking to, you know,

1153
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:16,680
as I had been to Zawahiri's cousin, they should say individual A, you know. And so I'm not

1154
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:25,480
identified. But, you know, obviously I was. And I thought at the time, oh, those Egyptians, you

1155
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:31,880
know, they're on top of, you know, Zawahiri's cousin. They sent this as a gift to the CIA.

1156
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:40,200
And the, but then I, you know, then I a couple of years later learned, you know, that

1157
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,160
we had been, you know, they had, the American intelligence had been taping Americans and some

1158
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:57,880
reporters. And I obviously, I had had a visit from, there's a terrorism squad, even in Austin.

1159
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:03,000
And they, you know, a couple of guys came over, they wanted to talk to me. And I thought they

1160
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:08,760
wanted advice because I had talked to FBI agents before and give them a little background on

1161
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:15,000
Al Qaeda. And I thought that's what this was. And one of them was from the FDA, but he was on the

1162
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,440
terrorism squad and he walked into my office and there are all these books on Al Qaeda and there's,

1163
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:25,880
you know, a whiteboard full of Arabic names. And, you know, he was terrified. His hands were

1164
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:36,920
trembling. And what they wanted to know was about a call that I had made to England. And

1165
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:45,720
it was a 44201 number, you know, and it just sounded like business number in London.

1166
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:53,560
And I said, surely you know who it is. But I looked on my rolodex and it was a barrister

1167
02:28:53,560 --> 02:29:03,640
who represented some jihadis. And it turned out, you know, then they said, did you know a person

1168
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:10,520
named Caroline Wright, who's my daughter, she was in college. And they thought it was Caroline

1169
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:17,160
calling this barrister to get to these jihadis. And I thought, this is our intelligence. You know,

1170
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:24,520
it was, you know, and then as I started thinking about it, it was like, wait a minute,

1171
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:32,680
how do you know it's my line? How do you know that, you know, that Caroline would, how do you

1172
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:38,200
know about Caroline at all? You know, and so you wouldn't have gotten that if you hadn't been

1173
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:46,040
listening to the call. And I was really outraged as an American citizen, but also shocked by the

1174
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:51,720
level of incompetence that I mean, I was grateful they came to clear it up. I have to say they at

1175
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:59,160
least did that. But the presumptions that they had were so absurd that I could see how we got

1176
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:05,960
ourselves into this fix. The two hijackers, the future hijackers in San Diego, the FBI,

1177
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:13,800
their line on what was going on is the CIA knew they couldn't operate in America,

1178
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:20,600
but the Saudis could. And so they struck a deal with the Saudis to try to follow these

1179
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:25,880
guys and turn them. Here they are in our clutches, we have an opportunity to penetrate Al Qaeda,

1180
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:32,440
which is not something the CIA had been able to do. And all the young men from all over the world

1181
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:39,000
were simply walking into the camps and becoming Al Qaeda members. But they thought that the Saudis

1182
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:47,880
would do them that favor. And then the two hijackers disappeared and the CIA lost them.

1183
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:56,840
And it was then in August of 2001, just a couple of weeks before 9-11, that the CIA went to the FBI

1184
02:30:57,640 --> 02:31:04,280
to ask them to find these guys that they had lost. And it was too late. The FBI never did find them.

1185
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,040
So Muhammad Ata is an interesting character.

1186
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:21,480
Of all the 9-11 hijackers, obviously he was the senior figure, but he was also

1187
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:30,600
such an interesting and unusual character. It's hard to make sense of his motivation,

1188
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:41,720
an educated man, a pious man. But one of the things I've always struggled with is,

1189
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:49,480
what is it that these guys believed was going to happen? You go back to the story about the

1190
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:55,640
birds circling and the flesh not rotting. Do you believe every one of those 19 men believed they

1191
02:31:56,600 --> 02:32:02,520
would be greeted in paradise by virgins? Do you think they literally believe that?

1192
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:09,880
I think so. It may have not been the preponderant motive for them.

1193
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:13,880
Although martyrdom seems to be the highest motivation, right?

1194
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:19,560
Martyrdom, even if you're not going to paradise and getting the virgins and all of that,

1195
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:27,400
Martyrdom has its appeal, especially for young men who have really little opportunity to make a

1196
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:32,920
dent in the world. And here you can go off and change history. All you have to do is sacrifice

1197
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:43,720
your life. So the martyrdom might be the carrot, but it might not be. It might just be that they

1198
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:48,040
wanted to prove a point and they wanted to go down in history and they have.

1199
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:57,400
You talk about how terrorist organizations were allowed to legally operate inside of Germany,

1200
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:01,800
provided that they were foreign and not domestic terrorist organizations.

1201
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:07,720
It's almost an unfathomable statement. Can you help make sense of that?

1202
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:24,760
Well, Germany has a tortured history and its problems with fanaticism on German soil have

1203
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:34,440
historically been a corrective. So you cannot very easily be a fascist in Germany now.

1204
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:40,440
There are fascists in Germany, but it's sort of an underground thing.

1205
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:51,640
Other countries, there's this sense in Germany of implicit neutrality. We don't take positions on

1206
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:59,800
things like that. And so if you're opposed to your government and you flee to Germany for asylum,

1207
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:07,400
what you do in relation to your home country is your business, not ours. Just don't screw

1208
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:19,880
around with our country. It's not just Germany. Europe was slow to awaken to the threat to their

1209
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:29,640
own countries, in part because in England, terrorists were actually brought into England

1210
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:35,000
because they were escaping the death penalty in Egypt and they still live with subsidized rent

1211
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:43,640
and such a thing. In London, one of my sources is a driving instructor in London and he killed this

1212
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:52,440
little girl, Shema, in Egypt in his attempt to kill the prime minister. That kind of mentality

1213
02:34:52,440 --> 02:35:01,400
came about because people just didn't feel threatened. And I think to some extent that

1214
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:08,600
explains why these terror groups were allowed to grow up inside the borders, especially of England

1215
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:15,480
and Germany and Spain as well. When did Ata come to the United States? I don't remember the exact

1216
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:25,160
month. His cohorts had begun to assemble. And so I think he was one of the last to arrive. He was in

1217
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:33,240
Spain coordinating with some of the Spanish Al-Qaeda guys. To what end, we're not really sure.

1218
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:42,680
But then he flew into America. Of course, unlike the other guys, his English was pretty good.

1219
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:46,520
So his English is good. He's one of the four pilots.

1220
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:56,040
How were they coordinating inside the US? What did they communicate by? Did they speak on cell

1221
02:35:56,040 --> 02:36:02,680
phones? Did they use email? How did these 19 guys organized in four groups communicate?

1222
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:07,400
Well, they did use email and cell phones. And what you have to understand,

1223
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:18,680
they weren't really hiding. The CIA knew that Al-Qaeda was present. And the Al-Qaeda guys didn't

1224
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:26,360
know the CIA knew that. So ostensibly, they just lived openly. They had driver's licenses and

1225
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:34,680
stuff in their own names. Eventually, the FBI would find that they were listed in the San Diego

1226
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:42,360
phone directory. So they weren't in hiding. They didn't feel threatened. And they took

1227
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:47,880
advantage of that freedom. So after the election,

1228
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:56,040
Richard Clark, who's also a very important figure in your book, gets a demotion.

1229
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:59,560
Why is that? That was not clear to me in the book.

1230
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:12,280
Well, he had been under Clinton, the terrorism czar. And when the Bush administration came in,

1231
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:18,840
they didn't see the need for that. And their view was about the big picture. We're talking about

1232
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:27,800
China and Russia. And so the people in their NSA and Secretary of State and Condi Rice and so on,

1233
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:37,800
they came from the old school. Clark told me that when he talked to Condi Rice to try to

1234
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:44,760
alert her to the danger of Al-Qaeda, he had the feeling she'd never heard of the organization.

1235
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:51,560
And it's hard to imagine that she didn't hear of it at all, but she clearly didn't take it

1236
02:37:51,560 --> 02:38:00,840
seriously enough to take his counsel. And so he was pushed down the ranks. And Bush was,

1237
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:12,040
you know, I don't think he took it seriously until the Saudis threatened to break off relations with

1238
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:18,840
the US because of Israel. And that woke him up. He was very concerned about that. But then there was

1239
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:26,440
a CIA memo. I think it was dated August 6, 2001. This is the presidential daily brief. Yeah.

1240
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:33,560
That was titled, Al-Qaeda set to attack in the US. Right. And so it couldn't have been clearer.

1241
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:39,880
And this was about the same time the CIA lost those guys in San Diego. So

1242
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:45,560
suddenly things are moving and they're out of the CIA's control.

1243
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:53,160
Now during the 9-11 commission, when Condi Rice was asked about that memo, August 6th,

1244
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:59,000
right? So five weeks before 9-11, the president of the United States gets a briefing

1245
02:38:59,560 --> 02:39:06,840
that says Al-Qaeda is going to strike on US soil. And of course, when Congress questioned her,

1246
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:13,160
it was sort of, why was this not taken seriously? Her response was, if I recall, something akin to

1247
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:21,240
this was dated. There was nothing new in here. This was speculative. There was no real intelligence.

1248
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:27,480
Am I remembering that correctly? Yeah. Such dodges were characteristic of a lot of the

1249
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:33,720
people involved in this massive intelligence failure. You know, I've asked people in the CIA,

1250
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:40,920
you know, people in high authority about those hijackers, for instance. And no, we didn't really

1251
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:47,480
know. I mean, it was just incompetence, actually. There were memos that we didn't read and, you

1252
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:51,960
know, it was in, yes, it was in the memos, but it never really came to the attention of people in

1253
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:58,280
authority. And in other words, there's a fog, pixie dust thrown in your eyes, whereas nothing could

1254
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:06,600
be more incendiary to very same people that are ringing the alarm bell saying Al-Qaeda is on the

1255
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:11,560
warpath and is coming our way. And then they say, well, you know, we didn't, we weren't really paying

1256
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:18,600
attention to that. And the memo never came to our attention. Bullshit. You know, this was, you know,

1257
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:25,960
CIA was well aware by this time, you know, there was the embassy bombers, there was a coal bombing.

1258
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:30,200
There was, and then, you know, they become aware that Al-Qaeda is in America now. So

1259
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:36,040
they're moving onto our soil. And that's the origin of that particular memo is that

1260
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:41,480
CIA knows they're here. And so they're obviously they're going to do an attack here.

1261
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:49,240
Now, O'Neill said this to Condoleezza Rice before he was fired, forced to resign. And

1262
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:56,120
she seemed to indicate that this was not a high priority because it, I think in the, in the words

1263
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:02,520
at least used in the, in the dramatized version of this, this was swatting flies, right? This was

1264
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:08,280
what? We've got a couple of Al-Qaeda guys in this country. That's not strategic. That's not relevant.

1265
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:16,200
One of the things that's just so mind boggling to me about this story is how,

1266
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:22,920
is how, yeah, incompetence is, I mean, this is obviously a big part of this, but it's the

1267
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:26,840
personality conflicts that got in the way. I mean, another character in this story,

1268
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:37,720
whose role is really quite sad is Barbara Bodine, then ambassador in Yemen, who did not get along

1269
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:43,640
with John O'Neill, which I guess you can't fault her for that. I can, John O'Neill struck me just

1270
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:47,160
from everything I've read about him. And I know you did not have the ability to interview him,

1271
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:51,560
but you're doing, your reporting is based on interviews with everyone who knew him.

1272
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:57,000
He struck me as a love or hate guy. Is that a safe, a safe, polarizing thing? Yeah. You either

1273
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:02,120
absolutely loved this guy or you absolutely hated this guy, but I never got the impression that

1274
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:12,440
anybody wouldn't think he was competent. Yeah. Barbara Bodine seemed to have a thing about

1275
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:19,960
men and guns. And she was offended that the FBI came to Yemen with a bunch of armaments. And

1276
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:29,640
of course it was dangerous. And, and O'Neill was trying to take care of his people and they were

1277
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:36,120
authorized to carry weapons, but she was offended and made them give up their long guns.

1278
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:42,120
And she kicked him out of Yemen. She did. Which is another real setback in the investigation

1279
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:50,040
at the time. It could be, I mean, taking her side, I'm sure she perceived O'Neill as a swaggering

1280
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:59,880
misogynist and, you know, and she wasn't going to have any of that. And she felt that she had a

1281
02:42:59,880 --> 02:43:06,440
role as the ambassador cultivate a better relationship with the Yemenis. And here he was

1282
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:12,680
coming in, kicking up all this dust, alienating everybody with his American big footing.

1283
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:23,800
And so enough of this, you know, I can do without him. And it was a terrible blow for O'Neill. And I

1284
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:32,280
think, you know, that in some ways led to his sort of disgrace at the end where he had to go to a

1285
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:37,640
retirement conference and he took some papers out of the office he shouldn't have taken, but he was

1286
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:45,000
doing work in Florida at this retirement conference and then left his briefcase in the

1287
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:51,400
conference room and somebody took it. He got it back. And, you know, the only thing it was taken

1288
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:58,120
was like a silver cigar cutter. And the papers were still in there, but, you know, he turned

1289
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:05,800
himself in and he had a lot of enemies inside the FBI and they were not going to miss the opportunity

1290
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:12,920
to use this to get rid of him. Now, he had many job opportunities after he left the FBI.

1291
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:18,840
One of them was a job in the government, again, in the White House, correct? Or at least that

1292
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:21,400
was something that Dick Clark hoped he would take. It's not clear that he would have been on it.

1293
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:25,720
Yeah. Dick wanted him to replace him. He couldn't think of a better person. And

1294
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:34,120
O'Neill had lived above his means for many years. I don't know how he got away with it.

1295
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:44,360
But he was deeply in debt. And I think he was also deeply wounded by his experience with

1296
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:50,200
government. And so he wanted to get out and make some money. And there was money to be made for

1297
02:44:50,200 --> 02:45:00,600
him. With his experience, the job that he settled on was head of security at the World Trade Center.

1298
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:07,960
And I know that. And listen, when this whole adventure started for me by reading obituaries

1299
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:13,960
that were streaming online right after 9-11, I was trying to find a way into the story,

1300
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:22,840
something that would humanize it. And I thought I was looking for people who died in 9-11 and see if

1301
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:30,920
I could find a narrative. And on the Washington Post site, about six days after 9-11, I think,

1302
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:37,800
was this obituary of John O'Neill, FBI head of counterterrorism.

1303
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:40,200
Recently retired, been on the job for a month.

1304
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:46,760
It was more than that. It's spelled out that he had taken classified information out of the office.

1305
02:45:47,400 --> 02:45:57,720
And I thought I didn't know if he was a hero or a goat, but his life could tell us something about

1306
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:03,160
why we failed. He was the head of counterterrorism in New York. He's the guy that had the warrant on

1307
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:08,920
Bin Laden. But instead of getting Bin Laden, Bin Laden got him. That was the way I looked at it.

1308
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:15,000
It's one of those things, Lawrence, where if this weren't a true story,

1309
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:21,880
if you had written The Looming Tower as a fiction, I don't know that the editors would have let you

1310
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:27,880
end it the way you did. I don't think they would have let you have John O'Neill actually die inside

1311
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:35,080
the World Trade Center a month after being forced to resign from the FBI because he was

1312
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:39,320
kicked out at the shins and not able to do his job.

1313
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:48,120
I thought when I read that, Obed, that it was a supreme irony, but I don't see it that way. Now,

1314
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:57,240
he told his colleagues, some of them said to him, John, you'll be safe now because they already hit

1315
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:03,960
the Trade Center because they've been a bombing. And he said, no, they'll come back to finish the

1316
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:11,080
job. So I think he instinctively put himself at ground zero. In that sense, I see it as a Greek

1317
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:19,800
tragedy. He in some ways anticipated his fate and went to meet it. He actually

1318
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:24,760
left the tower that day and went back inside to rescue people.

1319
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:33,720
Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. He walked back into the building, as many heroes did.

1320
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:35,260
Yeah.

1321
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:45,240
If September 11th took place on December 11th, if the mission were postponed two months,

1322
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:52,760
do you think that would have been enough time for the FBI to figure it out? How close was the FBI

1323
02:47:52,760 --> 02:48:01,160
to doing this despite the incompetence of the CIA, if not the outright negligence of the CIA?

1324
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:11,480
Well, it's hard to calculate how much they could have done, but there's no reason to think that

1325
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:17,640
they couldn't have once alerted in August and given three or four months to work it out,

1326
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:24,280
no reason to think that they couldn't have tracked down the communications if the American intelligence

1327
02:48:25,240 --> 02:48:27,000
community had been helpful to them.

1328
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:32,920
Because remember, the other thing that I always feel like they were so close to cracking was

1329
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:42,840
once they had the list, the CIA list of suspected Al-Qaeda operatives and the list of Arabs in

1330
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:49,080
flight schools and they crossed that list, that was just a matter of time.

1331
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:56,520
It seems like, and there were several cases, like you mentioned, the flight schools in Arizona and

1332
02:48:56,520 --> 02:49:04,200
Minnesota, there were these weird things where these Arab would-be pilots who wanted to learn

1333
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:11,400
how to fly but not how to land. Those were really puzzling things. Now, of course, nothing like this

1334
02:49:11,400 --> 02:49:16,920
had ever happened before. It seems crazy, but on the other hand, it had been envisioned.

1335
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:24,200
But you'd think all it would have taken would have been a handful of these guys show up on a

1336
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:30,520
cross list and that manifest gets sent to TSA or whatever. Was TSA TSA back then? I don't know

1337
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:35,640
what it was called. But there would have been a watch list that said, because as you said,

1338
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:38,760
these guys are getting on airplanes with their real names. They had real ID.

1339
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:48,280
Well, also, one of the FBI agents in Phoenix actually wrote, I think this was a guy that did

1340
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:56,600
that. They could envision crashing into buildings. That's spookily prescient. And then there was

1341
02:49:57,400 --> 02:50:07,080
secret. The 9-11 families had sued to get the 28 pages that had been suppressed in the 9-11 report,

1342
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:12,600
and we finally got them, although there's still some redaction in it. And in there, you see

1343
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:21,480
Saudis on airplanes doing trial runs, getting the ticket in the first class compartment

1344
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:33,960
and walking into the cockpit. And oh, I thought this was a bathroom. And then one of them was

1345
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:40,680
so provocative in his actions that they actually landed the plane to stop the flight, put down to

1346
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:47,480
nearest airport, and had somebody come out and interrogate two, I think, Saudis. And they said,

1347
02:50:47,480 --> 02:50:52,600
no, we're going to a party at the Saudi embassy. And they gave them a number in the Saudi embassy

1348
02:50:52,600 --> 02:51:00,120
in Washington. Well, that's damning. And no wonder it was suppressed if you're trying to

1349
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:06,920
protect your relationship with Saudi Arabia. But it hasn't been explained. But these were clearly

1350
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:17,960
trial runs. And the CIA knew about them. That's why that was in the 9-11 report. This is intelligence

1351
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:24,600
that had been surfaced. So there was intelligence around that something was cooking. And even the

1352
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:32,520
CIA, George Tenet was telling the White House, they're going to attack us. They're coming for us.

1353
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:37,960
That's the thing with Tenet. I can't understand from your book. I got to be honest with you. I'm

1354
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:44,200
really conflicted and confused. On the one hand, he seems to be in lockstep with Richard Clark

1355
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:51,160
in saying this is a big deal. And he seems incredibly frustrated with the Bush administration

1356
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:56,920
that they're not taking this more seriously. And he seems to believe that this is almost something

1357
02:51:56,920 --> 02:52:01,560
they're doing out of spite. Whatever the previous president did, we're absolutely going to do the

1358
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:08,680
opposite. But at the same time, I think, how is it then that under your watch, your organization

1359
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:22,760
was so derelict? He's never really been able to produce an incredible answer. And I've tried to

1360
02:52:22,760 --> 02:52:29,880
imagine what was going through his mind. If it's the case that he did seriously believe that Al

1361
02:52:29,880 --> 02:52:36,840
Qaeda was a threat and that he had been striking a deal with the Saudis, it was a risky deal,

1362
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:45,560
but one that had the potential for a huge payoff. And then it gets out of control. And just as it's

1363
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:54,120
getting out of control, he is dramatically shouting, pay attention, Al Qaeda is on the war path.

1364
02:52:54,120 --> 02:53:01,080
So it's sort of like the arsonist who, as the house catches on fire, is actually the one that

1365
02:53:01,080 --> 02:53:06,680
calls the firefighter. Yeah, I think that's a fair comparison. I don't know what's going through. I

1366
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:11,720
want to be fair to him. But he were not able to interview him? He wouldn't talk to me. And he's

1367
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:22,440
never really dealt seriously with this subject. It's not just George Tenet, but he's responsible.

1368
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:28,440
He was the person who oversaw the American intelligence community in one of his greatest

1369
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:35,880
catastrophes in our history. And not that it's been so sterling since then, but it was

1370
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:44,840
an unbelievable failure. And there are so many points. Yes, it's true Monday morning

1371
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:51,640
quarterbacking and all of that. But I think I'm being fair enough to say the CIA knew what was

1372
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:58,920
going on. They hid the information from the FBI. Had the CIA been transparent and worked in tandem

1373
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:08,120
with the FBI, the 9-11 would not have happened. I think the facts support that. And so there's

1374
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:17,400
never been accountability for this, not any. And in fact, George Tenet got the Medal of Freedom and

1375
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:25,240
all these other things, accolades. I'm not saying that he belongs in prison, although

1376
02:54:25,880 --> 02:54:31,480
I can understand why people might say that. But he should be held accountable, as should everybody

1377
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:39,080
in authority at that agency. So I wanted to ask you about that, which is given all that we know

1378
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:47,880
today, has anyone inside the CIA been charged with a criminal offense for obstruction of justice?

1379
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:56,440
No, no, they were promoted. People that knew about this were given plum assignments. And

1380
02:54:57,880 --> 02:55:07,240
I asked one of the directors about, has anybody been held accountable? And he said, well, yes.

1381
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:17,160
I've held people accountable. Well, who? For what? And he wouldn't specify, but there was no evidence

1382
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:30,520
of it. And I asked about, it was a question about torture and the two hijackers in San Diego,

1383
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:39,720
and maybe one other thing. And I said, this is a history of the CIA, not all under your reign,

1384
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:47,720
but partly, has anybody been held accountable? And he quarreled with some of my facts

1385
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:55,400
without actually saying that they were wrong. And then I said, so in other words, nobody's been

1386
02:55:55,400 --> 02:56:00,200
held accountable. And then he said, no, that's not true. I've held people accountable myself.

1387
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:07,000
But I don't know how to credit that. The most conspicuous people got promotions.

1388
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:11,720
Yeah. I mean, let's just think about it through the lens of the family members of 9-11. So we had

1389
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:20,520
a 9-11 commission. What came of that for the family members?

1390
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:29,720
Well, it was frustrating for the family members. It was presented as being the whole truth and

1391
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:35,480
nothing but the truth. And then it came out that there were parts of the 9-11 commission that were

1392
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:41,720
suppressed at the 28 pages, most notably. And of course, a lot of pages were redacted.

1393
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:45,320
And the 28 pages that were suppressed dealt primarily with the Saudis.

1394
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:46,040
The Saudis.

1395
02:56:47,320 --> 02:56:53,640
Because again, I remember even at the time, one of the things that was odd was the Saudis

1396
02:56:53,640 --> 02:57:01,640
being given air clearance to leave. How do you make sense of this? This is one that I have a hard

1397
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:08,360
time wrapping my head around, which is why would the Saudis have, why would anybody inside of Saudi

1398
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:13,320
Arabia had wanted this? I'm talking about not obviously Al-Qaeda, but I'm talking about anyone

1399
02:57:13,320 --> 02:57:18,040
within the royal family, anyone within the Saudi intelligence community. I mean, there's no doubt

1400
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:25,080
to me that Prince Turkey was a good guy. This is a guy who I can't imagine there was any part of

1401
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:31,240
him that would want to see bin Laden and his organization succeed. So what's the explanation

1402
02:57:31,240 --> 02:57:38,920
for how any of the quote unquote Saudi good guys could have stood by and knowingly watched this

1403
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:42,360
happen or worse supported it financially or otherwise?

1404
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:52,040
If we think about these things as an intelligence analyst, just imagine, here are the facts.

1405
02:57:52,040 --> 02:58:01,560
So where are the Saudis in this and why are they behaving like this? I think that the Saudis thought,

1406
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:12,200
for one thing, they gave us the information that Al-Qaeda is in America. Perhaps if this FBI's

1407
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:20,520
scenario is correct, that the CIA thought that they could turn these guys, they work out a deal

1408
02:58:20,520 --> 02:58:28,360
with the Saudis where they're going to run these people. They'll use them as potential recruits.

1409
02:58:29,240 --> 02:58:35,960
And they fund the bayoumis and other people that are sort of their supervisors. So they give them

1410
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:50,360
money to keep the operation going. And there is a certain ambition on the part of the Saudis to

1411
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:57,640
show what a great job they can do. And also, these are Saudis that are in America. And so they want

1412
02:58:57,640 --> 02:59:04,200
to try to keep control of them. So I can envision that. But does that explain how they would actually

1413
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:11,800
how the ambassador's wife would send money to know? It would explain if Bayoumi, for instance,

1414
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:17,080
is a Saudi intelligence operative and his job is to oversee these guys.

1415
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:20,120
Oversee them to prevent them from attacking on US soil?

1416
02:59:20,840 --> 02:59:24,920
Oversee to penetrate their cell and understand what's going on.

1417
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:31,320
I see. And I don't know if the Saudis knew that they were planning to fly planes into buildings,

1418
02:59:31,320 --> 02:59:34,120
but they were up to something. So what could it be?

1419
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:41,880
I see. So that's a more plausible explanation, which is that, again, their failure of imagination

1420
02:59:41,880 --> 02:59:47,800
was they had no idea that these Saudi kids could accomplish something as grand.

1421
02:59:47,800 --> 02:59:55,400
Especially given that pair. It's hard to imagine that they would take them that seriously.

1422
02:59:55,400 --> 02:59:57,000
On the other hand, there they were.

1423
02:59:57,560 --> 03:00:01,320
I see. This makes a bit more sense. So going back to my analogy,

1424
03:00:03,160 --> 03:00:08,680
they're not really acting as an arsonist. They're somebody who accidentally sets the house on fire,

1425
03:00:08,680 --> 03:00:16,440
but then realizes, oh, I just set the house on fire. I better call. But I also better make sure

1426
03:00:16,440 --> 03:00:22,280
I'm nowhere near this fire to get here. I'm not going to stick around to say I was doing this and

1427
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:28,760
that. One always hopes for whistleblowers and somebody to come clear of the air and their

1428
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:36,200
documents to surface that, and none of that has happened. So far, I may be wrong about all this.

1429
03:00:36,200 --> 03:00:45,080
It could be simply incompetence, which explains so many things. But there were people like those

1430
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:53,560
FBI guys. They knew something was going on and they were alarmed. They were also shut down when

1431
03:00:53,560 --> 03:01:03,480
they tried to air their concern. So obviously, it was important enough. Dozens of people in the CIA,

1432
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:13,960
at high levels, read these memos. So I long for the day when somebody comes up and says,

1433
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:22,760
this is what actually happened. But it hadn't happened so far in 20 years. And I think that

1434
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:27,400
the longing of the CIA is to bury it in institutional memory and have it never surface.

1435
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:38,840
Richard Clark apologized to the family members of the 9-11 victims. How many other government

1436
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:47,880
officials apologized publicly? I don't know of any. There was an awful lot of scolding going on.

1437
03:01:47,880 --> 03:01:57,000
But what made Dick Clark's statement so cathartic is he took responsibility. Nobody else did that.

1438
03:01:58,120 --> 03:02:04,440
I always found it amazing that he became sort of a target of partisan hit jobs. Yeah, I know.

1439
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:09,560
Which is, I mean, I've read quite a bit about him. I obviously never had the privilege of meeting him,

1440
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:15,160
but never came across to me as a partisan guy, actually. I actually served presidents of both

1441
03:02:15,160 --> 03:02:23,240
administrations. Yeah, I served George H.W. Bush before Clinton. I mean, I was on Sean Hannity's

1442
03:02:23,240 --> 03:02:30,120
show one time and it seemed like one of the main things he wanted to do is attack Dick Clark.

1443
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:38,680
I wasn't prepared for it at all. And I mentioned that incident where he said that

1444
03:02:38,680 --> 03:02:48,360
Condi had dismissed Al Qaeda and Hannity went off on Dick Clark. And I said, but

1445
03:02:49,560 --> 03:02:57,320
he's been a wonderful public servant. I mean, you may think ill of him, but he's a master bureaucrat.

1446
03:02:57,320 --> 03:03:04,840
And he was one of the ones that was ringing the alarm about Al Qaeda. I don't know.

1447
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:13,640
We live in a culture that's just full of people that like to attack others. But Dick Clark,

1448
03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:22,120
you can be puzzled over some of his actions, like he was the one who authorized the flights for the

1449
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:29,800
Saudis to leave the U.S. And I'm sure that he envisioned retaliatory attacks on members of the

1450
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:37,800
Saudi royal family or Bin Laden's family who were present here. And that's totally plausible. But

1451
03:03:39,080 --> 03:03:46,520
was it a wise thing to do? I don't know. What were the days after 9-11 like for Ali Sufon?

1452
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:52,920
Oh, God.

1453
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:02,760
It's hard not to think about who he was. You know, this young guy,

1454
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:13,640
an earnest immigrant who is probably the most valuable person in the FBI at that point.

1455
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:21,160
He's in his 20s. He's been given, I think he was 26 when he became the lead agent for the coal

1456
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:33,160
bombing, a huge responsibility. And he is deeply intelligent. And he is also totally conversant

1457
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:41,000
with Islam and with the politics of the Middle East, such that, you know, when he would interrogate

1458
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:49,000
al-Qaeda guys and they would bring up stuff about Islam, he pulled out the Quran and said,

1459
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:54,360
show me where, show me that in the Quran. And he could recite the Quran himself.

1460
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:59,640
Yeah. In fact, during his interrogation of Abu Jindal, I mean, he basically won him over

1461
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:05,720
with his knowledge of the religion. He knew how to interrogate people without torturing them.

1462
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:13,320
And in fact, during Guantanamo, when they started waterboarding, he called the director

1463
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:19,560
and said, I'm either going to arrest these people or I have to leave. And the director said,

1464
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:25,800
leave, we don't want to, we're not going to be a part of that. He's a seminal figure in our

1465
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:34,440
history in some ways. He's the guy that identified through his interrogations who the al-Qaeda people

1466
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:40,680
were. You know, he got the names, you know, through his skilled interrogation techniques.

1467
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:51,720
And all the time, the CIA was hiding something from him, which was the meeting in Kuala Lumpur,

1468
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:57,320
where the coal bombers had been present and photographed. And, you know, those photographs

1469
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:02,760
were... Tons of cash had been transferred. Ali knew about the transfers, but didn't know why.

1470
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:07,880
And, you know, and who, who were they? And he was beginning to get some names from his

1471
03:06:07,880 --> 03:06:12,440
interrogations. And so that was some of the stuff that was flowing up in his request to

1472
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:20,440
the CIA for more information. And, you know, he's flatly denied. And then 9-11 happens.

1473
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:26,360
And all he can think about is he has to get back to America. And of course...

1474
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:27,480
He's lost his mentor.

1475
03:06:29,240 --> 03:06:30,040
He lost John.

1476
03:06:32,920 --> 03:06:40,120
So he gets on the plane and then he's told by a CIA representative, no, you have to go back.

1477
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:48,360
Go back into, you know, your office in Yemen. And they give him a Manila envelope.

1478
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:54,360
And in there are the pictures of the people that were at the Kuala Lumpur meeting.

1479
03:06:55,320 --> 03:07:02,600
And suddenly he knows... And there was one picture that he knew. And he knew that, you know,

1480
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:10,040
there's an Al-Qaeda operative. And this has been withheld from him. You know, had they given him

1481
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:17,800
that just those photographs that he had asked for back when he was doing his, you know,

1482
03:07:17,800 --> 03:07:21,800
starting his investigation of the coal and began to piece together what had happened,

1483
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:27,400
the FBI would have been able to break open the case right there. And

1484
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:37,800
he went to the bathroom and threw up. And then he went to work.

1485
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:49,160
And that's when he got the names of the Al-Qaeda guys. And, you know, he essentially

1486
03:07:49,640 --> 03:07:55,640
solved the crime from that office in Yemen. One man.

1487
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:07,080
And history could have been so different if the CIA had, you know,

1488
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:12,920
exceeded to his request. And there was nobody better prepared to take advantage of it than Ali

1489
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:26,680
Sivan. Lawrence, it's hard to believe this has been 20 years. Yeah. I want to thank you for

1490
03:08:28,040 --> 03:08:35,880
an unbelievable, unbelievable investigation. Just an amazing amount of research.

1491
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:43,640
It's hard to imagine what you had to do to write this book, how many trips you had to take to take

1492
03:08:43,640 --> 03:08:51,000
into the lion's den. And at the same time, how infuriating it must have been to learn

1493
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:59,720
the set of events. I can't think of anything I've ever done in my life that would be so upsetting.

1494
03:08:59,720 --> 03:09:04,680
Right? Like I think of anything I've ever done that's upset me that in terms of like learning

1495
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:10,200
that something happened or didn't happen, or this person wasn't competent and it led to this,

1496
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:15,960
you know, like the dietary guidelines in the 1970s, like none of that compares in some ways to this.

1497
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:24,040
But I also think that, you know, you've created a place in history for a lot of people who

1498
03:09:24,840 --> 03:09:30,920
wouldn't otherwise be recognized. And I think the Ali Sufans of the world are probably people who

1499
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:37,800
would, you know, not become household names. And look, I hope that as we sit here at the

1500
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:42,440
20th anniversary of, you know, one of the most consequential dates for most of us,

1501
03:09:44,360 --> 03:09:47,560
that people will take time to go back and reflect on the history of that

1502
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:52,920
and reflect on the people who were trying to make a difference.

1503
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:58,360
I guess I'll close with one last question, which is

1504
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:08,360
what do you think the future holds with respect to this type of asymmetric warfare,

1505
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:15,480
be it Al Qaeda or fill in the blank, you know, pick your favorite organization that operates

1506
03:10:15,480 --> 03:10:25,080
in the same mindset. Is this something that is going to be part of our world for the next century?

1507
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:33,080
I think so. You know, just, I mean, there are innumerable terrorist groups around the world

1508
03:10:33,080 --> 03:10:41,560
and in our own country, you know, the white supremacist and most notably. But Al Qaeda set

1509
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:49,160
a template, you know, a small group highly empowered by kind of judo moves of, you know,

1510
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:55,560
using technology against the countries that developed the technology. But now we have,

1511
03:10:55,560 --> 03:11:03,800
you know, Al Qaeda, you know, which was on 9 11, three or 400 guys. Now the estimates 30 to 40,000

1512
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:09,320
members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, you know, from Morocco through the Sahel up through Saudi

1513
03:11:09,320 --> 03:11:15,560
Arabia to India to Southern China, you know, there were Al Qaeda groups all over the place.

1514
03:11:15,640 --> 03:11:21,960
Their intentions haven't changed. They haven't been able to pull off the highly successful attack

1515
03:11:23,960 --> 03:11:31,720
in America that would equal 9 11, but many smaller attacks and not just in America,

1516
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:39,880
but other countries, many other countries with technology, I especially worry about drones.

1517
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:47,080
You know, small groups can have a tremendous, you know, far greater influence and power.

1518
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:52,040
And then, you know, I've been writing about the pandemic.

1519
03:11:55,560 --> 03:12:02,920
I worry that, you know, these kinds of episodes can be suggestive. There are groups like

1520
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:11,480
Omshin Riki, oh, was a Japanese cult that really wanted to destroy much of the world with diseases

1521
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:16,520
or atomic bombs. You know, they're in a lot of very capable scientists were members of it.

1522
03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:25,640
Adam Waffen division, one of the white supremacist groups, they have a philosophy of, you know,

1523
03:12:25,640 --> 03:12:31,880
wanting to eliminate much of the population and so that it narrows down only to white people.

1524
03:12:33,080 --> 03:12:41,000
And biological warfare is part of the, you know, the goal of some of those groups.

1525
03:12:42,360 --> 03:12:51,080
It's dismayingly easy to create diseases. And, you know, I was talking to,

1526
03:12:52,680 --> 03:12:56,440
who's the guy in James Bond that creates all the weapons? Is it him? Is that the?

1527
03:12:57,080 --> 03:12:57,640
Not sure.

1528
03:12:57,640 --> 03:13:01,240
All right. I think it's him. Anyway, I talked to this American version of that.

1529
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:06,200
And he didn't show me the good stuff, but I asked him, this was several years ago,

1530
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,360
what worries you? And he said, what really worries me is those high school kids that are now

1531
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:20,600
creating computer viruses will one day soon be able to manufacture biological viruses just as

1532
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:28,920
easily. And that day is on us now. So I worry about that a lot. And, you know, I think, you know,

1533
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:37,640
we live in a hazardous world. A world is constrained by a lot of loss of freedom because of that.

1534
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:46,440
And, you know, it's, you know, we have to keep in mind the idea of freedom and country that we used

1535
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:52,600
to be and hope that one day we can return to it. We also have to be sober minded about the

1536
03:13:52,600 --> 03:13:58,200
challenges. And I don't think our children are going to live in a world without terrorism or

1537
03:13:58,200 --> 03:14:04,120
our children's children. I think that, you know, terrorism is going to be a factor for a long time

1538
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:12,040
to come. And I don't, I don't finally know, given the proliferation of terror, how we're going to

1539
03:14:12,840 --> 03:14:18,600
put breaks on it. I mean, you can think of it from two standpoints, right? You can think one of it is

1540
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:23,080
you reduce the drive for it, right? So what are the factors that are contributing to terrorism?

1541
03:14:23,080 --> 03:14:28,760
What is the humiliation? What is the disenfranchisement of the individuals who go on to

1542
03:14:28,760 --> 03:14:34,440
perpetrate these things? So what are all those things? What are the forces to reduce them?

1543
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:40,360
At the other end of the spectrum, right? That's is the kind of offensive strategy, which is how

1544
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:46,280
much better can our intelligence agencies be? Look, every person who has run for president

1545
03:14:46,840 --> 03:14:53,320
since 9 11 has said, look at the success. We have not had another attack of this magnitude on US

1546
03:14:53,320 --> 03:14:59,480
soil. Is there something to that? Is that, is that, I mean, that's presumably that's not been

1547
03:14:59,480 --> 03:15:06,120
through a lack of effort on the part of Al Qaeda or others, correct? Well, we always tend to look

1548
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:11,080
over our shoulder at what happened in the past and we have to keep in mind what's happening

1549
03:15:11,080 --> 03:15:19,800
right now. The terrorists proliferate, they move around, they adopt new ideologies. There's a

1550
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:29,000
fluidity about this and we're going to see eruptions of terror. Some will be of small magnitude,

1551
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:40,200
but I've just been writing about the massacre in El Paso in 2019, 23 Mexican Americans killed.

1552
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:48,440
This is the largest attack on Latinos in our history. And it wasn't Al Qaeda,

1553
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:57,800
but it was terrorism. And that idea is so seeded into our culture now that

1554
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:10,360
things can, no doubt, things change over time. You had school shootings, for instance,

1555
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:17,960
that's diminished, but the whole mass shooting thing started here in Austin with the UT tower

1556
03:16:17,960 --> 03:16:26,920
shootings in 1966. So in a way, there was a wave that was created and emulators came along. And

1557
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:35,080
then, currently, it seems like school shootings have diminished, they have drive by shooting.

1558
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:47,560
These memes get into our society. And I don't know how other than being displaced by a new meme,

1559
03:16:48,840 --> 03:16:52,680
they get removed from the consciousness of people that want to do harm.

1560
03:16:54,600 --> 03:17:01,880
But I do think that we are doing a better job of containing terrorism. And we're far more alert to

1561
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:12,040
it. But I do think that our intelligence agencies have to improve. The pandemic was a catastrophic

1562
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:20,360
intelligence failure. This was a national security threat. We've lost more than 600,000 Americans.

1563
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:28,120
If a nation had attacked us and killed half a million of our citizens, we'd been totally on

1564
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:34,120
a different track. But we have to take new things into account. And when we're talking about our

1565
03:17:34,120 --> 03:17:41,240
safety and security, it's not just terrorism, public health, the natural environment, global

1566
03:17:41,240 --> 03:17:48,920
warming, all of these things, we have real challenges ahead of us. And so far to date,

1567
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:55,400
we are not performing adequately to put them at rest. I know I said that was my last question.

1568
03:17:55,400 --> 03:18:03,320
I guess I have one more. In all of your research, have you come to believe that these relatively

1569
03:18:03,320 --> 03:18:09,800
small terrorist organizations would have the capacity to acquire and actually utilize nuclear

1570
03:18:09,880 --> 03:18:18,840
weapons? I think nuclear weapons are kind of hard. When the Soviet Union collapsed, there were

1571
03:18:18,840 --> 03:18:26,840
a lot of loose nukes. And Al-Qaeda tried to get hold of a nuclear bomb and it turned out to be a

1572
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:37,560
fraud. But nuclear weapons tend to be beyond the capacity of the people that we've dealt with in

1573
03:18:37,560 --> 03:18:44,440
the past. That doesn't mean that there couldn't be people in the future who have that capacity

1574
03:18:44,440 --> 03:18:52,520
and would be willing to. But you would say biological weapons would be a far greater concern

1575
03:18:53,320 --> 03:18:58,760
in terms of massive, we're talking about on the scale of hundreds of thousands of lives.

1576
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:08,600
And some toxins. Anthrax is a good candidate. I think we have to be really, really careful.

1577
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:18,520
Anthrax has come out of our own Fort Detrick. So we have to be always cautious. We can't live

1578
03:19:18,520 --> 03:19:24,840
our lives in fear all the time, but you'd be nuts not to pay attention to the fact that there are

1579
03:19:24,840 --> 03:19:29,160
dangers out there and there are people that want to cause harm. And I think we have to,

1580
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:36,920
it's the absence of unity in our community that threatens us the most now because we're not

1581
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:46,360
together on this. And there are people that would cheer on such actions. And

1582
03:19:47,640 --> 03:19:49,880
what kind of country have we become in that case?

1583
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:56,040
Well, I seem to keep coming to a real down conclusion.

1584
03:19:56,040 --> 03:20:03,240
I was about to say, I'm looking for an optimistic way to close this out. And I guess the only thing

1585
03:20:03,240 --> 03:20:08,600
I would say is I hope that this week people can basically pause for a moment and reflect on

1586
03:20:09,480 --> 03:20:14,760
people who lost their lives, people who made sacrifices as a result of that. And if nothing

1587
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:19,160
else, just to remember that, I mean, I'm not sure that there's something actionable I can do with

1588
03:20:19,240 --> 03:20:26,920
that other than just be grateful and at the same time be sad. So simultaneously, I think,

1589
03:20:26,920 --> 03:20:35,000
experience these two extreme emotions. It occurs to me though that tragedies often have

1590
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:46,680
surprisingly good consequences or let's say benefits for society. And if you look at

1591
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:59,800
our recent history in this country with 1918 flu, I would not say that we took advantage of that.

1592
03:20:59,800 --> 03:21:05,560
We tended to forget about it, but then came the depression and in the middle of the depression,

1593
03:21:05,560 --> 03:21:10,760
we made ourselves into a different country, stronger, more compassionate, more resilient.

1594
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:19,080
We could do that. And then World War II once again, took a challenge and transformed our country.

1595
03:21:20,440 --> 03:21:29,160
And since then, we had 9-11 and we invaded Iraq and tortured people in Guantanamo. So

1596
03:21:30,360 --> 03:21:36,280
tragedy is an opportunity. And- Do you think we squandered this one?

1597
03:21:36,280 --> 03:21:47,320
I thought we squandered 9-11 terribly. And the consequences of what we did to ourselves

1598
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:52,520
after 9-11 are greater than what was done to us. Unquestionably.

1599
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:59,720
The invasion of Iraq, the trillions of dollars we spent in Afghanistan, just all of that

1600
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:09,400
inconsequential in terms of lives lost. But we made huge mistakes, but we're capable.

1601
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:16,600
We've shown ourselves to be capable of triumphing and we've got another opportunity now.

1602
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:23,880
And I hope that we take the lessons that 9-11 have given us and pandemic and try to make

1603
03:22:23,880 --> 03:22:28,360
ourselves into that country that we once were and want to be again.

1604
03:22:30,200 --> 03:22:35,560
Lawrence, thank you so much for making a lot of time to talk about this. I know this is a book

1605
03:22:35,560 --> 03:22:41,560
you wrote 15 years ago, so I'm sure sometimes it's not even top of mind. It's back of mind,

1606
03:22:41,560 --> 03:22:45,640
given all the things you've written about since. But I appreciate you taking a trip down memory

1607
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:53,400
lane and pulling some of the cobwebs off. What I think is one of the most remarkable things

1608
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:58,520
written. Well, thank you. And I appreciate having the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners.
