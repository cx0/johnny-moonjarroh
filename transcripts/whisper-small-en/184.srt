00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello Peter.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,960
Hey Baham.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,080
How's it going?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,920
Good. What do we got going on today?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,640
We got a lot of questions around one particular topic, actually one paper.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,440
And the title of that paper is Once Weekly Semaglutide in Adults with Overweight or Obesity.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:41,200
And I don't think that a lot of people would be talking about this or asking this if the results of the paper weren't so freakin' remarkable as far as the weight reduction with that study.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,120
So a lot of questions were around this study. Can you go over the findings of the study? What are the implications? Do we need a drug for obesity?

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,640
What the heck is semaglutide? How does it compare to other drugs and diets? Et cetera, et cetera.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,400
I think people want to get more clarity around this study.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,080
Yeah, this study, did it come out earlier this year? Was this early 21?

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:17,040
Yeah. You know, obviously this is a study that those of us who spend time in this space knew a lot about and were kind of anticipating the results of this for a while.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:27,680
There are other drugs in this class, liraglutide, that about six years ago showed also very promising results.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:37,600
And basically, once this study came out, I would say many of our patients were asking about it.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:46,000
And we actually did a journal club on this particular paper, the New England Journal of Medicine paper, I think back in the spring.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
So it's great to see that a lot of people are basically kind of wanting to go deep on this.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,720
And I think as we'll get into today, you can't really go deep on this paper without doing a little bit of background on what GLP1 is.

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,800
Because of course, this drug is effectively just an analog of GLP1.

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,320
So yeah, I think we're about to go pretty deep on this topic.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,360
So let's start with GLP1s, huh?

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,600
Yeah, let's do it.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:29,280
Okay, so I guess the easiest way to start this discussion is to really do it through the lens of what is an incretin or what is the incretin effect.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, I've read that people have been aware of this phenomenon or something like it since the 1800s.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I still don't understand how that's the case, because without being able to measure an insulin response,

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm not sure how people would have suspected this, because it's at least to my perhaps naive view,

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,160
only when you can measure insulin can you understand what the incretin effect is.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:08,000
But it effectively comes down to a bit of a mismatch between how oral and intravenous glucose are processed.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,160
But let's take a step back from all of that and just make sure everybody's up to speed on insulin and glucagon.

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Because these are two hormones that you have to really understand to get what incretins are,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,600
and then by extension to appreciate what semiglutide is doing.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,600
And again, all of this is sort of prologue to make sure that we understand how semiglutide works.

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,120
So let's start with the basics.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Again, I know many of you realize this, but it's what's always worth reiterating.

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,320
So insulin is secreted by beta cells in the pancreas.

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,600
So the pancreas has two broad functions.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,520
It has an endocrine function and an exocrine function.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,520
So the exocrine function is kind of the local digestive function.

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,080
And the endocrine function is the more systemic function.

41
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,360
So the release of insulin and glucagon from beta and alpha cells respectively

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,880
fit into the endocrine portion of this.

43
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,720
And I think I could be wrong on this.

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,400
My recollection is that by mass, only 5% of the pancreas is really endocrine function,

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,680
is alpha and beta cells, that the majority of the pancreatic mass is for the exocrine,

46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,520
the local digestive function.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,480
Anyway, so these beta cells, they secrete insulin.

48
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,120
And insulin really has pretty significant effects on obviously muscle cells,

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
fat cells and liver cells.

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
And it signals all of these tissues to take up glucose.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
It also tells the liver to stop making glucose.

52
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
So again, what's the purpose of this?

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Its insulin is a signal of the fed state.

54
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
And it's particularly sensitive, of course, to carbohydrates.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,760
So it's saying when carbohydrates are abundant,

56
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,240
we need to take glucose up into cells and we need to stop making more glucose.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Because remember, the liver has many functions,

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
many functions, but one of the most important functions of the liver.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
In fact, you could argue the function with which we would die the quickest

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,680
is its ability to make glucose and put it into circulation.

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
And this is a very important thing that insulin regulates.

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
It also regulates the output of glucagon.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
So what is glucagon?

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
So glucagon is produced by alpha cells of the pancreas

65
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,520
and it increases blood glucose via hepatic glucose production,

66
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
via stimulating glycogenolysis,

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
so breaking glycogen into glucose and gluconeogenesis.

68
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,760
And it also increases lipolysis and ketone production.

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,640
So you can see how there's a bit of an antagonistic relationship between these hormones.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,160
And therefore, when one goes up, it would regulate the other.

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay, so how does all this fit into the incretin effect?

72
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Well, I think a figure says a thousand words here.

73
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,360
So Bob, let's take a look at figure one

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,440
and we'll kind of walk people through this because it is pretty interesting.

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,680
And I think if you haven't seen this before, it's a bit of a head scratcher.

76
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Absolutely. Okay. I pulled it up.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay, so what you're looking at here are three graphs.

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
Let's talk through each of them.

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,480
So the upper one shows on the x-axis as they all do time.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
So time in minutes.

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
And here on the y-axis, you're seeing plasma glucose.

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay, so this is in response to both an oral and intravenous glucose load.

83
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:52,720
So that means in the solid gray circles is the measured plasma glucose level following a glucose

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,400
load. So these are done in picomole per liter, but this translates very well to,

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,320
I think picomole per liter actually is equivalent to milligrams per deciliter.

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,800
So you're looking at normal glucose, say in the nineties,

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,720
following the ingestion of oral glucose, you see it goes up and it peaks at about 60 minutes and

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,240
then kind of returns such that by three hours, it's effectively back to baseline.

89
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,000
And the intravenous glucose dose is delivered in what's called an isoglycemic manner,

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
meaning the IV of glucose is titrated to match that dose.

91
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
Sorry, not to match the dose, to match the glycemic response.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Okay. What's interesting is when you look at the two figures below.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,360
So the first figure, which is the green figure, shows what happens to insulin under these two

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
conditions. So now again, we're sampling peripheral insulin

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,200
and in the first example, you see insulin goes up and this would be sort of what you would expect

96
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,320
from an oral glucose tolerance test. So insulin peaks at about 90 minutes, returns to baseline

97
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,960
in about three to four hours. But what's really interesting here is when you look at the insulin

98
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,880
response under the intravenous glucose administration, you see it's a fraction

99
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,240
of what is delivered or appreciated in the oral glucose administration.

100
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,680
In fact, it almost looks like a flat line. So what explains that difference? Well,

101
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,520
that difference, which is basically the shaded green area is referred to as the

102
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,560
incretin effect, which we'll talk about in a moment. So looking at the bottom graph now,

103
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,720
you see the same effect, but for glucagon. So remember glucagon is secreted by the pancreas as

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,520
well. And it acts primarily on the liver to regulate glucose output, glycogen breakdown,

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,240
and glucose production. And you can see with the oral glucose administration,

106
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,280
the attenuation of glucagon is less than with the intravenous administration. So again, that delta

107
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,160
is referred to here as the incretin effect. So why does this happen? I guess is the question, Bob,

108
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
what insights do you have on this? Thank you for listening to today's sneak peek AMA episode of
