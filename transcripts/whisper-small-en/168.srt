00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hugh, it's so awesome to have you here today. Although I do wish we were doing this in person.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've been talking about...

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Me too.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
Yeah. We've been saying, well, let's wait and do this in person. Let's wait and do this

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,560
in person. But between all that's going on, I think this is the next best thing.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,460
Yeah. I mean, the best part of in-person, I know the conversation is great, but the cooking

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,340
is off the charts. You're cooking, you and Jill combined to like a crazy good dinner.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,340
There's another whole avenue there for you.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,460
I don't know. I still think some of the meals I've had at your place have blown my mind

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,660
even more. And including the meals I haven't had. Do you remember the day I came over to

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,860
your place? I think I was on day six out of seven on a fast.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,860
Yes. Yes.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,180
And you and Deb really, really thought you were going to get me to cave and instead I

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,620
just walked around the kitchen smelling it and regretting.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,020
I respected that. But I can't really take any credit for the meals of my house. You

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,300
can take the credit, the ones that are yours. I mean, right down to sourcing the food. I'm

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,300
impressed.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,820
Yes. I know you appreciated that. Actually, I want to come back to that because there's

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,380
an interesting story about some of those meals. But this is kind of a different podcast for

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,700
us. We've talked about this a lot and we thought that what would be fun today is not just that

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,940
I'm interviewing you, but in some ways that you're interviewing me. And I think that's

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,980
in part because you're the most curious person I know. And that's evident any time you are

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,780
sitting down with anyone. I've watched you interact with so many different people, even

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,580
just in the few minutes before we were getting this podcast recording, when you were talking

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:50,700
to Nick, you're just immediately obsessed with and interested in every detail of what

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,100
another person knows and how they've come to know it and stuff like that.

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,580
And so I think in the past couple of months as we were thinking about this, it became

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,460
clear there was no way I was going to be able to get away with just interviewing you because

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,340
you were going to end up asking me a bunch of questions anyway. So we said, well, why

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,860
don't we just acknowledge that this is going to be a discussion and not an interview?

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,020
Yeah, no, it's my favorite way to do it anyway. I often in interviews, no matter what, and

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,460
I've done a lot, I always try to ask questions because I get bored of talking about myself

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:24,140
anyway. And if you think about my job, my job is human nature, like observing it. If

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,180
you're an actor and you're not curious about people, it's going to be a real struggle.

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,300
So I do want to start with this idea of, because it's actually something Olivia asked me yesterday.

37
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,500
I said, hey, Olivia, I'm talking to Hugh tomorrow, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she's

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,860
because she's very interested in music. And she said, will you ask him a question from

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,020
a researcher? She said, when did he know he was good enough that he could make it in

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,660
his chosen profession? And I said, I don't know. Let me, let me ask him that.

41
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,940
I think when, when I got cast and I got the job at the Royal National Theater in London,

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:09,740
so I'm, I'm now 28. I've studied for four years at college. You certainly don't know

43
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,700
that. I mean, the stats on college, and I went to probably one of the top two colleges

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,780
in Australia, three year full time program, the stats are maybe 5% actually make a living

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,800
from that. So there's 18 people chosen in a year. So I certainly didn't have it there.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,700
And then I came out of the gate and got quite a bit of work straight off the bat, which

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,140
was I was super lucky. Don't let's not forget, I was 26. So I needed to work. And but when

48
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,260
Trevann Nunn, I auditioned for Trevann Nunn for Sunset Boulevard in sorry, I should I

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,020
just give you some context. Sir Trevann Nunn is one of the great theater directors of all

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,100
time. And I was a huge fan from his work at the Royal Shakespeare Company, but also Les

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,140
Miserables, Nicholas Nickleby, you name it, he was just one of the greats. And, and so

52
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,020
when he came to Australia doing Sunset Boulevard, I actually didn't want to do the musical.

53
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,420
I wanted to go I was an actor who weirdly got into musicals. And I thought I'm going

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,460
to get out because I was getting pigeonholed into that world. And I, I said to the casting

55
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,740
director, listen, I don't want to be in the show. And this is the like the most presumptuous

56
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,620
thing I'm ever going to ask of you, but I would love to audition for Trevor. Like he's

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,220
my hero. But I don't want to do it. So I totally understand if you tell me to, you know, get

58
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,780
stuffed. And she said, All right, I'm just gonna put you in. So I went along and I auditioned.

59
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,460
And Trevor, I could tell it went well, it was like an amazing hour that I spent with

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,580
him. And unusually, it was in a theater. So I was there, I had this feeling of what it

61
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,060
was going to be like working with him. And I remember thinking if he offers me this,

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,940
I'm gonna do it, because I need to work with this guy. It was just so clear. And really,

63
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,180
that was the turning point when someone like Trevor, none kind of and then he took me to

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,060
London to do Oklahoma. That's when I thought, all right, that was the turning point for

65
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,660
me. And he was the one who gave me that confidence to see, okay, so you're getting work in Sydney

66
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,700
and Australia, can you make it overseas? And he was the one who gave me that.

67
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,580
It's interesting. Is it sort of like being an athlete where you, with obviously a different

68
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,140
life cycle, but where, you know, you show these glimmers of greatness early on, but you're still

69
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:31,180
constantly evolving in the craft. So for example, consider like a Tom Brady, right? You know,

70
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,020
everybody loves to talk about, oh my God, you look at him and his combine, you would have never

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:43,340
predicted what he could have done. Of course, he's the backup to Drew Bledsoe. And if Bledsoe

72
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,180
hadn't have gone injured in the 2001 season, who knows how long he would have sat on the bench.

73
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,620
But then once he got his chance, all of this preparation he'd done in advance, he was sort

74
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,380
of ready to unleash it on the NFL. Did you sort of feel that you were in this constant state of

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,340
pent up potential and you just needed an opportunity to demonstrate it or was it much more

76
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,700
incremental than that? Still is incremental. I still, I marvel at those people who have the,

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,020
I know what I have to offer. Give me a shot. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Like,

78
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,780
come on, coach. I marvel at that kind of confidence. I've always had the courage to say,

79
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,940
give me the ball, whether I felt like getting it or not. And I realized that that was essential.

80
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,820
At some point you get it. In fact, I was pretty scared of drama school. And I just had a rule.

81
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,140
I just put my hand up when they said, all right, we need someone to do the scene or we do it,

82
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,860
put my hand up. Because mainly because I didn't want to sit around for an hour and a half being

83
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,940
scared whilst watching everyone else. I just wanted to go. So if you and I were bungee jumping,

84
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,860
and I was scared, I'd be like, Peter, I'm going first. So I, but really, and I think some people

85
00:06:50,860 --> 00:07:00,460
saw that as courage, but or confidence, but it wasn't, it was more. I just wanted to make sure

86
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,740
that I didn't miss an opportunity to try and to grow. And I think for me, what happened with

87
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,420
something like Trevor Nunn, it wasn't like, ah, yeah, I'm going to be great in this or this. I

88
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:20,460
just felt like a thoroughbred running in the paddock like, ah, this just feels so good. And

89
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,580
by the way, part of my head's going, this is Trevor Nunn who's worked with

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,700
Judy Dench, Patrick, you got you name it, Ian McKellen, like the greats. And we were having

91
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,780
this kind of great sort of repartee. I could just it felt like a match. And that feeling of a match

92
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,380
just made me go, all right, yeah, I deserve to be galloping in this paddock. And hopefully that'll

93
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,420
continue. What about you? You are one of the most, this is, I'd written down some questions,

94
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,500
this is not one of them. But you're obviously one of the most successful doctors in the world.

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:08:02,300
And listen to podcasts, you know, when was the moment where you knew that you could look after

96
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,100
some of the most demanding, high achieving people on the planet?

97
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,540
You know, that's tough. I don't probably the same way that you would say it's not entirely clear.

98
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,820
I don't, I don't think that I, I don't feel like I've got to some point where yes, I can do this

99
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,620
and everything. I think there's a, there's a constant sense of am I doing enough? Am I learning

100
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,540
enough? What am I missing? What am I forgetting? What could I be doing better? How can we make this

101
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,140
process better? But what I think I can say is it was probably in the, it was probably about a

102
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,940
year ago that I stopped feeling like an imposter. So that was a big transition, right? That was a

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:53,660
big step forward, which is there was this sort of lingering feeling of what if you're, what if

104
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:00,460
you're just nowhere near as good as people think you are. And I think I'm over that now, which is

105
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,260
only a year ago. Yeah. Only a year ago to get to the point of it's okay. Nobody is perfect.

106
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,780
And don't, you know, you're not representing yourself to be all knowing. And you're not an

107
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,100
imposter. Was that the drip, drip, drip of achievement? Or was there a crystallizing moment?

108
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,300
Yeah, that was, that was a lot of therapy actually. Right. Yeah. That was learned on the couch.

109
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,620
Not, not it. So that actually became, that was a big challenge to my identity, I think. That was

110
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,060
also recognizing like how much of identity is wrapped up in what you do versus who you are.

111
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,820
And I think so part of it was like kind of releasing my identity being involved in my work.

112
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,020
Wow. Which is an ongoing struggle, right? How do you remind yourself of that? Do you have a way of

113
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,300
reminding yourself? Yeah. I think honestly like kids are probably the best part of, kids are a

114
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,700
great reminder of that, which I know we're going to talk about a lot, but I think a lot of the

115
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:12,060
things I do are, have the potential to warp my head around my identity. So exercise, you know,

116
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,980
driving a race car, shooting my bow and arrow, medicine, all of those things have the potential

117
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,420
if I'm not diligent to consume me in a way that also sort of determines my self-worth.

118
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,580
Right. But if I anchor to my eulogy and not my resume, which is sort of my, I think I've shared

119
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,380
this with you, but that's, that's kind of like my mission statement in life is make your eulogy

120
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:45,020
better than your resume. Then I just say, look, these people here, these little people, these,

121
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,900
these kids are the ones that are going to matter at my eulogy. So sometimes I'll come in the house

122
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:57,500
after shooting really poorly and I'll see my little boys running around and it's just much easier to

123
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,500
now dismiss the thoughts of how frustrating it is that I can't shoot that well today when I sort of

124
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,300
see them playing and realize, well, if I play with them, they don't even know the difference.

125
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:15,260
And I think that's true of medicine as well. Right. So brilliantly articulated. I just need

126
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,340
to drill down on you said, am I doing enough? I completely relate to this. I'm, I'm an overworker.

127
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:28,300
The job for me is what do I really want to achieve and how can I do it with less? Because I think

128
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,900
insecurity has led me to overwork and that I guess I'm asking you that question. The, am I doing

129
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,820
enough, which certainly helped get you and I to where we are today, right? Because we probably

130
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,860
did work harder than other people. We never stopped, but it's clearly not actually not a

131
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,900
disciplined recipe for wellness or happiness or being a good husband or good father. Right.

132
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,580
Um, how have you made that transition? Very, very slowly. Do you worry that you won't be good enough

133
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,620
if you don't worry about being good enough? You know, this is something I, I've spoken at length

134
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,660
with Esther Perel, who's someone you know well and come to respect greatly. Um, yeah. When I wrote out

135
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:21,740
my recovery contract a year ago, a little over a year ago, um, this was a very important part of

136
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,340
that recovery contract, which was, um, being able to on a daily basis journal about the trade-off

137
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:38,860
that you describe, which is if you start to prioritize your eulogy over your resume, you will

138
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,740
make deliberate trade-offs that may sacrifice your performance in the short run. And you have to be

139
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,860
able to accept that and you have to be able to write about that in a sort of dialectical way,

140
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,380
which is it is okay to say goodbye to an opportunity today in exchange for something

141
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,500
that you value more in the long run. Um, and it's, and it's okay to acknowledge that I think

142
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,620
was her point, right? In other words, don't just, don't just just sort of shove it under the rug and

143
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,580
say, well, I'm just, you know, I'm going to be much more focused on my family and less focused on my

144
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,180
craft and act like that doesn't matter. No, that's a very deliberate trade-off and it's okay to

145
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,900
acknowledge that that's a trade-off and it's okay to acknowledge that you might pay a price for that

146
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,100
in the short run. So how specific is the journaling? I'm not a journaler. Give me, can you give me an

147
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,940
example? What would it look like? I actually enjoy journaling a lot. I think it's one of my

148
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,700
favorite activities that augments my mental health. Um, I, you know, you and I have spoken about it,

149
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,980
but I, you know, for me, therapy is a very important part of this. I'm, I have a number

150
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:58,220
of therapists actually, and I, I'm involved in, you know, sort of, I do sort of regular psychotherapy.

151
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,540
I do something called dialectical behavioral therapy, which is something I'm really interested

152
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:10,140
in and I've become more and more fond of as a tool to help me change behaviors. Um, but in that

153
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,500
journal is sort of where a lot of thoughts go in an unprocessed way. And then in fact, one of the

154
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,820
chapters of my book, which you've read, you're one of maybe six people who's read it actually,

155
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,300
that chapter basically wrote itself because it was simply extractions from the journal. I basically

156
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:33,100
just went back to two volumes of my journals and literally just sat down one day. This was actually

157
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:40,380
at Esther's recommendation and put sticky pads in piece in pages that meant, you know, that sort of

158
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,740
took me back through the story. And then the next day literally just wrote 26,000 words basically

159
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:54,620
into that chapter out of, out of those journals. So, um, I recommend it for a lot of people. I,

160
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,620
I do think that it's a, it's a, it's a great way to process info and, um, you know, it's private.

161
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:09,260
I've never shared it with anybody. Um, so no one's read it directly. Um, but it's a, it's a place

162
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:16,460
where I can be as honest as I can be anywhere. It's a great, can I talk to you about that chapter?

163
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,940
I won't mention, I mean, it was a great privilege to read. You were the first person to read it.

164
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,860
Wow. I remember being incredibly moved by it. It was so articulate and honest,

165
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:38,620
a vulnerable, smart, and you could tell it was years of synthesizing everything. And I remember,

166
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,260
I think the first thing I told you after reading it, I think it was chapter, it said chapter 15.

167
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,820
I think it was chapter 15. That's right. I said, dude, for me, that's gotta be chapter one. I said,

168
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,100
because if I'm going to you, if I'm picking up your book, because I want to improve my life,

169
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,300
whether it be my longevity, my health, my, this, my body, yeah, I might think I want to improve

170
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,180
my blood pressure results or whatever, but actually in the end, we all just want to

171
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,300
be better humans, right? We want that eulogy to be stronger than our resume. And that was one of

172
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,940
the greatest examples of teaching that I ever heard, which came from your ability to go, I've

173
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,980
failed here, here, I've learned this, I've learned that. And I don't think I've ever heard that from

174
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:32,060
a doctor before, to be honest. And it made all the other chapters go, sure, tell me what to do about

175
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,420
blood pressure, tell me how to train, tell me how to, I'm in, because I could see where I was going.

176
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:45,100
And I just, yeah, I can't wait for people to actually read it. Even if they only read that

177
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,460
first chapter, you'll get a lot from it. Yeah. And it's so interesting to know how

178
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:58,380
it's going to shake out. Just now, that book is being, it's in the process of undergoing a major

179
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,500
revision. It's far too long. So that book, when it's submitted was 180,000 words. It needs to be

180
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,100
chopped down by a full third. So, but I've said a couple of things to the editor. And one of them is,

181
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,740
I feel strongly about this chapter staying in the book, because there was even some discussion about

182
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,100
just discarding that whole chapter, because it's so different from the rest of the book.

183
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:31,500
And as much as I'm afraid to put that chapter out there, because in some levels, it's all my mistakes,

184
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,580
right? It reflects so poorly. But I also think what you say is true, and what we'll talk about,

185
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,300
I think more is true, which is living long without living well in terms of mental health.

186
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,140
It's a form of torture in a way. And I want to obviously talk about the fountain,

187
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:59,420
which is one of my favorite movies that you are in. And I want to explore some of those themes

188
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:07,740
when we get there. Yeah. Well, I imagine, like I was thinking, when I was asking, I said, we have

189
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,940
stuff in common, but it is different for actors. I mean, in some ways, every time I do a job,

190
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,740
you're open to criticism from critics or people or bloggers, whatever, but I actually feel the

191
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,660
internal pressure from your industry, other doctors, academics is more brutal. In fact,

192
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,980
I like if I do a job, Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't write an op ed and go, you know, this guy is

193
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,860
the worst. He's like your fellow actors, my bitch about you, I'm closed doors, but you,

194
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,220
your fellow actors are not getting out there trashing you. Whereas I think that's a real thing.

195
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,940
Tell me if I'm wrong, but in the medical industry, there is, but I'm sure I think it's tougher for

196
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,620
you. I think it's tougher for you. No, you're on a much bigger stage. You're on a much bigger stage.

197
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,380
And you, I don't think in the history of, what do you, what's, what performance are you most proud

198
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:12,860
of on the screen? There's elements of the fountain. It's, I'm going to say elements. I'm super proud of

199
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:20,540
Les Mis. There was some really frightening stuff for me and elemental stuff. Logan,

200
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:30,540
because I knew that was a 17 year journey to get to that. There are moments in prisoners in,

201
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,740
moments in the prestige, the first movie I ever did, which no one has ever seen called

202
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,340
Erskineville Kings, which we shot in three weeks. First time I did a movie. I actually

203
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,500
proud of a lot of stuff in the front runner, which, you know, it didn't come and go, but

204
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,700
in quite land in the way, I guess we all hoped. It's sort of, it's moments are very rarely

205
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,460
kind of come away from a film without criticism, personal criticism.

206
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,020
That's my point, right? Is, is there's no matter how great a job you do, there's always someone

207
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,500
given the stage you're on, that's going to say something that is, represents a total lack of

208
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:27,100
understanding of what's, what actually took place. And so, in that sense, I think that,

209
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I think the criticism that a, that a, that an actor or an athlete, a professional athlete or

210
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,900
a politician, and look in our culture today, politician's a dirty word, but I got to believe

211
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,940
there are some of them that are still good. And so, you know, think about a job where a 60%

212
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,460
approval rating is amazing. Like that, if you're a politician, a 60% approval rating means you're

213
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,620
exceptional and that means 40% of people can't stand you. Speaking of approval ratings, I love

214
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,340
this statistic. You know, these Q ratings, right? Do you know that you have the highest Q rating in

215
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,860
Australia? Your Q rating, which is a measure of popularity and likability is 99%. And I think the

216
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:22,220
next person after you is 67%. Yeah. It's a, I, I, a friend of mine who runs Foxtel, which is like a

217
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:29,580
big sort of cable network in Australia. And he did come from marketing originally in PR, but

218
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,380
anyway, he rang me and he, he told me this. Why did he tell me, I think I was going to do something

219
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,380
like a commercial for something. He goes, and so the Q rating is more around if you're going to

220
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,780
endorse a product. Yeah. How much do you trust this person? Exactly. Yeah. And he rang me and he said,

221
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:55,420
for the last eight years, you've been the number one guy by such a long way. And he said, but here's

222
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,380
the thing. I know you're going to hear that. And all you're going to think is what, there's 1% who

223
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,220
don't like me. What do I have to do to get the 1%? That's exhausting. That's probably the, and I

224
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,500
laughed my head off and there's certainly an element of truth to that. Well, that's why you

225
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,820
absolutely could never go into politics. The worst. When I did the front run and people said,

226
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,980
Oh, you want to go to buy certain? No. In fact, when I, when, when I did you meet, did you spend

227
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,420
time with Gary Hart, by the way, in prep for that movie? Yeah. Yeah. I went and spent time with him.

228
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,220
And let me just, before I forget, when I asked, told my dad, I was going to go and study acting

229
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,300
and I sort of wanted his blessing. Very, my dad never gave advice about, there was, you know,

230
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,380
he always thought it's your choice. And then after I make a decision, he let me know what he thought,

231
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,860
which was super frustrating at the time. But now I think incredibly wise and disciplined.

232
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,500
But I said, I'm getting into acting. He goes, I definitely think you have the talent, but I think

233
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,540
you're too thin skinned. That was his comment to me. So I've always kept that. And actually it was

234
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,140
helpful to me. I don't read reviews. I'll get a, I'll get the temperature of the while. Someone

235
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,780
say, what's, what's the temperature here? What's the basic idea? But once I start reading,

236
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,020
particularly when you're doing stage, it gets into your head. And actually a compliment is

237
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,700
sometimes worse than a negative. The negative can fire you up. Oh yeah, I'll show them. Oh yeah,

238
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,060
really. You know, but a positive like it can, can kill you. But, but that's, so there's sort

239
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,620
of different, right? There's the review for on screen where you can't do anything about it.

240
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,140
The work is done. It's out there. Then there's the review on stage where you're going out night

241
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,820
after night after night. So do you, do you think about those types of reviews differently?

242
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,380
Totally. So I really don't look at the reviews for on, on stage. Again, I'll just try and find

243
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,780
that the thing, because I like, for example, I did a show called The Boy From Oz. It was back in 2003.

244
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,300
We did not get well reviewed. I did not read any reviews, but my feeling on opening night,

245
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,660
being on stage was like, man, this is landing. Like this connects with people. This is, I can feel,

246
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,060
it's great. So I remember we got together on the next night we were back on and we were in a circle

247
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,220
and our producers came and they did one of those, don't worry, we committed to the show. And I

248
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,380
remember looking around and going, what's going on? How bad was it? And it turned out it was not great.

249
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,460
And so in theater, particularly New York back, particularly back then, if you didn't get a review

250
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,060
from the New York Times, it could kill your show. Because a lot of the other reviewers followed

251
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:34,140
that. Most people look at the New York Times and it depends, ticket sales depend on that. So

252
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,780
movies, it's not always dependent on that. So anyway, we ended up, but I could just, I was like,

253
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,220
no, I feel this connects. I really feel it connects. And we ended up being kind of a massive hit. And

254
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,940
it did actually, I could feel people came back and back and back. One woman saw it 200 times

255
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,980
out of 400 shows that I did. It was people just, I could feel them by the end, we were like, you

256
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,500
couldn't get a ticket. So in that way, I'm kind of glad I didn't read those reviews, because I knew

257
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:12,140
no one knows better than me and all those other actors, not even the director. I know when it's

258
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:18,620
landing a bit like a comedian on stage. And you know, something is landing or not. And someone

259
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,940
could write a review and it will, but film is different. Film, you're removed from it. You're

260
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,020
not in the editing process, unless you're part of that or directing it. And you never really know

261
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,940
how it's going to land. And I do actually now think I've sort of grown up a little bit and think

262
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:42,140
it's worthwhile reading really good reviewers to see what their take is on it. But I think I was

263
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:50,140
always basically scared to read what the hell is this guy doing on the screen? Like he's not that

264
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,420
good. I don't understand it. And that something like that would just bring me to my knees. That's

265
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:02,620
what always scared me, I think. So does Deb have the same sort of relationship? Like when you

266
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,460
are doing something or when she is doing something, can you not read for each other? I mean, is it

267
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:16,540
harder to see your spouse going through something that you deem unfair? And then do you have sort

268
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,460
of an agreement that says, look, you can read these reviews, but I don't want you to share with me

269
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,660
the nitty gritty of it. You can give me the Gestalt if it's productive for me. Like how do

270
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:32,300
you navigate that? Yeah, that's exactly how it works. So I remember I did my one man show here

271
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:39,180
on Broadway and Deb came down to me. She goes, I've read them all and they're amazing. And I know

272
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,260
you don't want to read them, but you have to read this. It's in the New York Times and you need to

273
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:51,420
read it. So I read it and I was like, Deb, I don't think this is a great review. She goes,

274
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,540
what are you talking about? It's amazing. And I said, I don't think so. There was a line in there

275
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:04,460
that I remembered to this day. All Hugh Jackman asks of his audience is that you love him,

276
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:11,500
loving you, loving him. And I kind of went, what? But in my heart, I knew that was like,

277
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,780
this is kind of bullshit. He's really, he wants you to think that he's really there for you. But

278
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,300
I'm not sure he is. It stuck with me to say I'm ever going bright red reading it going,

279
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:31,020
is that am I am I anyway, and Deb was like, Oh my God, I'll never get to you again. But I kind of,

280
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,260
in a way what I didn't want to hear, I kind of, it might've been a throwaway line from the review.

281
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't know, but it's certainly, but ultimately, I think it helped me because it made me go.

282
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,740
All right. Really look at yourself. Is that the real me? Because I'm doing a one man show. It's

283
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,540
elements of my life. How much am I manipulating that to show you what the version of me I want

284
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,660
you to see? Which is, I guess what that line is about and how much of it is actually me.

285
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,740
And that's a work in progress for all of us. If I do that show now, I would say I'm more authentic

286
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:15,260
than I was 10 years ago. But it's a good question. And Deb is like a lioness. She'll just want to

287
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,460
lop someone's head off if they give me a bad review. She's very, very protective. I'm sure

288
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,820
Jill is the same for you, right? Yeah. I mean, Jill, well, this is funny. So Jill really has

289
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,300
enormous disdain for social media, which is really the place where people are going to attack you the

290
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:38,940
most. For example, recently I put out a number of podcasts that dealt with vaccines, vaccine science,

291
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,460
and a lot of the misinformation around this. And not surprisingly, you're going to get a very small

292
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:52,460
vocal minority of people who are just going to attack you over this kind of stuff and do so in

293
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:00,700
a very personal way. It's almost impossible for these people to say, this is your interesting

294
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,100
take on the science, but have you ever considered such and such? No, no, no. It's usually like,

295
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:12,620
you're in the pockets of pharma. You're an idiot. Literally, I had one person compare me to Adolph

296
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:20,140
Hitler and say that what you're doing is propagating so much lies that are going to hurt so many people

297
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:29,020
that this is like Hitler killing Jews. So when you have this type of vitriol coming at you,

298
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:38,620
Jill's view is, why do you even do this? Why in the world do you do this? Why would you ever

299
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,460
have a single account on social media that even gives people an opportunity to comment?

300
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,380
What's your answer? It's that, look, I don't really look at these things that much. Frankly,

301
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,020
it's very rare that I look at them and it's even rare that I would respond. Maybe once every

302
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,620
six months I have a lapse in judgment and I'll actually respond to someone like that trying to

303
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:10,620
clarify something. I'm O for 20 on ever changing anybody's mind who's in that stage. So you'd think

304
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,940
after the first 10 I would have learned when someone comes at you with that, that you can't talk

305
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,020
rationally with them. Joe Rogan gave me really, really great advice a few months ago after a

306
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:29,740
particularly awful attack. He said, because I said, Joe, how do you cope with this? How in the world,

307
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,980
because you're such a polarizing figure and he just said, post and ghost, post and ghost.

308
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,860
Whenever he puts something up, he never, ever, ever looks at a single comment.

309
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,460
In some ways that's our analog, I think. Yeah. But in the end, I guess you're doing it because,

310
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,180
I can't imagine, do you care about those people who are saying you're right off the table?

311
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,020
No. I mean, when someone says something so ridiculous, it doesn't phase me. I think what

312
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:09,500
does bother me though, truthfully, is that I know that a lot of the people who have really warped

313
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:17,500
views about science will suffer for those views. Science is a hard topic and I think scientists

314
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:24,140
have not always done a good job explaining it. I think that people do sometimes pay a price

315
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:30,780
for this. I think in some ways I have empathy for people who are, I think, being misled.

316
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:41,980
Obviously, I have incredible empathy for parents of kids with autism who think, this vaccine did

317
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:47,340
this to my child, even though there's not a shred of evidence to suggest that. But I understand,

318
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:55,100
of course, you want to have someone to blame for this. I think if anything, I just want to be able

319
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,780
to offer those people some hope that says, hey, you didn't do this to your child.

320
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,020
So that's part of what I think makes me a bit sad. I think that's why your book is a bit of a

321
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,300
game changer for me in that it's incredibly humanizing. I think a lot of people feel,

322
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,980
with medical stuff or with doctors, they want confidence. They want to feel like what they're

323
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,140
getting is the right answer because I don't know. I don't know. I haven't done any science. I don't

324
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,620
know. Should I take this pill or that pill? So you want the confidence. Sometimes that can come across

325
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:33,900
as arrogance, I guess, from some doctors. And then people want to question it and lump it in with some

326
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,820
kind of government conspiracy. I don't really understand that. But your book, I think, will go

327
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,580
a long way to just humanizing it and saying, hey, I can be wrong, by the way. And I've been wrong.

328
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,060
And here's how I've been wrong. And here's what I've learned from it. But I've done a lot of work

329
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:56,060
on this. And this is the way forward. I want to kind of ask you something about, I've never asked

330
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:03,180
you this before, but you live in a world of data in many ways, right? And you clearly kind of love

331
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,460
data. I think you love the puzzle of it and that. And you know, you've helped me out some things

332
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:15,420
where I can, you love solving. I want to do it this way, which has amazed me. Have you ever gone

333
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,540
against the data with your gut? Like your guts just said, he really should stand on his left foot

334
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,740
and turn around four times and there's zero data on it. Or the data might say, this is ridiculous.

335
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:34,060
Have you ever gone with your gut instead of the data? I'm sure I have at times.

336
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:46,380
This is a ridiculous example, but probably the best example of my life, choosing to marry Jill.

337
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:54,780
Right? Like if I remember, we were dating when I was in residency and

338
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:06,460
it was, I just didn't think I was, I just at the time was so focused on my work. And I just wanted

339
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:15,740
to be the best surgeon in the world. I mean, I was so maniacally driven Hugh and how she even put up

340
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,220
with me. I'll never understand like every, you know, so we're already working 110 to 120 hours

341
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:28,060
a week in this hospital. And when I would get out of the hospital, I only had two priorities,

342
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:36,140
exercise and more practicing and reading. So I would have to read, I made a commitment to read.

343
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,780
I don't remember exactly what it was, but you know, something like 15 pages a day out of surgical

344
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:50,140
textbooks. I ended up spending a few years summarizing the top shelf of my bookcase,

345
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:58,140
which was, I forget, I think it was like 17,000 words of surgical text into 150 pages. And then

346
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,140
I also would practice doing these very delicate anastomoses every night with my surgical instruments

347
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:10,380
in these models that I had built. And so when we were dating, like even before we would go out for

348
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,580
dinner, I would have to do these things and she'd be sitting there twiddling her thumbs,

349
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,660
sitting on my bed while I'd be doing these things. And then I'd even make her come over and inspect

350
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,500
that. I'd be like, you know, put the magnifying loops on and look at that. Do you think that's

351
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:31,100
perfect? Is that, you know, could that, and we, it became a joke. But, but really I was like,

352
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,300
and even she had sort of like this thought of like, you know, this is a guy who will never put

353
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,300
me first, right? He will always put his work first. And- Did she articulate that to you?

354
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:50,620
Not then, but later on. Right. This is actually a very personal story, but which I guess I'm

355
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:57,420
sharing now, but we, the week before our wedding, we really collectively had second thoughts.

356
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:05,660
And we sat outside. I remember exactly where we were and thought, maybe we shouldn't do this.

357
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,260
You know, maybe I'm just not the kind of guy who's ever going to want to be married and,

358
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:19,260
and that's that. And, and I guess you could argue that was sort of the data talking to me. The data

359
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,180
was saying, Hey, you know, surgeons have a divorce rate of, you know, X and-

360
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,780
Did you initiate this talk? Yes, I did. No, it was a hundred percent me.

361
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:44,620
And then something in my gut just overrode that. And by the end of that day, I decided that, no,

362
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,620
there's something here that I don't yet understand and it's going to be more important. And I will

363
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:55,580
say, and you know, you now know how my life has turned out. It turned out to be the most important

364
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:03,580
decision I've ever made because I don't think I'd be doing what I'm doing without Jill. In other

365
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:10,140
words, when I think of all of my, all of the, all of the, the, the difficult things that have come in

366
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:16,700
my life, having her as the base of my support has been the most important thing. And it's,

367
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,580
she is a unique person. Everybody would say that about their spouse, I suspect,

368
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:28,780
but so it's, it's, it's that she's the right person for me, right? She, she is the right person

369
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,300
for me. And that would not have been apparent from any amount of data. But I do think my gut probably

370
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:41,020
sensed that, sensed an ability for an unconditional love that probably even transcends what most

371
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:47,980
spouses could provide. Yeah. I mean, it's clear from the outside that you and me to be together.

372
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Again, that's a gut feeling you get. I actually, I have a little bit of a similar story at the

373
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:00,540
beginning of my relationship with Deb, who is down there. Deb, are you okay if I tell the story about

374
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:08,700
you at the restaurant? Remember the story of you in the restaurant early on talking to someone else

375
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,020
and I'm like, Oh, she wants to break up with me. Remember that story? Okay. You okay with that?

376
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:22,540
All right. So early, it's two or three weeks in, but I, I just had this feeling

377
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,980
two weeks in and now Deb and I met on a television series. She's the star and it is my first job. So

378
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,580
we started dating two or three months into it. But both of us, it's an unlike, you never date

379
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,540
your co-star. That's the biggest cliche. It kills the series. The whole series was about this kind

380
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:47,420
of sexual tension between, in the prison, between the psych, psychologists played by Deb and the

381
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:54,060
prisoner, me. So everything was wrong about it. Anyway, getting through that, we get together,

382
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,300
we're there and so happy and I'm falling in love. And I'm just like, this, I've never felt like this

383
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,180
before. This, I didn't really know. It could be like, I didn't know that there were human beings

384
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,860
like Deb on the planet. I didn't know. And I was super happy being single. First job out of drama

385
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,940
school, 26 happy days. And we go out two or three weeks in, never spent a night apart. We go out to

386
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:24,220
dinner. I want to say there's 14 people at the dinner. I sit down sort of on one corner and Deb

387
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,980
sits in the literal opposite corner on the other side. And I'm like, fine, you know, whatever. Like,

388
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,740
that's okay. And at one point I was telling a story and the whole table was listening to my

389
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,260
story or I can't remember what it was. But I remember looking down and Deb had her back turned

390
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,380
to me talking to someone next to her. So apart from Deb and that person, everyone's listened to me.

391
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:54,220
And the thought just came into my head or more in my gut. Oh, she's trying to rake up. She's trying

392
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,340
to rake up with me. And that stayed with me for the dinner. When we get in the car, I just knew it.

393
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:07,340
And I said, and this is not me at all. The me up until that point was, if I'm getting the data

394
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:13,420
that someone wants to break up with me, I'm out first. I'm out. Like, I'm not waiting there to

395
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:22,220
get dumped. I'm going to like, see ya. Like, so I'm there and I'm in the car. And I turned to Deb

396
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,500
and I said, you're trying to work out reasons to break up with me, aren't you? And she, I remember

397
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:35,820
she goes, yeah, yeah. I said, I get it. I said, listen, I know you're scared. Remember, it was my

398
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:43,180
first job. There was a star at the time. Her New Year's resolution was, I'm not going to date any

399
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,580
more actors and definitely none under the age of 30. Right. And I'm 26 year old actor in his first

400
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:53,500
job. Like I was her worst nightmare. And I remember these words came out of my mouth. I still to this

401
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:00,220
day doesn't, didn't feel like me. I just said, well, I understand you're scared. I get it. I guess

402
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,860
I would be too, but don't worry. I know we're going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can

403
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:12,220
feel it. So you better just get over it. And she just laughed and that was kind of it. That was

404
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:22,140
sort of the moment. Like, and you there Deb? She's not, no, I thought I heard her. Anyway, so that,

405
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:30,060
I'm forever grateful. I mean, I knew and I'm the most, you know me, I'm very indecisive. I can't

406
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:36,300
whatever lunch, have this or that or super indecisive. And somehow with Deb is one of those

407
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,180
moments where she just went, oh, this is absolutely clear. And it is the greatest relief. And when you

408
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:49,100
get that, I always say to people, just if you get that moment, just go with it because it's turned

409
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,220
out, obviously be one of the greatest blessings in my life. We just celebrated 25 years together

410
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,820
and it just gets better and better and better. And there's no way I would be here or as happy or who

411
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,900
I am today without it. Can you think we've got that in common for sure. Yeah. Do you, do you have

412
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,900
any other moments like that? I, when I grew up in Canada, there was this sports network called TSN,

413
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,380
the sports network. And every night they would show a highlight called the TSN turning point where

414
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,980
they would pick one game and there was one play and one game that totally changed the game.

415
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,980
And so I've always had in my back of my mind, this idea of like you're at the TSN turning points of

416
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,340
your life. And that was obviously one of them for you, right? That's a very important decision. Had

417
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:38,140
you fallen into your default state, which is to run totally different life. What are some other

418
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:44,380
moments that you've made enormous, maybe at the time they didn't feel like enormous decisions,

419
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,540
but they totally changed the arc of your life, whether it be personally or professionally.

420
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:57,020
Yeah. I'll tell you a little one, which is, I just want to tell you this because it's a little freaky.

421
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:04,220
And I think it goes back to, I was brought up in a very religious household. My father was converted

422
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,820
to Christianity by Billy Graham. So we lived that sort of life very much. Every holiday was church.

423
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,620
There's, and I remember praying every single night for most of my childhood through till 1516.

424
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,500
The God just tell me, make it clear to me what you want me to do. That's all I ask. I actually do

425
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:31,340
not care what it is. It could be anything, but I want to know that I'm on that path. The idea

426
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:37,180
that is in Christianity that I was taught was there is God's will. It's a narrow path. It's

427
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,980
easy to go off it. And most of the world would distract you from it, but stick with it. So

428
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,420
I went and auditioned for a drama school after I'd done a degree, majored in journalism. And

429
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,580
before I went off to do that career, I thought I'm going to audition for this drama school because

430
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:01,420
long story better. I'd spent time doing a play and just loved it. And it was clear to me. I

431
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:10,220
loved it more than I did my degree. So I went auditioned when I got in. And that's a long story.

432
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,380
I just got in. Had you acted before? Had you done any acting before?

433
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,580
Amateur. I'm only amateur. So I did amateur all through school, even a college. I was in

434
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:27,100
local community plays and I did a play at college in my last semester, which made me

435
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,140
realize I was spending way more time on the play than my thesis and everything. So I thought

436
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,100
someone's off here. I might just spend a year while I'm waiting. I'll do this course. And I found this

437
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,380
course that was in Sydney. I wanted to do a course in England, but I couldn't afford it.

438
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:51,020
So I want to do this one in Sydney and I got in and I opened up the, I remember opening up the

439
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,260
letter and it said, you're accepted. And I was so happy. And at the bottom, it said,

440
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,900
please make payable your check for the tuition of three and a half thousand dollars. Now, that's

441
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,660
not going to sound like a lot of money, but in Australia, when I was growing up, you didn't pay

442
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,740
for tertiary education. So university was free. It's now not quite like that. But I was like,

443
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,020
I hadn't even thought of it. And I just finished a degree. My dad had helped me and I was like,

444
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,340
three and a half grand. I don't have three and a half. Whatever. I screwed it up. I put it in

445
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:24,060
the trash. And so I thought, oh, well, there goes that. They're not meant to be. And it's going to

446
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,740
sound like an exaggeration. I swear to you, it's not. My grandmother had died three months before

447
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,380
and the bequest came to me the following day and a check for three and a half thousand dollars.

448
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,140
And I'm literally fishing through my trash can, which of course I never emptied anyway,

449
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:48,140
so it was there. And at that time, I wasn't as as sort of maniacally into Christianity that way,

450
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,740
but I was like, oh, that's just super clear. So that's that's sort of a TSM moment, but not

451
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,780
really of my own doing in a way. But then I at the end of that year, I was offered,

452
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:04,700
I got an audition for Neighbours, which is a soap opera, but it was like a seven o'clock at night.

453
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:13,660
Beverly Hills, 90210. Yeah. Melrose Place. It was a massive show in Australia. Huge in England. I mean,

454
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:20,140
the amount of people who come from it is as actors that you would know is extraordinary. I got offered

455
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,940
a role. It was it sort of came out of the blue. I auditioned. I got it. And all of a sudden I'm

456
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,100
like, oh my God, I've got a role. And I remember the contract is two thousand dollars a week. I'm

457
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,540
like two thousand. What am I going to do with two thousand dollars? This is unbelievable.

458
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:39,020
Two year contract. This is crazy. But I was in the middle of auditioning for a major drama school.

459
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,780
I auditioned. It went well. I got a call back. I went again. The contract hadn't come through

460
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,780
for Neighbours. So I just kept sort of auditioning and long story short, I got offered a spot. And I

461
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:57,740
had a weekend where I had to decide. And I remember I had an agent back then who was begging

462
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,140
me like, what are you doing or thinking you must what are you talking about? This is Neighbours.

463
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:09,100
This is a job. You must do it. And I went to my dad, who I as I told you before, he wasn't really

464
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:14,220
in the business of giving advice. And I said, Dad, I just don't know what to do. I see both sides.

465
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,660
I don't know what I should do. Like my agent saying, go into the thing. And I said, I don't know

466
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,140
go into the thing. And money, go off and study. You'll have money and you'll have experience.

467
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,140
You've been trying to be camera and then keep studying. And I said, but dad, I just don't trust

468
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,660
myself. Once I start working, then I'm going to do the training. And I don't feel I deserve an

469
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,820
audition at the Royal Shakespeare Company, which is where I want to work or the National Theatre.

470
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:41,260
And I don't think working on it. Anyway, I'm doing all this. And I remember he said to me,

471
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:48,860
he goes, Hugh, I can't answer that for you. That's the decision you have to make. You're 22.

472
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:58,300
And this is your choice. Right. Thanks, dad. I was like, I went off. I just put it away. Don't

473
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:06,220
think about it. By the next day, it was just clear to me that idea of I want to work at the Royal

474
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:12,060
Shakespeare Company. When am I going to get the training that makes me feel I deserve to audition

475
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:16,700
for that? A bit like you. You want to be a great surgeon. You didn't want to just, I'm going to

476
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,740
work in that little place down there. I've got the job. At least I can do that kind of work.

477
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:28,300
No, I wanted to have the opportunity to do everything. So in the end, I decided, I went

478
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:33,420
to my dad and I said, dad, I've decided to go and go to drama school and not do the job. And he goes,

479
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:40,380
oh, thank God. Oh, I'm so happy. I said, what? I said, you knew all the time. He goes, yes,

480
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:47,100
but I just, if I made the choice for you, then I would have denied you that moment of maturing

481
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:53,580
and growing. And it would have forever been dad told me. And I remember that to this day,

482
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,180
but that was one of those great TSN moments for me at turning points.

483
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:02,700
Your relationship with your dad is kind of amazing. How old were you when your mom left?

484
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,700
I was eight. So I was eight when mom left, but she had been unwell. First year and a half of my life,

485
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,140
I'd spent with my godparents. So I think mom went into hospital when I was about,

486
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,460
we postnatal depression major, when I was about three months old, she went into hospital. So I

487
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,780
was with my godparents for that period. Then I came back and I remember periods where mom would

488
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:34,140
be just going away for a week, which I guess was some kind of reset. Or maybe I actually don't

489
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,620
know if it was like an official sort of facility or rehab or just getting away. By the way, five kids.

490
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,100
Yes. And you're the fifth. You're the youngest. Yeah, I'm the youngest. So,

491
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,260
yeah, so when I was eight, she left, I don't think she ever planned. In fact, I know she didn't. She

492
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,820
told me she didn't plan to leave for good. And it just sort of did. And she wasn't in a great place.

493
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:01,980
And her mom was not well. So she went back to look after a mom in England. And so I did.

494
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:09,180
So my dad, from when I was eight, my oldest sister, I think was 15 or 16. So he brought up,

495
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,500
you know, from those ages, he brought up all of us. He's sort of an amazing man in that way.

496
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,620
It's like, if you think about what that decade must have been like,

497
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,180
I don't think he had a moment to himself for 10 years. I don't ever remember. Like,

498
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,260
there was sometimes he used to, he was an accountant at Price Waterhouse and he used to travel

499
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,660
for work. And I actually remember, now I know we travel when I had young kids, like,

500
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,020
just the first two days when you travel, when you have young kids is the greatest thing. When

501
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:48,060
you go somewhere, you want to go out and go, shut up. No, I want to go to bed at eight o'clock.

502
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,700
I want to sleep and then I want to wake up and I want to read the entire newspaper

503
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,020
from front to back or the other way around. And I want to drink coffee. I don't want to talk to

504
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:05,260
anybody. But he had an incredible, incredible time. But that decade, I in many ways, I learned many of

505
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:15,020
my, I guess, ethics, hard work from him for sure. How much do you think that your mom's departure

506
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:24,300
impacted this perfectionism and this insatiable, probable desire to sort of please people?

507
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,700
Do you feel that that was either conscious or subconscious?

508
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:38,060
Subconscious for sure. It certainly rocked my world. As you can imagine, I was eight, but

509
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,100
I remember people thinking, oh, you don't really, I remember them saying it doesn't, I'm like,

510
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:49,020
I totally understand. Like, I think we underestimate eight year olds and also I have older brothers

511
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:54,860
and sisters. So I certainly have learned after that more about the dynamics of the relationship. But

512
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,580
I was never, and I can't say this for all my siblings. I don't want to speak for them, but

513
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,660
I don't ever remember being super angry with mom. And I, on some level, I always had a kind of

514
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:16,620
connection to her and a sort of understanding that she loved me, that she had done her best.

515
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:25,980
Like on some level, I think I always felt that, but it was certainly a whole for sure. And I had a

516
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:33,260
lot of fear that got exacerbated from that. So I guess you'd call that anxiety now. I didn't,

517
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:41,980
at the time, just scared of lots of things. And I guess that unknowing, I can rationalize it now,

518
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:48,300
that that perfectionism in me is you got to work really hard to make sure people don't leave,

519
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,500
right? You've got to be your best. And it's interesting. I just finished watching that

520
00:52:53,500 --> 00:53:00,300
great documentary by Ken Burns and Lynn, is it Novik? I always get her last name.

521
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:07,740
It's called College Behind Bars, and it's about the Bard Prison Initiative. Anyway, it's an

522
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:15,020
amazing doco. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. And I actually, not lost a minute,

523
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:22,940
my first job was in a prison, playing a prisoner. It just feels to me very similar dynamic. Like

524
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:31,100
when you have some kind of abandonment or a hole, my way of cutting that was I'm going to make sure

525
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,300
that I please every, that no one's going to want to leave me behind. Like,

526
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,260
that's not going to be, I'll work, whatever you want me to do, I'll work hard, I'll do this.

527
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:47,500
In that way, I think it's really, I think it's sort of the opposite in some ways of people who

528
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,500
end up being rebellious. By the way, my next brother up was really rebellious and all of that.

529
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,220
And I was the opposite. I would do all the things my brother did, but I never wanted anyone to find

530
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:06,300
out. I just wanted to stay in the good graces of everybody. And that's how it impacted me.

531
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,860
That is such an amazing topic to explore. As you know, our mutual friend, Paul Conti,

532
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,860
who's really one of the most thoughtful people when it comes to understanding trauma.

533
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,460
And certainly your mom leaving when you're eight, if that's not trauma, I'm not sure what is.

534
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,420
But one of the things that's so interesting in talking with Paul is kind of the ways that

535
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,900
two people in the same household even could have different adaptations to the same trauma.

536
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:39,100
And so one could move one way and your brother could move another way. And yet those were both

537
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:47,740
serving very important needs to each of you. They were both adaptations that were serving you

538
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,340
and usually more productively than unproductively, which of course brings us back to kind of how we

539
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:58,700
open the discussion. At some point, those adaptations generally become counterproductive.

540
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:06,220
At some point, those adaptations catch up with you and they start to become maladaptive instead

541
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,260
of purely adaptive. And I think that's the thing that people struggle with is understanding,

542
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,660
which again is another form of dialectical synthesis, which is, hey, there was a day when

543
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:22,540
this was a really good adaptation and it sort of got me to a certain place, but now it's a little

544
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:29,980
counterproductive and that doesn't mean that I can't embrace what it's helped me do, what it's

545
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:36,700
protected me from. And yet there's still a rationale to be made for changing things and improving.

546
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,340
Well, I couldn't agree more. I actually want to ask this

547
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:49,980
to you because knowing your history in particular, I didn't know that you had that desire to be the

548
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:55,340
best surgeon in the world, but it doesn't surprise me when you did athletics or you did swims.

549
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:01,260
It wasn't a three mile swim. It was a 50 mile swim. It was like you would push yourself through

550
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:09,660
crazy limits, physical, mental, spiritual, emotional. There was that need to push, am I right?

551
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,300
Sure. Yeah.

552
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:17,580
So I've only recently read as a man think of, it's like written in 1904. It's like this big.

553
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:24,860
It's a great book and James Allen writes in that, that the growth is part of nature. It's very

554
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:32,940
natural growth and it is uncomfortable, but it is the natural state. So I think both you and I

555
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,540
went beyond that natural state in our need to be successful or to achieve or to grow.

556
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:45,020
We would go through unusual amounts of pain or sacrifice. You've done it, I would say more than

557
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:53,820
me. I think your capacity is one of almost everyone I know has been so huge. Well, now

558
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,660
I know you're more sort of measured about it, but what is that line? How would you coach your kids

559
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:06,300
about what is the line where it's actually destructive and not productive?

560
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:12,300
This is such an important topic that I struggle with a lot and I talk about a lot with my wife

561
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:20,940
because I don't know the answer, right? There are times I look back at my upbringing and my

562
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:31,580
childhood and I think, boy, I look back at the child and I feel sorry for certain things that

563
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:37,420
the child endured, but then I think, but look at what came out of that, right? Look at the resilience

564
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:44,220
that came out of that. But then I think I don't want my kids to experience some of the things I

565
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:53,980
experienced as a kid, but I also want them to have the internal drive to do things that I wonder,

566
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,580
how can that be created from a positive place? Because I do think most of my drive came from

567
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:10,140
a negative place. It's important, at least for me, to separate the part that is above the surface,

568
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:16,060
that which one sees the striving, the achievement, all of those things from that which is beneath

569
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:21,820
the surface, which is, is it coming from a place of self-love or is it coming from a place of

570
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:30,460
self-flogging? I think in my case, pretty much everything I did came from a place of self-flogging

571
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,020
and therefore I think there's really no scenario under which that's the right thing.

572
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:43,900
Right. So if the answer is, could you be sort of, so first of all, I don't think that's uniformly

573
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,500
the case. I think there are lots of people who achieve, who are doing well in whatever it is

574
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:54,620
they choose to do, who can do it in a way where they're not sort of flogging themselves to get

575
00:58:54,620 --> 00:59:01,500
there. Right. And what I want to understand better, and one of the things I'm really interested

576
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:09,260
in exploring as a parent is how do you encourage your kids to achieve the best that they can do,

577
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,580
but not from this place of beating themselves up to do it?

578
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:20,220
Totally. I remember asking my dad, Oscar, who's now 21, was maybe four or five or six, I think I

579
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,900
even was born, and I remember saying to dad, I said, dad, give me some advice. You've had five kids.

580
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,300
Like you'd watch him. We were on vacation. What am I doing? No, no, no, no, you're doing great. No,

581
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,860
that's fine. I said, come on, dad. I had to really push him. And he said, you praise the kids too much.

582
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:41,180
I'm like, oh, he goes, you know, when Oscar takes his plate off the table and puts in the dishwasher

583
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:46,700
and thank him for that. That's expected. And I, in that minute, I was like, oh, yeah,

584
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,820
all of us, my siblings have this sort of need to do more to please. And, you know,

585
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:59,260
but sometimes I go, what sort of work, you know, in some way it works. But what is that balance?

586
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:06,540
I don't, for my dad, I do praise him too much because I guess I want to focus them on,

587
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,700
I like following like the Seth Godin approach. Like I read a lot of Seth and I know you like Seth,

588
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,660
that way of following your fear, the thing that scares you, that there's some illumination in that

589
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:24,300
and having something to say and doing it for other people. And in that way, it takes care of a lot of

590
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,620
stuff. So there is a responsibility for every single person on the planet to be part of this

591
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,860
community. And I try to say that to kids, like what, what are you offering? What is it you've

592
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,460
got to offer? And it's, even if it's something you love, there's going to be days you don't want to do it.

593
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,300
But I want them to do it from a place exactly as you say of self-love.

594
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,580
Ava just went off today to do a pre-ACT test. I was just, I texted her this morning, I was mad

595
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:57,740
with myself, I didn't say it to her before she left. And I wrote this, have fun today. No test

596
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:05,980
is a reflection of you, who you really are. Just be curious and open, love you. And I'm sure she's

597
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:12,060
rolling her eyes when she read it, right? But I guess that's what I'm trying to be curious.

598
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,540
I try to say to her when she goes to school, I was like, ask challenging questions today. And she

599
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,100
was like, roll her eyes. I'm like, don't just do the good girl. I got my grade. And at the end of

600
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,940
that, I said, the world doesn't need those people. I was one of those. I was school captain of my

601
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:30,140
school and this and like that. And I always spend my homework and blah, blah, blah. But that's not

602
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,140
what the world needs. And all these people who are going to do what they love know when enough is

603
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:42,700
enough. More is not always better in terms of consuming or just achievement. Be disciplined

604
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:49,500
about doing less. All those things are what I'm trying to teach him. Speaking of kids, how much

605
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:59,420
have your kids struggled with being the son of, you know, famous people? You told me a story once

606
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:06,700
that I thought was very touching about how devastated Oscar was when he learned obviously

607
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:12,860
retrospectively that John Lennon had been killed. And I mean, first of all, it's just amazing to me

608
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:20,940
how much that troubled him. It really troubled. I would say he was eight or nine when he found it out.

609
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,700
And there were tears for, I'm going to say on and off for three months, three to six months.

610
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:33,660
There was a period where I genuinely said to Deb, I've got to step away. I think I've got to step

611
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:39,020
away. It's too much for him because he was genuinely frightened. We would go to Central

612
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:45,580
Park all the time. We would go to the story that is past the John Lennon Memorial. And he just saw

613
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:51,260
me as a famous person. And I did try to explain to him that there's different levels of fame. There

614
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:58,780
is a mania with some people, Tiger at his height or Bieber or, you know, that's never really happened

615
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:03,660
to me. John Lennon and the Beatles. That was a whole different thing. But to an eight, nine-year-old

616
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:08,700
for him, he just found it really difficult. He hated the paparazzi. He hated the attention when

617
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:15,900
he was a little kid. Like I remember he was about two. People would come up to us at a table.

618
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,820
They want to talk to me. And you know what people, they want to talk to you. So what they do is they

619
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,700
come up and go, oh, hi to the kid. Hey, look at that. You look so cute. And it's like his way in.

620
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,140
And people would come up and Oscar would just go, he would look at him and go,

621
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:40,700
and I thought that's the most honest response at this table right now. I just wanted to be, but

622
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:46,220
of course, you know, I never want to be like that with people. And sometimes people overstep. They

623
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:51,740
don't mean to. They don't know. Or sometimes as kids, but for Oscar, it was always brutal. And so

624
01:03:53,500 --> 01:04:01,740
it was on and off. And when he was a little older, it never really left in a way until he was like 16.

625
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,620
He would, if I said Oscar, I need you to, why am I going to clean your room? You got to clean your

626
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,660
room. You know, why don't you clean your room? He goes, well, why would I listen to you when you

627
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,100
won't listen to me? And I would say, what do you mean? He goes, well, you won't stop acting.

628
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:19,420
So why am I going to clean the room? You know how that important is to me. And so we really

629
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,460
sat down and had a conversation about it. And I said, I said, you don't understand. Like I didn't

630
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:30,860
ever expect to be famous. Like no one ever does. I don't think none of the actors I know, you got

631
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,140
a drama school of all he is and you hope you can pay your rent. And if you don't, you're going to

632
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,860
do something else. But it's a really rare thing, let alone be really sort of successful. That's

633
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:46,460
just a crazy thing that just sort of happened. And I said, well, he said, well, why don't you

634
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:51,180
just do theater? Like when you were just doing theater before the movie came, I understood

635
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,100
people in the theater were, you know, they would clap you and then you would have your normal life.

636
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,420
I said, you know, well, I really loved the films as well. And I said to him, it's not what I set

637
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,740
out to do. I didn't set out to be famous. I'm not trying to hurt you. You know, I understand

638
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,260
I want to be there for you. And he looked me straight in the face and he said, so if you had

639
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:18,380
your time again, would you do it differently? I was like, wow, I said, that's a really confronting

640
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:27,660
question. If I knew what was coming and what how it might impact you. I said, I would find it really

641
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:33,580
difficult. I might have done things in a different way. But I said, I probably honestly still do it,

642
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:41,660
Oscar, and not for the fame or the money. But because the people I get to work with, I pinch

643
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,980
myself every day, like I'm having the most amazing time. I'm working with incredible people.

644
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,900
So imagine there's something you love to do. And all of a sudden you get to work with other people

645
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:58,300
who you just can't believe every single day. I said, it's so fulfilling to me. I never really

646
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:04,300
got it. You just but I remember thinking that's a really brilliant question for a 12, 13 year old

647
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:08,860
to ask. It was a really difficult time. And I remember there was a period where I thought,

648
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:15,820
if I was truly loving, you know, I should just drop it. For whatever reason, it's just too much

649
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,300
for him to bear. Even now the hand has always been really balanced about it. And I'll tell you a

650
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:26,940
funny story about that. We arrived in Australia after a 24 hour flight from New York. And once

651
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,620
we got through customs, there were a lot of photographers. So the way we would handle that is

652
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,860
I would separate myself, the family would go ahead, it would, you know, split them up. And ultimately

653
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:44,700
they needed me in the photograph. So and in Australia in particular, the kids are famous because

654
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,820
Deb, Deb is very famous too. So they want the family shot. So I would just separate myself. And

655
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:54,140
a neighbor just came back and started to walk with me. I said, Oh, babe, you don't have to do that.

656
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:58,620
That's fine. I guess it's okay. I said, we're walking along and they're taking photos of us.

657
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,420
And I said, How is this for you? Like, would you prefer that it was just an account like my dad and

658
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:09,580
you never had to go through this. And she said that we just got off a first class flight on Qantas

659
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:14,540
from New York to Sydney. I can put up with this for like 40 seconds.

660
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:22,620
And I thought, you know, let's she's just sort of super, super balanced about it and kind of gets it.

661
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,580
She's just always seen the, all right, there's a bit of a trade off here. But no, I'd still

662
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:33,420
prefer to fly first class for 24 hours and put up with two minutes here, you know. Yeah. And then,

663
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,340
and then I've been lucky in the paparazzi thing just to follow up. Now, I remember we came straight

664
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:41,980
from the airport. I was super worried and we were going down there to shoot a movie. So I was there

665
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:47,820
for 12 months. They all followed us. I'd rented a place and I'm like, Oh, they know where I live.

666
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:52,620
Of course, they're going to know where I was renting. And we pulled in and I could see behind

667
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:58,780
me 15 photographers. And I thought, and Oscar was dark. He was dark. And I thought, I don't know,

668
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,580
we're back home. We've got a year here with my family, with his cousins, with everything.

669
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,620
So I just said, everyone go, okay, you guys go inside. And I said, I'm going to unpack.

670
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,180
I wasn't going to unpack. I went out of the garage and I went out onto the street and I

671
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,180
started walking towards him. You can see the cameras come up like, Oh, this is great. He's

672
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,500
going to confront us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

673
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:25,580
He's going to, this is like gold for them. That's what I want. Right. And I, one guy, Shane, I said,

674
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:30,060
Hey Shane, and he puts his camera, he's sort of like the most senior guy. I said, can I have a word?

675
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,940
He comes over. They all put their cameras down. They didn't quite know. I said, dude,

676
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:39,180
we're here for a year. I said, you could see the airport. I get, this really, really bothers

677
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:43,980
my son, which means it really, really bothers Deb and I. And I don't want to get in a situation

678
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:49,820
where we're hiding inside a house in Australia. And I said, so, but I understand you need

679
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:55,980
something. So what do you need? And he goes, we need you at the beach with your shirt off.

680
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:03,180
I said, I'll see you there Bondi tomorrow morning, 8.15. So I literally had just made a deal. I felt

681
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:08,540
I've made a deal with the devil, but I thought in the second I thought, okay, this is the lesser of

682
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:14,540
two evils, I guess. So I went down the next day and I trained with my mate Mike and I said, Mike,

683
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:18,060
I'm sorry, but I have a feeling there's going to be some photographers when we get into that.

684
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,740
And he was hilarious. He goes, awesome. Cause I've never looked better. Like

685
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:28,780
he's the same age as me completely ripped. And so he's like, bring it on. So we go out there.

686
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:34,540
It was the most uncomfortable 20 minutes of my life because there were 15 of them and they were

687
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:39,340
in the water up to their waist. Like it wasn't like we're on the beach. I'd given them this

688
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,420
permission and I was like, what have I done? What have I done? This is so embarrassing. So I have a

689
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:47,580
swim. I catch a couple of waves. I come back in, Shane just nods at me and I said, we're good. And

690
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:52,940
he goes, we're good to their word. Never saw him again for 12 months. Wow. Not with my family. Like

691
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,940
that would take me occasionally. Like if I was somewhere, I get that. That's fine. I can live

692
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:03,180
with that. And other, yeah. So that was my little deal with the devil, which worked out well. There

693
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:08,380
was, I thought some honor amongst them. And I was pretty impressed that they kept that for

694
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,700
12 months and it would end up being a great year for us. You know,

695
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:17,740
there's so many things I want to, I want to pull on that. One of them is just the amount of energy

696
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:27,020
it takes to perform and then the amount of energy it takes to not perform. Right. So, so there's,

697
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:31,100
there's a clear, you know, so to me, the stage and the screen are very different and I want to

698
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:37,420
explore them both in separate ways, but let's go back to the greatest showmen, the stage production.

699
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:42,460
Right. So when you came and stayed with us in San Diego, I guess that was two years ago, right?

700
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:51,980
Yeah. When you and Irv came and one of the things that amazed me was the whole purpose of having you

701
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:58,300
come and spend a day and a night with us was to give you a break. Right. It was like, I don't know

702
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:05,340
how many weeks or months you were into that, but it was a grueling schedule. It was hotel,

703
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:13,100
hotel, hotel, hotel, Deb and the kids are back home. It's just you and Irv, you know, I, it's

704
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:17,020
like, you can't even leave your room. You're having meals in your room. I mean, it's this,

705
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:22,220
it just, it just struck me as, you know, a very difficult experience. And we were like, look,

706
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:28,140
we want you to have a totally normal day where we're going to work out in the gym. We're going

707
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,620
to do nothing. We're going to have a home cooked meal and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But, you

708
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:37,740
know, it just happened that like my, my sister-in-law and her husband are in town, the kids are in town.

709
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:44,380
So there's like all of my kids, all of their kids, everybody's there. And like they worship you like

710
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:49,500
no other because they don't understand you're not the greatest showman. Like they actually think you

711
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:55,500
were the greatest showman. Right. And what amazed me is actually that's a movie I should have mentioned

712
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:02,860
too. Yeah. Well, I don't know why I didn't. So I couldn't believe, cause, cause our thinking was,

713
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:08,220
okay, Hugh, let's just make this, we're going to go to the gym, go have a shower, go relax. We'll

714
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:14,380
call you when dinner's ready. But you couldn't wait to jump in the pool with the kids. You played

715
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:19,580
with them for like an hour and a half while I got dinner ready. And I, and I just remember thinking,

716
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:26,060
Hugh, this is your chance to turn it off. Like you don't have to perform here. You don't have to

717
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:35,660
please these kids. This is, this is your window to not please anybody, but just relax. And yet it,

718
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,900
I just, I was amazed at how much, first of all, it didn't look like it was an obligation to you.

719
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,980
You genuinely looked like you were having fun, but I was just, I didn't know where the energy came

720
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:49,980
from. That that's really my question. Where does that energy come from? Well, it, it kind of energized

721
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:55,340
me and it surprised, it did surprise me because I was very tired. It's a game of exhaustion. I guess

722
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:01,260
the same for like during the NBA season, you're traveling in this and it's, it's managing recovery

723
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:10,460
and, and, and like you, you're really just doing your best and it's a bit monk-like. And when you

724
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,740
get a day off, cause that was a day off for me. It was a rare thing to be in the city without

725
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:21,180
traveling in a day off. You think, okay, this is the time to recharge. And when I was there,

726
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:26,140
we jumped in the pool. Like, look, if I, I definitely would have jumped in the pool with a

727
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:30,140
I love your kids and the kids were there and I would have done it for five minutes. You know what

728
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:36,620
I mean? If, and done enough to, you know, okay, the kids have spent time with me. They got to know

729
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:43,980
me a little bit. It just was energizing. It was somehow genuinely fun. First of all, the kids

730
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,980
forgot within five minutes, I was a greater show. I mean, we were just playing a game and they got

731
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:53,100
competitive and I sort of felt like a kid again. And you realize sometimes, particularly in a

732
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,380
creative field, actually, I don't know if it's creative or not, you've got to go outside your

733
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:00,780
zone a little bit. And it becomes an inspiration. I, I learned this when I was at drama school,

734
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:07,740
like my teacher goes, if you're an actor, and you didn't say yes, when someone offers you a ticket

735
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,580
to the ballet, then you're not a real actor. And I'll be like, the ballet, but I'm interacting,

736
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,260
he goes, it's another creative art form, you've got to, you don't know where the inspiration is

737
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,700
going to come from. If you're just gonna listen to the songs that you think you like and go to

738
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:23,500
the movies that you like, you're just gonna stay in that lane as an actor, like you need to mix it

739
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:30,540
up. Right. So I didn't mean to do it, but in a way, it was like, I have been on my own. Like,

740
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,780
well, I've been with the group and then you get to the stage and you've got 20,000 people and you're

741
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,660
leading the group and tell you when you get home, you just want to sleep and read. And I was just

742
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:45,580
missing my kids, my family just being silly and playing in the afternoon where you don't care about

743
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:52,300
whether you're overusing your voice or, you know, and again, great food, wine,

744
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,380
those berries. I remember awesome. What was it that you put it was a month?

745
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,780
You brought the wine though. That was the finest. That was a, that was, that was a,

746
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:06,060
it was a Penrose, right? It was a Penfolds Grains.

747
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,580
A Penfolds, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

748
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:12,060
Penfolds Grains, which I'm happy to give them a plug because it's probably one of the finest wines.

749
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:18,300
I have since been procuring it, not to the level of the bottle you bought. That was one of the

750
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:24,860
finest. Yeah. Penfolds. That's right. But anyway, so that was that. It was a joy. It was a real joy.

751
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:30,060
And by the way, couldn't you see it in it? Irv has been my, like, when I first knocked on the door

752
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:34,220
to Deb's house, Irv was over there helping a change of clocks. Like, Irv's known Deb since

753
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:38,060
November 11th. So, and it's become one of my closest friends and he ended up working with me

754
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:43,660
and still does occasionally on things. But we both went away that night just going,

755
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:49,180
I didn't realize how much I needed that. We're good friends, family barbecue, like a Sunday

756
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:54,300
afternoon, just where you let loose. You have a couple of beers, a glass of wine, good conversation.

757
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:01,260
And it was totally energizing. Yeah. It was, it was great. And of course the next night

758
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:08,860
when we came to the show, I simply couldn't have imagined what that was going to be like

759
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:18,300
because I had deliberately not read any reviews also. So I knew nothing about this. And it sounds

760
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:23,420
funny, but going into it, I literally assumed it was going to be a stage version of the movie,

761
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:30,380
not realizing that it was actually more of a stage version of your life, which included the movie.

762
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:35,740
And the opening tribute to your family immediately makes that clear. Right.

763
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:45,260
And it's so, it's so moving. It's so touching that at the end, I mean, I don't know if you remember

764
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:50,300
the email I sent you that night when we got home, but I mean, I was, I was really kind of,

765
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:59,100
it was very hard for me to all take in and how gracious you are with an audience, right. And how

766
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:06,380
much energy you give. And that's the part that again, of all the things that an actor can do,

767
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:12,140
it's that ability to be on stage night after night and put out that type of a performance.

768
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:18,300
Because how many times did you do the greatest showman on stage performance wise? 92, 92. Right.

769
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:23,740
So on average, let's assume that each person is only seeing it once. So they're not going to go

770
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:28,780
to multiple shows. So you can, you know, you can largely figure out how many people have seen that.

771
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:35,260
But for each of them, it's the only time they see it. So you're the type of person who goes out there

772
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:42,780
and every night you're making sure that they see the best version possible. Like you have to do

773
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:50,140
that 92 times. Right. Very few people live in a world where that's the case. I mean, I think

774
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:55,020
great athletes will often say that, right. This Muhammad Ali used to say that all the time, right.

775
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:01,980
Right. You know, you may never see me fight again. I want to make sure every person knows

776
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:10,060
on this night they got to see the best version of Muhammad Ali. I don't know where that energy

777
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,700
comes from actually. Because it's both, there's a physical piece to it that I can sort of understand.

778
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:19,980
Like you could be well enough conditioned and obviously you are, but there's actually an

779
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:25,820
emotional piece to that that I can't relate to. Well, first of all, thanks for saying those nice

780
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:32,060
things. And there's, I think for me, the stage in particular, whether it's an arena or the theater

781
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:40,140
is as close to the spiritual, I think my job gets. I've had moments on a soundstage where

782
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,660
you're filming something and it feels incredibly intimate and powerful and things are happening.

783
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:49,420
But you rarely get that feeling of this is a sacred space. I get it almost all the time. And

784
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:55,340
I make sure that I do everything I can every night to do that. So there's a few things,

785
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:01,900
for example, triggers for me. I never really wear aftershave, right. I just, you know, occasionally

786
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:09,820
I do it, but I usually do it on a special occasion. So for me, I always wear aftershave when I'm on

787
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:17,260
stage because just that smell makes me go, oh, oh, special night tonight. This, it's a visceral thing

788
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:23,500
to waiting in the wings before I don't look through the thing. I want to hear that sound

789
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:31,100
of the audience gathering. I actually had an idea, which I got talked out of on that tour of

790
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,980
warming up on stage as people were entering. I'm like, why do we have to have this feeling of,

791
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:46,460
oh, we're waiting for Hugh and we're in and we're waiting and the show's going and there he is.

792
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:53,180
I was like, everyone does that. What if they saw me on my foam roller and I'm out there and I just

793
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:58,220
say, hey, what if it was more like in my living room and then we're still going to do the big

794
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:02,620
opening and the lights are going to go out. But what if we just dropped all this pretense? Oh,

795
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:08,140
my God, you came to see, you know, like anyway, I got talked out of that, I think for security

796
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:15,980
reasons in the end. Did you still get, would you get nervous before each show? Yeah, yeah.

797
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:22,540
Which, you know, you mentally just go into excitement and there's definitely a buzz.

798
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:30,220
There always is for me and it comes out of that. I want this to be a special night. And for me,

799
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:37,660
when I go to the theater or to a show, like I've been to lots of concerts and doesn't matter how

800
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:43,340
good they sound or how big the production is. If I feel like this is the exact show they did in

801
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:49,340
Portland, Oregon, like I'm pretty sure this is the exact same show except Hello, Melbourne. Hello,

802
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:54,460
Sydney. That's it. I just go, oh, we're just sort of churning out the same show. It just feels,

803
01:20:55,020 --> 01:21:01,180
doesn't feel sold for me. I always want an audience member to go. I was there on the night when,

804
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:07,020
you know, that feeling of something happened that night, because it is a special thing. And I know

805
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:12,060
what it takes. And I love going to the reason I stand in the wings is because when I'm sitting

806
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:17,820
in my seat, I'm reading my playbill and I hear the hubbub and I literally get tinged. Like,

807
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,940
I'm so excited. I've always been like that since I was a kid. So clearly is where I'm meant to be.

808
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:29,740
But it certainly is important to me. And I'm actually an introvert by nature, not an extrovert,

809
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:37,100
but somehow I can feel on a stage, even like in San Diego that night, more relaxed. I would stare,

810
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:43,100
say my heartbeat is even lower apart from when I'm dancing than when I'm just on stage. I can feel

811
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:49,260
very calm and myself. I don't know where that comes from. I think that's, I don't know where

812
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:55,020
that comes from. That's just maybe that's more not made, but that I certainly had that feeling.

813
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:01,820
And did you have to train yourself to do that? Because to be an introvert and yet to be able to

814
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:07,420
be so energized by that type of an experience seems counterintuitive to me.

815
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:15,740
Yeah. Well, the reason I got into acting, why I wanted to do it, I had, I told you I was brought

816
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:23,580
up in a very religious sort of upbringing. I certainly, that idea that there is a spiritual

817
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:29,500
element to life, there is a higher purpose to life, to everything you do. The activity in the end is

818
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,860
not as important as fulfilling that. And my definition of that is far broader than what it

819
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,140
was growing up. I certainly don't believe there is a literal heaven and hell and only those people

820
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:44,300
who believe this set of beliefs are going to the heaven, everyone else. But that's what I was

821
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:50,220
told growing up. I don't believe that. I don't think it's as linear in any way. But I wanted

822
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:57,020
to get into acting for that Socrates idea of know thyself. Like in, you know, on the Delphic Oracle,

823
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:01,980
there's just two words, know thyself, that's it. Understand who you are, why you're here. And

824
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:08,060
acting for me was the way to do that. For you, it was medicine, like, and that was your path,

825
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:13,900
you know, meant to be clearly meant to be on, right? For me, it was acting. So I was always more

826
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:20,860
interested in that. I can tell you now the most spiritual moments I've had in my life have all

827
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:29,420
been on stage. It's like the moment in which everything stops, things are floating in that

828
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:35,260
feeling of timelessness, where things will be happening, you can be singing a song, but somehow

829
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:42,220
you can be acting, you feel a connection with 2000 strangers, 20,000 strangers, we're just all

830
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:47,100
of a sudden together, that feeling of consciousness, whatever that is. I've only I've had those

831
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:53,420
always on stage. In a different way, obviously, with family and close friends, you can get that

832
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,140
moment. But that certainly, that out of body experience that people talk about, that spiritual

833
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:03,500
experience, for me, has only ever happened on stage. And that's why I always go back to it. That's

834
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:12,540
always my goal. Why I was embarrassed by that line in that review, he just wants you to love

835
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:18,220
him, loving you, loving him. I'm like, no, no, that's not why I'm trying to use that. Jeez,

836
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,620
okay, that's not my higher self. That's my lower self. If it's true, I really want something deeper.

837
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:30,620
And so that's why we really on stage, and I don't think I've learned it. I think that's somehow a

838
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:36,140
mass of everything I'm trying to do in being this world of feeling completely at home and connected

839
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,060
on stage. It's where I have that spiritual meaning, I guess.

840
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:45,100
Is it different if Deb, Oscar and Eva are in the crowd?

841
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:57,020
Yes. Yes and no. Like, I really am trying to be, it's actually wonderful to me. Like when you guys

842
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:05,660
were there in San Diego, I really love it. Because I know in a way that you were seeing a different

843
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:12,780
side to me, and a real side of me. If you ever see me on stage and I walk out and I do this,

844
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:19,500
I did it at the Oscars, I did it at everything. So my, everything I do first off is I try to find

845
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:24,060
their eyes. Now my kids look down because they're just terrified I'm gonna call them out or put a

846
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:31,660
spotlight on them. I always do this to Deb, because this is where they're one of the greatest gifts

847
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:37,660
for someone who is sensitive to have a marriage with someone where you know that no matter what

848
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:43,820
happens, if I completely suck, if I die, if the career is over, if whatever happens is over,

849
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:49,740
she's there for me no matter what. So when we were together that that night of San Sebulabar,

850
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:52,300
she always says it was a real, we were already married but

851
01:25:55,260 --> 01:26:00,540
she said you could feel I'd become a star. That night, like there was a hubbub and talk

852
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,500
and she's there at interval and then after, and all I remember was coming backstage, it was

853
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:12,060
excitement, it was a big thing for me, big, my big lead role I guess in a way. And I said I just

854
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:17,660
needed to see Deb. I said a bunch of people came backstage, I said I just want to see Deb first.

855
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:21,260
And I remembered, I just held her and I said no matter what happens, you're the most important

856
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:27,900
thing to me, like anything else. And so now to sort of remind myself of that, I always put my hand

857
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:33,980
over my heart just as a signal to her to say you're the most important thing to me. And it

858
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:39,260
gives, it just really calms me down. So in that way it's different. At the Oscars it really helped

859
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:45,420
when you go out, and this is when I was hosting the Oscars, if you see Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt,

860
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:49,500
Angela, like they were all front row, front three rows, just every star that ever lived,

861
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,260
they're all looking at you like what were you thinking man, like why did you say yes it is.

862
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,980
Just to see Deb, it somehow puts that perfectionist in me, just quines it down.

863
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,660
No matter what happens, everything's going to be okay.

864
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,540
I feel like you've asked me a bunch of questions. I think it's my turn. Can I ask you a real tough

865
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:19,420
one? Can I ask you a tough one? Sure. And I actually don't ask this of anyone, but I remember

866
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:25,980
I was very moved, you asking or just explaining in your book and you said it on this, the eulogy

867
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:34,220
qualities as opposed to resume qualities. And of course as a doctor you've seen a lot of death,

868
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:38,860
you've experienced it, you I'm sure you have patients who are facing it or faced it.

869
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,340
Are you scared of death? Yourself.

870
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:55,580
So it's really funny. You haven't read the epilogue of my book, which I only wrote

871
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:05,740
maybe a couple months ago. And in the epilogue, I actually answer this question for the first time.

872
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,180
Oh, wow.

873
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:13,500
Because I don't think I understood it until very recently. I would say

874
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:22,380
I had always been afraid of death, not afraid of dying. And they're obviously different,

875
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:29,820
right? Dying is the mechanical process of going away. I think I probably have the same level of

876
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:34,940
trepidation about that. There's the uncertainty, am I going to die in a car accident? Am I going

877
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:42,060
to die this way or that way? But that's actually a far distant concern to me. I think my greatest

878
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:50,860
fear was my fear of not being here. And I think that fear took a dramatic step forward when I

879
01:28:50,860 --> 01:29:01,100
became a father. And I think the reason for that is the constant tension between what I'm doing

880
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:11,580
and what I should be doing. And therefore, I think my initial kind of obsession with this

881
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:17,020
topic of longevity, which started about 10 years ago, in some ways, although I didn't know it at

882
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:27,740
the time, was really trying to delay this thing I didn't want as much as possible, which was leaving

883
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:34,140
this planet without having done what I was supposed to do. Because deep down, I kind of

884
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:41,420
knew I was doing a bad job of it, which was not being a good enough dad, not being a good enough

885
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:48,940
husband, not being a good enough fill in the blank. So I think that through everything that

886
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:59,580
I've gone through in the last year and so I've got more confidence in the stuff that I'm doing

887
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:06,140
that I actually don't feel afraid of dying in the way I used to. Right. Yeah. In that you-

888
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:11,980
I'm coming to grips with the fact that- You can answer those questions in the affirmative.

889
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:17,500
Yeah. I'm doing- I'm a good dad, a good husband. Yeah, exactly.

890
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:22,540
Yeah, that's pretty awesome. That's a great place to be. I mean, I think if-

891
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:30,460
I was just talking to my mate yesterday about that, the idea of coming to terms with, you know,

892
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:35,260
I've done enough. There's more I want to do, but we've done enough. It takes a huge weight off.

893
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:40,060
I think for people like us, that idea of having to do more-

894
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:45,100
Let's talk about this in the context of The Fountain, right? Which is, I think,

895
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:50,620
one of the most amazing movies. I mean, obviously you and I are both just such fans of Darren.

896
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:59,260
Yeah. And I just, I think he's literally just one of the most gifted people imaginable.

897
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:03,980
Yeah. And what I like about that movie, oh, there's so many things I like about it, but

898
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:09,260
is that it's open to so many interpretations. And I actually want to hear yours because I'll share

899
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:13,500
with you mine. And I've never heard Darren's. I don't know if Darren's actually spoken about

900
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,700
what he intended it to be, and maybe he didn't. He has.

901
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,220
Has he? He has. He has.

902
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,820
Okay. Well, before you tell me, I want to tell you what I think. But obviously the theme of this

903
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:29,980
movie is immortality, right? This is a big part of it. How did you get inside that character of

904
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:36,940
Tomass, Tom, Tommy? How did that challenge you and how did it make you think about your

905
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:45,580
own mortality, if at all? Hugely. It was a, so we, 17 years ago now, Darren came to see me do The Boy

906
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:51,500
From Oz, a musical. I was playing Peter Allen and he just, he said, I've got a script for you. And I

907
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:56,940
read the script. And I was like, I read it that night because I was such a huge fan. I thought,

908
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:01,980
I don't fully understand this, but I think this is about the meaning of life. Like this is,

909
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:07,900
this is as close as I've read to, this is what it's all about. And I just said, I'd love to do it.

910
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:16,300
We spent a year working on it. Before we rolled one foot of film. I did Year of Tai Chi. We did

911
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:22,060
yoga. I had to be in this. There's a position you have to sit in. Yeah. Yeah. Took me a year to get

912
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:28,700
my hips, you know, flexible enough to be able to do the Lotus position. And also just understanding

913
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:38,540
the history of it and the mentality of it and the obsession of a man who, I'm now literally,

914
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:44,300
as I'm speaking it, I'm seeing some of the parallels with your chapter in your book, right?

915
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:54,700
He's loved for his wife who is sick and dying and he's raised to, to heal her and cure death.

916
01:32:54,700 --> 01:33:01,820
And he's obsession with that and the absolute need to cure death. When I spent a lot of time

917
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:08,860
talking to doctors, there's a lot of doctors who believe that's in some ways, theoretically possible

918
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:13,900
that we could cure every disease, which is interesting. Probably another question I want

919
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:22,700
to ask you, but I had to go further inside deeper into my own emotional reservoirs, journey.

920
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:31,740
And in many ways, it was the most lost I've ever got in a character. I'm not an obsessive person

921
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:39,180
by nature. I'm quite. I'm balanced. Even when I was partying with my mates, I'd be the guy at

922
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:43,740
three in the morning going, you know, guys diminishing returns from here. I'm out and

923
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:48,620
there, there'll be dead or be dead or midday the next day. And I was just naturally that's,

924
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:53,980
that was my thing. Or maybe I was too scared to kind of just fully go down the rabbit hole. But

925
01:33:54,460 --> 01:34:00,780
I spent, and I'm so glad you called that out, Darren, because he also became a great friend.

926
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:07,500
And this was actually in film, the closest I got to a spiritual experience, where the rolling camera

927
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:12,540
and stopping your camera, just the blur and that feeling of living, particularly when I was in the

928
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:18,380
spaceship in that bubble. There were moments where it touched on emotions for me, where an hour later

929
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,740
I was still crying, like everyone's gone to lunch and I'm

930
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:28,620
racked with sobs, like it was touching on things. And that was totally because of Darren and his

931
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:38,940
belief in the sacredness of the creative space. He's just a pure artist. And, you know, funnily

932
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:44,940
enough, all that stuff, you know, Tim was talking about the I wasca and all of that, which

933
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:50,380
I'm not sure how much I should say, but this sort of came out a lot of that. But this is way back

934
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:55,820
when, you know, Darren's always been a searcher in the

935
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:04,140
in consciousness, in the broader sense of consciousness and meaning of life, the eternal

936
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:10,780
immortality. And he's not afraid to ask those questions. I feel like I've gone off track a little

937
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:16,540
bit. Like the found out, like I feel that it was certainly the most is the only time I came home

938
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:20,540
from a movie where Deb said it took you three or four days to get your feedback on the ground.

939
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:26,300
It took me a while to get grounded again. And I remember, by the way, with Darren, I've never

940
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:36,620
really had this before, but I formed such a creative bond with him that there was all that time in the

941
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:44,460
spaceship where I was on my own and imagining in this where he's gone on to live, you know, forever.

942
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:51,340
Darren would be right next to the camera, the camera's here, and he would just be right there.

943
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:55,820
And I would ask for him. So I said, Darren, can I have you close? And just him coming there would

944
01:35:55,820 --> 01:36:03,580
open literally with my heart open. He just created a feeling on stage. And he would just

945
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:11,820
he just created a feeling on space in the space that was sacred. And in terms of what it's about,

946
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:18,460
I used to ask him all the time, I like to explain this and he goes, what do you think? So I think

947
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:25,340
expose and he goes, yeah, I said, right. But what's it about? He goes, no, I'm not going to tell you

948
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:31,740
like it doesn't matter. It's it's whatever it is for you as it is for the audience. I go, yeah,

949
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:38,540
got it. But come on. So I remember I kind of I would bug him about it all the time. And when we

950
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:45,580
went on the I would be at press conferences and a panel and he'd get asked a question and he would

951
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:51,340
start explaining the move. And I'd be like, looking down, I'm like, that's what that was about.

952
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:57,260
I was completely wrong. Like I'm literally, I'm on the complete wrong page there. And he would look

953
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:01,980
down at me and just sort of smile at me like it's okay. Because it was true for you. It is true.

954
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:09,660
I actually don't I wish I could remember exactly, but I had the whole timeline. Like everyone asks,

955
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:15,340
which is the present? So yeah, and I don't know why for me, it resonates that the present is the

956
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:23,340
present. That's the way I find it. That's the way it spoke to me was that the present was the present

957
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:32,540
and that the past and the future were sort of metaphors and were sort of spaces of sort of

958
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:38,380
emotional travel. But that what was really happening between Tommy and Isabel was actually

959
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:45,340
her physically dying in front of him and him not being able to save her and him struggling with

960
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:55,740
this loss of control and this fact that we're mortal. Yeah. I could be entirely wrong. I could

961
01:37:55,740 --> 01:38:03,580
be entirely wrong. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. And I think from memory,

962
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:08,780
Darren at the conference was saying the future is the present. But I'm actually not very

963
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:16,380
confident about it. I have to I know I'll just bug him. Yeah. He's one of the most genius

964
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:23,260
filmmakers. And by the way, so much fun. Like he's really, really fun. And a good, funny guy,

965
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:29,580
super smart, super interesting. Yeah, I love him. We catch up all the time now. And he's great.

966
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:36,300
It's so bizarre that I forgotten again, what the whole meaning is. But to me,

967
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:43,740
I sort of love the mystery of that movie. Yeah. Like the it's sort of the mystery of life. It is

968
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:49,100
whatever you, whatever we want to believe it to be. It is actually this is a question I want to ask

969
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:55,100
you. Manifestation, right? You hear all about it. Are you buying into it? Do you believe it?

970
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:02,620
I don't know. I mean, you know, I think I'm still in many ways sort of grounded to

971
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:15,900
my science, my reality. What about you? I'm a recent convert to it. You're evolving. Yeah.

972
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:22,140
I actually, my dad was always about it. Always this. And in my head, I'm like,

973
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:27,580
it just sounds nice. And I get the placebo effect if you believe something is probably going to come

974
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:32,140
true. And certainly with fears like don't hit the tree, don't hit the tree. Oh my God, the tree.

975
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:38,700
You're thinking about obsessing your head in that way. But I used to think, no, and actually

976
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:47,180
my life is a good example. He said, I used to say to people like if I had manifested when I was 23,

977
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:53,900
I wouldn't have thought up half the stuff that I've done or has happened to me. Not even a

978
01:39:53,900 --> 01:40:00,620
quarter of it. I would have had far less sort of scope to imagine what could be. So maybe I would

979
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:06,460
have eliminated my life if that was true. You know, so that's not what it's about. So it's like,

980
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:11,580
Devin, I played backgammon. We played backgammon a lot, like probably 15, 20 games a day,

981
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:17,100
really for 500 a month. Yeah. It's like our little backgammon is such a great game because

982
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:23,100
it's five minutes. Like chess is like a commitment. It's minimum 30 to an hour. You just don't really

983
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,580
often find that time, right? Backgammon, you can just go play one game, three games. Anyway,

984
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:34,860
I will, when I was first introduced the idea, I wanted to believe it because I was hearing it

985
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:40,780
from a life coach that I still see to this day. And I thought, you know what, I'm going to test

986
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:49,260
this out. I'm going to test this out and back him. And it worked. It literally worked. This whole,

987
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:55,420
I was losing my for the month by and there was no way I was going to win. I was like, all right,

988
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:01,100
this doesn't make any sense that I'm going to win this month. I have to win like 20 games to three

989
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:08,060
or something like that to win. Okay. I'm practical. Close my eyes. Believe it. Feel it. Imagine it.

990
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:13,580
Okay. Imagine your senses around it. If anyone dies is rolling into double six, the fact,

991
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:20,140
the frustration of Deb that I'm winning, winning, winning. And I won. And I'm like,

992
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:24,300
I almost didn't want to test it again because I was anyway, I'm a recent convert, but I imagine

993
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:29,900
like even if you publicly said, yeah, I'm kind of into it, you would probably get completely

994
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:36,460
destroyed. You would be professionally destroyed. But anyway, I'm just sort of,

995
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:43,420
that's why it's a very unfair question, but I do find it fascinating. And maybe for me goes back to

996
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:50,780
my biblical religious sort of upbringing, all that stuff in the Bible of you can move mountains.

997
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:57,820
And if you believe it, if you know what is prayer, what is prayer to imagination,

998
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,820
then you hear coach K famous letter to self. Have you heard that?

999
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:06,060
I haven't let it to self. No, I think it was on CBS Sunday morning. He used to do this

1000
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:12,140
thing where let it to myself. So you write a letter to your eight year old self. Listen to coach

1001
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:18,140
case and coach K would have all the players do it or no, he did. He did it. Okay. He did it for

1002
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:22,940
himself. A letter to himself when he was eight and you can Google it. Yeah. No, when he was,

1003
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:26,700
I mean, he did. Yeah, yeah. But a letter to his eight year old. So, yeah.

1004
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:31,900
And he talked about, he didn't say the word manifestation, but the power of imagination.

1005
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:38,860
He said, if there's one thing I could tell you, all those hours spent imagining that you're

1006
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:43,900
hitting the game time buzzer when you're really on your driveway out the back and you're going past

1007
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:51,100
six defenders and there you are lay up and you win the championship. And he goes, that those

1008
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:55,660
hours you spend are preparing you for the future in ways you do not yet understand.

1009
01:42:55,660 --> 01:43:01,740
But I actually think to me, that's very plausible, right? I think that that's entirely plausible

1010
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:10,060
because I think that is rehearsing a set of skills and literally my relating a set of

1011
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:18,060
channels in the body that do come into play. Right.

1012
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:25,740
Where I can't come up with a plausible explanation is where it impacts randomness

1013
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:32,380
that's out of your hands. Right. In other words, I can absolutely see how it can actually material

1014
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:38,780
alter the course of something you have control over. But I don't understand the mechanism by

1015
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:45,100
which it would go otherwise, which of course is exactly the great conundrum of how one

1016
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:52,460
reconciles religion and science. Right. Like, you know, religion makes sense to me in the sense of

1017
01:43:52,460 --> 01:44:00,860
why it exists. It exists because we had no tool to explain the natural universe until 400 years ago.

1018
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:08,300
Right. Right. Until the 17th century, there was no tool to codify

1019
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:15,260
nature. Right. So if you think about how many thousands of years our species existed

1020
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:23,580
without a framework or a tool to explain what we saw, why is it bright out? Why is it dark?

1021
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:31,500
Why are there stars? Why does anything happen? Well, if we don't have a tool that can say, well,

1022
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:36,700
there are gravitational forces and this planet is rotating this way, well, then you have to come up

1023
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:41,740
with something plausible and that something plausible becomes stories and those stories

1024
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:47,580
become the basis of religions. And that's why going back to a question you asked me a long time ago,

1025
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:55,900
I think that's why science is very difficult for people to understand. It is not remotely innate.

1026
01:44:56,700 --> 01:45:02,460
Evolution has not at all prepared us for it. We have not been selected for it. It's, you know,

1027
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:08,300
the scientific method is literally only 400 years old. The idea of controlled experiments,

1028
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:14,460
like this is a fraction of time in evolution's history, right? This is less than one, one

1029
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:22,460
thousandth of 1%. Yeah. So the likelihood that this would be innate to any of us is preposterous,

1030
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:26,300
right? Yeah. And I'm sure there are some people for whom these ideas come more naturally than

1031
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:31,500
others, but just as there are probably some people for whom acting comes more naturally than others,

1032
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:35,660
but the reality of it is if you want to be good at your craft, you've got to practice it. And

1033
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:44,060
similarly, learning to think critically is very difficult and very unnatural. We're wired to

1034
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:51,260
pattern recognize and come up with stories. Right. Absolutely. Evolution actually prepared

1035
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:56,300
us very well to do that because you were rewarded for that evolutionarily, right? Right. You know,

1036
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:02,700
if you saw, you know, Billy in your tribe. What story do you tell your kids?

1037
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:09,820
I actually love to, I love to try to explain science to them. I really do. But if they say,

1038
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:15,900
if they say, dad, is God real? Yeah, this is where my wife and I struggle a little bit. I think my

1039
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:20,860
wife likes to demure a bit more and say, well, you know, I mean, I think that's, you know, she'll say

1040
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:27,260
more like that's a bit of a mystery. I'll just say, look, there's no evidence of that, you know?

1041
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:35,980
You know, and that's, you know, I'll just, and again, that really, amazingly, I haven't been

1042
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:43,100
asked that question directly, but what I like to be able to do is kind of not get dogmatic with them

1043
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:47,820
and say, of course not, that's a stupid question, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but instead say, well,

1044
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:53,580
you know, it's an unanswerable question. Let's be honest. It's an unanswerable question. So

1045
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,820
maybe you'll find yourself being an agnostic more than an atheist.

1046
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:04,540
But let's think through how would one even go about answering that question and how would you

1047
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,540
test some of the claims that would come along with that question? You know, things like that.

1048
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:15,180
So this goes back to kind of what you said. Don't read your social media tomorrow. There's

1049
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:23,340
going to be a lot of evidence just plowing in. Yeah, exactly. So on this thought of immortality,

1050
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:32,140
let's talk a little bit about Logan because how much affection do you have for Logan? Like you've,

1051
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:37,900
he's been such a part of your life for so long. It's like, I can't imagine how you must feel for

1052
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:45,660
him because my affection for him is unbelievable, right? Like he's not even real. And yet I feel an

1053
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:50,540
affection for him the way I feel an affection for you. Now explain how that's possible, right? Like

1054
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:57,420
you're a real person. You are my friend. I have affection for you. Logan is a character and yet

1055
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:05,820
I feel for him. I weep for him. How is that possible? That's a really, that's a great question.

1056
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:10,140
I think there's something archetypal about the character. I'll go back to my personal connection

1057
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:14,940
with it, but it's a very archetypal character. It's been the basis of many, the outsider,

1058
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:22,140
the reluctant hero. He's a mixture of where we want to be. While most of us want to be,

1059
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:27,660
like that's why he's so cool and I wish I was Wolverine and marches to the beat of his own drum.

1060
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:33,100
And yet he's imperfect too, which is so important.

1061
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:41,420
Completely imperfect so we can relate in that way. I have such a, when you're acting, you have

1062
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:45,340
to fall in love with the character. You've probably heard that before. It's, but you sort of do. You

1063
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:50,060
have to, even if you're playing, you know, Macbeth, if you're playing someone who murders the king

1064
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:55,740
because he wants to become king on any level, you have this guy's a monster, right? But that's where

1065
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:01,340
Shakespeare's brilliant. You get inside his head, his ambition, and you can see it coming. You see

1066
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:05,980
failings. It goes without saying every character I've played, there's some level of love or affection,

1067
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:12,460
but with Wolverine, I've, I've felt at the beginning, like he was teaching me, it's going to sound

1068
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:22,940
weird because I'm a people pleaser and he's the opposite, right? He, he almost to his own detriment

1069
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:29,100
is an outsider. I'm desperate to be an insider. I will do whatever I need to be to be on the inside.

1070
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:34,620
And so playing someone who was the opposite was so great for me. So kind of believing and fun.

1071
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:42,380
And it was difficult. It was not a particularly happy set. I didn't feel comfortable for quite a

1072
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:47,900
long time. I didn't feel I really had the support on set.

1073
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,740
In, in just the very first one?

1074
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,260
Just the first one.

1075
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:53,260
Okay. Which was what year? Was that 2000?

1076
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,500
99. We were filming. And I was, you know, someone else was playing the role.

1077
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:01,980
Doo Gro Scott had the part and he got injured on another film and that film went over. So

1078
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:07,980
they had to recast. So I was sort of like, I got cast, they were shooting, it was their third day

1079
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:13,660
of shooting. And I was coming to do an audition on set. So I was a bit of a last minute thing.

1080
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:21,020
I could just feel a bunch of people like, we had the guy like, who's this guy? And then I just

1081
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:26,300
don't think I found my feet for a while. I was trying to, I was came from the theater. We rehearsed.

1082
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:32,140
Let's work it out together. And it just wasn't that. And, and I felt very much on the outside.

1083
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,380
And I actually thought I was going to get fired.

1084
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:43,100
Pretty reliably, I felt that I was close to getting fired. And, and the humiliation of that,

1085
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:48,540
I remember spending a weekend talking to Deb. And I was just pitching to her about this person,

1086
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:54,300
that person, you know, this situation. And she actually said to me, she goes,

1087
01:50:55,260 --> 01:51:00,380
I don't think you've done enough work. I said, what? She goes, I can, I understand why you're

1088
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:05,740
angry and probably been embarrassed and scared. But it sounds to me like you actually, you haven't

1089
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:11,740
done the work. Like, and a really, I spent all that weekend and I went, Oh, that was, that's

1090
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:18,860
another TSN moment. That's right. Yep. That's great. Great spouse from your wife. Great spouse

1091
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:23,500
to kind of hold your hand. I know. Yeah. Tell terrible you poor thing. And they shouldn't have

1092
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:28,220
done this and more there, but you got to pull your finger out and get to work.

1093
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:34,780
Yeah. And I did it. And on that Monday morning I went in and I, instead of trying to make scenes

1094
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:39,900
work, I just add like the first thing I did that day, I ad libbed everything. I ad libbed, I rewrote

1095
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:43,500
it. I did everything. I said, I'm not doing any of the dial. I was like, I just sort of took over

1096
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:46,940
in a way like I was forced to, because I felt like I was fighting for my life.

1097
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:52,060
By the way, that's something I've got. I'm a pretty nice guy. But if you back me into a corner,

1098
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:56,060
you're going to see the Wolverine in me. I definitely have that and it's appeared.

1099
01:51:57,100 --> 01:52:00,780
I've sort of got off track of it, but I just felt like I owed you a bit of an explanation

1100
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:06,700
of that first one. So I felt in a way even closer to the character because of that situation.

1101
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:13,260
Then it was clear to me that people, it was clear to me, I was getting calls from the street. You

1102
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:17,340
could just feel when things are turning around, when you're in a position, you're on set and

1103
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:21,900
they're not loving what you're doing. It's like you've got a bad smell. People just away, you're

1104
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:26,940
not getting invited to the drink after thing. You can just feel there's a jockeying for,

1105
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:33,020
don't get close. So he's a nice guy, that guy, and then you feel them coming towards you.

1106
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:38,140
And I'm getting calls. So I knew that things were turning around. I had no idea what would

1107
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:45,020
happen to the film at all. The success of it, no one knew that. That was a bit of a shock to

1108
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:52,780
everybody, I think. But over the years, my affection just got deeper and deeper. And by the way,

1109
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:56,300
people, I remember people saying to me like, oh, you're doing another one. Like, does it get boring?

1110
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:02,940
All I wanted to say was like, this character couldn't be further from me. And it's like,

1111
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:08,380
imagine you went to the gym, you got yourself into a greater shape, and then you didn't go to that

1112
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:11,500
gym for two years. And then all of a sudden said, right, we're back in the gym again. And you're

1113
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:17,820
like, oh, how do you do it again? It was always like that. And I always had this feeling from the

1114
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:23,500
first one, I was reading the Japanese saga. The first one, I'm like, this is the story we're going

1115
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:29,420
to tell. And, you know, I just didn't really have a say in it. And so by the time we got to the last

1116
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:36,140
one, where I had to say I was really adamant about what we were going to do. And I'd always felt

1117
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:41,340
like I'd let the character down a little bit, if that makes sense. There was more to the character.

1118
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:45,900
And I could easily rationalize that in an X-Men movie because you're one of, I mean, he's one of

1119
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:50,860
the more popular characters, but you're still one of 12 characters. And on any level, if you're the

1120
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:57,340
writer, you've got 120 minutes, you have 12 characters. You just don't, you may have three

1121
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:04,380
scenes for your character. And was prior to Logan, was Origins probably the one that most featured you?

1122
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:10,860
Would that be? Right. Because you were in Origins. Yeah, Origins was what, 09 Origins? Yeah, yeah. Which

1123
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:19,340
was unbelievable. Like, I mean, I've probably only seen it 51 or 52 times, but I mean, it's

1124
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:27,580
just unbelievable. I still then felt frustrated that we hadn't got to the core of who this character.

1125
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:33,420
I just really felt there was a deeper story to tell. And there was resistance for sure. Not amongst

1126
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:37,740
the key people at Fox, to be honest, you know, the key people were like, let's go for it. But then

1127
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:41,820
it was like, if we go R rated, it's probably 100 million from leaving on the table. You know,

1128
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:45,980
we've spent all these years building it. And then I said, got to call it Logan, because this is

1129
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:51,660
actually about more the human being. No, like we've spent 17 years building a brand. Yeah,

1130
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:56,620
Harley Davidson's Harley Davidson. You don't all of a sudden call the Harley Davidson Terry. Like,

1131
01:54:56,620 --> 01:55:01,900
that's a Harley. So that we need Wolverine on the post. And I said, me and Jim were like, no. And

1132
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:06,860
again, they went with it. There's a lot of bold steps. And I guess that's why I was super proud

1133
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:16,140
of it because I knew it was going to be my last one. I had. I know that and it just kills me to

1134
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:22,220
hear you say it still. I know that's true. And it upsets me so much. I didn't want to have any

1135
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:26,780
regrets about it. I didn't want to have any sort of, because then I would be doing another one.

1136
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:33,900
Probably. Because I wouldn't have to lose myself. You know, so I just came back to your original

1137
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:41,180
question. I just still pinch myself that I got to play such a great role, that I feel at peace with

1138
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:49,660
it, that I got to do it in nine different movies. That anyone who knows me from any thing just knows

1139
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:55,100
that if they knew me before I went for the audition for and I wasn't getting the part like

1140
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:01,420
it's not so it was felt in every way. It just felt like a great when Patrick

1141
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:09,580
dies. I mean, when Professor dies, of course. I mean, first of all, that is to me one of the

1142
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:16,940
most startling scenes in the movie that you just don't expect. And what's so heartbreaking about

1143
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:26,140
it is how he doesn't realize it's he thinks it's Logan. Right. And, you know, I don't

1144
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:31,580
know. How deliberate was that?

1145
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:39,340
Very. That was very deliberate. And that's where like the writers and Jim Mangold, they

1146
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:43,820
made so many decisions. I was just immediately so proud of when I watched. First of all,

1147
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:49,740
Patrick was incredible. That scene, prior to him dying, he does that monologue, which is

1148
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:55,660
admitting his failures and faults and his regrets and

1149
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:01,740
live. It's not too late for you. Live. I know. You can live like it's so beautiful,

1150
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:09,580
beautifully written, his affection for your daughter is is unbelievable. And he's basically

1151
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:17,980
trying to give you this one last chance to make it all right. And then, you know, I remember sitting

1152
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:22,540
next to Patrick Stewart and Jim Mangold, the director who I've done three movies with is one

1153
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:28,700
of my closest friends in Berlin. So we get to the Berlin Film Festival, which I wrote down on a

1154
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:35,740
sheet of papers. This is the type of movie that will premiere in Berlin, like film film. This is

1155
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:40,380
going to be seen as a film, not a superhero movie, but a film about a real character. So we're sitting

1156
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:48,940
there in that scene where Jim just directed this. So, well, obviously it wasn't there because

1157
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:54,780
my character is in the grave spoiler, all of it, if you haven't seen, but where she walks up,

1158
01:57:54,780 --> 01:58:00,860
all the other kids walk off, they've done the funeral. She walks up to the ex, the two sticks

1159
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:05,900
that have been put in the thing. She just takes it out, tips it over onto its side into an ex.

1160
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:09,260
I could get emotional, I could cry now just thinking about it,

1161
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:17,020
weeping. It was so, because in many ways, going back to telling you about my upbringing, that idea of

1162
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:21,820
this is how you were taught, I was taught when I was a kid, this is religion. And at some point,

1163
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:28,300
you have to become your own man. And Wolverine was always his own man. But actually,

1164
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:35,660
he wasn't really an insider. In the end, he was an X-Men. Like he really was the epitome of what

1165
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:42,060
I thought the poetry in that moment, and we didn't know if we were going to kill Wolverine or not.

1166
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:48,380
When we started it, of course it was a discussion. And we all said, unless we earn that moment,

1167
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:53,660
then it's a stunt. It's just like, oh, it's one in and we'll piss people off. If we get a ride,

1168
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:59,900
it was that feeling that I had in that cinema, we were just, and I remembered just grabbing Jim's,

1169
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:04,620
like put my hands on their legs and I turned to Patrick and he was just crying. And you know,

1170
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:10,620
we realized it was 17 years and such a gift in our business where you go in, you meet people,

1171
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:16,220
you become super close three months later. See you later. It's a really odd kind of business in that

1172
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:24,780
way. I don't know if you remember this, actually it was at Darren's birthday, Darren's 50th birthday,

1173
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:30,620
you and I were sitting next to each other and we were talking about the last scene of Logan because

1174
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:38,540
I had recently rewatched it. And I sheepishly admitted, I was like, you're not going to believe

1175
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:44,700
this brother. But the first time I watched this, when Logan says, this is what it feels like,

1176
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:53,260
I thought he was talking about death. Right. And then of course the second time I actually

1177
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:57,580
understood what he meant. Has anyone else ever said that to you? Has anyone ever?

1178
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:04,620
Oh, all the time. Really? All the time. That's Jim wrote that line. I think it was Jim. I don't

1179
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:09,900
think it was Scott, but I think it was, I'm pretty sure it was Jim. When I read that, I was just like,

1180
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:17,980
I thought the same thing because the ultimate, when I first read it, I thought, oh, the person

1181
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:25,980
who's immortal, effectively immortal, and yet unhappy with life, like,

1182
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:33,260
this must speak to you as someone who deals with longevity. What's the point of being around

1183
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:38,140
forever if you've got so much pain and lack of understanding where it comes from? That moment,

1184
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:42,700
oh, this is what it feels like. In the whole movie, you get a feeling of someone who almost

1185
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:47,100
wants it to come like, please take me out of my misery, please, please, please. But then

1186
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,540
it wasn't until we were doing it and playing the scene. Oh, no, it was before that. When we

1187
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:56,700
talked about it, I realized there's such a dual meaning to this. People are going to take it in

1188
02:00:56,700 --> 02:01:04,220
different ways. Again, that's what Jim Mangle always says to me. He goes, don't, in a movie,

1189
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:09,740
don't tell me one plus one equals two. That's science. Tell me one, in science, I want to know

1190
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:13,660
one plus one equals two. But in art, tell me one plus one equals three, and then spend the

1191
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:20,860
movie proving it to me. It's like, make me go, and an end line like that is just such a great example

1192
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:27,980
of one plus one equals three. It can work on both things. I think Aronofsky had knows that fully.

1193
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:31,020
That was a great birthday party, by the way, wasn't it?

1194
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:34,620
I think it's literally the best birthday party I've ever been to in my life.

1195
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:42,380
I'm with you. Can I ask you something? I feel weird. I do want to ask you this.

1196
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:47,340
It's more trivial than some of the subjects we've been talking about. But when I was training for

1197
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:52,060
Wolverine, at one point, my trainer said, hey, we need to mix it up. I'm going to bring in this guy,

1198
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:59,420
Scott, who's a professional bodybuilder and natural, but natural bodybuilder. And we're just

1199
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:03,980
going to train with him for a week. And we might just pick up some tips. So training with him at

1200
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:12,060
the gym. This was when I did actually was X-Men origins. I was in Sydney. Someone comes up to him

1201
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:18,620
every 10 minutes at the gym and wants advice. Right. No matter what he's doing. And I never

1202
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:23,900
forget the first like he was on the lap pull down and he's doing it. By the way, a great thing I

1203
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:29,580
learned from him that I've used to this day. I seem to be in his shape. You have to just smash it.

1204
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:37,340
He starts super light on everything like it's fun and builds up. He doesn't do one warm-up set

1205
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:44,060
and three smashing it. Like I said, by the time you're doing your third, fourth set, you want it.

1206
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:47,580
You actually really want to lift. Your body's got used to it. It was such a great tip.

1207
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:52,620
Go light. Like it shouldn't feel like a chore all the time. Like, oh yeah, I can do this pull.

1208
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:57,980
This is easy. A little more, no problem. And then you just want to go in and rip it. So he's on the

1209
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:05,660
lap pull down and he could feel someone walking up asking about to ask him, hey, dude, how do I get

1210
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:11,340
in the shape? Right? His whole life. That's what he is. And without turning yours, don't eat carbs

1211
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:17,900
after three in the afternoon. The guy goes, oh, he didn't even ask his question. He walked away.

1212
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:22,780
I said, dude, how often do you guys literally in tons of work, someone was going to ask me that. So

1213
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:32,060
you in your job as a longevity doctor must get asked every five seconds, what's the one thing,

1214
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:37,180
what's the thing you say on the lap pull down to that is the most important thing to change your

1215
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:40,860
life? Oh, no, he said one more thing. He goes, donate carbs after three, you'll lose three to

1216
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:52,700
five kilos in the first month. That was it. Oh gosh. Look, I think there are glib answers to

1217
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:58,300
that question and I think there are serious answers to that question. I think, and by glib,

1218
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:03,340
I just mean universal. Right. So what's the universal truth in longevity? Gosh.

1219
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:11,980
If you're willing to exercise nearly every day, like you're going to end up in a good place.

1220
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:15,180
You know, exercise is a very potent,

1221
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:24,220
zero protective agent, right? That's a very non sexy way to describe exercise, but it's potent,

1222
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:30,380
right? So it's, it's, it really has a strong impact. It's diffuse. It acts in many different

1223
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:37,420
parts of the body and it's very zero protective, right? It really slows down aging. And, you know,

1224
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:42,700
if you want evidence of this, just examine the opposite. Just look at what happens to people

1225
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:48,780
when they are sedentary. Um, you know, you look at someone who, especially someone who's, you know,

1226
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:56,380
our age, who gets laid up in a hospital bed for a week and you look at how far it sets them back,

1227
02:04:56,380 --> 02:05:01,580
you know, if you, if you're laid up for a week in the hospital, it could take you six months to

1228
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:07,340
recover from that physically. So, so you very quickly understand the potency of exercise. And,

1229
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:12,460
and so I would just say, don't underestimate the power of exercise, which of course then gets into

1230
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:16,620
all the technicalities. Well, how much of it should be zone two, how much of it should be zone five,

1231
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:21,100
how much strength, how much stability, and of course the devils and the details there. And then

1232
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:25,020
I think the other thing I would say is something we've been talking about all along, which is

1233
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:32,140
don't underestimate the power of relationships because ultimately they are probably going to

1234
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:38,300
play a greater role in the quality of your life than the length of your life. But that matters more.

1235
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:44,060
What's, what's the long, you know, the, the definition of, I think the definition of hell

1236
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:50,940
would be infinite length and misery. Right. So, you know, what can you do?

1237
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:57,180
I love that. I love that you said that about relationships. I, I, I, my best mate started a

1238
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:03,980
charity Gus, he started a charity based on a doco he did on male suicide. And it was incredibly

1239
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:10,700
successful, but his idea in this charity, it's called Gotcha for Life, the number four, but it's

1240
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:19,020
gotcha is the idea that never worry alone, like make sure that you have someone and hopefully

1241
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:25,900
more than one where you can say anything, everything. And he goes, and by the way, like I have that in

1242
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:30,140
my marriage, you have that in your marriage. A lot of people don't, but as long as you've got someone,

1243
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:37,580
a mate that you can, that actually that loneliness and the inability to unload stuff, you need to

1244
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:45,740
we as humans need to unload it. I think that's really vital from my medical standpoint.

1245
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:54,460
Look, this is an example of things that things where my thinking has evolved so much, right? I,

1246
02:06:54,460 --> 02:07:03,500
I think that, you know, 10 years ago when I thought about this, I just didn't find this to be this,

1247
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:09,820
this meaning the sort of emotional side of this to be a particularly relevant piece of the puzzle.

1248
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:18,780
And, and I've evolved obviously, as you know, to the complete opposite end of that spectrum.

1249
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:24,380
And now, you know, it's one of those things that's often the case. Once you get to the other island,

1250
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:29,900
you look back and you think, what was I thinking on that other island? You know, because you just,

1251
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:36,460
you can't appreciate what you didn't know at the time. And I think that

1252
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:47,500
there's something about giving to someone else that, and sacrificing that, I think David Foster

1253
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:54,620
Wallace spoke about so eloquently in his commencement address. Yeah, this is water. And,

1254
02:07:54,620 --> 02:08:00,380
and the way he, the way he talks about these, the myriad petty ways in which we can sacrifice for

1255
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:06,220
other people. And that's, you know, that's, that's a big part of what it's about. And I think that

1256
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:10,940
any parent recognizes that that on, you know, on some days it can be really tough to be a parent,

1257
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:17,900
but, you know, you're making these sacrifices for your kids, you know, it's not always fun to be a

1258
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:23,820
parent, right? It's not always fun to be married. It's not always fun to do all of these things,

1259
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:30,780
but I think somehow finding the beauty in those difficult moments, you know, when your kids having

1260
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:36,700
a meltdown or when your spouse is really pissed at you and you think it's unjustified, but you bite

1261
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:42,300
your tongue, like there is value in that. Totally. And I think there is joy in that.

1262
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:48,940
Yeah. My brother, my oldest brother, Ian, when my, when my, he's had four kids, when my,

1263
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:57,340
when Oscar was born, he rang me and he said, I'd, hey man, everyone's going to tell you this is the

1264
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:00,860
greatest thing that ever happened, send your life. You're going to be amazing. And it's the best time

1265
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:05,340
your life. And he goes, here's the truth. Some of that is true, but it's also, you're going to be so

1266
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:11,420
tired and angry and frustrated. And a lot of it's going to be really annoying at times. And it's

1267
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:17,020
going to be inconvenient. He goes, it's okay, man. When those moments happened, just give me a call.

1268
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:21,900
It's okay. It was so relieving because of course you get three hours sleep at night,

1269
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:26,780
four hours sleep at night. You're going to be shitty, you know, at times. And of course it is

1270
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:34,540
great too, but parenting is, I tell you, I've learned some, the mirror gets, you know,

1271
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:40,460
shown up to you about who you are so quickly as a parent. Yeah. Very nakedly.

1272
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:52,700
So how do you handle aging in your field, right? You're in a field where you are forever going to

1273
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:59,420
be judged by your appearance. I think the field is harsher on your female counterparts than you.

1274
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:00,700
For sure. For sure.

1275
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:07,500
But nevertheless, how do you think about this process and how do you balance, because, you know,

1276
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:11,820
you're becoming better and better in your craft and you're getting older. And at some point,

1277
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:16,620
I mean, there are, you know, there's, there's the Clint Eastwoods of the world where, I mean,

1278
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:23,740
they just seem to never be able, they seem to transition into that age, like as they go.

1279
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:33,260
Totally. Yeah. I embrace it. Like I embrace it. Certainly 95%. You know, sometimes you go, wow,

1280
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:38,060
or you'll see a photo of had, you know, where you looked and you go, wow, those bags. Wow. Like,

1281
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:45,260
you look like shit and all that. But in general, I embrace it. I, he'll kill me for saying this, but

1282
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:52,460
the guy who did my skin cancer, my basal cell, I had a bunch on my nose. So every time I go in

1283
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:57,340
over the years to do something on my nose and they're doing corrective surgeries, like,

1284
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:01,420
you know, I could just do a little, this bag, it's easy. I could just fix that. Or we can do that.

1285
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:09,020
I'm like, no, I did. And or, or there's, he goes, I could take some fat from somewhere and I can

1286
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:13,580
pump it into, into here. And then you won't get that scar that did it. Because when you look from

1287
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:20,700
the side, I said, no. And he goes, it's my wall. And I said, it's my nose. I don't have that. I,

1288
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:26,220
I kind of have that feeling of embracing it. And I actually enjoy it.

1289
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:36,620
If I'm really honest, part of that, I wanted to stay a movie star. I've got to do that. I've got to

1290
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:45,820
be, is exhausting to me. It feels pointless to me. And I'm happy not to embrace it. You know what

1291
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:54,780
I mean? It's like, I've never really loved that side of it. And it's exhausting, relieving. My

1292
02:11:54,780 --> 02:12:00,380
real North star, I look to is Newman. Paul Newman. Everything the way he did his career,

1293
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:05,900
the Newman zone, the way he just kept his passions going. And he did a lot for the actors union

1294
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:10,460
behind the scenes. He did a lot on nuclear disarmament behind the scenes. Like, yeah,

1295
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:13,020
that's, that's the way you're doing. Did you ever get to meet him?

1296
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:20,220
Once, once it was awesome. I was, it was awesome. He was, he was fading at the time.

1297
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:26,940
He was super skinny and clearly not well, but yeah, he's my hero. So thanks for today, man.

1298
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:35,260
You're a hero to many. And you've played many heroes. And I thank you so much for your openness.

1299
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:41,260
I know it's, it's a hard thing for an actor to do because you have this contract with us that says,

1300
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:48,540
as long as we don't know you, we can believe you. Right. It's true. But, but as you can tell from

1301
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:52,540
me, I'm, I want to answer the questions. That's why I'm doing it. So you're right. It's, it's a bit

1302
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:58,140
of a tightrope, but you helped me walk out better than, better than almost anyone else. And I, you

1303
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:03,740
know, I listen, we're friends, but I also listen to your podcast. And I think what you're doing is

1304
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:09,500
really helping. It's helped me a lot. Thank you for that. I love you, man. Give my love to the kids.

1305
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:15,420
Give my love to Jill. And thanks to the two Knicks behind the scenes. They're doing all the work.

1306
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:21,020
Love you, man. I love you too. And please give my best to dev and the kids and look forward to

1307
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,740
seeing you in person, hopefully in the next three months. Awesome, man. All right. See you.
