00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,880
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,400
you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,080
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,080
more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,520
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,960
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Sasha Cohen. For those of you

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,880
who may not recognize her name, she's an American figure skating legend. In fact, the last female,

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,280
I believe, to win a medal in figure skating. She was a silver medalist in the 2006 Olympics, and

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,840
I don't waste any time in this episode going straight to that moment because on some levels

49
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,640
it is one of the most remarkable parts of her story, frankly. And I don't want to spoil the

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,800
story, but needless to say, if you only watch one video from all of the videos or anything we talk

51
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,200
about in this talk, that's the one you want to see. And I actually, frankly, this might be one

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,840
of those times where I recommend you, before you even listen to the podcast, you go to the video

53
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,920
of the final for the long program in the 2006 Olympics and you watch this six-minute video,

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,440
seven-minute video, whatever it is, obviously it's linked to in the show notes, but for those of you

55
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,920
who aren't subscribers and don't get the show notes, I still want you to be able to go see this video

56
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,840
because that's exactly where I go to at the outset of this discussion. We then work our way

57
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,280
a little bit backwards and talk about her life growing up and how she was able to channel and

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,440
focus all of her insecurity into becoming such a great skater, but much more importantly, we talk

59
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,680
about this life post-skating for her. And I think in many ways, Sasha is kind of a remarkable example

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,840
of how a person can remake themselves from being completely focused on one thing and having their

61
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,360
entire identity tied up in one thing and moving past it. And again, I think what comes across here

62
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,920
is the just maturity and wisdom of a person who is remarkably adept at understanding the

63
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,240
hollowness, the shallowness of achievements. For me, certainly this is something that just really

64
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,400
resonated to be able to hear her talk about this. So even though, again, we're talking to a former

65
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,280
world champion Olympian superstar, there's a lot in this episode for normal people like us who

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,440
aren't that way. And again, we explore the depths of depression. We talk about the statistics of

67
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,400
how many Olympians they want to suffer depression, and I talk about her involvement in a project

68
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,320
that's meant to bring a lot of awareness to this. We talk about a lot of other things as well.

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,240
So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Sasha Cohen.

70
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,280
Sasha, thanks so much for coming over. Thank you for having me. I'm really excited for this.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,520
There's so much I want to talk with you about. And this, as I was saying even before, interviewing

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,280
somebody, you get to know a lot more about them than you may have known before. It sort of

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,520
accelerates your learning about a person in the weeks leading up to the interview. I mean, if

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,840
you're sort of doing your homework, which you obviously want to be doing, you're learning so

75
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,520
much more. And I think I forgot, you know, 2006 is a long time ago. On some levels, it doesn't seem

76
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,360
like that's not long ago. It's like, guys, 2006, like I sort of remember that. But, but you realize,

77
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:12,040
oh, that's 13 years ago. And to go back and watch the footage of the Olympics, I sort of forgot a

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,400
few things because I sort of remember watching that at the time. I mean, as every Olympic athlete

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,320
knows, that's the time when the rest of the country completely stops what they're doing to focus on

80
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:31,960
sports that aren't football, basketball, baseball, hockey. But I was really blown away by what has to

81
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,680
be one of the more challenging and yet remarkable achievements of your athletic career. And I say

82
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,880
that because it's a small footnote to what I think will be the broader arc of your life, which we'll

83
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,560
talk about. But I wanted for a moment, go right there and then back up and give people some context

84
00:07:51,560 --> 00:08:00,120
about the sport of figure skating. But take us to the 2006 Olympics, you were favored. What was the

85
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,560
expectation for you after being a 17 year old almost making the podium? I think you were fourth

86
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,640
in 2002, correct? Correct. It was my second games. And I was one of the favorites going in. There was

87
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,760
strong competitors also from Japan and from Russia. And it's a moment in your life where it's

88
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,600
rare as a figure skater or a gymnast or in certain sports to go to one Olympics, let alone two. And so

89
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,960
you know that most likely this will be your last games. And figure skating, the ladies competition

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:39,000
is at the very, very end of the Olympics. And so the whole two weeks before most everyone is gone,

91
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,120
the Olympic village has turned into just a party scene. And so. Sodom and Gomorrah. Exactly. So

92
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,840
generally the figure skaters are not staying in the village. We're isolated, perhaps we're missing

93
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,440
opening ceremonies to really focus in and hone on this one moment that we've spent our whole life

94
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,800
basically since we were toddlers training for. It was difficult because six months before I was

95
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,680
flying high, I was in the best physical shape, mental shape. I was very, very strong. And then

96
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,920
over that winter, I had a series of injuries, equipment problems. And it was really tough

97
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,000
because I was going into the Olympics, not feeling prepared. And I've said that it feels like you have

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,240
to walk a pirate's plank. And you know that you kind of have to just jump into the sharks and you

99
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,480
don't feel prepared or equipped to handle it, but the show must go on and you have to keep

100
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,680
putting one foot in front of the other. So that was kind of the mental state that I was in, even

101
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,400
if you're in the best shape of your life, it's still the enormity of the games and this, these

102
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,960
few minutes you have to fulfill a lifelong dream is just immense pressure. Now, is that different

103
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,800
from the pressure you feel in 2002 when nobody knows you? And it's amazing that you're there.

104
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I mean, how much of what you just said is not just the fact that you're going to the Olympics,

105
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,440
but that you're going to the Olympics as a favorite? I think definitely going in as a favorite. You

106
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,440
just, so a 17 year old brain and a 21 year old brain are a little bit different. And my first

107
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,200
Olympics was actually my first huge international competition. I'd never been to a world championship.

108
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,160
So I was thrilled to make the team. I was competing on my home soil in Utah and Salt Lake City.

109
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,680
And I went to opening ceremonies and I was just like a kid in a candy shop. And it was just

110
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,600
incredible how Salt Lake was transformed. So it was pretty magical. And of course,

111
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,080
I was nervous in these moments, but the spotlight was really on, on these favorites and that were

112
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,520
duking it out. And I was disappointed that I, you know, it was close to a medal, but didn't

113
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,600
medal in Salt Lake. But really when it came to Italy, I felt in 2006, I felt all eyes were on me.

114
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,240
And this is, this is the moment that I've been waiting for to redeem myself from four years back.

115
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,880
And I'm not at my best. I'm not ready. As an athlete, you're generally homeschooled and you're

116
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
analyzing videos and you're training and you're spending your whole life planning like four years

117
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,040
out. And so you're always analyzing every little thing you might've done wrong or how you could do

118
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,440
something better. And I couldn't help thinking like, how am I here about to compete in the Olympics?

119
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,440
And I'm not prepared. What did I do wrong? And I think something that I've learned a lot about

120
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,520
myself since then is that we can't control everything. And as athletes, we think we can,

121
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,200
that we can control and prevent any injury that might arise or any equipment problems. And,

122
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,520
and it's very hard to admit to yourself that you can't control everything.

123
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,120
Cause that's what you spent your whole life trying to do. That's what's up to you.

124
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Does anybody else in your really inner circle, and I'm guessing at this point, your mom and your

125
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,320
coach are probably the two closest people to you when it comes to what you could be feeling.

126
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Is that a fair statement?

127
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,240
Yes. Mainly my mom, you know, she was the one that, that came with me in all my competitions,

128
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,880
took me to the rink and physical therapy and off ice since I was seven years old. So we really

129
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,480
bonded and she was, she was probably the only one I was super vulnerable to, to the outside world.

130
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,400
It was, I'm fine. I've been training. I'm prepared. You don't want to admit weakness. It's like,

131
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,080
everyone's a shark and they can smell blood. And so you're always putting on this brave face and,

132
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
and it's kind of a fake it till you make it. Because if you show fear, you give others

133
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,240
confidence and you undermine yourself.

134
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,960
When did the Olympic trials take place for figure skating?

135
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,600
They're usually in mid early to mid January. And then the Olympics are kind of, uh, the middle,

136
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,680
like kind of early to the end of February.

137
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
So it's very close to the Olympic games.

138
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,240
About a month.

139
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
So how did you do in the trials? I mean, I don't mean how did you do in terms of what

140
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,400
was your position? Obviously we know you made it to the Olympic team, but how did you feel at the

141
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
trials and what did that do to your confidence?

142
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,400
I was going in with the flu and had a high fever. So I had missed a week of training going in.

143
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,960
And so I was pretty weak and frail, but I, I managed to, to skate well. I won that national

144
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:17,080
championship, but it wasn't this really strong at my height showing. And, and then after that,

145
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,400
it proceeded not to get better, but to get worse in my training at home with other injuries.

146
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,680
Going into, into the games where I was in physical therapy every day and had ionophoresis on my,

147
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,680
my inner thighs. And, and it was just, is a tough place to be because you want to train harder, but

148
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,840
then you push yourself and you become more injured and you set yourself back.

149
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,920
And so it's just this, this delicate balance of, of trying to, to navigate.

150
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,640
So let's explain to folks how this program works. Most people sort of know there were a couple of

151
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,520
different skates. There's a short and a long. The long is sometimes referred to as the free skate as

152
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,480
well. What are the parameters involved? The short program is usually two minutes and 50 seconds.

153
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,080
There's three jumping passes. There's a footwork sequence, a spiral sequence and three spins.

154
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:15,000
And, and the long program is a little over four minutes, four 10. And it, the rules keep changing,

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,240
but at the time that I was competing, I think you're allowed eight jumping passes and you could

156
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,680
do jumps in combination as well as requirements of three to four spins. And then a footwork

157
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,600
sequence and a spiral sequence as well. But there's more flexibility in terms of if you do a

158
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,480
combination or you don't do a combination and it's all about trying at the time that I was

159
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,600
competing to aggregate more and more points. At the end of a short program, so there are,

160
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,640
how many judges? You're testing my memory now. So different competitions vary, but I believe

161
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,360
it's usually nine and there's a backup judge. Got it. And it's like some, it's up to six points.

162
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,640
Is that the most? It used to be a six point oh system that shifted in the early, early 2000s.

163
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,640
And by the time that I was competing, no one really knew what their score meant until they

164
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,440
compared it to someone else's score because every competition would have new highs and,

165
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,480
and it was, it was all relative, but it was, there was no cap to how high you could go.

166
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,960
And so you didn't know if your score was the best score until you compared it to others.

167
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,920
Got it. At the end of the short program, which I assume is sort of done in reverse order of

168
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,680
favorites such that the, which we don't get a sense of when you're watching this on TV,

169
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,040
because you're not actually watching every single person there, but how many women would

170
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,280
have skated in the short program, for example, they eliminate after the short program. So I

171
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,920
believe it could have been up to 30 people in the short program, but it's a random draw for the

172
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,240
short program. Only the long program is done based on results in the short program and in groups of

173
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,760
six. So it's not a complete reverse of order, but it's in six and you draw. And then after the short

174
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,320
program, I think the people like that last six places are eliminated. So then when you go into

175
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,760
the long program, it's more like 24 skaters. And this is, this is rough approxinations.

176
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,440
It is still amazing. We'll come back to this in more detail, but it's sort of hard for mere mortals

177
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,720
like me to even understand what it means to make an Olympic team or in a time sport to even make an

178
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,560
Olympic standard. You know, there are some countries in the U S we take this for granted,

179
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,480
but there are many countries where you don't even have to, you just have to make the Olympic standard

180
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,720
and you get to go. Like there are so few athletes that could even do that in a given event. Like,

181
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,680
you know, a running event, for example, it is sort of hard to believe that all of the athletes in the

182
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,840
world are windowed down to 20, 24, 30, whatever it is. And then away you go. So going into this,

183
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,000
would you say your strength was more on the short program and the long program or how did these

184
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,120
differ? I mean, the difference in duration must obviously pose a different physiologic stress.

185
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,400
What are the other differences between them from the standpoint of the athlete either,

186
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,640
either it be mentally or physiologically? I think the short program, the margin for error is,

187
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,760
is zero. There's fewer elements. And so if you make one mistake, you really drop in the ranks.

188
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,160
And if you make two, it's just, you're, you can put yourself out of the running for a metal

189
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,720
and the long program, it's definitely more, for some people, it can be more mental. It's longer.

190
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,160
There's more elements, but there's more of an opportunity to take risk, to try harder elements.

191
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,160
And different athletes tend to favor different formats. I tended to like the short program

192
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,440
format more. It was more condensed, more fiery. And I think it's just very different depending

193
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,360
on what kind of athlete you are. Like you're saying there's more endurance and play in the

194
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,080
long program, mentally and physically. And there's also a finality to it. Whereas in gymnastics,

195
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,760
events are usually standalone in figure skating, the short and long program are combined. So

196
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,680
you're setting the stage with a short program, but it's by no means final. And it's not weighted as

197
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,920
heavily as the long program is weighted. For some people, they see it as more pressure because

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,480
you can't make a mistake. And in some ways it's less pressure because it doesn't count for as

199
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,320
much as the long. And it's just, it's everyone kind of getting initiated and seeing where you rank.

200
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,160
You were first coming out of the short program in 2006. How did you feel? I mean,

201
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,800
you're probably your own harshest critic. How did you judge your performance in that short program?

202
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,840
It certainly wasn't my strongest short program that I had done, but considering

203
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:39,560
the level of preparation that I had going in and in my mental confidence, I was thrilled with it

204
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,560
because I hadn't done a clean and clean mains making no mistakes. I hadn't done a clean short

205
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,040
program in weeks. I had struggled to even do full run-throughs because I was nursing injuries and

206
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,600
just really struggling. So I think I skated towards the end, if not last, after my competitors had

207
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:08,040
skated good programs and there's this immensity that you feel in the air and knowing that this

208
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,720
moment has arrived and you're not ready. And so when I went out there and ended up landing

209
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,120
my three different jumping passes and making it to the end, I was just exuberant and thrilled and

210
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,160
relieved. And then when I saw my name on the leaderboard and I was in first place,

211
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,920
I couldn't believe it. It was a thrill and it's a temporary victory, right? So you have one day

212
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,120
off and then you're back to the long program. But in that moment, I was triumphant.

213
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,640
So how did you spend that day between the short and the long program?

214
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,680
I had actually strained my leg during my performance. And so I had decided to take

215
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,960
the day in between off in order to be fresher and to not continue to

216
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,600
exasperate the injury in between the short and long programs, which really confuse everyone

217
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,280
because no one skips a practice. You get 40 minutes a day and people are used to training

218
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,280
for hours at home. So people just jump all over that time.

219
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,560
Oh, I never even thought of that. So of course, you now have whatever the 20, 24 skaters that

220
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,760
now have one day to get ready for the long program. And you're not going to put them all

221
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,240
on the ice at the same time. So everybody gets their 40 minute block and you're not showing up

222
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:30,440
for yours. I'm not showing up for mine. And that certainly confused people. The idea was...

223
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,600
Was that your decision or your coach's decision? I think it was a joint decision.

224
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,480
The physical therapist was coming to see me a few times a day. It seemed like a good decision.

225
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Again, I think you always second guess everything in hindsight. But considering where I was and how

226
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,320
injured I was at the time, it did seem like the best decision because at a certain point,

227
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,680
you've done everything so many times that it's how you feel physically, which really informs

228
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,200
how you feel mentally in the moment that you step out to perform. You step onto the ice now

229
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,720
for the long program. You know, I've watched that video many times. It's hard because when you're

230
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,760
watching it now on video, knowing the outcome, it's different than watching it live. And truthfully,

231
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,160
I can't tell you that I see in your face any reduction in confidence. I can say I do because

232
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,480
that's the narrative I'd place over it. What do you see when you go and watch yourself? First of all,

233
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,200
do you go back and watch that? It took me a very long time to watch it. I believe it took me a few

234
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:40,040
years before I ever watched it. I was in an acting program and one of my classmates found out that

235
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,960
I was a skater and watched my performance and was like, it was so dramatic and it's so great and

236
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,960
we should watch it together. I'm like, I'm not watching it with you. So he finally convinced me

237
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,760
to watch it with him. But even though I didn't do the warmup, the longer 40 minute warmup, there's

238
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,280
a five or six minute warmup before you skate. And during that warmup, I fell on jumps that I

239
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,560
usually don't fall on. And I fell on a triple flip in the warmup and I fell on a triple lutz. And it

240
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:15,240
just, I think it really shook me. Figure skating is a sport where you're jumping and if you hesitate

241
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,000
for a millisecond, you throw off a whole timing of a jump. And going into that program, I knew,

242
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,760
wow, I just fell on things I don't normally fall on in my warmup. And now I'm going out and this is

243
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,960
it. Everything that I've prepared for, this is my second chance, this is my moment. And I don't

244
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,760
know what's going to happen and I'm not as prepared as I want to be. But again, you can't admit any of

245
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,680
this to yourself. It's all gets buried and compacted deep within you. And so you go out and you just

246
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,600
try to stay in the moment. So getting ready, all you need to do right now is put on makeup. All you

247
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,320
need to do is put on your pants. All you need to do is get on the bus. All you need to do is jog

248
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,800
around the arena and keep it simple because the enormity of the expectation and everything you

249
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,760
need to do and the crowds cheering can really unravel you. And so I think that's a training

250
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,800
and a skill set that you develop over years of competing. And when I went out and when I started,

251
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,280
it was a surprise to me when I fell on my first jump. And you partially register it.

252
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,280
And I partially registered just this kind of hush from the arena.

253
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,440
This was the first one, the triple Lutz.

254
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,120
The first one was a triple Lutz combination that I explained for folks who haven't watched

255
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,480
figure skating much. I don't know that I know I could recognize a Lutz. I don't know how I just

256
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,320
would describe it. So you're skating, usually taking most of the rink to prepare and gaining

257
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,880
speed, skating backwards and people jump both ways. But for me, I would be skating on backwards,

258
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,680
on my left foot, on my outside edge with my right foot in the air. And then my right foot would

259
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:01,400
reach behind me and tap kind of like a pole vault. And then I would begin, I would jump

260
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,800
and begin to rotate counterclockwise. It's considered one of the harder triple jumps and

261
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,240
the triple axel is the hardest.

262
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,800
We'll come back to the triple axel because I don't think a woman has ever landed a quad

263
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,960
axle. Has that ever been done yet?

264
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,040
I don't think a man has ever landed a quad axle.

265
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,320
Oh, I thought a man has landed a quad axle.

266
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,680
Well, maybe I'm thinking a man's done a triple, but a woman's not done a triple.

267
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,160
Midori Ito has done a triple axle. And then I think in the team competition,

268
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,320
Mariah Nagasu has done a triple axle. But I believe that was not in the lady's singles.

269
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,080
Okay, got it. But you're saying it's possible a man has never landed a quad axle either then.

270
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,960
I don't know why I thought.

271
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,680
Not that I know of. They do all the other quads.

272
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,760
Elvis Stoico had done a quad, but maybe.

273
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,280
He's done a quad, but not a quad axle.

274
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
That would be four and a half turns.

275
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,040
Yeah, I want to come back to all of that because growing up in Canada, figure skating is,

276
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,560
you know, along with hockey, it is a sport we paid a lot of attention to growing up.

277
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,160
And there were some great Canadian figure skaters.

278
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,560
Yeah, Elvis and Kurt were icons.

279
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Just to put this in context, like I'm still struggling to understand how one trains for

280
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:10,120
this because I can't imagine like you go to a practice and you would do that whole four

281
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,520
minute, 10 second routine by itself. Right. I mean, wouldn't you practice by breaking that down into

282
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,520
short segments and doing those and working on the transitions as opposed to just going through the

283
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,920
whole thing?

284
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,320
Mariah You would do both. There would be a lot of

285
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,920
emphasis placed on the whole run through and then mocking competition conditions.

286
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,320
So that might mean you go into a five minute warm up, you get off the ice at home and you wait.

287
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,160
And then you go out and no one else on the ice and you have to go with someone's press

288
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,120
press play for you versus getting to restart or skating with everyone else and taking 30

289
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,440
minutes to warm up. And then you'll also just repeatedly train segments. And sometimes it

290
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,960
could be the beginning and the end or maybe just at the beginning three times in a row

291
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,680
to work on cardio and stamina. And so you're, you're trying to train yourself mentally.

292
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,880
You're trying to train physically so that stamina isn't an issue when you're at the end.

293
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,360
And everyone's a little different. And that's, I think the thing that was always so tough for me

294
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,920
is there's no, there was no formula. And with some people, more was better. And for, for other

295
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,600
people, more means you break and then you ultimately set yourself back. And so it was

296
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,600
always this tough push pull of, am I being lazy or am I being smart? And sometimes that,

297
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:32,360
you know, the person, something inside was just like, I'm not sure, but I have to do this again

298
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,120
and again and again. And then you end up injured and then you feel like an idiot. Cause now you

299
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,000
have to take a week off. But that was, that was a very hard balance for me because I, I did get

300
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,880
injured easily. One of the things that has always amazed me about figure skating. And again, your

301
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:52,040
fall in that triple Lutz at the outside of the long program was yet another remarkable example

302
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:59,240
of it to me is the ability that the skater has to immediately resume the choreography as though

303
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,280
nothing happened. And that amazes me for two reasons. The first is physically, anthropometrically,

304
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:12,680
meaning where you are in space can't be predicted by a fall. So it's one thing to go through a

305
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,480
series of movements and do them perfectly every time. And therefore know exactly where you're

306
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,040
going to be that next moment. It's quite another thing when you fall and you're never going to

307
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,880
fall exactly the same way twice. So every time you fall, you're going to land in a different

308
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,080
position slightly or roll into a different position. And yet you have to be able to go from

309
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,600
a first time being in a given position to right back into it. So that has always amazed me.

310
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,600
The second thing that's amazed me amazes me actually a lot more, which is the sort of courage

311
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:52,840
to be able to stand up when at that level, a fall of that nature almost guarantees you can't win.

312
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,360
Right? I mean, sure, as we'll see in your case, you didn't miss by much a gold despite that fall.

313
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,720
But who has the processing speed internally to do the math and go, well, technically I could still

314
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,760
be perfect the rest of this. I mean, in the end, it's just so crushing to your confidence in that

315
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,960
moment. And yet it's that ability to stand up and go again that I find more moving, I think,

316
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,120
frankly, than any aspect of the sport. And it's different from other sports, even individual

317
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,360
sports where it's crushing like tennis, you know, you're out there all alone. You're, you know,

318
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,920
there's no one to hide behind, but you make the worst play in the world. The most your damage is

319
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,280
capped. It is finite loss. It is. It is not finite loss in a sport like figure skating when you make

320
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,400
a mistake, it can be catastrophic and you can lose the entire competition, especially if you

321
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,080
can't get up and get back into the zone. So is there anything going on in your head consciously

322
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,240
as all that's happening? Or is it that in practice, every time you fall, the practice is getting up

323
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,720
and going right back into it as opposed to falling, thinking about why you fell, reflecting on it and

324
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,520
repracticing it, if that makes sense. Practice is certainly a component of it. And my coach

325
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,600
always taught me, you don't fall, you bounce. So as soon as you hit the ice, you're up.

326
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Not only do you have to find physically where you go in space, but musically it has to match. And a

327
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,400
lot of times when you fall, especially if you're sliding or you hit the board, all of a sudden you're

328
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,720
late and you're trying to make up time because you know, on the next musical indication, you're

329
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,760
supposed to be halfway across the ice and you're still trying to get yourself up. So there's

330
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,560
certainly that element, but I think it's a combination of things. First of all, there's

331
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:52,200
so much going on that you don't have time to sulk in it, to let it hit you, the implications

332
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,000
of that fall. You have to block that as fast as you can because the firing is continuing.

333
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,600
For me, it was like I felt myself hit the ice. I heard the audience just go,

334
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,440
and that is not always your own disappointment and something I've always struggled with is not

335
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,920
wanting to disappoint others. And so now I have a stadium full of people that are just

336
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,520
audibly groaning and disappointed and you have to keep going on. And it's kind of being in this

337
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,920
embarrassing catastrophic nightmare where you can't hide. It's like someone's ripped off your

338
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,320
clothes, but you can't run off and hide. You have to hold your chin up and keep going and pretend

339
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,840
like you're fine. And then I go into the next jump, the triple flip. I didn't quite fall,

340
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,520
but I had a very severe step out and then I hit. And both your hands hit the ice. Yeah,

341
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,000
it was pretty much as close to a fall as you can get. I mean, I've been watching the video again,

342
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,440
I've watched it now so much in the preceding few weeks, but I forgot. I mean, it's amazing. You

343
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,960
don't break your wrist sometimes the way you would put your arms down. And you're not the only

344
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,040
skater I've seen do that, but that's a hard hit. You probably don't even recall it.

345
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,480
No, I don't know what to ascribe it to other than I generally have loose ligaments. I fall

346
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,320
all the time and people look like, how did you not tear your ACL and everything?

347
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,040
I would break my wrists if I fell into the position you did. But again, for the person

348
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,640
who's, and anybody at this point who's listening to this is going to go back and watch this video

349
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,520
and it will do more justice to what I'm trying to articulate. But again, it hadn't even started.

350
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,000
I mean, the music you chose for that piece, which I'd like to talk about all elements of this,

351
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,440
we're focusing on sort of the most challenging parts of this. But in terms of like the music

352
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,080
and the actual choreography and the performances, I don't think I'm alone in saying it's certainly

353
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,720
one of the more beautiful performances in all of women's figure skating. And yet it hadn't

354
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,640
even really started here. Sort of one, two punch. And if I was amazed the first time that you got up,

355
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,040
that says nothing about what it felt like to watch you get up the second time. It's like,

356
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,400
how is she doing this?

357
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,600
I think you get very good at denial as an athlete and at blocking things out because

358
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,240
they would be too much to take. So if you actually process what's happening and where you are in

359
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,480
space and time, because you have to understand going into this, I saw the Olympics as this just

360
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,000
huge looming, like the sun, like the horizon. I couldn't imagine anything beyond it. And it's

361
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,560
the same way that we know that we one day will die, but we can't imagine that actually taking

362
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,600
place and what's beyond it. And that's the same way I couldn't imagine March of 2006. I'm like,

363
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,240
I know it's going to come, but I don't understand that.

364
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,920
Let me pause for a moment then and ask you a question, which I'm going to ask you to try

365
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,400
to answer through the lens of February 2006. Because you've heard all these surveys and

366
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,440
questions where you walk into the Olympic village and you ask all of the Olympians there, like,

367
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,400
would you be willing to be dead in 10 years if it could guarantee you a gold medal at these games?

368
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,360
And I don't remember the numbers, but the numbers suggest that the answer to that question is yes,

369
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,080
in a staggeringly high amount, which I think speaks to, look, if you can't even picture March 2006,

370
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,000
what the hell would March 2016 even mean? Do you understand or can you relate to that ethos of

371
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,160
like you would die in 10 years to have been the best in the world undisputed on that day?

372
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,080
It was never posed to me as making that type of trade. I think now I can't imagine it, but

373
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,760
you know, who knows at the time, but it just, it was everything. It was an identity. It was your

374
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,440
chance to prove yourself to the world. It was everything that you were. And so everything was

375
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,560
riding on it. It was just so absolute and failing was the worst thing. And the sad thing is in a

376
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,280
sport like figure skating, if you're a medal contender, failing is getting second. Very few

377
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,440
people will say, oh, congratulations. You have an Olympic medal. It's more that you lost the gold.

378
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,840
You just don't know what to do with yourself. You have your own disappointment. You have the

379
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,840
disappointment of everyone around you, Team USA fans, your family, and the people that flew out.

380
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:19,320
And it's, it is kind of sad in hindsight to see just the nature of the interviews that,

381
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,160
you know, I had a string of interviews right after I competed and it was just like,

382
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,200
you know, your dreams are kind of dashed and you fell twice. Like how could you do this? Like how

383
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,720
devastated are you? And that that's what it's all about and reinforcing. And I think when you grow

384
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:42,600
up in this bubble and your whole identity is as an athlete and as a figure skater, and all you

385
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,640
want to do is prove to yourself and the world that you're good enough, but good enough means first.

386
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,480
And that's a very hard game to play. And I think it's not something that you can fully realize

387
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,000
at the time, you know, as a teenager or as a 21 year old. And I think it's something that takes

388
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,080
years to deconstruct after. And something that I've always found so interesting is I've,

389
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,760
I'm an overly analytical person and I've thought, oh, if I had just skated perfectly on that day,

390
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,000
and if I had, if I had won, then there would be nothing to resolve. There would be no searching.

391
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,040
And what I found is even fellow athletes like Apollo Ohno or, or Michael Phelps, who have won

392
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,120
multiple Olympic gold medals and are heroes and icons still struggle because I think so much of

393
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,680
what we gear our lives and performance for is for a moment. And even if you win in that moment,

394
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,200
that moment passes and then you still need something new to define you, to prove that you're

395
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,200
still good enough because now you're just last year's or last Olympics. And then you constantly

396
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,880
need a vehicle to prove yourself. That's such a great example. I mean, as you know,

397
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm really close friends with Apollo. We're going to be seeing him next week. We're going to play

398
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,960
patty cakes together. But you know, swimming is a sport I love, right? And that's a sport that from

399
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,400
the standpoint of following it and knowing the metrics, there were a few people who could rattle

400
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,760
off more swimming statistics than me. So I followed Michael Phelps from 2000 actually, you know, even

401
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,680
before most people knew who he was when he was just a kid who made the Olympic team and managed

402
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,320
to get fifth in the 200 fly, which is a huge deal in Sydney. And I was kind of amazed last month

403
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,640
when his world records in the 200 fly and the 100 fly fell. So at the world championships this

404
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:31,080
year, 2019, I was amazed at how people were writing about him as though it weren't that impressive what

405
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:37,160
he had done. And I mean, I'm reading these things and I'm like, these people have lost their mind.

406
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,880
Like they have no idea what he has accomplished in the water. And yeah, these two incredible swimmers

407
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,680
have come along and broken world records. In one case he's held for 18 years. And it might even be

408
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,880
the case now, I haven't checked in a while. It might be the case that the only world record Phelps

409
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,120
still holds is in the 400 IM from Beijing. But the point is, as someone who doesn't know Michael,

410
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,760
but just has always been a fan and knows, I can tell you his place and time in every race he's

411
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:12,200
ever done. I'm amazed at how quickly he, his greatness is also fading in the memory of the

412
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,080
average person, right? Like we will likely never see an Olympian like that again, ever, ever, ever,

413
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,640
ever in another hundred years. And yet only three years after his last Olympics, he's sort of

414
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,800
yesterday's news, which I think speaks to this point you're making, which is maybe the brighter

415
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,640
that star is, the longer it takes to fade, but every one of these things fades. It's interesting

416
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,040
what you're saying. It's, which you, it's almost like you're suggesting that you went through a

417
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:48,200
period of time thinking, if only I had won, things would have been different, but it seems that you

418
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,640
don't really buy that rhetoric. Regardless, you lose an identity. So win, lose, or draw.

419
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,640
So much is signified and held within a gold medal and being number one, this absolute, this peak.

420
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,960
It symbolizes that you didn't leave anything on the table. It symbolizes no regrets. It symbolizes

421
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,840
that you accomplished what you set out for and, and the world recognizes you as the victor. And

422
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,800
all of a sudden silver just brings up all these questions. Like what went wrong? Was it you? Was

423
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,880
someone better than you? How are you going to live with that? It just, there's another element to it.

424
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,720
But, but regardless, when you decide to retire or if an injury forces you to retire,

425
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,800
you still lose the identity. And I think that is what is so challenging for so many Olympians,

426
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,680
because you have sacrificed everything homeschooled, you have no balance. You generally don't have many

427
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,280
other outside interests. And if you do, they're certainly not developed few friendships and,

428
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:00,040
and it's just this one thing. And so even if you win, and then all of a sudden that identity is

429
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,560
taken from you, it's like, I'm a figure skater. That's who I am. That's how everyone sees me. But

430
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,320
once you stop figure skating, then who are you? And as, you know, someone in my mid twenties,

431
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,720
trying to figure out who that was, was very difficult. Cause I didn't develop other

432
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,320
interests or hobbies in, in middle school and high school. I didn't develop close friendships.

433
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,760
I didn't go to college at the age of 18. So you're kind of left on your own, somewhat isolated.

434
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,720
And Olympians aren't really sharing this when they retire. Cause I think they're kind of with

435
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,360
their, they're in their own heads, they're in their own sports, and they're dealing with this

436
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,000
with their families or maybe with some of their close friends. And so you don't really realize

437
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,640
this is normal. And everything about being an athlete is about projecting confidence and power

438
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,200
and that you're fine. And you're always fine. You just kind of get in the habit of not portraying

439
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,280
weakness, of not asking for help. And it's always you, it's always your fault. I think athletes are

440
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,400
some of the most accountable people. We're generally not saying, Oh, it was, it was the ice

441
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,000
or it was that, or these outside influences. It's all you. My training wasn't good enough,

442
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,600
or I mentally got distracted or the pressure was too much. So we feel like we have to fix everything,

443
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,080
because it's, we've been told that it's all up to us and it's our moment and we're either going to

444
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,200
make it or we're not. So I think that's something I'm trying to find a balance with life now,

445
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,040
is this balance of making life happen and allowing it to happen, allowing for serendipity and

446
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,840
opportunity. And these, all these things that happen in life that as an athlete, you think

447
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,400
you can control everything, but you can't. When you finished that long program, which again is

448
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,920
beautiful, right? I mean, if you take these first 30 seconds out of that program, I don't think I'm

449
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,200
alone in saying this. I think many people have written and certainly I've read many accounts

450
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,960
of it, describing it as one of the greatest programs in all of women's figure skating.

451
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,320
Were you proud of how you finished? I was certainly proud of how I finished. And

452
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,480
I think in that moment after I had missed my second jump and I was heading

453
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,160
15 seconds later into my third jump, a difficult jump for me, you just kind of like, what's going

454
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,640
to happen on the other side of this? But you have to go in and just remind yourself, okay,

455
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:25,400
like set the shoulders, like pull back, snap, and just get back into the word by word guidance that

456
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,960
you give yourself through the program. And I landed that jump and it was kind of a relief. It's like,

457
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,360
okay, now I have a second and I had a spin and a few moments and the music shifted.

458
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,120
But at that moment, you're still kind of realizing like there went the gold, but you're just trying

459
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,440
to keep your head back because your head wants to go all these places. But as an athlete, you've

460
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:52,040
taught yourself to suppress emotions, feelings, and doubts, and especially in when you still

461
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,800
are on the line and you have to perform. And so as I ended up landing each consecutive jump,

462
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,280
there was this sense of relief and the music was very emotional. It was Romeo and Juliet from the

463
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,960
movie. And I just loved it. And so I allowed myself to really kind of get into some of the pain

464
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,360
and the expressiveness of the music. And I was relieved when I was done, but I was also

465
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:23,320
crestfallen and it was still trying to process everything at once. And in some ways, it was

466
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,640
kind of a messy night. A lot of girls were falling and that usually doesn't happen at an Olympics.

467
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,880
At another games, I would have been eighth or 10th and I ended up second because the top three

468
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,240
girls all made mistakes. So I can see that silver medal is just, wow, I was so lucky to medal,

469
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,400
considering how I skated. But I think at the same time, you just know that this wasn't the

470
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,560
state of preparation I wanted to be going in. This wasn't the performance that I wanted to give.

471
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,120
And I don't know what I could have done differently. And I think that's the biggest

472
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,720
thing for me is I'm a perfectionist. I want to understand everything. Things should be rational

473
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,000
and I want to fix everything. And so when you don't really understand,

474
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,440
sometimes it's hard to have closure and figure out what it means and what you could have done,

475
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,200
if you could have done anything at all. When you accept the medal, when you go back with your

476
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,640
family that night and your coach, are you already in your mind starting to think about the next

477
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,560
thing? Are you already thinking about the next world championships or the next Olympics, God forbid,

478
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,840
four years down the line? Or are you able to, in this particular moment I'm referring to specifically,

479
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,240
able to take some comfort in what you've just achieved?

480
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,480
I would say usually if it's a national championship or a Grand Prix, you're thinking

481
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,840
about the next thing because those are events gearing up to bigger events. But the Olympics is

482
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,520
just... Well, this one in particular.

483
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,640
Yeah. So this is just...

484
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,280
As soon as I was done competing, it was press conference, drug testing, and then media circuit

485
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,720
hitting all the, I believe it was hitting all the morning shows. And then every time they put

486
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,880
a microphone in my face and I could get through 30 or 40 seconds before I started to cry and have

487
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:13,320
a hard time talking. And that was eight interviews. So you don't really have much time to process then.

488
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,080
And then we have a show the next day. So all of a sudden it's, okay, now what's your show program?

489
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Block it out with lights. And it's just go, go, go and trying to keep everything together. You're

490
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:33,000
kind of a porcelain doll that's shattered and glued yourself together to try to keep going

491
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,960
for the next two days of the Olympics, which is basically doing this exhibition, closing

492
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,840
ceremonies and leaving. And so you don't really have the time to process. I was saying with my

493
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,600
mom in, we'd rent an apartment and you kind of just come home to silence at the end of it.

494
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,440
It's too much to process at the time. And I think the most, the biggest concern is to keep yourself

495
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:04,840
together in front of team USA officials, in front of the media, in front of even family. It's like,

496
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,560
it's fine. I'm all right. Like it's okay. But certainly not thinking about the next competition.

497
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:15,720
Because after that world is kind of like a throwaway. I ended up going, but different athletes

498
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,600
handle it differently. But I think I tried to create a wide vacuum between skating and myself

499
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,120
and a persona just to get away from the pain of it. Again, I didn't watch the performance.

500
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,320
I fully embraced all the fun opportunities I had post games, which were quite the Oscars and,

501
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,120
you know, all these different events and skating. Unlike other sports, you have a chance to tour.

502
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,680
So you know, you're busy doing shows and live TV events. So I kind of lost myself

503
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
there and then put skating aside. I went to acting school. I just...

504
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,640
But did you formally retire in 2006?

505
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,760
No. And I actually ended up competing in March at Worlds. And then I ended up touring for a few

506
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,080
years while taking time away from competing and ultimately decided to come back and train in 2009,

507
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,760
2010 season. So it's interesting, you sort of delayed that. I remember Apollo talking about how

508
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,640
post 2010, I forget what he said, somebody the effect of like two weeks after the Olympics,

509
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,960
it all sort of hit him that that was it. On the one hand, that seems like a very short period

510
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,640
of time. Like, oh my God, like two weeks after, you know, the Olympics, it all sort of crushes

511
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,120
down on you like a ton of bricks, like you're no longer a professional athlete. And on the other

512
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,440
hand, that seems like a really short period of time. It seems like in your case, it was different.

513
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,120
It seems like in your case, you were able to stretch that out more partly because of the

514
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,880
nature of your sport, I think. And when you mentioned that you were taking acting classes,

515
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,960
was that in the spirit of making you a better skater or was that really in the spirit of

516
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,560
thinking about your next career?

517
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:04,840
I think it was about exploring other opportunities. I guest starred on CSI New York and on Las Vegas.

518
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:12,040
And I did a small indie film. I wanted to move to LA and take acting classes. And it was,

519
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:18,040
it was a wonderful diversion from this intense world of pain and disappointment, which I think

520
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,080
I didn't really want to process or look at. It was like, oh, here's all these fun, sparkly things for

521
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,440
you. Because right now you're cool and sexy because you just competed in the Olympics. And,

522
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,240
and then this is kind of something that all Olympians go through is you work really hard.

523
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,200
You have tunnel vision, you spend your day between the gym, your home and a training facility. And

524
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,160
then all of a sudden the whole world cares about you. And everyone wants to meet the Olympian right

525
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,920
after the Olympics until the next games. And then it's like, oh, who are you? So it's, it's a very

526
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:57,880
fun, amazing opportunity that some Olympians are fortunate enough to have. And I think for me,

527
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:06,040
it was just a wonderful relief of the disappointment and pain of my games. And then it was, I was just

528
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,840
busy working. So it was, you know, I went on tour for a few months and you're doing shows every,

529
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,120
every other night. And when you go and see a figure skating show, how much are you guys dialing

530
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:22,680
back your athletic sort of movements to guarantee that you're not falling? Like in other words,

531
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,880
at the Olympics, you're at the limit obviously. And that's why you will see someone fall at the

532
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,800
Olympics because they're the best in the world doing the hardest thing in the world. But when

533
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,920
you're doing like Disney on ice or whatever other show, they're obviously still amazing skaters,

534
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,680
but is that such a step below? Are you skating at 25% of your capacity in those situations?

535
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,680
So first of all, it's not Disney on ice. That would be a, you'd be a character if you're doing

536
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,200
Disney on ice. It's generally stars on ice or champions on ice at the time.

537
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,560
But the Disney on ice people, I mean, they're obviously very good skaters too. I'm using that

538
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,040
as an example, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Just clarifying, but no, it's certainly a much lower

539
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:05,720
level of difficulty in terms of your technical elements. And a lot of times you, you may not

540
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,640
have practice or time to prepare. You might be on a small ice and you're skating with light bulbs

541
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,480
around and no boards and you've got spotlights on you and you might be taking a red eye. So people

542
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,800
are definitely dialed down the level of performance, but it's more about entertaining. So at this

543
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,360
point the fans are there, they've watched you compete over the years. They're there to see you.

544
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,080
And so people are skating to songs with words and it's about entertaining and connecting with

545
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,160
the audience and you're still doing difficult triples, but it's not like you're packing your

546
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,520
program every 15 seconds with a very difficult combination. You mentioned already something that

547
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,360
I think is lost on a lot of people, which is the relatively small window in which you can be at

548
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,440
your best. And again, people like Apollo and Michael create, I think a false sense of what

549
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,960
the true longevity of an athlete looks like. It's very rare for someone to be the best in the world

550
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,160
over three or four Olympics. In many ways, I think it's a lot more like horse racing. And if you look

551
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,520
at thoroughbreds have one season in which they can be the best and it's very early in their life,

552
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,600
right? They're usually three year olds when they're at their absolute best. The horse might live 20

553
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,440
years, but it's going to race from ages two to four and it peaks at age three. I don't know if

554
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,360
you know these statistics, so I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I know how involved you are

555
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,720
in helping Olympians as they think about this transition. I mean, do we even have a sense of

556
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,520
how many people go to the Olympics and what percentage of people get to only go to one Olympics

557
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,680
and what percentage of people even get to win a medal? And it might just be even in the United

558
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,400
States where you probably would have better access to those stats. I don't have the stats,

559
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,120
but I know that most people only go to one Olympics and very, very few people medal.

560
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:51,080
I was surprised just thinking about it because I think the last winter Olympics,

561
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,600
Sean White won the hundred gold medal, Olympic gold medal, I believe for the US and you're

562
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,080
thinking the Olympics went going back to the twenties and there were breaks in there,

563
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,680
but you're just like, whoa, there's very few people have actually won medals.

564
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,560
And very few people get to go to an Olympic twice and certain sports, I think, like swimming or

565
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:17,400
speed skating tend to allow for someone to go perhaps twice, but, you know, three times,

566
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:23,000
four times is very, very rare. And in a sport like gymnastics or figure skating, especially as a

567
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,160
woman, your body changes. And then it's this complicated window where you have to be 15,

568
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,880
but some girls were peaking like a lot of these Russian girls were peaking at 12 and 13 and 14,

569
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,080
but then they couldn't go and compete. And by the time they were old enough to go,

570
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,360
they were off their peak. It's unbelievable to see that again. It's sort of like,

571
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,360
if you could really only peak for one to two years, it's like, imagine the Kentucky Derby is

572
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,520
only every four years and yet those three out of four horses wouldn't even get to peek in their

573
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,160
thing. And, and again, it does create this and it really breaks my heart. There's it. There's,

574
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:04,680
there's an amazing American female swimmer, Missy Franklin, who was an absolute phenom in 2012.

575
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,240
I mean, just sort of knock the socks off of people. You just couldn't believe how well

576
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:15,560
she swam in 2012. Well, in 2016, she was obviously not the same swimmer. I just found it so

577
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,480
heartbreaking to watch the reaction to this as though somehow she had failed as though somehow

578
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,960
like she had let us as fans of US swimming down, which I actually found infuriating,

579
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,880
truthfully, because I was able to sort of in a moment recognize that, wait, like it's okay to

580
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,680
be sad for her. Like I wish Missy was doing better here in Brazil because she strikes me,

581
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,200
I don't know her, but she strikes me as a beautiful human being and obviously a beautiful swimmer.

582
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,480
But to think that I could be disappointed, like she was somehow not living up to her potential.

583
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,600
It's ridiculous when you imagine here's a girl who's already got world records and gold medal

584
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:02,040
and Olympic titles to her name. It's almost like we as the fans create this awful expectation and

585
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:09,960
this sort of toxic environment of expectation around. It's never enough. You're only as good

586
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,000
as your last Olympics, right? You're only, you know, as you pointed out by 2010, it doesn't really

587
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,440
matter anymore what you did in 2006. It's can you make this 2010 team? And the media is a big part

588
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:26,280
of it too. It's a story, you know, will they live up to expectations and how will they do? And it's

589
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:33,800
you build people up and you tear them down. And I don't know why people do this. People are busy

590
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,640
living their own lives and then I think they just project everything, project failures and they

591
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,600
don't know these people, but they're somewhat public figures. And so it seems easy to kind

592
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:50,040
of slash them at the ankles and just like, how could you disappoint your country? And like,

593
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:57,480
why weren't you prepared? And there's really no sensitivity to this person being a human being.

594
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:03,640
We see athletes as resources and you need to perform. You need to meet expectations. And

595
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:11,320
there's not a lot of compassion for them as a human being just struggling on this global platform

596
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:17,480
and just having their heart ripped out. Well, you're absolutely right. We just can't,

597
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:24,440
we as fans, I'm saying now, we sometimes have a hard time believing you guys aren't machines.

598
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:31,240
For example, like you watch Djokovic win Wimbledon and then a month later have to pull

599
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:37,000
out of the US Open and people are booing him. I mean, I just can't believe it when I watch it.

600
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,160
I really, it embarrasses me to be a member of the public when you realize like a guy whose

601
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,120
shoulder is obviously in tremendous pain has to pull out of a tennis match and people are

602
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,800
pissed about it. And look, maybe if I'm going to take the other side of that, I would say, well,

603
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,440
maybe they paid a lot of money to come and see the Wimbledon champion at the US Open. It's funny,

604
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,520
when I was growing up, I was, I guess I still am sort of a football fan and I had this poster

605
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,760
on my wall of Jerry Rice. I don't know if you know who that is, but very famous wide receiver,

606
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,760
arguably the greatest wide receiver to ever play the position. It's just a very famous,

607
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,400
I think it's like a Nike poster and he's in the end zone and he's holding the football up. He's

608
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,960
just scored a touchdown and there's a player, I think it's like a Cincinnati Bengal player.

609
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:23,400
You don't even know who the player is because he's on the ground with his feet trying to grab

610
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,480
Rice's ankles. Obviously, he has failed to stop Jerry Rice from entering the end zone. And I

611
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,480
remember one of my best friends in high school, Jeff Bajoni, made the most astute observation ever.

612
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,680
We were like sitting in my room one day, we're like seniors in high school and he looks at that

613
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,000
and he goes, isn't it amazing that that dude, when he points to the guy on the ground, is a better

614
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,520
athlete than anyone we ever know. And I think people don't realize, we're so used to looking

615
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,720
at Jerry Rice or Michael Phelps or whatever that one exception is that comes along and truly bends

616
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:02,840
the arc of a sport that you forget. Even the people seven rungs beneath them are still doing

617
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:08,920
something that most of us can't fathom. But it's almost like we get numb to it, I think. We get so

618
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:15,080
used to seeing you guys be perfect that you make a mistake and maybe there's a part of us that

619
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,560
likes seeing it because we know you're not perfect and maybe there's a sense of, well,

620
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,960
you failed, therefore I'm not so mediocre in my existence. I don't know, maybe that's sort of

621
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:33,560
an overly skeptical view of it. Human nature is complex. I think a lot of it is invisible,

622
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:41,880
meaning the athlete, especially the Olympian's journey, we see him pop out of just nowhere for

623
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,440
a month around the games and then he kind of goes back into obscurity. Whereas you're kind of seeing

624
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,640
half the season, if you're watching the NBA or NFL, you're kind of constantly getting updates

625
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,400
on what's going on and there's multiple games. So you're part of the process a lot more, whereas

626
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,320
someone that is a skier or a swimmer, all of a sudden they pop out of nowhere at the age of 14

627
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,960
or 15 and you see them for a month and then they disappear again for four years unless you're

628
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,960
following the world championships. But I think most people would really just tune in for the

629
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,040
Olympics. So we don't really know what their lives are like. And I think that's what these

630
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:27,480
fluff pieces going into the games try to do is track this person training in their rundown

631
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,280
facility. The fact that they're homeschooled, you see them at physical therapy, icing everything,

632
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,640
taking 30 vitamins a day, trying to optimize their performance and then also having to take

633
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:44,200
painkillers because they're performing with a broken foot and humanizing the pain and the

634
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,400
struggle behind it and the sacrifice. And I think when all those things are taken into account,

635
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,640
all of a sudden this person becomes more human and someone that is overcome versus someone in

636
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:01,720
kind of a shiny USA outfit kind of going across your TV screen for 20 seconds and then they're

637
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,920
just a racehorse to you and they're a time. But I think once you know the human and you know the

638
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,720
story and what it takes and that the four years in between, there's really kind of this nothingness

639
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:18,280
for them and there's no glory for most Olympians and there's no money for most Olympians and they're

640
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,320
working second jobs and they're in debt to pay for their training and the sacrifice that they

641
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,440
go through. I think when you understand all those elements, it really, really humanizes the athlete.

642
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,480
Is the United States, I can't tell, is it a good or a bad country to be an Olympian from? Because

643
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:40,920
I've seen, for example, like in other countries where if you're even in the top five, top certainly

644
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,120
the top three in the world as a swimmer, you can make an amazing living because it's so great.

645
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,560
There's so few athletes in that country that could do it whereas in the United States, if you won a

646
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:59,240
bronze medal in the 200 IM in one Olympic year, you're not going to make that much off that.

647
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,440
But at the same time, the US seems to have a lot of great resources to help Olympians but just

648
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,720
on balance, you get the sense that it's great to be an American Olympian relative to other countries.

649
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:16,040
Well, it's certainly incredible to see the US flag and the sense of camaraderie and

650
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,080
you know, America still is this icon for so much of the world and so there's this immense

651
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,080
sense of pride representing the US. But I think the difference is the US Olympic and Paralympic

652
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:34,440
Committee is solely responsible for funding the athletes. The government is not any part of it

653
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,760
and in a lot of other countries, I believe like Russia and in China, the government is putting a

654
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,760
lot of money into the athletes and paying for their training and so they just have the resources

655
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,120
that they have to work with are at another level. You know, in Russia, if you reach a certain level

656
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:55,720
of success, you get an apartment and you get a car and you get a stipend where that doesn't

657
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:03,160
happen because the purpose of the Olympic Committee is really to find young talent and support them

658
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,400
leading up to their Olympic journey but they don't have the resources that these other countries do

659
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,920
and for other countries, especially during the Soviet Union, it was all about how do we beat the

660
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:18,760
US and everything and no expense is spared and look at five-year-olds and do they have the right

661
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,800
bone structures? Like, okay, take them away, take these 55-year-olds away, put them in camp and

662
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,080
maybe one of them will make it. We don't care if we work them all to the bone because it's about

663
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:34,840
winning and it's an Olympic machine. Your mom's from Russia, right? She came to the US when she

664
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:39,480
was what, a teenager? 16 and it was the Soviet Union at the time but she was from Odessa.

665
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:46,280
She was from Odessa, okay. Did Russian fans have a negative view of you? Did they want you to be

666
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,680
competing as a Russian or were they just opposed to you? They seem to boo you disproportionately.

667
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,400
Was it just because you were American or was there something more going on there?

668
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:00,360
I think it's because there was another Russian, Irena Sutskaya, that was a favorite as well and so

669
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:05,400
there was really no association with me being a president. I see. It had nothing to do with you

670
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,520
not competing as a Russian though it was in your bloodline. It was purely just the fact that you

671
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,360
were the competition to a Russian. Yes and I think in other competitions where there was no Russian

672
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:22,040
favorite then the Russians were supportive of me because I was closer to who they were but

673
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,200
I competed in Moscow against Irena and I was thoroughly booed. It was really that it was

674
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,080
kind of when I was ever up against one of their own that I certainly, they were not rooting for me.

675
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,640
Let's go back a little bit because I still, I don't understand how a seven-year-old girl decides

676
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,160
I'm going to subject myself to this much practice and this much deliberate effort. I mean you've

677
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,440
talked about this before in other interviews I've heard where like many athletes your parents are

678
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:55,320
told you probably have attention deficit disorder and was it framed as she should either probably

679
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,720
take this pill or she needs to find something to do for three hours a day? I mean was it sort of

680
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:09,400
like that? I was a hyperactive kid. I was constantly climbing trees just on rooftops wild and I would

681
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:16,440
race the boys, I would do cartwheels, I would just kind of, I would wear this same neon stretch

682
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,560
two-piece suit because I you know I had no sense or care about fashion. I just wanted to be running,

683
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,920
jumping, climbing at all times and I went through three different elementary schools because I

684
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,280
didn't know how to sit still in class or stand still during roll call. I would be off being cartwheels

685
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,560
or if art was over I wouldn't put my art project away because I wasn't done.

686
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:43,560
So I had a very difficult time being in a group setting and listening to direction. One teacher

687
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:49,960
thought I was deaf, another teacher gave my mom a book on juvenile delinquents and it was just kind

688
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:56,440
of clear that I couldn't conform to a system and you know my mom finally found a school that was

689
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,760
like mixed grades, no desks, mainly art that seemed to jive with me. This was in California?

690
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,400
In Pasadena. Then I was put into gymnastics at the age of five because I just I was bouncing all

691
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,400
the time. It's so much energy so I went to gymnastics for four hours a day and we were

692
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,920
literally a hundred v-ups, you know 300 jumping jacks, 100 push-ups and this is as a five-year-old.

693
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,080
I look like a little cut sumo wrestler. Were there other five-year-olds there or were you with

694
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:28,280
older kids? No I was with other five-year-olds. It was a very intense training center and yes you

695
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:34,840
know I was diagnosed with ADHD and my mom didn't want to medicate her five-year-old and so she

696
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,400
thought okay well we'll just get it rid of her energy in gymnastics. Through that a friend threw

697
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,000
a skating birthday party and I found skating and this feeling of gliding and freedom and I could

698
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,400
channel all this energy I had into something I loved and could focus on. And so then for me

699
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,560
it was very easy. It didn't feel like a sacrifice because all I wanted to do was be on the rink and

700
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,240
to be skating and learning new jumps. So I never really saw it as a sacrifice early on in my life.

701
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,160
It was something that gave me clarity and purpose whereas I didn't really fit in at school.

702
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:15,560
I was a lot smaller than everyone else and I just had a very different, I think I didn't know how to

703
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:21,000
socialize. I was climbing trees or I was painting pictures come sixth grade when everyone's getting

704
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,800
ready for dances and figuring out what they're wearing and figuring out what boys they should

705
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:32,200
spend time with at the mall. I just completely completely over my head and skating gave me this

706
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,440
channel to express myself to work hard to become something and it just clicked. Even by the

707
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:44,280
standards of a figure skater you would still be considered kind of an outlier in terms of your

708
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,160
artistic ability. Again the way you know your your movement exceeds even that of your peers.

709
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,840
You've now even just in the time we've spoken discussed this constantly as this sort of creative

710
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,880
expression. Do all, I mean I guess it's hard for me to ask you that question, but do you think that

711
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,880
that's common as the the thread towards getting somebody into figure skating or do are there

712
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,600
different paths that get people there? So in other words you don't have to know much about physics to

713
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,040
understand the strength and power that is required to jump the way you guys jump. I mean that's a it's

714
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:24,360
a very explosive sport so there's probably a very athletic component that's required to it in terms

715
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,920
of those raw athletic inputs. But there's also this huge artistic component where I could imagine you

716
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,280
take the most powerful female athlete on the planet but if she doesn't have the ability

717
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:42,440
to create lines and flow and spin in a certain way and dance in a certain way or choreograph in a

718
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,360
certain way it wouldn't be the same. I think it's the same is true for men and women. I'm just using

719
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,320
women as an example because we're talking about you. Did you start to figure out which of those

720
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:59,400
was your leading edge? It's interesting because on the spectrum of sports I think figure skating is at

721
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:08,200
the very end of sport and then the next is ballet and ballet is an art. And I think the physicality

722
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:14,360
channeled my energy but I think I've always been very expressive and creative and and I felt that

723
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:20,040
the music was a way for me to channel my feelings. So I think I was always much more of the artistic

724
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:26,920
skater and while I definitely had physical talent and capabilities that was by no means

725
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,480
my strength. Like some people were jumping machines. They were they were robots and they could do it

726
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,840
the same jump over 20 times just boom boom boom and for me I always struggled with that. It took

727
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:42,680
me longer to learn my jumps. I would lose my jumps and for me I excelled at the expression and the

728
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:48,120
line and the flexibility which I'll thank my mom for because she wouldn't let me watch TV unless I

729
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:55,000
was sitting in the splits. And so growing up I was either in the splits or practicing holding spirals

730
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,480
but everyone I think is is very different in a sport like figure skating and even ballet because

731
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:07,240
you have the range of the more athletic and then the more emotive artistic and you really need to

732
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:13,240
be a mix of both. Although the way that the system is evolving is with a heavy emphasis on

733
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,680
the technical abilities because that racks up points and so you don't need to have as much

734
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:25,400
personality or artistry because the points are really not captured there. Certainly it's part

735
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,040
of it but but you can rack up so many points with technical capabilities that it outshines.

736
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,440
And that become in some ways a criticism, hasn't it, of women's figure skating which is okay I get

737
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,600
it we're going to add more and more points to these greater and greater degrees of staggeringly

738
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,440
powerful jumps. But the critic would say well shouldn't we be subtracting points for the lack

739
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,000
of beauty in this, for the lack of grace, for the lack of spin, for the lack of line, for the lack of

740
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,920
choreographing as well so that we do try to preserve that balance. I mean I guess ultimately that's just

741
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,760
so subjective though right it's very difficult to enforce that the way you can say look you have to

742
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:05,960
do a triple Lutz and it's very clear what is and what is not that jump right. Figure skating is very

743
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,640
complicated as is gymnastics because it's not a race with you know did you beat this other person

744
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:18,600
what was your time. It's really an art that's also a sport and and so it's it's a philosophical

745
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,240
argument. Do you want to treat figure skating purely as a sport and a sport is about technical

746
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:32,680
ability and progressing and pushing the body to more rotations faster and treat it purely as a

747
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:40,280
as a sport because then what happens is you peak at 14 you get injured quickly you can't sustain

748
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:47,080
and evolve and have the kind of skaters you had in the 90s and early 2000s like Suriya Bonnily and

749
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,440
Kurt Browning and Michelle Kwon where there were personalities that developed and people matured

750
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:59,480
and became more like well-rounded athletes and performers because we're now choosing to treat it

751
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:06,760
just as a sport. We're not valuing the artistry but but who's to say that we should that's subjective

752
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,200
obviously I appreciate the artistry I couldn't my skills that wouldn't have been conducive to

753
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:18,360
competing in today's environment and I think a lot of what the audience loves is the personality and

754
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:23,480
the artistry of figure skating but is that what makes it a sport and I think that's a very

755
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,720
philosophical subjective debate. I don't feel qualified enough to weigh in the the fact that

756
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,120
I always have a very strong opinion in swimming for example you know the most dominant male swimmer

757
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:39,000
before Phelps was a guy named Tom Dolan and I mean not a beautiful swimmer to watch swim I mean

758
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:46,440
he looked like he was beating the crap out of the water the whole time and yet the fastest swim I

759
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:54,280
mean back to back gold medals in the 400 IM in 96 and 2000 so amazing swimmer but you know you

760
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:58,120
gotta say look in swimming it just matters how quickly you get to the wall it shouldn't you know

761
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,040
it's pretty clear in swimming or running to your point it doesn't matter if you look ugly doing

762
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:07,960
it who cares if you're there first but at what point in your figure skating career was it clear

763
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:15,400
to you that you wanted to do this as your life's mission at least for the foreseeable future

764
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,880
when do you make that decision where which is okay it's time to start whole homeschooling and

765
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:25,960
living on the road and training six hours a day I was 12 I was going into seventh grade my first

766
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:35,000
day of school and I just felt that it was such a waste I was at a public high school in California

767
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,080
everyone was focused on shopping and surfing and it wasn't a very rigorous academic environment

768
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,440
and I just I would often get heckled it's like oh what are you doing here do you lose your way

769
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:51,000
the elementary school's down the street because I because you're short yeah I was I was short I

770
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,240
was little I looked a few years younger than I was like I looked like I was in third or fourth

771
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:01,960
grade I was tiny when I was competing at the age of 15 I think I was four nine and 70 pounds

772
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,560
um so I was I was I was really little wait a minute wait a minute you were four foot nine

773
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,760
and 70 pounds at 15 I was tiny you know you had you I mean if you don't mind me asking I mean had

774
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,200
you even had your period yet no not tell much much much later wow yeah which is not uncommon

775
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,320
obviously for for female gymnast figure skaters ballerinas I don't remember why I had the tests

776
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,720
where you're kind of submerged dunked underwater yeah I think you know it was like five percent

777
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:32,520
body fat just just tiny it's kind of amazing to reflect on that for a moment I mean I think again

778
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,440
maybe even for you it's hard to appreciate now this is me getting to talk with some authority

779
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:44,280
right on what the implications are of totally arresting your endocrine system for six seven

780
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:51,240
years literally a third of your life being fully stopped to prevent your body from developing I

781
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:58,040
mean that speaks to what a physiologic stress it is for a young boy or a young girl it's just the

782
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:03,880
the I think there's a fundamental difference right which is for boys the training effect can

783
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,880
actually sort of help puberty but for women it can be really suppressive as it obviously was in

784
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,400
your case in the case of many others that that's and for me it was pretty easy until I was 17 and

785
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,640
then when I was 17 everything changed with with diet and with training meaning you got more dialed

786
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:27,640
in at 17 when I was 15 I could eat whatever I wanted I see and I was just tiny I had a kid's

787
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:34,840
metabolism and I was also working out hours and hours a day but when I was 17 16 17 you know

788
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,760
things started to change you started to get a little more pudgy and and all of a sudden there's

789
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,880
this focus and your coach and everyone's just like oh I you know I see you you know they would pinch

790
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,920
your stomach and it's like we that's not just skin there there's fat and then as you get to know your

791
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,800
body better and and every because it fluctuates you to get down to a pretty low weight but you

792
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,840
can't really sustain that during the year and so you'd gain 10 pounds after the end of the season

793
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,960
and then you would try to get back on the ice and do a jump again and it just you really feel the

794
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,600
difference in terms of your spring and being able to rotate rotational inertia for sure

795
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,640
how prevalent are eating disorders amongst figure skaters they must be quite prevalent

796
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,120
I'm sure they are but it's something that everyone keeps pretty private and even the men

797
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:25,320
have their own versions of them it's it's yeah I don't eat breakfast or lunch I just have coffee

798
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,720
and then then I have dinner but I don't have an eating disorder I think everyone has found their

799
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:36,280
own method for what works for them and it's very difficult because it's not so much about the

800
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,640
energy to train it's it can be very much about what your body looks like and how you can propel

801
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:47,080
it into the air and every body type is very different and has its own kind of physics where

802
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,520
you'll see a lot of the North American or European skaters being very very very muscular to to vault

803
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,240
themselves up into the air and and some of the Japanese skaters like the Japanese men you don't

804
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:01,800
really see a lot of muscles on them but they're just the most incredible light springy jumpers

805
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:07,480
and so everyone has to find their own dynamic and I think that's why you see a lot of girls kind of

806
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,600
get sidelined when they go through puberty is because their body really changes their bones

807
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,720
change and no matter how they try to control what they eat or how they train it that time has passed

808
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:23,080
them by it is a little bit of uh you talked at the outset about one of the challenges is you don't

809
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,680
you think you're in control of everything but you're not well this must be one of the greatest

810
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:33,160
example right because a 15 year old girl who has yet to go through puberty has very little control

811
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,920
over what her body is going to turn into I mean you don't know if your hips are going to do this

812
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,720
your breasts are going to do that and that can be all the difference in the world so our coaches

813
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:47,240
at that age also sort of hedging I mean how are they communicating to the parent because I'm trying

814
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:54,680
to put myself in the shoes of a parent whose child is 12 or 13 who's being told your child has the

815
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,720
potential to be an olympian but oh by the way when she goes through puberty all bets could be off

816
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:04,120
like you know her body could change in a way that's simply not conducive to the movements of the sport

817
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:10,280
is that ever explicitly discussed or is that just always sort of we just keep our fingers crossed

818
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:16,040
and we just go for it every model is different if you're you're in in Russia or in a different

819
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:21,400
training environment you know you might the coach will only take on a few students it's much more

820
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,120
intense whereas in the US it's like every skater has to pay for lessons so coach will teach someone

821
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,200
that might never make the olympics because they're getting paid and it fills this hour later on

822
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,520
there's you know as someone proceeds through the ranks and they're senior and they're close to

823
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:39,560
making a world team the coach gets more involved and there's more at stake but but ultimately

824
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,800
it's on the athlete can you control your body and it's again this everything that we think we have

825
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:52,360
to be able to control everything and and I think it is very dangerous because you get the validation

826
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,920
from your coach and from the world like if you have a longer line and you look more balletic

827
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:02,680
and at the same time it's easier to jump and you're also controlling something in your life which are

828
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,720
kind of all these things that are tied into having an eating disorder but then it's like

829
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:15,640
is that what's necessary for this sport when you look back at your entire career in figure skating

830
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:23,720
so from age call it five or seven until what 2025 when you stopped when was it the absolute most fun

831
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:33,960
it was the most fun when I first started and then probably when I was 14 15 years old

832
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:42,440
14 15 years old I was just beginning to get really good to get national attention go to

833
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:49,960
my first international grand prix's burst on the on to the national stage and get second at nationals

834
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:56,680
and then be invited to do tours as this young kid this whole world this this carpet unfolds before

835
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:02,040
you and now you're touring with your your idols with Cristiano Magucci and and Brian Boitano and

836
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,400
people you've watched on tv and you're just this little kid and all of a sudden

837
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:12,920
the olympics are two years away and and it's just it's all at once and it was this inundation

838
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,960
so I think that was probably the most exciting I was still super motivated it was all ahead of me

839
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:25,560
and I was young enough that I think the pressure the immensity like the enormity of the where the

840
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,440
level of pressure would go had not yet sunk in that is a response that I've heard from

841
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:35,400
a number of athletes which is the best time in their life with respect to the sport was actually

842
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:41,000
before they became the best do you think that's common I mean I you probably have a much larger

843
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,040
sampling of that than I do I think later on it just becomes about expectations I think it's a

844
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:52,120
matter of appreciation so before you have it it's just you idolize these these athletes at the

845
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:57,000
olympics and it's a dream just maybe one day I could get to go there and then all of a sudden

846
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,560
when you're going there you're like if I don't win I am the biggest failure in my life is ruined

847
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:07,160
and so I think it's all about framing and lenses and when you're young it's it's all ahead of you

848
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,640
and you see things with rose-colored glasses and you're doing something you love because you love

849
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:21,480
it and then later on it can change and I had a very difficult time between 2002 and 2006 I moved

850
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:27,000
across the country I had different coaches was dealing with like gaining weight and you know my

851
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,880
body not cooperating with me and losing all my jumps and just being super super devastated

852
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:40,520
weight did you gain between 02 and 06 so in 02 year 17 and I was you know six year 21 it would

853
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:47,480
fluctuate a lot between off season and on season but I had very low estrogen and low bone density

854
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:53,560
and so doctors wanted me to be on birth control to strengthen my bones and that just completely

855
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,840
put my body out of whack and completely didn't work for training and so it's like all these

856
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,080
things that your your body is like this finely finely tuned instrument and you do

857
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,680
you switch blades you you try birth control you and it just completely puts your body out of whack

858
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,840
let alone all the emotional repercussions and it was really tough but I knew the olympics were

859
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:21,480
two years away and I had to be there and I had to redeem myself and I had to win because this was

860
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:28,280
everything my life was for so despite how difficult it was and how hard it was failure and quitting

861
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:33,480
wasn't was never an option there's just you know something inside that's propelling you and I don't

862
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:39,160
know if it's there's so many different factors going in but it's it's something that there it's

863
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:45,480
not pure joy and like the love of what you're doing that's driving you it's the need to fulfill

864
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:52,840
a quest at points it can be a lot more painful and difficult than it is exciting and motivation

865
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,680
is serving as your source in some athletes case it's it's usually obvious at least if you're

866
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:03,080
playing armchair psychologist it's obvious what what void is trying to be filled you know it's

867
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:09,320
an athlete that's trying to you know win the approval of someone you know a parent that's not

868
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:15,480
there or a person that rejected them do you feel like or do you see or sense looking back any sort

869
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,920
of motivation that could make you feel like you had you know everything you just said i'm not

870
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,480
going to repeat it because i can't i won't do it justice everything you just said was that in

871
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:35,080
service of some thing some void you think or is that just the inevitable fuel that one needs to

872
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,360
turn to if they're going to compete at that level in other words can you win an olympic gold purely

873
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:49,720
purely from the place of bliss pure joy and love for the moment that you're there being a part of

874
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,360
every bit of the training win lose or draw have the same bliss is that even possible at that level

875
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:01,400
i think it's certainly possible i think you see it with kids just coming up so they might be 15 go

876
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:07,080
to their first games and they're so excited to be there and wow they won i think it also happens

877
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:13,320
towards the end of a career when people have had dealt with hardship and maybe it's their fourth

878
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:18,280
olympic games and they realize that this is the last one and how incredible it is and that they're

879
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:25,000
performing and they're competing with the appreciation of their legacy and that this kind

880
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,840
of final punctuation on their career but i think it's difficult especially when you're it's your

881
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:37,000
second games and you feel like there's so much pressure riding on this performance because it's

882
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,480
no longer about your olympic experience it's about will you deliver in these few minutes and that's

883
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:47,480
what everyone's been been talking about and waiting for so i think it is complicated but i think it's

884
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:55,880
possible and it's not to say that even if you are using this kind of not negative motivation but

885
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,680
just this you know a certain dry that doesn't come from pure joy not to say that you don't have the

886
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,960
most exhilarating moments when you you find this piece of music and you choreograph and you program

887
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,560
or you land and you jump combination for the first time it's you realize that the great things in life

888
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,440
take hit in your head against a wall over and over and over and over and over for years and you just

889
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:22,360
don't give up because giving up isn't an option i think this sense of obstinacy is it it makes you

890
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,520
great as an athlete but then when you apply it to life it's it's kind of you have to it's like the

891
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,440
zumba in the room it's like no that's a corner we actually should move the zumba and like start

892
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,480
banging against something else but that's what it takes to be a great athlete is not accepting

893
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:42,120
failure you keep showing up again and again and again and i can tell you that two years out when

894
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:47,240
you're out from the 2006 olympics i didn't even know if i was going to make it because i was

895
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:52,920
struggling so much the one season before the olympic season i had to withdraw in 0405 yeah

896
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,880
i lost all my jumps that year i pulled out of every grand prix and i i thought i've stuck around

897
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:03,240
this long and i'm not going to make it to 2006 like how is this happening but but you don't give

898
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:08,200
up you just keep showing up every day you keep showing up every day and then things get better

899
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:15,240
and it kind of teaches you that that if you don't give up if you show up that that has a lot of

900
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,080
weight to it one other question i just want to ask you about the actual olympics because it just

901
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:25,400
blows my mind how long does it take you to to choreograph say that the long program of 06 right

902
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,960
so you do you pick the music first you say this everything is going to be built around this song

903
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:36,040
and then we're going to build it in or do you largely sketch out what you want to do movement

904
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,480
wise and then pair music to it i mean especially for an olympic season you're listening and then

905
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:46,760
you're taking music to the ice and you're seeing how you move to it does it inspire you and then

906
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:52,840
you might work for a few weeks with a choreographer not only cutting the music but trying different

907
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:58,040
series of spiral sequences and jumping combinations and figuring out what really suits you and you're

908
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:03,400
really choosing music to suit your style if you're more lyrical or if you're more of a power skater

909
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:10,920
you really want the music to serve you and your style of artistry or how you skate was romeo and

910
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,200
juliet do you think your best work in that sense it certainly was one of the pieces of music that

911
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:25,080
i resonated with the most and i always felt that i just melted into the music and it's it's funny

912
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,480
because i get nervous with public speaking and and for some reason it's when i'm in front of a

913
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:35,480
microphone and i'm nervous and i speak it's very different than getting out into the middle of the

914
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:42,840
ice being incredibly nervous and nauseous but hearing music and then somehow you can melt into

915
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:49,320
the music and and moving your body and i think romeo and juliet was a piece of music that i felt

916
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,920
really at one with it was a love story and had so much drama and especially this the movie version

917
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:01,240
i think it was the prakofiev that and spanish music i intended to skate to malaguenia and

918
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:07,640
karman and these kind of fiery character pieces which you know also suited another side of my

919
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:15,640
personality you've described the feeling i'm sort of paraphrasing but profound nausea and the feeling

920
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:21,320
of thousands of pounds crushing your chest or something to that effect that's what it feels

921
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:26,840
like when you go out there and yet it's sort of amazing as i you know i think that's partly why

922
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:32,840
maybe as we get older we find something different in watching the olympics you know when you're

923
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:38,840
young you're watching it because it might just be all about the achievement but i think as we

924
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:45,000
age a little bit and we experience our own setbacks and we start to sort of understand

925
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,200
what our demons are all about part of what i think is amazing about it is trying to imagine

926
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:55,560
how they feel you know trying to imagine whether it's you know the start of the hundred meter free

927
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:00,600
it's like there's eight people lined up on a starting block one of them's going to win one

928
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:05,000
of them's going to finish last right one of them will finish last there's no denying it he or she

929
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,560
will still be the eighth fastest runner in the world for that day but what is the anxiety like

930
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:18,200
in that moment i don't know there are a few sports like figure skating where the margin for error is

931
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:26,920
so small because one you're out there for so long so the duration is long the technical complexity

932
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:33,880
is very high and three the aesthetic component matters meaning how you present yourself matters

933
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:39,480
again you can be scowling when you jump in the pool or get on the bike it doesn't really matter

934
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:44,280
you can't be scowling when you're standing there on the ice it's always amazing to listen to the

935
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:49,240
announcers as though they know what the person's thinking try to project that but presumably that's

936
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:55,880
been a skill as well right i mean is there anything in your current life that puts a fraction of that

937
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:02,360
pressure on you in a moment certainly not and i think it's it's something i was able to really

938
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:07,080
describe because i stepped away for a few years and then came back to compete again at the age of

939
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:13,960
24 25 and and i could finally articulate what it felt like and it was like battery acid running

940
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,760
through your chest with a thousand pounds of weight crushing you you're like how do i even move

941
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:25,240
and and again this is what really taps back into denial is you can't really identify with your

942
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:32,920
feelings you have to shut them down and i think that's why i found acting so appealing when i was

943
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:39,800
done skating was because there's there's a spectrum of humanity and actors are on the far

944
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:46,440
left and athletes are on the far right and normal humans are in the middle where when as an athlete

945
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:52,920
if you are have fear any feeling you have to shut it down you have to be impervious you're always

946
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:59,720
fine you're a robot you're projecting confidence and as an actor you have to take in every emotion

947
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:05,400
from the outside every vulnerability cultivate feeling because that's that's your paintbrush

948
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,440
that's how you live and as a as a human in the middle you have places you feel safe to be

949
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,680
vulnerable and open but you certainly aren't at work you don't cry when you see every homeless

950
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:20,440
person and and you learn in the middle but athletes are on the far far end of the spectrum

951
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:25,480
where you just learn to shut everything down because you're dealing with so much all the time

952
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:30,920
and just this is pressure and i think it's hard to learn to be a normal functioning human being

953
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:36,760
after you're an athlete it's i think it's almost in the same way you you're a soldier and and i

954
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:40,600
you know i hesitate that some ways to make the comparison because obviously we're not putting

955
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:48,760
our lives on the line and this is sport but the element of the human is shut down for the task

956
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,360
and it's all about the task and and that's something it takes time to learn how to be

957
01:28:54,360 --> 01:29:00,120
a human again after it's so interesting you the way you explain that which i guess i now see it's

958
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:04,760
after 2006 when you go and you take acting classes as you say that's a big part of i think

959
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,480
what enabled you to maybe come back in 2010 with a different perspective perhaps i mean yeah i think

960
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:15,160
it was the break from it because i think a lot of it is habituation so if you start competing from

961
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:19,400
the age of of five years old you're you're nervous but you're a tiny little competitions

962
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,480
and you know kids are really nervous even when they're seven years old you see them running to

963
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:28,760
the bathroom to throw up before they skate and they're pacing and they're crying and they've got

964
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:34,200
butterflies and these are just seven-year-olds at tiny little local competitions and so you're kind

965
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,280
of habituated at a young age and then your competitions get slowly bigger and then they're

966
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:42,520
national and there's more people but at the time you get to the olympics even though this is the

967
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,880
biggest stage you've ever been on it's been this steady ramp up to that and then i took three years

968
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:54,600
away from it and then i came back and so i and i was just doing shows and so i think i wasn't

969
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,800
constantly stressing my nervous system with these kind of nerves and feelings and so i think when

970
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:05,160
i took a break and came back i was just like part of you is like i'm never doing this again this is

971
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:10,680
how could i ever subject myself to this but then once you go out and you're performing it's this

972
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:16,280
most incredible high and so as an athlete i think you get used to these high highs and these low lows

973
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,960
of these lonely difficult moments where you're injured and you're dealing with so much psychological

974
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,960
stress to these moments where you're out doing what you ultimately love to do and the crowd is

975
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,720
cheering for you and you feel like you know you're paused in this most unique moment in time doing

976
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:40,520
what you love and after i retired you know life was just nice and that was wonderful for a year

977
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:45,960
and then life just felt flat because everything had evened out the high highs were gone the low lows

978
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:53,640
were gone and then you're kind of learning how to live without that paradigm i've read that 80 percent

979
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,840
of olympians or former olympians suffer or have at least experienced in some transient form a

980
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,720
form of depression does that i mean does that sound believable to you having been on the inside

981
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:08,840
certainly and i'm sure that the number might even be higher because again we don't as athletes we're

982
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,880
taught not to admit weakness and it's not only to the outside world it's to yourself because if you

983
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:21,080
admit weakness to yourself then you're undermining what you're capable of and the biggest tragedy

984
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:27,640
there's a you know there's multiple factors one mental health issues can be a stigma and so people

985
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,360
generally don't talk about them and they should and then on top of that as an athlete if you admit

986
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,480
that you're struggling it's going to undermine your own performance and and you don't want to

987
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:44,200
admit that to yourself or let your competitors know and then once you retire you lose your

988
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,480
identity and you lose your purpose and something you've spent a decade or two decades your whole

989
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,520
team of support and everything you do and everything you wake up for which is like this

990
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:00,440
moment four years down the line you like imagine yourself on a podium and and you've charted out

991
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:05,720
this whole path to get there and then all of a sudden you don't have the goal anymore you don't

992
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:10,440
have the identity anymore you're watching other people do what you did but they're doing it better

993
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:16,440
because they're the next generation and and you don't have a skill set that everyone else your age

994
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:23,320
does who was actively pursuing an academic education and went to college and interned and

995
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,680
really setting themselves up for the next 40 years of your life it's all been this rug has been pulled

996
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:34,840
from underneath you and so not only are you mourning your identity and have lost your sense

997
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:41,400
of purpose but now you see yourself as 10 years behind normal people and you don't even know what

998
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:45,640
you want to do but there's this interesting thing i've observed which is there's there are a subset of

999
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:53,000
people and you and apollo would be great examples of it where you seem to have made the transition

1000
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,880
so easily now you've made it look easy i'm not suggesting it's easy of course but you were

1001
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:05,800
basically able to take the rumba mentality of i can go harder i can go faster i can go longer i

1002
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:11,800
can go deeper than anybody just give me a new skill set and you know you emerge at one of the

1003
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:17,640
best colleges in the country and you kick ass and you know today you've got a great job in finance

1004
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:23,480
there are a handful of athletes who just make this transition and if you're saying it's hard

1005
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:29,080
i mean what's happening for most athletes i mean i mean i'm not asking that rhetorically like

1006
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:35,880
what does the graveyard look like for especially olympic athletes it's different if you've at least

1007
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:43,640
played five years in the nfl and you've managed to stash away seven figures but most olympians

1008
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:49,960
don't come close to scraping together that kind of money so what are they do they go on to become

1009
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:57,960
coaches and like how many of them are able to resume where they would have been or get back on

1010
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:04,040
that same path if they had chosen something else because they're obviously very capable but they're

1011
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,200
going to need new you know they're going to need to be retrained there's so many variables i think

1012
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:14,120
the mindset of an individual athlete versus someone that was on a team sport yeah that's

1013
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:20,360
a good point and then is this something where they went to their first olympics at 27 or 30 and

1014
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:24,920
they've kind of developed this identity and this group of friends were they actually in where they

1015
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,960
did they actually go to college and were they playing a collegiate sport because then you

1016
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,360
develop very differently than if you're a gymnast or a skater or speed skater and you've been

1017
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:37,400
homeschooled since seven and this is your world and it's it's myopic and then your personality

1018
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:43,320
type like how neurotic are you and what do you see as success and what's your appetite for

1019
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:50,440
the unknown i think some you know across all sports some people continue to coach they judge

1020
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:57,320
they they want to be in their sport and they want to be the big fish in the small pond and they

1021
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:03,080
continue to hold on to that identity as this greatest moment of their life and what to find

1022
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:08,840
them and then i think there's others that that prefer to be the tadpole in the ocean and you

1023
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:15,480
have to deal with this sense of insignificance and feeling lost and realizing the more you learn

1024
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:20,200
about the world the bigger you realize it is and then the more confused you are the more options

1025
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,400
and and i think i definitely chose the the tadpole and the ocean route and i moved to new york and i

1026
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:32,120
went to columbia and and i'm still learning who i am and and what it is i want to do and and

1027
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:38,200
redefining success because i think at the age you know when i when i was competing and when i was

1028
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:43,480
21 it's like oh well what's the next thing that seems really competitive and athletic and i can

1029
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:48,440
define winning and to me that seemed like finance you know i went i got a liberal arts education and

1030
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:53,800
you start to realize what's out there you realize that success is what you define it to be

1031
01:35:54,200 --> 01:36:00,760
and that actually happiness starts to be more important to you than what society quote unquote

1032
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:07,480
deems success because success is fleeting and maybe success is a moment but you're quickly

1033
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:13,640
replaced and what are you building your life around and so i think there's a there's definitely

1034
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:18,360
a value shift instead of just like this plug and play at first it's like i'm going to take

1035
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:23,080
everything and all this intensity i had in my sport and put it towards something else

1036
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:28,280
and be the best and just like show everyone and this is this is my new vehicle it's like

1037
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,920
just show me what to do and i'll get to the top and then you realize like is this mountain worth

1038
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:38,200
climbing even this is a formula that i knew before but applying it somewhere else this

1039
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,760
isn't actually what i want and i think it takes a lot of time and reflection and kind of self

1040
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:48,840
growth to realize like what's worth doing like what's worth like what actually is winning in life

1041
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,640
what do you think enabled you to figure this out because honestly talking with you sasha it's

1042
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:59,160
blowing my mind that you you are so wise beyond your years when you talk about that right i mean

1043
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:05,320
you have figured something out that most people never figure out in life and yet you have two

1044
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:11,400
thirds of your life still ahead of you in terms of years how do you think you made that transition

1045
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,160
think you made that transition i mean obviously there's some deliberate choices so you made a

1046
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:21,960
decision in 2010 not just am i going to leave the sport but i'm not going to wrap my identity around

1047
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:26,920
this sport either i'm going to go beat the tadpole i'm going to go and roll at columbia

1048
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,680
where frankly i'm going to suck because i'm competing with a bunch of whippersnappers that

1049
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,920
came out of high school and they're way better prepared than i am and i'm going to be doing an

1050
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,960
internship in something with a bunch of kids that are 10 years younger than me and probably a bunch

1051
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:44,360
smarter than me when it comes to these tangible sets of facts and skills that one would have

1052
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,720
learned and i totally appreciate what you're saying that part of that was the challenge of

1053
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:55,960
this is my new olympics my new olympics is going to be graduating first of my class and doing x y and

1054
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:00,360
z but but then what you described at the end there was another transition which is wait a minute like

1055
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:05,160
that's not even the way i want to live my life anymore which is it's not about being the best

1056
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:13,080
tell me how that realization and the application of that came to you i think it's in finding things

1057
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:21,000
to be hollow it's going down a path that you think oh if i'm just the most successful in this if i

1058
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,720
work my way up to the top i'll find identity and fulfillment and i'll be good enough

1059
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:31,880
and then you realize as you do it these things look sexy from the outside but once you're in

1060
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:37,720
them it's really not what it appears to be it's like people do this so they can show you the

1061
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:43,080
country club in the car and the the business card and maybe some people really love what they do

1062
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:48,680
and these are these are side effects but i think a lot of people do things for approval and for

1063
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:57,880
status in society and i think at a very young age i got used to being rewarded by the public but for

1064
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:04,440
for achieving and so i felt that what i needed to do had to be publicly visible and needed to be

1065
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:11,400
appreciated and to be validated and then i think as you you get older you know i i've spent a lot of

1066
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:17,960
time become very very interested in different buddhist texts and in meditation and just

1067
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:24,920
understanding this this bigger picture of life because i think we get so singularly absorbed

1068
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:29,160
in like what's in front of us in the moment and we think it's the most important thing and then

1069
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:37,000
the biggest struggle for me and something that i daily work on is what do i actually want to do

1070
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,680
versus what do i think other people will be impressed with and again i think this is like

1071
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:48,280
the resume versus the eulogy are you a fan of the book by david brooks the road to character

1072
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,360
or the second mountain being the more recent one i actually haven't read the road to character but

1073
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:57,320
i i read the second mountain and found it very very compelling and powerful and i think that's

1074
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:03,080
the phase of life that i'm certainly in and i have a lot of questions and i'm exploring like

1075
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:10,920
what makes a meaningful life and what actually brings me joy if i can peel away all the layers

1076
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:16,920
that my upbringing through sport and society have projected onto me because sometimes you you don't

1077
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,960
really know the difference and you end up doing things that people around you do because that's

1078
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,600
what they respect and ultimately we're we're social animals and we want to be respected by

1079
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:32,840
others to have a sense of of self-worth if you can really strip all those things away then you can

1080
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:38,600
start to have the dialogue with yourself of what you actually like and what if you really like

1081
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:44,120
something that the world doesn't validate who's gonna win like are you going to do something for

1082
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:49,000
them or you can just think for you and this is still you there's still tension there yeah of course

1083
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
yeah well let's play a hypothetical game because what i'm not hearing you say to be clear is

1084
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,280
you regret the decade and a half you spent killing yourself to be the world's best figure

1085
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:04,360
skater i'm not i'm not hearing you say that but i want to just play a thought experiment which

1086
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:10,280
is i'm going to put you in a time machine and i'm going to take you back and you're going to get to

1087
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:19,320
spend the next 10 years with 15 year old sasha so we're going to take you back to circuit 1998

1088
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:24,440
you're two years outside of your first olympics but now you i'm going to change the way you look

1089
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,520
so that the 15 year old version doesn't realize this is the adult version of her but you now get

1090
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:36,360
to become another coach slash mentor to the girl and you know everything you know so you know how

1091
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:44,280
the story ends if she stays the course how would you counsel her that's such a hard question because

1092
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:48,680
it's going backwards and tweaking something you don't know what's going to happen going forward

1093
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:54,840
admittedly yes we we run the risk of the butterfly effect here big time well let me ask you then i'll

1094
01:41:54,840 --> 01:42:00,120
start with some broad themes well this is the more i think about this question the more interesting

1095
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:08,280
it gets in that through the lens of if you only have knowledge through 2010 versus seeing where

1096
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:12,680
you are today it might it might be different let me make it an easier question then which is the

1097
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,360
question i didn't want to ask because it's such a common question which is what advice would you give

1098
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:25,320
yourself let's take a hybrid of that basically which is how much would you let her worry about

1099
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:33,240
what she's doing even if alleviating some of that worry subjected her to the risk of not being as

1100
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:41,000
successful it's really an interesting question because i would want to go back and say enjoy

1101
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:49,160
this time right this is enjoy being at the olympics enjoy being on the ice and moving and

1102
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,960
having your body like honed and trained to this this such this this incredible degree right it's

1103
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,440
it's such a rare fleeting moment later you're going to be jogging and you're going to be winded

1104
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,560
very different it really is incredible because ultimately it's like the a piece of this

1105
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:12,440
incredible journey that it means to be human right and it's it's a very extraordinary exceptional

1106
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:17,800
piece that you can get to you know the top of a spore that you can represent your country that

1107
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:23,720
you can see the world like it's it's such a gift but at the same time if you if you tell this

1108
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:29,480
younger girl there's so many things after you're going to go to college like the world is so much

1109
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:35,160
bigger than this maybe you wouldn't stick it out maybe you wouldn't stick out those really

1110
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:42,040
difficult times i remember a few years before my second olympics fourth of july everyone was

1111
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:47,400
barbecuing i was training at a center in connecticut i had the key to the rink opened up was just

1112
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:52,280
training by myself and then i went with my off ice coach to the outdoor track and was doing

1113
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:56,840
sprints and 100 degree heat and just broke down crying and i was like i don't want to be here i

1114
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:01,160
want to be with my family i don't want to do this and this is like oh nine this probably would have

1115
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:06,680
been in like 2004 oh before the second one just complete breakdown and in that moment if you're

1116
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:12,680
like you know what college is going to be amazing you're going to find poetry and you know your

1117
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:18,200
philosophy and it's going to blow your mind and buddhism be like why am i what am i doing like

1118
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,760
how many days am i going to have groundhog day of doing the same thing over and over in this rink and

1119
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:28,200
to this day i go to an ice rink and i smell that that musty smell of rubber mats and that's there's

1120
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:35,080
visceral there's like some ptsd associated with it certainly it's visceral and i think if you know

1121
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:40,600
that there's more and i guess i'm a person that i've got so many interests and there's so much i

1122
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,960
want to do and i have so much fomo i i want to be in every country and i want to get a phd and

1123
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:51,720
in you know buddhist studies and i want to do everything so i think if i knew more about the

1124
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:55,560
world in those hard times i think it would have been much harder to stick it out when that

1125
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,960
versus that being your only identity and your whole world well there's there's certainly a

1126
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:04,120
reason why they have to put blinders on race horses i don't know i guess that's sort of the

1127
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:09,320
thing that that about it that that feels i've had this discussion with a number of my friends who

1128
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:13,960
are you know in your situation right so people who were at one point the best in the world and now

1129
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:18,440
they're they're normal quote unquote right anything but trying to be yeah but you know what

1130
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:24,520
i mean there's a sadness there's a very famous athlete who was incredibly well celebrated and

1131
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:30,440
decorated 20 years ago he's really fallen on hard times now substance abuse a whole bunch of other

1132
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:34,840
things and you know sort of behind closed scenes there have been a handful of people that have

1133
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:41,160
tried to help them to really you know get him back from the from the edge of drugs alcohol

1134
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:46,040
all of the things that have sort of taken him to within about the inch of his life repeatedly

1135
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:53,400
and it's hard to look at him because i still i can't get the image out of my mind of him when he

1136
01:45:53,400 --> 01:46:00,200
was the best in the world at what he did and there was a whole country that viewed him as the most

1137
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:07,320
amazing thing they'd ever produced and now this entire country would abandon him in a heartbeat

1138
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:14,520
out of pure disregard and shame for who he is and what he's become and what seems unfair to me

1139
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:20,920
is that the same forces that lifted him up he was a national champion at 17 that you know the

1140
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:27,880
greatest that that country had ever produced the same forces that put the blinders on him to enable

1141
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:35,880
him to spend a decade of his life being the identity of a nation in a sport are the exact

1142
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:42,840
same forces that have abandoned him and given him nothing to cope with the complete emptiness and

1143
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:49,080
bitterness of his existence and the shame that has followed it if i had the ability to tell the whole

1144
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:53,080
story with all the details it would be a more powerful story but i think you get what i'm

1145
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:58,600
talking about because even though this is an extreme example it's not actually that extreme

1146
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:03,800
in terms of the emotions it might be extreme in terms of the net effects you know the near death

1147
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:09,640
and the drug overdoses and stuff but i think this is sort of the guilty this is sort of the guilty

1148
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:16,280
part that we have as the spectators right is we don't realize that the same thing that we throw

1149
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:24,600
on the athlete to sort of praise them is the very same gasoline that is to a bad fire as it is to a

1150
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:31,160
good campfire kind of thing if that makes sense athletes generally start young and so there's a

1151
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:37,560
conditioning that sets an early validation through performance and through through winning so

1152
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:43,240
it's Pavlovian and you're trained that that's how that's how you're defined and that's how you're

1153
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:50,760
respected and adored and so you you very much try to prove yourself to the world to get this

1154
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:56,280
this validation back but i think something that's important to remember is like you can be a healthy

1155
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:02,360
functioning human being or you can be the best in the world at something but you can't be both

1156
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:07,880
you believe that to be true i do because i'm talking about sports at this point in time but

1157
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:12,760
you have to sacrifice all these other things you have to sacrifice your emotional well-being

1158
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:19,320
time with friends like socializing in school these other things that would make you well-rounded

1159
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,240
and knowing you know someone telling you it's like oh it's okay if you fell or you want to

1160
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:28,520
take a week off and you're not defined by this you are a full human being and that's not what

1161
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:34,440
we value you for but that's not true and i think what happens is in sport you become valued for

1162
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:40,040
what you do and as soon as you stop doing it or stop doing it as well as you did all your value

1163
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:45,720
is gone and so it's like you spend you know it's like all blood, sweat, and tears creating

1164
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:52,360
the social cultural value by winning and as soon as you stop winning the value just like it just

1165
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:59,720
disintegrates so quickly. Being versus doing is a very eastern versus western sort of mantra

1166
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:06,360
yet when it comes to sports there seems to be no eastern it's all western isn't it in other words

1167
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:12,200
there's no buddhist athletes in the sense of it's just being like even if you're competing in the

1168
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:18,440
olympics from eastern parts of the world in the end athleticism always comes down to to what you're

1169
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:25,240
doing. Nike's slogan just do it we don't care how you feel it's about what you do it's funny i was

1170
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:34,040
recently reading an older version of the art of war and 50 pages was the introduction it went back

1171
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:38,840
to the genesis of eastern and western thought and philosophy back to confucius and back to

1172
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:45,640
aristotl and plato and in the west we always think that we do something that there's a mover

1173
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:52,360
and a move a cause and an effect that there's god and he created everything else and you go into to

1174
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:59,240
eastern culture and and it's symbiotic everything is a relationship god is everything and it's about

1175
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:04,920
relationships and the belief isn't that you cause something but that you are part of something and

1176
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:10,520
it's all interrelated it doesn't apply to sports but i think it really goes into the philosophies

1177
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:16,360
and the way that people in eastern versus western cultures have historically lived and and that

1178
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:22,280
really stuck with me because there's it's a lot of responsibility to feel that you cause everything

1179
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:28,360
that it's all up to you to a certain extent it's true in certain ways but there's there's so much

1180
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:35,080
that we don't control and that we still don't understand and that how things are all interrelated

1181
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:42,040
and i think that's that's important to remember and i think it's helpful as an athlete to remove

1182
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:47,400
yourself from this cause and effect way of living to understand that you're you're also a part of

1183
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:53,400
something one of the exercises that i find really helpful when i really get in my head is and it

1184
01:50:53,480 --> 01:51:00,840
sounds morbid but i just start imagining the world in my absence it's a game you play if you go to

1185
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:09,160
enough funerals but you realize the earth wouldn't slow down by one millisecond on its axis if i cease

1186
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:15,160
to be here which is not to say that i can't make a difference or that i don't matter i do matter i

1187
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:20,600
matter to at least a small group of people if nothing else my family but it's a way for me to

1188
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:27,720
get out of what you're describing which is like taking on more sense of importance it is really

1189
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:33,800
interesting the number of people for whom their removal from this planet matters is really low

1190
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:39,880
now of course the flip side of that is how do you create meaning and purpose which as you've talked

1191
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:47,400
about i mean did you know steve hulkam i did not you know i heard many stories about him and he's

1192
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:51,560
featured quite a bit in this documentary the weight of gold tell us a little bit about that

1193
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:58,840
how did that come about so a friend of mine germany bloom had found the director his name

1194
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:04,840
is brett and he was actually wanting to do a comeback story because steven was i think coming

1195
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:12,360
back for a second or third games had won multiple olympic medals he was living in a training center

1196
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:18,680
in lake placid and he thought oh what a great comeback story i'll kind of film him going into

1197
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:26,440
the games and had interviewed him 12 days before he actually died before he committed suicide

1198
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,680
and then all of a sudden that changed the whole direction of the film and then brought in all

1199
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:38,440
these other athletes some other athletes who had committed suicide and other athletes that had

1200
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:43,720
suicidal thoughts or really struggled with depression and really put a voice to what it's

1201
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:49,160
like to lose that sense of identity and for steven in particular he was living in the training center

1202
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:55,640
felt very isolated was starting to lose his vision was driving the bobsled car and you know

1203
01:52:55,640 --> 01:53:00,600
felt all this the enormity of it the pressure and not really having an outlet for how to talk about

1204
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:05,880
it and and would would say that after this olympics even if i win i'm gonna have to go live in my

1205
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:13,000
mom's basement because i don't have any money and you don't make any money doing what i do in this

1206
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,320
sport and i think it's just kind of the isolation and the pressure starting to lose his vision and

1207
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:24,440
just the enormity of it he really suffered with with mental health issues and

1208
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:31,000
there's a whole spectrum you know there's people like him and like speedy peterson

1209
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,200
who ended up committing suicide as well who might have had intrinsic mental health issues

1210
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,760
but then there's all these things that are aggravated by the fact that you you lose an

1211
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,560
identity when you're done competing and even if you're still competing just the enormity

1212
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:51,480
of the pressure and you're handling it alone and i think it's so important that athletes michael

1213
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:57,240
felds is a part of this so is shawn white and apollo ono are coming together and really talking

1214
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:03,320
about what the process of training is like and what the loss feels like on the other side of an

1215
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:07,880
olympic games and how they try to process it and from the outside it may look like they have

1216
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:13,080
everything and that they're this epitome of success but the sense of hollowness they have

1217
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:18,520
on the inside this loss of identity and where it takes them because you have these really incredible

1218
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:24,840
type a personalities that will do anything and sacrifice anything to achieve and then all of a

1219
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:31,480
sudden their whole platform for achieving it has been erased and i think it really leaves you like

1220
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:37,000
a fish out of water we want to say well all these people that have depressive tendencies or that

1221
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,480
have committed suicide have mental health issues but we make it sound like that's a binary

1222
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:45,000
distinction or something like that like they have cancer they don't have cancer or something like

1223
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,840
that i mean in the end i think we're all quite susceptible to quote unquote whatever mental

1224
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,880
health means you know i'm writing a book on longevity and probably the reason the book is

1225
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:59,480
taking so long to be completed is because i just can't finish this chapter on emotional health

1226
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:05,400
it's the final chapter it's the 17th chapter in a book but i feel strongly about writing it because

1227
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:09,720
through my own sort of journey i've realized that none of this other stuff like it doesn't really

1228
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:14,920
matter how long you live if you're miserable longevity means nothing if it's married to misery

1229
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,160
but it's very hard to do and people keep asking me oh how's the chapter on mental health coming

1230
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,920
and i keep saying well i'm not i'm not calling it mental health because it strikes me as just a bit

1231
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,320
of a loaded term it's really emotional health and it doesn't come with a diagnosis and it doesn't

1232
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:34,440
come with an icd 10 code it doesn't have a chapter in the diagnostic and statistical manual

1233
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:39,480
the dsm 5 and all these other things i don't know if it means that steve had quote unquote mental

1234
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:43,880
illness i mean the bottom line is it's just a tragedy in in this sense and it's just an extreme

1235
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:49,000
example but it doesn't in any way it comes back to this point which is maybe it's true 80 percent

1236
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,880
of athletes may have this total loss of identity that that can be coupled with some form of

1237
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,880
depression that follows this and i guess the bigger point because i imagine there are people

1238
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:01,320
listening to this who on some level might be saying like i can't even relate to what she's

1239
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:06,440
talking about like i'm saying this is the listener and it's true as myself like i'm not even close to

1240
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:11,720
being the best at anything like i'd give my left arm to be the best at something for one day

1241
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:20,600
what would you say to that person it's fleeting i think it's an incredible thrill but i think

1242
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:29,320
ultimately it's complicated we're driven by so many things but it's the life that you build it's

1243
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:37,160
the relationships and i think where mental health can be exasperated is when there's a lack of

1244
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:45,080
relationships steven was living in a dorm and a training center maybe some people love that and

1245
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:49,080
have a sense of camaraderie but maybe some people feel isolated from family and friends

1246
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:54,440
and so i think we don't realize how social we are and how much we need each other and we need

1247
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,360
friendships and family in our lives we become such an individual society that it's all about me and

1248
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:06,920
how good am i and what am i doing versus the community and i think that's why there's been

1249
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:13,240
such a spike in rates of depression is this feeling of disconnection and i think it's important to

1250
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:21,800
realize that the things that we see people winning an oscar or winning an olympic gold medal or

1251
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:25,400
achieving some great feat it's incredible and it's a life's work and it should be

1252
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:35,720
applauded but that shouldn't take away anything from the value of a connected loving life doing

1253
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:40,920
something that is fulfilling no matter what that is because ultimately that's something day in and

1254
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:45,880
day out that you have to hold on to because all these other things are moments they're moments

1255
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:51,160
that pass by where you're quickly replaced by the next person that wins the oscar next person that

1256
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:56,840
wins the olympic gold medal and you're holding on to a memory but that feeling is it's something

1257
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:01,560
you've done that you'll always have but you still have to step on to that next chapter and try to

1258
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:07,480
build those relationships and find satisfaction and fulfillment and build a life again so it's like

1259
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:15,400
be careful what you're trading for what how would you help somebody make that transition i mean

1260
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:21,080
obviously the first part of it on some level must be accepting what you've said i mean i accepted

1261
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:26,680
fully because i've seen it as well right i've i've spent time with the people who have been the best

1262
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:32,760
in the world and without exception everything you say is entirely correct based on that experience

1263
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:39,720
there is no sum of money there is no number of trophies there is no number of oscar statues that

1264
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:48,440
can accommodate for or compensate for bad relationships or a bad sense of self but the

1265
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:53,080
how question is hard right it's what do you do when you wake up in the morning to begin

1266
01:58:53,080 --> 01:59:01,000
resetting your identity around these things that are less fleeting it takes a lot of work and the

1267
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:10,760
work isn't easy because you are letting go of a whole system of values that have defined you

1268
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:17,880
to an extreme in your sport and to some extent define society as a whole what we value who we

1269
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:25,480
think you know it's the young it's the thin it's the beautiful who we put on billboards and applaud

1270
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:33,880
and read about in in magazines and so you have to be willing to let go of what society is projecting

1271
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:40,600
as this they're selling thin beautiful you know what are we selling as a society and is that

1272
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:45,160
actually making anyone happy you know we think oh when we lose 10 pounds we'll be happier like oh

1273
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:49,640
when i'm in this relationship i'll be happy and then you start to realize that these are kind of

1274
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:55,880
mirages or false illusions because it's profitable for companies to sell you something and it's

1275
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:01,560
easier than looking inside yourself and beginning to change the way that you relate to yourself and

1276
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:07,880
relate to the world and i think that's just there's many many books to read but it's a slow unfolding

1277
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:13,960
it takes time and you have to kind of be curious and want to put in the work but it's very difficult

1278
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,480
to let go of the only thing you've ever known of the way that you're supposed to live and what

1279
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:21,800
everyone else applauds it's much easier to just play the game the way everyone else is playing

1280
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:26,520
the game and then hold up the trophy and then everyone applauds you but then at the end of it

1281
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:30,520
you it's great for the day and then it just kind of wears off and then it's just like this

1282
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:36,520
this trophy but what are you now it's funny in some ways athletes have it the worst and maybe

1283
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,800
that's why athletes become some of the most powerful examples we have to talk about these things

1284
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:47,080
because i'm sure you've heard david foster wallace's this is water so anybody who's

1285
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:51,640
listening to this podcast will hear me go on and on about it constantly and i can't recommend it

1286
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:55,160
highly enough anyone who's hearing this at this point in time and don't know what i'm talking about

1287
02:00:55,160 --> 02:01:01,160
hit pause on your podcast player right now and then go to youtube and then put in david foster

1288
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:05,960
wallace this is water and about a 24 minute talk is going to come up and i want you to

1289
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:11,640
sit down close your eyes and listen to it and then i want you to do that every day for the next

1290
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:16,840
week and then every week for the next three months and then every month thereafter that's

1291
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:22,600
that's the doctor's prescription right now but he talks about not athletes specifically but he talks

1292
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:27,080
about this idea of self of worship we worship things we worship our intellect our bodies

1293
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:32,600
our wealth whatever and to your point they're all hollow i think it's just that athletes figure

1294
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:37,480
this out quicker because the window in which you can be great is so much narrower than say the

1295
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:42,360
window in which you could be rich or the window in which you can be the smartest or the window in

1296
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:47,800
which you can be the fill in the blank it's condensed it's so condensed it's just a super

1297
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:57,320
amplified play on the same theme in some way i i was actually just in ireland and it would rain

1298
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,360
and there'd be sunny for a little bit and there would rain and be sunny for a little bit and every

1299
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:05,400
time it would rain i would take it so personally like no like the day is going to be ruined and

1300
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:11,960
how did i plan a trip at this time and it's a short summer and i should have figured this out

1301
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,440
but then it'd be sunny five minutes later and it just showed me how much we identify we it's all

1302
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:21,080
about grasping and aversion we want to be successful we don't want to be forgotten and we

1303
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:25,560
usually things are on a longer timeline so we can't really see it because we're in it

1304
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:32,120
but the weather was changing so fast in ireland that i could kind of just see the folly of it and

1305
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:37,240
the undulation of human emotions that aren't completely rational it's only when it was that

1306
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:43,080
close together and tying over to being an athlete it's at such a heightened extreme it's such a

1307
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:47,720
short period of time where you're like this hero you're on a weedy's box you're everything and

1308
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:53,080
then you're forgotten and you know it's the next olympian that they put on the weedy's box and is

1309
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,240
going on a speaking tour and it's like okay you're just not that relevant anymore i mean i guess

1310
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:02,360
taking what i said a moment ago olympic athletes are literally the most extreme version of this

1311
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:06,760
because even you know the average player in the nfl might have a tenure of three or four years

1312
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:12,200
which is relatively short compared to baseball or basketball but as you said an olympian on average

1313
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:19,560
is one olympics which means two weeks can you imagine being the best in the world at something

1314
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:26,520
where your entire pinnacle is two weeks that is a real manifestation and it's hard for me to imagine

1315
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:31,240
that that's just a coincidence with this idea that 80 percent of olympians post their career

1316
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:35,960
could experience depression it's hard for me to believe that's just a coincidence the way that we

1317
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:44,120
identify the way we see ourselves is completely responsible for our sense of well-being

1318
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:51,160
and if you set impossible standards or you know that if you're second best in the world that's

1319
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:56,680
the biggest failure and disappointment you're making the margin for feeling successful so

1320
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:00,840
narrow and that even if you meet it it's only a temporary high it's irrelevant you're going

1321
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,080
to pass through it before you experience it and it's a temporary high too you know it's like

1322
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:09,800
a chocolate cake you eat the chocolate cake you feel great and then the chocolate cake is gone

1323
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:14,600
and you're like i shouldn't be in the chalky not exactly like that but it passes by and and i think

1324
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:20,280
that we have to think about the way we set up and define success and is success the same thing as

1325
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:26,680
happiness because i think in sports being successful means perhaps sacrificing and being

1326
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:34,280
unhappy and enduring for a very very long time to be successful and to be gratified for for moments

1327
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:40,360
or days but it's not the same thing as cultivating a sense of well-being and being content and loving

1328
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:46,840
your relationships and having meaningful work and what you do that has been very much undervalued

1329
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:53,000
in our society and i think we're seeing a little bit of a a lashback in the sense that a lot of

1330
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,760
people are interested in meditation and in yoga and in the sense of community and there's a little

1331
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:05,240
bit of lashback on this individual achiever as being the kind of wherewithal for for success and

1332
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:09,480
joy and the answer because people get there they're like hello this actually isn't it like you know

1333
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:17,560
turn around although it doesn't show at all you're expecting a little guy soon huh i am it's a

1334
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:23,720
testament to how tiny you are that even when you're pregnant you still look super tiny it's so exciting

1335
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:30,280
and the idea of being a mother and moving into this next chapter of my life is

1336
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:36,760
i i guess there's not words you know i try to think about what it means my whole life was so

1337
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:44,120
focused on myself and what i did that i think having the chance to live for someone else and

1338
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:50,360
to create a life for someone else is just again it's part of the arc of being human and i'm so

1339
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:55,880
excited for all that it brings and it's been a complete diversion from planning to see every

1340
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:01,160
country and to so many books that i wanted to read which have now all been replaced with books on

1341
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:05,640
expecting and babies and i'm just like oh this is putting me so behind in my reading

1342
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:12,040
but it's such a joy and reminder that that life is so much bigger than just you and

1343
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:18,360
and the gift and wonder of creating life you know all these things that we consciously work so hard

1344
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:25,320
to do and create and yet the magnitude of what our bodies can unconsciously do and create and

1345
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:32,200
give life to is just so incredible uh if you stop to think about it you know it's just it's a huge

1346
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:39,320
joy and as i was telling you earlier i would like my child to not play sports at a very high level

1347
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:45,320
but i want to fulfill you know in a healthy way all the fantasies that i never had in my childhood

1348
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:50,920
and you know the debate team and playing guitar and spending time in the you know wilderness

1349
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:58,280
classes so well i'm sure that there'll be a lot of detours and opinions of the child's own is your

1350
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:02,360
olympic metal somewhere in your apartment is it is it featured is it one of those things that

1351
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:07,320
sits in a sock drawer or is it something that that sits out there it's so funny my mom actually has

1352
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:13,480
it and it's it's on top of her it's kind of like mounted on top of her dresser it's as much hers is

1353
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:18,120
yours isn't it yeah and i think when i moved to new york i kind of left some of that stuff behind

1354
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:25,240
and it was very important for me to split and and create a new identity and not hold on to that so

1355
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:32,120
i really i really let it go and just focused on you know i adopted my legal name alexandra and

1356
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:37,800
i was alex at school and i just really pushed forward but when i wanted to take i had two

1357
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:44,200
olympic rings i wanted to take them with me and wear them my mom said i i should get to keep one

1358
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:49,320
of them she's like i you know i'm putting a lot of time in work and to be fair i can't even imagine

1359
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:55,960
now you know as i'm expecting just sacrifice and dedication for you know over 15 years of her life

1360
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:01,400
was about me with taking me to different ice rinks and physical therapists and and i was like

1361
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:07,240
you know what i'll leave her both rings you know she she deserves that but it's again you just

1362
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:14,920
really the metal is a metal and i'm not again it's what it represents and the journey of my life and

1363
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:20,280
how figure skating and sport define me is incredible and i can't imagine who i would

1364
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:27,160
be today without that but again it's an object so it's not something i feel compelled to have

1365
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:33,880
or put on a wall or have near me but it is representative of this moment of my life

1366
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:41,000
you were really fortunate to have motherhood demonstrated for you like amazingly right when

1367
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:48,520
you think about what you learn from your mom and how you're going to write your own playbook

1368
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,960
that's going to look different right i mean presumably your kid's not going to be figure

1369
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:56,120
skating 10 hours a day so it's not going to be you're the way you spent enough time in an ice

1370
02:08:56,120 --> 02:09:02,120
rink yeah it's like it's not allowed but what are the one two or three things that you will take from

1371
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:09,240
the lessons your mom lived the practice that you saw in her as a mother to your son and potentially

1372
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:15,880
other children down the line i think a sense of selflessness and commitment to the family

1373
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:23,960
and just what it means to be a mother and and what a privilege it is and i think

1374
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:31,400
in society we don't always honor and worship the mother in the way that she should be and that she

1375
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:37,320
gives life and and it's you know it's kind of in the past has been relegated to kind of like the

1376
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:43,880
home but what we respect is what people do out in the world it's just part of creating your own

1377
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:50,120
set of values and and thinking for yourself of like what is actually valuable and i think

1378
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:53,400
at the end of anyone's life they'll say it's like the time they spent with their kids and their

1379
02:09:53,400 --> 02:10:00,520
loved ones you know even these little small moments i think for me having been homeschooled

1380
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:07,320
and had my my whole you know a lot of the team around me focus on what i did it created a

1381
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:13,320
self-centered way of seeing the world and so i think this opportunity to step back and have not

1382
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:17,080
life be about like what am i going to do am i going to be good enough or what's the next thing

1383
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:24,200
or how are people perceiving me but giving the gift of life and having my my son and you know

1384
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:30,280
show me to kind of reawaken you know i think a lot of times when we get to a certain place in life we

1385
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:36,680
we're a little bit set in our ways of like what we expect what disappoints us how things should

1386
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:42,200
be and i think what i've heard from from friends and parents is that your child is your greatest

1387
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:46,840
teacher because when they see something for the first time or they ask you about something it's

1388
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:52,040
the sense of play that you kind of forget about because you're worried about responsibilities

1389
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:56,440
or how things should be i'm very much looking forward to that and i think you know i want to

1390
02:10:56,520 --> 02:11:02,520
expose my child to to the world to travel to show him how big the world is and to really just

1391
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:08,280
explore it and you know life is this incredible adventure and so it's not really about becoming

1392
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:14,120
anything like becoming a product or becoming really good at something it's i think just having

1393
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:21,160
this huge life full of love and an adventure well i mean i can't seem to the future but my

1394
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:27,080
intuition tells me you will embrace and succeed it succeeds maybe the wrong word but for lack of a

1395
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:31,560
better word you will certainly embrace and succeed in motherhood in a way that you've done in

1396
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:37,400
everything else to date and i suspect it will only enhance this journey that you're on and i want to

1397
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:41,960
thank you so much for taking the time and the being vulnerable with us to sort of share a lot

1398
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:48,680
of this stuff i i know it's hard sometimes for normal people like me to try to extract insights

1399
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:54,200
from the best people in the world at something but i think you've done a great job of reminding

1400
02:11:54,200 --> 02:12:00,600
us that whether you're the best at something that seems you know like there can only be one best in

1401
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:07,240
the world it is fleeting there's probably no arena in which that fleeting nature of greatness is more

1402
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:12,520
evident than in the olympic arena i'm glad you've brought us along this journey thank you sasha thank
