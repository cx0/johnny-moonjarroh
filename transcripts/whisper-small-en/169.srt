00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, Catherine. Great to have you back on the show here.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Awesome to be with you again.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It seems we're always discussing something controversial. And by the way, I already know what our third podcast will be about based on other controversial work you've done.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, you don't like to write about things that are simple.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, I don't seem to. It is the fate of the investigative journalist.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, let's start with a broad question, which is what attracted you in particular to this story and why did you decide that you had something to offer, especially in a story where not to let too much out of the bag too soon.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But it seems that this is not something that can truly ever be known one way or the other. So it seems a bit of a frustrating exercise.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah. Well, I've been covering the pandemic for a year for Vanity Fair. And, you know, as things have come a little bit more under control in the U.S., at least for the time being, my editor and I were like, what are the big unanswered questions of the pandemic?

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And we decided that the biggest is what its origin was. Now, you know, one might say, well, that was settled a while ago or seemingly settled. Right.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It came from nature, but we don't know exactly how or where.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But it was interesting because the head of the World Health Organization himself said, we still don't know, you know, and all hypotheses remain on the table.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So it seemed that with Trump out of office, with the WHO head himself raising this as a question, it was a good time to begin to look into what was the sort of what's the debate?

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What's the controversy? What are the questions? And what I uncovered was a lot more than I had really considered or bargained for when I started my reporting.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Maybe for folks, we should give a little bit of background on what a lab leak implies. Is there a precedent for such a thing in virology?

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because at the surface, it certainly sounds nefarious, right? It sounds like, well, that must be a deliberate thing. And it immediately falls into the realm of conspiracy theories.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But in fact, there's quite a precedent for viruses getting out of labs in the modern era. And I would define the modern era as the era of microbiology. Obviously, there weren't lab leaks that accounted for the Spanish flu.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But are there any that come to mind as you began your work here or that you had to learn about as a result of your investigation?

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah. So let me say first that lab leak, as it's understood, is not a unitary theory.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It ranges all the way from field researchers went into a bat cave, brought back natural samples into a laboratory, and that natural sample somehow leaked or a laboratory researcher got infected simply through aerosol transmission, which is what we're talking about.

21
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is not, I mean, the word leak implies like liquid gushing out of a pipe. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about aerosol transmission.

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But it could have been an infected lab worker. It could have been an infected field researcher bringing a sample back. But the phrase lab leak sort of runs all the way up to the possibility that someone in a laboratory was manipulating viruses potentially

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in an experiment to make them more infectious, to see if they would become more infectious, and that that new strain, not a natural strain, per se, but one that was genetically modified, could have leaked from a laboratory.

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So it really runs the gamut. It's not a single thing. And yes, you know, lab leak. This is not like, oh, how could that ever happen? In a way, it's like, how could it not happen? Because it's happened over and over and over again.

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know, you had very serious lab leak in the Soviet Union, which finally became exposed. It was an anthrax leak. You've had SARS leaks. You've had four SARS lab escapes since the SARS epidemic of 2002. So this actually is something that happens a lot.

26
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And it seems that one of the most significant examples of this was this Russian flu in 1977, which was an H1N1 flu that had been around in the 40s and 50s. It was being studied in a lab. When it reemerged, it seemed to target disproportionately people that were younger than 25, which at the time maybe didn't make sense, although after it was clear that this was the same virus that was around.

27
00:05:33,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So it made sense because obviously the people that were being afflicted were people that did not develop natural immunity. Again, there had been no, to my knowledge, of course, because you wouldn't have had the tools to have done so, there was no gain of function. Not that they could have genetically edited, but I don't believe there was evidence that it had been sort of selectively bred or anything like that. It was simply a question of this is a virus that's being studied in a lab. And then somehow that led to it getting out. And as you point out, at least four cases of the virus that was being

28
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
early SARS-1 virus escaping. And again, when you read the stories of these, which I've read at one point, all of them,

29
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it's these are mistakes that people can make. These are perhaps viruses that are not being handled with as much care as they should be handled. Some shortcuts are being taken with respect to how they could be handled.

30
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You know, I think it's important to point out that people talk about, you know, BSL-4 labs that are studying these incredibly dangerous pathogens. And so those are the most protective, highest containment labs where all the researchers are working in spacesuits with independent oxygen.

31
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But the fact of the matter on the ground is that you have research with incredibly dangerous pathogens taking place in laboratories across the world that have much less protection, like BSL-2 labs, which are basically the safety standard of an American dentist's office.

32
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, so you've had live SARS viruses being studied in overcrowded laboratories, you know, in China and elsewhere with very little protection, very few protections.

33
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So there's at least a precedent that a virus that's being studied can make its way out of the lab. In fact, there's a great precedent for it. But of course, that alone doesn't explain what could have happened here.

34
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's probably worth also explaining for folks who haven't been so steeped in this story, or at least reminding people of the typical way in which a virus can be transmitted between animal hosts and what it means to have an intermediary host and how, for example, those were identified in the cases of SARS-1 and MERS.

35
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, you know, it was presumed early on that like other past viruses, SARS-CoV-2 had a zoonotic origin, meaning that it spread somehow from an animal and jumped to a human, or that there was an intermediary animal.

36
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So possibly a pangolin, possibly a civet cat, and that it went from a bat reservoir to some intermediary animal to humans. So that is believed to be the case with SARS-CoV-1. That is believed to be the case with MERS, where there was a a dramadary as an intermediate host.

37
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And with the initial animal being presumed to be some sort of bat reservoir. With Ebola, it's believed to have a zoonotic origin, either a bat or a chimp. It's not certain yet. But that is the, you know, that is the long history of these viruses, that it has some kind of natural origin and then evolves and mutates in such a way that it can be

38
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
infected by humans.

39
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I think one of the questions here in the case of SARS-1, it didn't take that long. I believe it was, you know, in the order of about six months to identify its intermediary, which is what's it called? Like a civet? Like it's sort of like a little, it's a little.

40
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A civet cat. It's very cute.

41
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Is it a civet cat? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, a very cute animal.

43
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah. And obviously in MERS, as you mentioned, a camel. What's relevant about this is that the virus can acquire additional tools in that intermediary host before making that final leap. And then so the question is, how much of the transmission occurs between, say, the cat and the human, or once that transmission occurs, is most of the transmission occurring human?

44
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so as of now, which is, you know, directionally, call it a year and nine months post the first infection, we don't yet have an identified intermediary host, which implies that it exists, but it hasn't yet been identified or there wasn't one.

45
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And this might have traveled directly from bats to humans, for which there's clearly a precedent based on what happened in 2012, right?

46
00:10:39,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, let me just say that we don't yet have a designated animal host and it's not for lack of trying to find one. So Chinese authorities have tested up to 80,000 animal samples to see if they could find a host animal and have not been able to do so.

47
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So there has been, you know, you could think of it as an international bat hunt to find the host animal of this virus and none has presented itself yet.

48
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right. So we have we haven't identified the potential bat source of it. We haven't identified the intermediary of it. There is a close closest relative that has been identified, correct?

49
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah. So that is a sort of complicated question. But there is a strain, RATG13, which was found in an abandoned mine shaft in Yunnan Province in 2013, which is sort of the closest viral sample to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.

50
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it's about 96.2 percent identical to SARS-CoV-2.

51
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And what do we know about that? That I don't want to say accident, but that experience in 2013 where the miners were exposed to it. What do we know about their illness and what does that tell us about that virus?

52
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So there's a couple of really interesting things about about what happened in 2012. First of all, that it happened, what happened, but also how it came, how it sort of broke into the public domain. What happened?

53
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So just starting out in 2012, there were six miners who were given this very unpleasant assignment, which was to go to this abandoned mine shaft and dig, clean it out because it was thick with bat guano, which is bat feces, essentially.

54
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So they go in there and they dig for days and weeks and they become gravely ill. So they become admitted to the hospital and in Kunming University Hospital, so they get admitted to the hospital.

55
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The question is, is it a fungus? Is it a virus? They bring in an expert who analyzed this says it's a virus. They have pneumonia. It's a virus. Their symptoms were almost identical to COVID-19.

56
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So he asked, what were they doing? They were digging up bat guano. What kind of bat? It's this Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, which is the same one that triggered SARS-CoV-1.

57
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Three of the miners died. Three ultimately recovered. So this is a case that should have triggered worldwide alarm because it looked like the beginning of an outbreak again.

58
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the Chinese authorities never reported this to the World Health Organization. It sort of remained below the radar, except that this abandoned mine shaft became a destination for virologists in Asia who were going into this mine shaft and getting samples and bringing it back to their laboratories.

59
00:14:37,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Probably the most active samplers from this mine shaft were members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan. They dug up many samples, brought it back to their laboratories, and they sequenced a sample, which they called at the time 4991.

60
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And that was, as we would find out later, 96.2% identical to SARS-CoV-2. Except at the beginning of the outbreak, nobody knew about this mine shaft. Nobody knew that three miners had died, and no one knew about 4991.

61
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The only way that we ultimately found out about it is because a very curious, unemployed science teacher in eastern India started digging into this database of Chinese master's thesis and pulled up an entire dissertation about this incident in the mine shaft.

62
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Now, to be clear, it would not have been known based on the infection of those six mine shaft workers with basically a 50% mortality that there was any evidence that that virus could be transmitted human to human. Correct?

63
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It could have been simply that they acquired it from the bats, which is the most likely scenario in the presence of an overwhelming exposure to the virus, but that the virus would not transmit human to human. Would that have been possible?

64
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's right. That's right. We have no information that they infected one another. They were all exposed to this bat guano. They went to the hospital.

65
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It doesn't appear that the hospital workers got sick, so it doesn't appear that they spread it to other people, but they were desperately ill. And it's interesting to note, the oldest miner died first. He was the most gravely afflicted. He was in his 60s.

66
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So if we look back at this incident in light of COVID-19, there are a number of aspects of this that do look like SARS-CoV-2 in 2012.

67
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Though clearly it's a different virus given that, I mean, I think for a person listening, maybe not familiar with genetic distance, 96.2% sounds like, oh, that's a perfect match. But of course, that's not remotely a match.

68
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've spoken with virologists who have said, look, to try to take a virus from 96.2% to 100%, I mean, would take forever. I mean, that would be a very long period of genetic manipulation.

69
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So the point being, it seems unlikely, at least if that's true, that that virus ultimately became SARS-CoV-2. What did your work uncover with respect to that specific concern?

70
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Right. So the issue is, that is one sample that was taken from that mine shaft. But we don't know the whole universe of samples that came from that mine shaft. Now, that sample was taken to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which just to point out, is about seven miles away from what was initially identified as the epicenter of the

71
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:55,000
COVID-19 outbreak in this Huanan seafood market. But the issue is, there were hundreds of samples that were taken to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The database that housed these samples was taken offline weirdly a couple of months before the known start of the COVID-19 outbreak. So we're, you know, publicly, we're taking samples from the

72
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:23,000
whole universe of samples that emerged from that mine. Now, based on the fact that the Wuhan Institute of Virology collaborated with a number of US institutions, most notably, presumably the University of North Carolina, which I think we'll get to. Can we look at any of the grants or publications that came out of those jointly and surmise just how many samples were taken?

73
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Can we surmise just how many samples of coronaviruses were extracted from 2013 until 2019?

74
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, I mean, well, we know that there are hundreds, hundreds of samples that were extracted. And we presume that there was, you know, deep sequencing done on these samples. But again, we don't have access to all that information.

75
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So, you know, we don't know if, if any of those other samples may have closed the gap from 96.2 to 100%, basically.

76
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So again, just to ground everybody in the thought process here, if, if there's an argument to be made that that SARS-CoV-2 originated, in its final origination came from a lab, you basically have a couple of mechanisms that that could have happened.

77
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:47,000
One would be that the exact version of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the wild, potentially in this mine, was brought to the lab where it was being studied, but not altered before it infected, presumably a lab worker that ultimately led to the outbreak.

78
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Conversely, a very, very, very close cousin to SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the wild, again, potentially in this mine, where it was brought to the lab. And research was done on it, which we'll get to called gain-of-function research.

79
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And that closed the genetic gap, so to speak, from where it started to where it currently is, and what ultimately led to the outbreak through presumably some contamination within the lab.

80
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is that sort of a safe summation of the plausible scenarios?

81
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That is. And, you know, let me just add that the reason those scenarios exist as questions that remain unanswered is because there has been a fundamental lack of transparency that has essentially been enforced by the Chinese government.

82
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I mean there to distinguish between the motives of the scientists and the motives of the government.

83
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:09,000
We don't know whether the Chinese scientists would like a full accounting of everything that happened and are being prevented at giving one because the government is restricting it.

84
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So, you know, we really, the questions can't be resolved because there hasn't been transparency around them.

85
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So who would be the most preeminent scientist or scientists in China with respect to viruses? There's a pretty interesting character who leads the charge there, correct? She even has her own nickname.

86
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
She does. And, you know, it's one of these stories where as a journalist you feel like you can't even make this stuff up, right?

87
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:56,000
She Zhengli is the lead coronavirus researcher, the foremost coronavirus researcher in China. She is a sort of nationally revered, very well-known figure.

88
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So she is the lead coronavirus researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And she has this nickname, Batwoman.

89
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And that comes from her fearless exploration of these bat caves in southern China. So, you know, when you see her image, she's often shown wearing this spacesuit in the BSL-4 lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

90
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And she's, you know, she's like among these sort of sparkling firmament of internationally renowned scientists. She's nobody disputes that she's earned her place there.

91
00:23:38,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And she's particularly well-known for a key discovery from the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, which is she was the first researcher to figure out the mechanism by which humans were infected by that virus, which is through the ACE-2 receptors, human lung cells.

92
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So she identified the mechanism for transmission.

93
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Now, how long has the Institute been doing gain-of-function research? And maybe even before we answer that question, we could take a moment to explain what gain-of-function is. It's actually not perfectly...

94
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There isn't an exceptional definition for it, but I think we can loosely describe it.

95
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sure. So, you know, first of all, there are some people who say that all of virology is gain-of-function research, which is basically when you study a virus, you are seeing sort of what functions it gains and what functions it loses.

96
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
How does it infect? Is it going to become more infectious? And by what mechanism is it going to become more infectious?

97
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So gain-of-function research, put simply, is this idea that you are trying to test whether the pathogen can become more infectious. You're trying to give it attributes that it doesn't possess in nature as a way to gauge its own

98
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
effect, to gauge its infectiousness to humans. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

99
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No, no. I was just going to say, look, at the surface, I think if you're listening to this and you don't dabble in this world, that sounds a bit absurd, right? We're going to take a virus that may have a certain level of either virulence or lethality or transmissibility, some feature that makes a virus undesirable, and we're going to enhance that.

100
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So what's the argument for doing that? What's the argument for making a bad virus worse or making a good virus bad?

101
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So, you know, first of all, let me say this is hugely controversial and has sort of divided the field of virology because there are people who say this is absolutely crazy. You know, as one source said to me, it's like it's like looking for a gas leak with a lighted match.

102
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And there are other people who say this is absolutely essential. So the argument for why to do it is that in order to gauge the risk from viruses that exist in nature, you have to experiment with how they become infectious to humans.

103
00:26:41,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And one of the ways to do that is essentially to soup up that virus. You know, you can through genetic editing, you can make it more infectious and see if it is, you know, one of these things that it's a determination of where we should put our resources.

104
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You know, what do we need to protect against? There are other people who say, all right, we're going to these very remote areas where these viruses are tucked inside these caves. We're taking back samples to laboratories in crowded urban areas.

105
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We are then altering these pathogens to make them more infectious. Right. That is, as one person said to me, the definition of insanity.

106
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Is there any evidence that gain-of-function research has produced victories in the past? And we can even just keep, you know, SARS-CoV-2 off the list at the moment because I don't think there's any evidence it's benefited our fight against this virus.

107
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But is there any evidence it has aided with the creation of flu vaccines or other vaccines?

108
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Right. So the people who defend it say that you actually do need to do this kind of research in order to help with vaccine development, that this is the way that you figure out how to create resistance, is to look at, to experiment with how viruses might mutate.

109
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So that, for example, if you wanted to, you know, kind of forecast what the variants of SARS-CoV-2 would be, like, as I'm sure the audience has heard of, you know, the fearsome Delta variant, which is so afflicting many countries in the world and now increasingly our own.

110
00:28:40,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Part of, you know, part of what gain-of-function research can help do is forecast the mutations. But, you know, there are people who say that there is a lot of other ways to do this kind of research without running the risk of unleashing, you know, deadly pathogens that you can't control once they're out in the world.

111
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now, what's the U.S. government's position been on gain-of-function research?

112
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah. So this is, you know, when I started, let me just say, as a journalist and as an investigative journalist, I had been reporting on the pandemic for a year.

113
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And once I got into this question that you just asked, I was like, wow, I can't believe how controversial and yet how under the radar this whole question has been.

114
00:29:40,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So just to back up, in 2011, a scientist named Ron Fauchier did gain-of-function research with the H1N1 virus and created a pathogen that he said was the most dangerous and infectious the world has ever known through manipulations.

115
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So that sparked this outcry in the scientific community. A group called the Cambridge Working Group was formed, which was basically stood in opposition to this kind of research.

116
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And their expressions of concern led the U.S. government to impose a moratorium on any kind of funding of any kind of gain-of-function research of SARS and MERS pathogens.

117
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So then began a period of review, task forces, reports, analysis. And interestingly, in the very beginning of the Trump administration in January of 2017, that moratorium was lifted.

118
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But it was replaced with this framework, which had pretty much enough loopholes to drive a truck through. But it basically said any agency in the U.S. government that wants to fund this kind of research needs to have its own review process in place and needs to ensure that the entities that are getting U.S. taxpayer dollars are proceeding safely.

119
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I know that one of the things that has allowed people to sort of lose faith in the government has been statements that both Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci have made with respect to this when asked.

120
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Both of them have been asked if the United States government or specifically NIH has funded gain-of-function research. Both have emphatically denied it.

121
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I believe the direct quote from Francis Collins, neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported gain-of-function research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans.

122
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Also in May of 2021, Anthony Fauci told the Senate hearing that NIH and NIAID categorically have not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Can you evaluate the veracity of those statements?

123
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So here is where we enter this true semantic marshland because the feeling of, and I'm not talking about sort of wing nuts who want to fire Fauci, credible people who have evaluated this say that there is some sort of rhetorical grant that is going to be

124
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the gray area here. First of all, while they haven't funded research, while the government hasn't funded research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology directly, they have funded basically an intermediary nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance, which in turn has given subgrants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

125
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, no direct funding, but yeah, indirect funding. Now, part of the obligation of EcoHealth Alliance was to report back to the NIH and say, you know, here's our progress reports. Here is, you know, what the Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing with some of your grant money, and we ensure that they've been doing this safely.

126
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We don't know what's in those progress reports because NIH has not released them.

127
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That smells like a FOA waiting to happen.

128
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh, I'm the NIH now is like being buried up to their eyeballs in FOA's. Absolutely. You know, people want to know what did they know about this research.

129
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You know, there are numerous investigations ongoing into that very question right now, including from the HHS Inspector General. So there's a lot of questions around this and not, you know, and let me just say part of the reporting effort for me was disentangling conspiracy theories and there's, you know, there wall to wall conspiracy theories out there.

130
00:34:35,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know, disentangling the ones that have no basis in reality and then trying to evaluate the credible questions. Right. So in my investigation, there are credible questions, you know, about that funding. I mean, why were we giving taxpayer, why were we allowing taxpayer dollars to, you know, a high level Chinese laboratory.

131
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Where we now believe there was actually military scientists working in there. They're obviously an adversary as as one person said to me, hey, what's wrong with the Louis Pasteur Institute, you know, I mean, maybe we should make more of an effort to restrict our research dollars to the science laboratories of allies and not adversaries.

132
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Tell me a little bit about eco health alliance. Why are they acting as an intermediary? What's their mission? What does this organization exist to do?

133
00:35:41,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So Eco Health Alliance is a nonprofit which is run by a fellow zoologist named Peter Daschak and has a very laudable goal, which is basically to sort of map the viruses in the natural world and use that information in part to preserve wild spaces. Right.

134
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If we continue on the path of habitat destruction and we end up sort of, you know, cheek by jowl close to these viruses like Ebola, it's, you know, we're both extinguishing the natural world and endangering our own health and safety on this planet.

135
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So that is the goal of Eco Health Alliance. But the organization was pushing very, very hard for big funding dollars, not just to fund, you know, this research on a small scale, but had their eyes on something called the global viral project, which was basically a massive mapping of the world's viral strains.

136
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And, you know, as one of my sources said, then it's not just looking for a gas leak with a lighted match, it's looking for a gas leak with a blowtorch. Right. If you going into all of these wild spaces and you're pulling back, bringing back all of these dangerous viruses, you know, and potentially unleashing pathogens, you know, the scientific question here is, do we need to know all the answers to this?

137
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Or can we just kind of leave the caves to themselves and, you know, make sure that we closely regulate all of this activity.

138
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So fast forward to the Trump administration in the middle of the COVID outbreak. Trump gets asked at a news conference by a journalist from a right wing media outlet called Newsmax.

139
00:37:46,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Why is the U.S. government giving money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was inaccurate. But Trump answered, we know about that and we're going to shut it down. About a week later, the NIH is forced by the White House to sever or to stop the grant to Eco Health Alliance.

140
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You know, so at that moment, it looked very much like, wow, the Trump administration is really interfering with the science. This is critically important research in a time of COVID-19.

141
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But as the story has evolved, you know, there are real questions about what was going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, what our taxpayer dollars was funding there.

142
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And because of the lack of transparency, it's very hard to evaluate that.

143
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So let's go back to sort of January 2020 when the virus was identified, sequenced. I think it still looked somewhat contained, at least contained to China. They had shut down Wuhan.

144
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You mentioned that in September, I believe, of 2019, the database of all viruses extracted from the mine, presumably the database would have contained all viruses that they had been working on as well. That had been taken down.

145
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That is right. And we don't know why. And it hasn't been put up since then. So so you know what was presumably this transparent hub of international science with She Zhengli doing these, you know, research experiments and collaborating with scientists around the world.

146
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Suddenly, it was like the the, you know, steel doors in front of this, this institute just were, you know, shut, shut tight. And and nobody can see into what strains they had.

147
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:16,000
What I mean, there was a Lancet paper that came out in February of 2020 that very aggressively made the case that any suggestion that this didn't originate in nature was ridiculous.

148
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That was that a peer reviewed paper? Was it it was it an editorial? What what was the nature of that paper? Was it an opinion piece?

149
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, so, you know, it's important to note it was not a peer reviewed paper. It was a statement, which was published by 27 scientists who said basically anybody who is saying that this could have had a lab origin is siding with is trafficking in conspiracy theories.

150
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And we stand with our fellow scientists in China to say that this had a natural origin. It was a big piece of branding, right, that suddenly raising the question of the lab leak was aiding and abetting Donald Trump's xenophobic agenda, aiding and abetting conspiracy theorists.

151
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And as one of my sources said, it was like it was nailed to the church door. It became the orthodoxy and it really shut down debate.

152
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But there was something more consequential that emerged from that Lancet statement. The scientists who signed it asserted that they had no conflicts of interest.

153
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The problem was the person who had sort of designed and orchestrated the statement was Peter Daschak, who is the president of EcoHealth Alliance.

154
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
A number of the scientists who also signed were either employees of him or had received grant money.

155
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And even though he's saying that he has no conflicts of interest, he was providing money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

156
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So it was not a kind of neutral value free assertion, right? He has a stake in this. He definitely has a stake in this.

157
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:23,000
As somebody pointed out, you know, if it turns out to have been a lab leak, it could do to the field of virology what Chernobyl did to the world of nuclear science research, right?

158
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Transform the whole thing, shutdowns, restrictions, moratoriums.

159
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So Peter Daschak as the recipient of million, well, not personally, but EcoHealth Alliance as the recipient of millions of dollars in grant money definitely had, you know, a horse in this race.

160
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Besides NIH, who else would be funding this type of research? Would the DOD be funding any of this research?

161
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It has. DOD gave grants to EcoHealth Alliance, you know, and so as I spoke with investigators inside the U.S. government who were looking at COVID origins over the last year, what they found is that there is a big, they called it gain of function bureaucracy inside the federal government.

162
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:34,000
There are a lot of people who are invested in this kind of research, who are giving grant money for this kind of research. So they, you know, they have committed to this kind of very aggressive viral research.

163
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And so they have, you know, an interest in the outcome of this question. And as these investigators told me, it had an enormous impact on their ability to just neutrally evaluate the question of origin.

164
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is more of a question of speculation, but do you think that had all of this taken place in a world where it had not been politicized? In other words, if politicians, including the President of the United States had never weighed in on this, if this were a discussion that were only going to take place in the scientific community, do you think the reaction would have been as polarizing?

165
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It would have made a huge difference. I mean, partly this became so polarized because President Trump, at that point, lacking a lot of evidence in April 2020, announced it was a lab leak, that he was certain it was a lab leak.

166
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Is there any evidence that he had intelligence to suggest that, or was this simply an off-the-cuff statement?

167
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Right. So according to my sources, the most significant information that the U.S. government obtained came in the fall of 2020. You know, late summer or fall of 2020. So April of 2020, it was a lab leak.

168
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:32,000
April of 2020 really predates a lot of the significant information that the government collected. Couple that with the fact that on the same day that he declared he was certain it was a lab leak, hours earlier his own intelligence agencies put out a statement saying, we are certain that this was not genetically modified.

169
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:52,000
As it turns out, they didn't particularly have evidence for that either. But, you know, it's clear that elements of the U.S. government were sort of ping ponging off of these xenophobic declarations that President Trump was making.

170
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You know, not necessarily as a good faith effort to get to the bottom of it, but more as a way to bludgeon China. You know, and as you know, he labeled the COVID-19 kung flu. He made a lot of very sort of negative assertions.

171
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And it had this tremendous effect. It created, as one source told me, an antibody response within the federal government to the idea that it was a lab leak.

172
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Was there censoring for these ideas or questions on social media? I wasn't particularly paying attention in the spring of 2020 to this, but was this the type of thing that if you had posted something about this on Facebook, where is it going to be taken down? I mean, what was the level of curiosity around this and how much was being explored?

173
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Well, it's interesting because, you know, some social media sites, I believe, including Facebook, were labeling posts like this as conspiracy theories. And there has been some reversal since then. You know, also in the media where you have now sites like Vox that were, you know, posting disclaimers about conspiracy theories are now lifting those statements as the idea of a lab leak.

174
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And that's why I think Facebook has gained in some credibility.

175
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So let's let's march through the government a little bit more here in terms of the the efforts that were made to sort of try to get to the bottom of this, because really everything we're talking about is not really front and center. Right.

176
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,720
And so I think that's where the central point of the

177
00:47:48,720 --> 00:48:03,000
business center is containing this virus vaccine development. I mean, there are real crises going on here. And presumably one could argue we'll look at this point. And by this point, I mean, say in the spring and early summer of 2020.

178
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:22,000
There's a lot going on in this country, right? And I think we've seen a lot of things, you know, we've seen a lot of these obstacles. And I think that's an interesting question.

179
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And I think we've seen as much matter what the origin of this virus is, as, you know, what our response is going to be. And obviously, a year over a year ago, there was there was great uncertainty about that.

180
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Is the window missed even by that point?

181
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I mean, there's always like the most interesting thing you'd want to do is gather serum samples and understand the the seropositivity of people within that vicinity and try to get a signature that way.

182
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Any efforts made by the WHO or others to do that or this or the CDC in China?

183
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Well, you know, this is very interesting because I interviewed Dr. Robert Redfield for this story and he was the CDC. He was the head of the US CDC.

184
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You know, he said to me that from minute one of of his learning of this virus, he began thinking about the Wuhan Institute of Virology because he knew of this risky gain of function research they were doing and wanted to rule them out as a potential source.

185
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And he offered to send in a team of experts to do exactly what you're saying, you know, to do this widespread testing, to do antibody testing of all the researchers there.

186
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
As he said to me, you know, I could have, you know, had we sent in a team of experts, I would have been able to rule.

187
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I could have presumably if the laboratory was not a source, I could have ruled it out in a couple of weeks. But China, you know, whether they were covering up a lab leak or because they were just reacting the way an authoritarian government does, they immediately circled the wagons.

188
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:25,000
They refused to let in a team of experts and they did start destroying records. You know, that is absolutely part of what they did. So, you know, there is no question that we have lost massive ground in our ability to understand the origin.

189
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And has the Chinese government allowed anyone to go back to the caves in Wuhan where the original samples were identified, where RATG13 was found to continue bioprospecting?

190
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah. I mean, not only have they not allowed it, they have actively arrested journalists who have tried to go there.

191
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The BBC sent a team of journalists there in December of 2020. They were tailed by Chinese police. They found a big truck blocking access to the mine shaft.

192
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The Wall Street Journal sent a reporter in on a bicycle and he was detained by Chinese police and questioned for about five hours.

193
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And, you know, his notes were confiscated. So the Chinese government has been blocking access to this mine shaft.

194
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So let's talk about some of the lines of evidence both for and against this. I mean, I think what's what's clear here is one, there's a precedent for this happening. Right.

195
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So it's an absolutely plausible scenario. Two, unfortunately, because of the nature of the Chinese government's behavior and by extension, the US government's behavior, there's ample reason to believe in a conspiracy.

196
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But by no means is that necessary. In other words, this virus could have completely occurred in nature and the Chinese government would probably still behave the exact way it did.

197
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And the US government would have behaved exactly the same way it did. So, you know, unfortunately, those things don't really, I think, move the thinking or the evidence one way or the other more than the other.

198
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But now let's talk about some of the features of the virus, because I think this is where it gets very I mean, not that not that not that what we've said hasn't gotten interesting, but but the biology of this is also quite interesting. Right.

199
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah. So, you know, there has been a lot of let me first say that I don't think there there is no information that is in the public domain, either regarding the viral sequence and the sort of oddities of the viral sequence, you know, or regarding other

200
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:13,000
circumstantial evidence that can answer this question one way or another. You know, you when I started reporting this, there was, you know, there were plenty of articles that were like, well, maybe this and maybe that, you know, but the information that is in the public domain doesn't get you there.

201
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Some attention or a lot of attention has been focused on what is called a furin cleavage site in the sequence. And that is, you know, part of the strain that one virologist told me is a sort of signature of genetic editing of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, that in a number of the strains they've worked on and manipulated and

202
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
published papers about, you see the insertion of a furin cleavage site in the in the viral sequence. And that is the spot on the sequence that makes it more infectious to humans. So Nick Wade, who's a former New York Times reporter, you know, he published a long piece sort of analyzing the question of the science and the

203
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
science and the science of the human body. And I think that's a very interesting question.

204
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That was he told his wife, that was the smoking gun, you know, and then he knew it was genetically edited. Since Nick Wade's piece came out and got a lot of attention, David Baltimore sort of walked that back and said, well, not really.

205
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And then other people have come out and said, well, you find furin cleavage sites and sequences in nature, and it doesn't necessarily have to be reflective of genetic editing.

206
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That's been my find as well. I mean, I've spent far more time on this than I wanted to, because it's one of those.

207
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Everybody does.

208
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, it's one of those things you sort of think, well, look, I'm going to just read these three articles and then but then you have to read every single reference to those articles.

209
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And I mean, truthfully, I'm going out of my mind at this point, and I don't want to read any more on this because it's too much.

210
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But, you know, that's one of the rabbit holes I went incredibly far down. And there's just outright contradictory information there.

211
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Now, I haven't spoken to Nicholas Wade, but in his piece, he says there is no evidence of furin cleavage sites in any beta coronaviruses that are SARS like.

212
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And yet I actually found several references for papers that contradict that, including a paper published in 2018 that found a furin cleavage site in MERS, which is a SARS like beta coronavirus.

213
00:55:49,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So to me, the presence of the furin cleavage site, which to your point makes this much more infectious than SARS one.

214
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You had commented that that SARS one, you know, it transmits through the ACE, the ACE two receptor.

215
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Well, this is on the order of like an order of magnitude more transmissible because that S1, S2 subunit is cleaved and now it has an enormous affinity for that ACE two receptor.

216
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So a more interesting question to me is the nature of the codons that exist there. So the furin cleavage site is always a or not.

217
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Actually, I believe it is. I believe it is exclusively a proline, arginine, arginine, alanine sequence. And not to bore people with too much biochemistry, but you have three nucleotides that make up each codon.

218
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So you have redundancy in the system because there's only 20 amino acids, but you have 64 combinations with all of the nucleotides.

219
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You have more than one way to get an amino acid. So what I think also got a lot of attention in Nick Wade's piece was the I think it's a CGG arginine.

220
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And that is a very unusual arginine. It's only typically present in 5% of coronaviruses, meaning only 5% of the time when a coronavirus needs to make an arginine, does it use a I think it's CCG or CGG.

221
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Okay. But when you go and look more deeply in the literature, it turns out that you saw that in other furin cleavage sites of other coronaviruses that also had very little of that.

222
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:55,000
In other words, there was another coronavirus that I saw that only had 3% of its arginines being either CCG or CGG, but it still showed up in its furin cleavage site.

223
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And there's no ambiguity about whether that was naturally occurring or not. So does that mean it occurred in nature? Does that mean it was manipulated in a lab? It's still very hard to know.

224
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So I don't think really in any dimension of this, there is no smoking gun per se. What there is is smoke coming out of a lot of windows.

225
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You know, that's what I saw as I was reporting. There is enough smoke coming out of enough windows that we cannot take the lab leak hypothesis off the table.

226
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And so for me, the most credible people on this, they're not saying it was a lab leak. What they're saying is, why can't we have a full investigation?

227
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That's what we don't have. We have not had a forensic investigation. And so if we haven't had a forensic investigation, why are the scientists acting so unscientific by saying it wasn't a lab leak?

228
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:16,000
How do they know? They don't actually know. Just like we don't know that it was or it wasn't.

229
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But there is enough of a suspicious fact pattern that it requires investigation.

230
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah. Of all the things that I have read, and I think at this point, I don't know what I haven't read. I feel like it's just so overwhelming. I think the most compelling.

231
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Welcome to the club. Yes.

232
00:59:41,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think the most compelling mechanistic answer. So there's lots of circumstantial reasons, right? The Lockham's razor says, you know, in the middle of fall slash winter. So in Q4 of 2019, when there are no bats, they're all hibernating.

233
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You have a breakout in a major population center that's doing research on it. So all of those things aside, from a purely biological mechanistic standpoint, I think the most convincing piece of evidence for a lab leak is that for about a year post this virus being in humans, it didn't change.

234
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:51,000
We're only now seeing variants of this virus, right? Like the Delta variant you mentioned earlier. That strikes me as interesting given that given the ubiquity of this virus, so how many people were infected, suggesting just how stable this thing was by the time it got into humans, meaning a lot of the tinkering got taken out of it sooner.

235
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Now, so one argument would be if this were a virus that got manipulated and naturally selected through humanized mice, which is to say mice that have ACE2 receptors in their lungs, which are the exact mice you would use to do this type of research.

236
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:25,000
In fact, the mice, which we know were being used for this type of research. Yes. That makes sense to me that, you know, you could easily have a virus that has now reached its state of maturation. It gets out now into, you know, the wild.

237
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And it takes quite a while to evolve into its new variant. What about you? Like, where does that stack up in terms of biological reasoning in favor of a lab leak versus not?

238
01:01:41,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So, you know, there are one scientist, Alina Chan. She's at the Broad Institute. And she has really advanced that idea and had a preprint paper to that effect, which is the idea that this virus seemed immediately ready to infect humans and didn't appear to undergo the sort of all the early mutations

239
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that you saw in SARS-CoV-1, right? So it seemed sort of primed for human transmission, which in her view argued for a lab leak. But then you have scientists on the other side of that who say, actually, if you look at this strain, this is not maximized for human infectivity.

240
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:44,000
If you were going to set out to create this in a laboratory to maximize human infectivity, this isn't it. So I think those are, again, two competing versions of this.

241
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But they're saying very different things. Like, I don't think that Alisa, is it Alisa Chen is her name? Alina. Alina Chen. I don't think her argument is that it's maximized in its potential.

242
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I think if I'm understanding her argument correctly, it's that it's reached a steady state. It's in an equilibrium. And I think that's a very different argument to the one that's being posed in the other direction, which is that, oh, well, if you were going to make this, you could make a much better job.

243
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I think that maybe gives a little too much credit to scientists. Like, you know, it's sort of like saying, well, you know, when those bombs dropped on Hiroshima, I mean, they were good, but they weren't as good as they could have been.

244
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I mean, come on, they could have been way more lethal. No, no, I mean, like, you know, I have to say that it is sort of a red herring argument because, OK, so let's say it's not like the perfect bio weapon to infect all of humanity overnight.

245
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That wasn't its intended purpose. Right. The credible people who talk about a lab leak are not necessarily saying it was a bio weapon. It could be the accident of a sloppy, you know, a moment of momentary laughs.

246
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah. So again, I've always found that argument to be completely nonsensical because one, if we believe in the broad idea of gain of function research, it's not bio weaponry to even if you say, well, no, but if you're going to go to the trouble of doing gain of function research, you should try to make the most virulent, deadly strain imaginable.

247
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:35,000
OK, but are you going to make that in the first, you know, let's assume it takes 100 steps to make that. And what happened if we were at step 60 when this leak occurred? Right. Does that mean we weren't on a path to making it better?

248
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So so again, to me, that argument is meaningless, actually. Right. There is a there's a lot there are a lot of red herrings in this debate.

249
01:04:43,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So given all this sort of loose smoke that's sort of diffusing from the ground out of windows here and there, how would you think about trying to synthesize the arguments that most favor the consensus view that this virus occurred naturally versus the contrarian view, for lack of a better word, that this virus emerged from a lab?

250
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:21,000
What would you say are the most compelling features that favor the former? First, let me just say that I actually don't think there is a consensus view at this time.

251
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think the consensus has been shattered and the scientific community is really divided. That said, I think, you know, the strongest argument for a zoonotic origin is the precedent of precedent.

252
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:59,000
A precedent of previous of previous SARS outbreaks, you know, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. And you look at those and yeah, those are SARS outbreaks that have a zoonotic origin that has been identified.

253
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Right. So it would make perfect sense that this would this is the big one. You know, this has come on the heels of those outbreaks.

254
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You know, and you add into that, you don't have any specific smoking gun evidence to contradict that. Right. Even though a host animal has not been found, an intermediate animal has not been found.

255
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So I think those, you know, that in and of itself is sort of the most basic, the most basic argument for it.

256
01:06:38,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And to build on that really, you know, SARS-1 traveled something like 900 to 1000 miles from its original site using two intermediary hosts. So to your point, the argument that, well, if this originated in a bat in a cave 1000 miles away, there's no way it could make it to this populated area. No, that's not true. It certainly happened in the past, right?

257
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It certainly has happened in the past. But let me just say that is one of the that is added to the mystery here, because, you know, what people are saying is, well, if it started in southern China in Yunnan Province, why don't we see a trail of infections up to Wuhan? We don't.

258
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So it looks like Wuhan in central China is the origin of this outbreak. Why? Right. So the original theory was there is a host animal and it could have been a sample at the seafood market in Wuhan. But no, you know, all of this testing has not turned that up.

259
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So, you know, in order to account for a natural origin, you have to find a way to argue how in the dead of winter in central China, you know, in a market that didn't sell bats, didn't have bats at a time when most bats are hibernating, you know, how do you have how do you have this outbreak?

260
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You know, and then you look at, you know, the Chinese scientists themselves were like, oh, we know where it came from. It came from these labs. Two Chinese scientists very early on in the outbreak posted a preprint paper saying, well, we surveyed the area around the seafood market.

261
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And there are these two laboratories that have all these bat samples. So we think it came from them. And that preprint paper was immediately taken down. But, you know, you have this problem of how to account for how it started in Wuhan.

262
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Now, again, to go back to evidence in favor of the zoonotic origin, it could be because I don't think anybody disputes that the bats weren't transmitting it to people in the fall or winter.

263
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I think everybody agrees that by the time September, October, November rolled around, the bats themselves would have been in hibernation. So the probability that a bat directly transmitted it to a human in, say, November, December, exceedingly low.

264
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Of course, the bats could have passed it on to intermediaries before then and or the bats could have transmitted it on to a person or persons before then who didn't really become that ill but somehow managed to make their way to Wuhan. Correct?

265
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Yes, although there is a wild card in this, which is that the virus in many cases is asymptomatic. So there are people who are arguing for an even earlier origin than we knew.

266
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Such as the summer of 2019.

267
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Right. They're like Dr. Redfield is one of those people who has said that he thinks the origin is actually a lot earlier and that it's very hard to pinpoint a date because of the problem of asymptomatic transmission.

268
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Right. And, you know, you got to take a step back and remember what it was like circa May of 2020 when the very first papers were coming out looking at zero positivity, suggesting that the case fatality rate was, you know, infinitely lower than it had been previously identified.

269
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So, you know, when we were first thinking about this as, oh, my gosh, like two percent of people or eight percent of people who are getting this are dying.

270
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And it's the realization was no, it's eight percent of people who are wildly symptomatic are dying or. Right. And then the more we begin to test people, the more that number began to fall.

271
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:05,000
But it wasn't until serology was being done on asymptomatic people. This was done in Santa Clara, a very controversial study by John Ioannidis.

272
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:13,000
It was done in New York. You basically began to see, look, this has got a lethality of about one in a thousand people infected.

273
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So if you then extract, you know, that back to China, there's a scenario in which 500 people are infected, none of whom really get sick or think anything of it beyond, you know, it's just a it's a regular cold.

274
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But, you know, someone threads that needle of getting up to Wuhan. So that there's at least a plausibility of bat to human to Wuhan in that timeframe. Correct.

275
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Correct. That is right. Yes. If that were the case, it's would still be interesting to identify the bat of origin, but it sounds like that's not happening yet.

276
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So let's chalk that up to first on our our wish list. Right. So we were creating a wish list of how one would get to the bottom of this.

277
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It would be a full court press to identify, you know, to do basically an amazing prospecting exercise to look for the bat host potentially.

278
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:20,000
But but but just to say that in a way has been done. Right. That's potentially what's in the database that was taken out in 2009 in September of 2019.

279
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:35,000
But even since, you know, since the covid outbreak and and so that is post dating what was in the database, there has been a huge hunt and widespread testing of wildlife samples.

280
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I mean, there has been a big, big hunt for the host animal, which has not been found.

281
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And has that hunt been carried out mostly by Chinese scientists or has been a worldwide effort?

282
01:12:47,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It's been a worldwide effort, but, you know, the Chinese authorities have tested. I mean, the the count and and the WHO report talks about this, something like 80,000 animal samples have been tested in search of a point of origin and has not been found.

283
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:23,000
OK, so then on the heels of that, another scenario is that a bat infected an intermediary, which either infected humans or another intermediary, which ultimately infected humans.

284
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Several of those animals have been proposed and several of those animals could have existed at the Wuhan market in the winter.

285
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It's been found that the animal was, you know, a very large animal.

286
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And yet it's still alive, still alive, not necessarily kept in the most sanitary conditions.

287
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
That seems like a very viable scenario.

288
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And the biggest challenge to that is that very few stones have been left unturned in the search for what those animals might be.

289
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So, you know, that is a very logical scenario, except that there's no evidence for it. That's the problem.

290
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Other than precedent.

291
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Correct. Yeah.

292
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So I just want to make sure I'm not missing a scenario. Is there any other scenario that involves this virus infecting people having not been to a lab first?

293
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You know, one thing that has been talked about is the people who live around these bat caves, who have had exposure, who have tested positive and larger numbers previously for SARS antibodies.

294
01:14:43,000 --> 01:15:00,000
You know, but you still have the same problem of if that is the or if that is a possible origin is a natural escape in location in southern China to villagers who live around those mines.

295
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
How does it get up to Wuhan without leaving a trail of infection that could be documented? Right. That's the that's the problem.

296
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Right. So then on the other side, we have a scenario where researchers are identifying this virus by identifying its original host and themselves get infected through that, bring the bats or the virus itself into the lab.

297
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And early in their tenure with these animals or with the virus rather, there's a contamination. I mean, I really think of these as two sides of the same coin, which is gain a function versus no gain a function research.

298
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But nevertheless, the virus has been brought into the lab. I mean, that's basically the other side of this coin. That's right.

299
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:28,000
The most compelling argument for that appears to be at least to my reading, the contrapositive of what we just said, i.e., it's the absence of either the original bat or the intermediary host, coupled with the argument made earlier about the relative lack of genetic drift or mutation once the virus took hold.

300
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In 2019, in late 2019, the stability of the virus, basically.

301
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You know, I think here, first of all, there is there is a lot of precedent for a lab leak, as we've seen. I mean, there is a long there is a long history of this. There is a proximity argument, which is why Wuhan?

302
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Well, here are these laboratories that have the largest collection of bat samples really in the world who were doing some of the most aggressive testing. So, you know, there's that smoke coming out of that window.

303
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We know that they were doing aggressive gain of function research in which they were manipulating pathogens. And we also know that they were doing it not just in a BSL-4 setting, but in a BSL-2 setting.

304
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And then you do have the Alina Chan argument that, you know, you do not see the sort of wide range of mutations initially in transmission that you did with SARS-CoV-1. So I think there's those arguments.

305
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, and I guess you could almost break this down into two arguments, which is what's the likelihood that this virus was brought into or created in a lab versus what's the likelihood it escaped?

306
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:21,000
The second probab- so you could break this down into two probabilities, probability that this virus was brought into a lab and then really a third one, probability that this was manipulated in a lab and then probability that this thing escaped or could have escaped.

307
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So if that's P1, P2, P3, P3 is like close to one. That could be taken as a foregone conclusion, meaning the probability that a virus in a lab can get out is very high. We know about the bad ones that have happened, but what we don't know is how many times has, you know, research been done on a virus in a lab that is of totally no consequence to humans and it gets out.

308
01:18:48,000 --> 01:19:02,000
We wouldn't know about it, but that could happen all the time. So if you're supposed to be functioning at BSL-4- and by the way, I mean, I'm not saying this to sort of pick on the people doing it. BSL-4 is a miserable environment.

309
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Like you couldn't pay me enough to be a viral researcher working in a BSL-4 environment. I would rather be painting roofs with tar in July than I would be working in a BSL-4 lab. So I can totally understand why there's a natural human inclination to take shortcuts with procedure there.

310
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:40,000
So I almost think of like that third step of could this have escaped the lab as of course it could have. So it's really just a question of what's the likelihood that this thing made its way into a lab and got tweaked.

311
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And that's where you get into these other questions of, boy, the people who claim it didn't aren't doing themselves any favors in the way they're acting. You know, the EcoHealth Alliance, the Lancet paper doesn't look good in the way that they're acting.

312
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It doesn't look good in the light of day.

313
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:26,000
No, it does not look good. You know, which is back to one of the groups that I talk about in my Vanity Fair article is this group that calls themselves drastic, which are these scientists who are independent researchers scattered around the globe who became, you know, curious about this, obsessed by this,

314
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:35,000
wanted to get to the bottom of it. But, you know, I interviewed a number of them. How many of them are anonymous versus identified, by the way?

315
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:51,000
There's a handful who are anonymous. And I did not write about any of those who were anonymous who I didn't speak with because you really cannot assess the agenda of someone who is anonymous and you're not interviewing.

316
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I mean, you don't know whether it's, you know, Steve Bannon hiding behind a pseudonym. So but, you know, for example, the Indian researcher who calls himself the seeker on Twitter, he's a science teacher in eastern India who was the one who uncovered this Chinese master's thesis.

317
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I was able to interview him. You know, a lot of those people I interviewed, they said the same thing to me.

318
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I got into this because I wanted to know why the scientists were asking, acting so unscientific.

319
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:46,000
You know, why do you take a hypothesis off the table without evidence? Right. If you're having an investigation, don't you pursue all hypotheses in an equal fashion until you have real evidence.

320
01:21:46,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And in fact, you know, the World Health Organization partnered with a group of experts who went to China and were basically sort of led on this, you know, highly restricted tour by the Chinese authorities and issued a report in which they said, oh, the lab leak hypothesis is highly unlikely.

321
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I obtained a U.S. government analysis of that report, which said, you know, the report is essentially ridiculous. It concludes that on the basis of no evidence. And in fact, one of the lead researchers on that expedition was Peter Daschak of EcoHealth Alliance.

322
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So, you know, there has not been a neutral. Wasn't Peter Daschak the only American brought in? Wasn't he the only American scientist brought in? Yes, he was.

323
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So there has not been a neutral conflict free forensic evaluation of all possibilities of origin at this time.

324
01:22:52,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Do you have confidence that such a thing will happen? The Biden administration recently requested such a report to be delivered within no less than 90 days, if I'm not mistaken.

325
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yeah. It is going to take a huge act of political will and really unity by many, many different countries to essentially force the Chinese to be more transparent.

326
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:47,000
It's not necessarily a fight that the Biden administration wants to have. It's really inconvenient. I think it would be a whole lot easier to say, well, it must be zoonotic and we can't find the animal host bummer.

327
01:23:47,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So, you know, I don't know if we're going to be able to surmount all of the political hurdles and the evidentiary hurdles that lay in our way to have a real investigation into this.

328
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And what would be required of full transparency? What would be asked for that would demonstrate conclusively one way or the other?

329
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Well, you know, part of that is what probably will never happen. China says, you know what? We're changing our minds, full transparency. We're putting back the database. Here's a record of all the samples. Here are the lab notebooks.

330
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Come to a tour. Here's the medical records of all the researchers who were in the laboratory. That is very, very unlikely to happen.

331
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:56,000
We, by the way, have no serology on the three people who worked in the lab who got sick in the late summer, early fall of 2019, correct?

332
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:05,000
My understanding is that we don't or if we do, if our intelligence agencies are more definitive, it's definitely not in the public domain.

333
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So, you know, plan B, assuming that China is not going to be more forthcoming, is for the countries of the world to basically look in their own research files.

334
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You know, that there is a lot of information that is potentially available to us if we are really to dig into our own filing cabinets. That is essentially what Joe Biden has called for.

335
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:44,000
He's told the intelligence agencies to go back to the drawing board, inventory what they have, and see if they can't come to some sort of closer conclusion.

336
01:25:45,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You know, there was recently an important paper put forth by Jesse Bloom, who is an esteemed virologist, who said that there were sequences that were in an NIH database that were taken offline at the request of Chinese scientists that had some early sequences from Wuhan.

337
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So potentially, you know, there is information that our own government, for whatever reason, has either buried or ignored or removed, which can be analyzed.

338
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So given all the time you've spent on this so far, how has your own probability shifted from zoonotic versus lab origin over the past year?

339
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Right. Well, you know, starting out when anybody mentioned the possibility of a lab leak, I was very dismissive because it sounded to me just like conspiracy theories. And there were a lot of conspiracy theories associated with that.

340
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:17,000
But I think what's happened is, as time has gone on, and no host animal has been found, and Trump has been removed, and so there is a sort of space to ask this question without necessarily aiding what's viewed as a racist agenda.

341
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You know, and China has failed to be transparent, and conflicts of interest have been exposed.

342
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You know, and from my own reporting now, I understand that a full investigation within the US government was essentially blocked or restricted.

343
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You know, I kind of give it even odds at this point. I think it's a possibility. I don't have a definite conclusion. You know, if a host animal was found tomorrow, I would be like, okay.

344
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But I think there are just too many questions to be ignored right now.

345
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:19,000
You know, one of the things about conspiracy theories is they require coverups. You know, they, you know, one of the one of the conspiracy theories that's always obsessed me is the Kennedy assassination ever since I was a kid.

346
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And I don't know, probably by the time I was in my mid 30s, I'd seen enough read enough that I concluded there's simply no way it was anything other than Lee Harvey Oswald.

347
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Like I really just decided, despite what Oliver Stone would have you believe, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

348
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And there are many reasons I could bore you with that include a more accurate looking at, you know, more accurate look at the forensics of the, you know, the, the, the ballistics and things like that.

349
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But a big part of it is how hard would it be to keep everybody quiet if this were some CIA plot or some mob plot or, you know, one of the other crazy ideas that's put forth.

350
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And I guess that's one of the things that kind of nags at me here a little bit with this one, which is if this in fact came from a lab, how many people have to know that? Right?

351
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's not the case, by the way, that that Peter Daschig would necessarily know that right? He wouldn't necessarily know that. I mean, he might have a huge incentive to hope that it's not happened, but he wouldn't necessarily know that.

352
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But, but presumably more than one person would be covering this up. Right? And I guess that speaks to the bigger that number of people, the harder this thing becomes over time. If indeed that's the case.

353
01:29:49,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So let me say a couple of things about this. You know, first of all, the question of COVID origin is the ultimate grassy knoll. Right? You know, this is one for the ages.

354
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I think the question of a cover up, you know, it's very different to consider a cover up in the U.S. with a tradition of freedom of speech and protection of whistleblowers and to consider a cover up in China with an authoritarian government that has control over everybody's lives and can act absolutely wreak havoc, not just on a whistleblower, but on a whistleblower's family.

355
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So, for example, the anthrax lab leak in the Soviet Union in the 70s only became disclosed after the fall of the Soviet Union. Right? Once this sort of authoritarian structure around it crumbled, then it could be disclosed.

356
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But, you know, China has incredible control over its citizens and could even if, let's say, She Zhengli thinks it was a lab leak or knows it was a lab leak, is she free to say that?

357
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Well, certainly not well in China and not well her family's. Right. Yeah. So, you know, that said, I'm always mindful of this expression we have in investigative journalism.

358
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Never assume conspiracy when incompetence is an option. In other words, you know, it's easy to say conspiracy, but that's always a more unlikely possibility.

359
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yeah, conspiracy doesn't make a lot of sense here. And I think it detracts from an honest look at the facts. It should really be viewed as two competing hypotheses and one of them that got largely ignored because because it was politically inconvenient to consider.

360
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yes, that's that's right. That's I side with that analysis. 100 percent.

361
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Are you optimistic that a year from now we're going to have much more insight? Because the reality of it is if you're if you look at what we know today versus what we knew six months ago, virtually nothing new. Right.

362
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Very little new information. There's just been more attention paid to old information, which is always concerning when you're trying to think about this. Right. Because, you know, it's more interesting if, oh, my goodness, there's a lot of information.

363
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There's a lot of information that is emerging here. We are learning more, but that's not really the case. We're learning more on the basis of old information. And at some point, we're going to saturate our knowledge based on that.

364
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Are you optimistic that we're going to learn more in the next year or is this going to become simply more of a polarizing discussion?

365
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Well, I have no doubt that it will be a polarizing discussion and continue to be one. I think the real question, the way I see it, is how much political capital does the Biden administration want to spend on this?

366
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:26,000
The Biden administration and the other powerful governments of the world. How far are they willing to push China to demand answers?

367
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Well, of course, someone in China knows some answer, presumably like they know it was or wasn't a lab leak or they can guess that. How far are the governments of the world prepared to go to push for an answer for this?

368
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:51,000
You know, besides the United States, who? Yeah. Who? Besides the United States, which governments would have the most persuasion?

369
01:33:51,000 --> 01:34:15,000
You know, a lot of this is going to be fought economically. So, for example, originally, the government of Australia, of Scott Morrison, was pushing to have the question of a lab leak as part of the sort of one of the facets of the World Health Organization inquiry into this.

370
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:39,000
They wanted to make sure that that possibility got on the agenda. China's retaliation was very swift and they were immediately blocked. I believe it was import of Australian goods into China. So there is a lot of economic retaliation that can occur in the push for answers.

371
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And as we've already kind of identified, there's no scenario under which a lab leak occurred and the United States doesn't have blood on its hands as well through both direct contribution of funding and also collaboration from a research perspective, correct?

372
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I mean, in other words, if there's a lab leak, you know, you can't just say, well, it's just the fault of the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it's just bad luck that it occurred there. The reality is this could have easily taken place at the University of North Carolina or the University of Galveston in Texas where similar research goes on.

373
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:24,000
The bigger issue is this was in some ways a joint effort between the United States and China, correct?

374
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Well, let me just say there is one other laboratory that is right near the Huanan seafood market, which is the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had moved right next to the seafood market shortly before the outbreak began.

375
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:57,000
They had a coronavirus researcher who was very gung-ho had collected a lot of viral samples. So I guess in theory, it is possible that this came from a laboratory that had nothing to do with U.S. funding.

376
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But I would say, you know, regardless, I still take your point that the lab leak scenario raises a lot of thorny questions for the National Institutes of Health, for how scientific research is funded.

377
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You know, it would be hell to pay in the field of virology if the effort to identify viruses ended up unleashing them.

378
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Yeah, it's interesting to think how this will unfold over the coming decade, the economic damage, the loss of life, etc.

379
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Do you get a sense of how this will impact gain-of-function research, at least in the United States?

380
01:36:49,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It's interesting because this whole debate has spotlighted this kind of tucked away corner of scientific research that the public really didn't know anything about.

381
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And so I certainly think that any agency now prepared to give a grant to this research is really going to think carefully about this.

382
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:25,000
You know, going to think about who are they giving grants to, who are the sub-grantees downstream, right?

383
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You know, what are the hazards, the dangers of the kind of research they're doing?

384
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So this really has been spotlighted, and I think it will, even, you know, without a definitive answer, I think it will have an impact on this kind of research.

385
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Yeah, it's certainly clear that gain-of-function research didn't help here, even if this was of zoonotic origin.

386
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,000


387
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It's not like gain-of-function did anything to prevent it or more rapidly thwart it.

388
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Well, let me just say this, which is, you know, EcoHealth Alliance's whole argument for existence is if we partner with these far-flung laboratories and we go out to these remote backcaves and we find these samples and we bring it in and we do this research, we are going to have a way to potentially prevent outbreaks.

389
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Okay, we spent millions, you know, U.S. government spent millions of dollars on that argument.

390
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,000
What did we gain? Didn't prevent COVID-19, right? So where is the benefit? What's the upside?

391
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:37,000
What, you know, what's the argument for the continuation of this? That's a question that has not been answered.

392
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Well, I wish I had a stronger point of view on this, but I think I'm in your camp, Catherine. I can talk myself into both of these scenarios.

393
01:38:48,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And the only thing I find myself really hoping for is the open and honest evaluation of this, which unfortunately requires getting new information.

394
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And I think the majority of that information probably lies outside of our borders and therefore is going to be limited.

395
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:16,000
So I'm not sure if we're going to be any further along in a year, but I think...

396
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You know, I, yeah, sorry, go ahead.

397
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
No, go ahead.

398
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I was just going to say, I do believe that eventually one day we will know. Is it going to be in our lifetime?

399
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Not sure about that.

400
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Well, it's funny, right? At some point, if no intermediary host and or species of origin is ever identified, like, is there some asymptote to that, you know, or tail where you say, well, gosh, if it hasn't been found in like 100 years, it really doesn't exist.

401
01:39:48,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Or, you know, in theory, you would imagine, even if this was all done through gain of function research, you'd need to find something in nature that was 99.8% close to it.

402
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And then you would say that that last 0.2% had to be done in the lab.

403
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:16,000
But then you could probably equally convince yourself that, no, that 0.2, that variation of 0.2% took place in the first few pieces of the lab.

404
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But then you could say that this was the first few people that were never identified.

405
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
So, again, I just I go back and forth and I talk myself in and out of this.

406
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And I'm I'm I'm frustrated that this is something that should be knowable and is not known, which is generally more frustrating to me that things that, you know, are unknown that maybe can't be knowable.

407
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:52,000
But I'm not as frustrated by that because that seems a lot harder to know. This seems like something that is knowable and I probably will never know it.

408
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Well, let's put it this way. Regardless of whether there is life beyond Earth, the answer to that didn't force you to stay inside for a year and not see friends and family, you know.

409
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So this one yet this one for all. Yes. But this one for all of us.

410
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And I'm really struck by this feels so personal, of course, because it is.

411
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And so the you know, people are people are obsessed with this question.

412
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And once you start looking into it, as you've experienced and as I did reporting it, you just go down this rabbit hole in which like night is day and day is night.

413
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And you cannot get to the bottom of it no matter how many rocks you turn over.

414
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Well, Catherine, maybe the next time we get together, we can talk about the consultants that unleashed torture upon the U.S. government and the CIA and their efforts in Iraq.

415
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Would that be a would that be a great follow up discussion? Sure. I'll do that one.

416
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I mean, my goodness. Do you ever write about do you ever write about things that aren't upsetting? Do you ever write happy stories?

417
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:15,000
You can guess from my silence, I have to really think about that. Yeah, it's it's not a lot of unicorns and rainbows over here. No.

418
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But, you know, I tend to gravitate towards the things that fascinate me.

419
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And you're fascinated by the macabre. You really don't like good things, do you?

420
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:40,000
In my own life, I do. But I do, you know, I do set out to try to get to the bottom of things that do not have easy answers.

421
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And sometimes those are can be quite dark.

422
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Well, Catherine, if it wasn't bad enough to talk about generic drugs and the corruption that goes on there, you put a bow on it this time.

423
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:09,000
And again, I think the bow is less about whether or not this did or did not come from a lab, but more about the fact that there is there has been and likely will be forever an enormous obstruction to get to the truth about it.

424
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yes. Unfortunately, that is absolutely true. Yep.

425
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Well, thank you very much for your work on this and for making time to chat about it today.

426
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Thanks. Great to talk to you as always, Peter.

427
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads.

428
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription.

429
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode.

430
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:58,000
The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely.

431
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel like this.

432
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:15,000
The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive.

433
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

434
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse.

435
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on.
