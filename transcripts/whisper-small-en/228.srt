Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,600
Holly, thanks so much for making time to sit down today. I look forward to talking about a lot of

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,920
things. My wife has already peppered me with a hundred questions for you today.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,760
I'm really excited to be here. Thank you so much for having me on the show.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,680
So tell us a little bit about yourself. I know you grew up in Australia and I know that you,

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,480
I think you ran track growing up.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,360
Yes, I did. So yeah, I grew up in Tasmania, Australia. So for those that may not be

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,320
geographic of that, where that is, it's the little island that sits just south of the mainland. So

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,040
it's a pretty small place. And I think part of the evolution of me now being where I am in Florida,

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,880
was just having such a big open mind and I didn't want to stay there. So I moved away

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,360
to do college. So I moved over to Melbourne Deakin University, where I did an undergraduate

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,600
in nutrition science, food science, nutrition, and then a master's in dietetics.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,680
So how, I know Tasmania by landmass looks pretty big, but what's, is it a tiny population?

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,920
It's tiny. I think at the moment it's probably like 500,000. Where I grew up specifically,

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,840
when I was living there, the population of Lompsiston was about 90,000. So pretty small.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,080
So in high school, you ran track or in college?

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,400
All the way through. So I started track at about age eight and I went right through till age 18.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,160
So I finished by the time I got to like second or third year of university. I guess at that point,

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,040
that was when I could either go for a sporting career or choose academics. So I ended up choosing

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,680
academics because unfortunately in Australia for females, it just isn't a whole lot of opportunity

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,520
to have a successful career in sport. For males, it's a little bit different. We have Aussie Rules

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,080
football, which is incredibly popular and absolutely can make a killing. And I think

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,320
perhaps now that social media has grown to be where it is, maybe some female females have an

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,480
opportunity to have a good career in sport. But yeah, academics was kind of the only option really

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,000
for me at that time. What did you run in track? So I was a sprinter, 100 meters long jump,

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,880
triple jump. And if someone dare ask me to do a relay or a 400, I might do that. So lots of fast

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,640
twitch, anything explosive and powerful and short. And did you lift weights in high school? Was that

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,640
your exposure to it? So not in high school. I actually only started lifting weights probably

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:43,160
in year 11. So we call that college at home. So grade 11, I started or introduced lifting weights.

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,720
And that was when I was part of the Tasmanian Institute of Sports. So my coach at the time,

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Peter Fortune was also Olympic 400 meter runner, Kathy Freeman. So she won the gold medal in the

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,880
2000 Olympics and everybody loved her. So I worked with him. And yeah, that's where I kind of had a

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,120
lot of my, I guess, experience in track sprinting. So why did you choose nutrition in college?

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,360
Good question. So I think most people would probably say, Oh, you know, I'm really passionate

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:24,680
about sport and da, da, da, da, da, da. But my reasoning was probably not a good one. I got into

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:33,000
the sport purely because of my, I guess, desire for control of my nutrition. And it probably begs

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,200
the question, you know, what's that all about? So I have only very recently overcome a 15 year

38
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,280
long eating disorder. I struggled with anorexia for a short period of time. And that went on to

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,840
become a binge eating disorder in bulimia. So before I even thought about going off to college,

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,880
I was already in the depths of that disorder. I was also struggling a lot with depression.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,240
At age 16, I had already attempted suicide twice. And I was hospitalized for a good part of my year

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,240
11 schooling, which looking back at that now, like it's, it's really sad actually. And I just

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:20,280
didn't have the supports. I didn't have the mentors or people in my life that really helped me to feel

44
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,920
what I needed to feel. And I think experience as a child and it kind of escalated into my adulthood

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,920
and really very recently have I only started to work on my mental health. And I think that's where

46
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,640
a lot of my advances have come, especially as it relates to like feeling like I have a sense of

47
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,240
purpose in life and really ultimately finding my happiness. So, um, so are you the, you have one

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,680
sibling? Yes. Older, younger. Younger sibling. A sister. Yes. So, um, when, when did the eating

49
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,640
disorder start and did that sort of, uh, uh, proceed the, what you described as depression or do you

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,760
think the two are kind of hand in hand and intertwined? They, uh, kind of came on simultaneously,

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:13,000
I think, um, for multiple reasons. So, um, I don't want to, you know, say negative things about my

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,160
family and my parents or how they raised me because gosh, my mother was just an incredible woman. She

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,600
basically raised us as a single mom. Uh, I did have a father in my life, but, uh, he was a very

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,000
hard worker, uh, very disciplined and so career focused that, you know, we were kind of invisible

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,920
to him. So my mom, uh, I think she had grown up in a similar situation where her mother, um, was

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,520
completely absent. She was a single mom. So I think her life experiences where she didn't have

57
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,240
somebody that even cared about her, that take her to do anything, do sports, you know, she had to do

58
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,800
it all herself. She'd catch the bus to afterschool trainees. She'd take herself, you know, to

59
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,160
athletics on the weekends. So, um, my mother was a wonderful woman, but she, she did what she did

60
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,320
based on her own personal experiences. So it probably wasn't the best thing looking back at it,

61
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,360
but you know, we all have our flaws, but our relationship was really strained. Um, I think

62
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,320
she wanted to control me, um, to protect me. I think, um, you know, and that kind of put a lot

63
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,520
of friction between us. So I felt like I had no control in my life. Uh, I think up until like year

64
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,720
10, I wasn't even allowed to have like a sleepover at a friends without there being like serious

65
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,920
like arguments. And there was just a lot of hostility and confrontation growing up. So,

66
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,760
so your 10 is about 15. Yes. And so give me a little bit more of an understanding of that. So

67
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,280
was the focus before that age, was it sort of a heavy emphasis on your academics and on your

68
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,880
sports? And that was it? Absolutely. Yes. So we were doing, uh, dancing, like tap jazz, ballet,

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,920
uh, piano music, guitar, like drums. Um, then we were in basketball and athletics. So we did a lot

70
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,120
of, um, you know, activities. Um, and I think the only kind of praise and recognition or like you

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,640
felt like you were cared for or loved was when you excelled at something. So, you know, if I came

72
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,400
home and I did really well in my grades at school, that was about the only time that I would get,

73
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,600
you know, Oh wow. You know, we really love you or well done. Um, and I know my mom loves me. Like

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,120
it's, it's just how people communicate is so important. Um, so yeah, I really kind of grew

75
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,920
up with this idea that unless I was the best at something or did everything and I excelled at

76
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,040
everything, I didn't really have value as a human. So that's kind of one aspect, um, I think of where

77
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,200
all that depression and the eating disorder started. Um, but sadly I also, um, experienced

78
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,720
some sexual trauma around that age. And I think that there were two instances and it happened

79
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,600
with people that I really respected that I trusted. Um, and that coupled with this toxic,

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,880
you know, home environment where you can't really even go to your parents because there's this,

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,040
you know, a fear of being judged, you know, from the community. Um, you know, everything was about

82
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,760
keeping up with appearances. So it wouldn't be, you know, are you okay? Talk to me. Let's, let's

83
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,880
have a discussion about this. It was, well, what, what, what did you do to deserve that? Well, what

84
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,040
were you wearing? How are you dressed? What, what kind of makeup did you have on? Like you're asking

85
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,880
for this, you know? So yeah, you didn't, you didn't disclose any of this to your parents.

86
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,960
Uh, I spoke to my mother about it. Um, but that was kind of the feedback that, that I got. Um,

87
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,160
she didn't know how to, to support me and she did granted, you know, try to look for therapy, um, at

88
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,080
the time. But, uh, I think at that point I was so far down like the rabbit hole of depression.

89
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,640
Um, and just feeling like I was a lost cause that like nothing even, nothing worked. Certainly the

90
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,080
behavioral therapy that I did, um, at that time was ineffective and the medication that I had

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,000
actually, um, made it worse, significantly worse, um, for a period. So I consequently came off that.

92
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,600
And so, um, help me understand a little bit more about how one, um,

93
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,120
sort of, cause I, I think that eating disorders are probably a lot more common than we are led to

94
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,360
believe. Um, I don't actually, this is not something I know a lot of the statistics about.

95
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640
We've actually been trying to find an expert on eating disorders for the podcast because I think

96
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,960
it is a very important topic. So I don't know if you are familiar with these statistics, but I'm

97
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,720
not. Uh, but do you have a sense of, of, um, how often they afflict young women versus young men?

98
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,040
So the prevalence is a lot greater in females than men, but it's actually increasing over the last

99
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,640
10 years, uh, in young boys as well. Um, I hope I don't butcher the statistics I did actually,

100
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,440
there was a couple of studies that I'd like to reference, but I don't have them with me.

101
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:54,280
But I believe 60% of, um, high school students in US, um, females have reported to struggle with,

102
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,000
um, low confidence, uh, negative, um, sense of self and body image, um, prevalence of eating

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,960
disorders. Uh, I guess it's a little bit lower, but I wouldn't know the exact statistics, but

104
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,080
it is scarily high. And we can also then look into some of the, the younger studies in children.

105
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,920
Um, and it is higher than it should be. Absolutely.

106
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,040
And so when you think back to how this started in you, I think you mentioned that it started

107
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,240
first with anorexia before binging and purging. Um, did you gain a sense of control by limiting

108
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,680
what you were eating? Did it, did it in the short term satisfy something that was inside you?

109
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,360
You know what it did, but I think because I was so athletic, I was so heavily involved in sport

110
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,360
that, you know, my energy demands, like I think back to the amount of training that I was doing,

111
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,120
you know, you've got your in-school sports and then after school and it was hours of practice

112
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,080
and six days a week for the most part, maybe training on Sunday. Um, I, I couldn't sustain

113
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:01,160
the restriction. I might like, I was so, um, famished and hungry and like that frustrated

114
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,960
me. It really did. Like I didn't connect the dots. Like, you know, why can't I control,

115
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,720
you know, what I put in my body? Like, you know, but little that I know anything about,

116
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,760
you know, your appetite regulating hormones at that point and the requirements for energy

117
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:23,720
for the sport that I was doing. So, um, I would, uh, I guess I would act out these behaviors of

118
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,720
binge eating, um, and then purging. And it was just constant. It became a point where

119
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,240
it was probably every day of the week for, I would say five years, which is terrifying to think about

120
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,160
considering the risks. So that means from high school all the way into university.

121
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,520
Yep. Um, it definitely slowed down when I got to university and I think it was just because of

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,880
the requirements for study and like I had to work three jobs and, um, you know, to make everything

123
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,960
work. So there was just less opportunity for me to do that if I wanted to excel in my studies.

124
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,720
So, um, yeah, it was horrific. I just remember feeling like I wanted to be able to control

125
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,240
things, but at the same token, I had no control because my body was doing what it's meant to do,

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,600
which is to protect you from starvation, essentially. Now, some of the complications

127
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,160
that people experience with bulimia, of course, you know, the constant flow of acidity up and

128
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,360
down the esophagus, did you have any of the issues with your teeth, the electrolyte abnormalities?

129
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,400
So interestingly, no. Um, I can't speak to the electrolyte abnormalities because I never had,

130
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,200
um, you know, routine blood work back then. It was, that was definitely not something I was going to,

131
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,000
to prioritize as a young, uh, naive student. But, um, I can say now, like thankfully, um, you know,

132
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,840
I never had any of the esophageal erosion from that acidic acid. I think, um, that, you know,

133
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,360
plays a strong risk in developing cancers of the throat and the olfactory. So I do wonder about

134
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,480
that, um, because of the frequency of purging, um, and what that says for me in the future,

135
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,160
because now that I have, you know, made, got that under control, um, it's a scary thought because

136
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm in, you know, cancer's a, uh, it's a scary thing. So how did this progress? So you, you're

137
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,120
in university, you're doing an undergraduate degree, then you do a master's degree right after. Um,

138
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,520
what's happening? Does anybody in your life kind of recognize that this is going on, be it your

139
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,720
sister, your mom or friends? No. So I think one of the challenges, and it's, I think been exacerbated

140
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,800
by moving away, um, was my family weren't in the same state. Um, and they didn't travel, uh,

141
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,160
to see me very often. And it's kind of been, been that way since I've moved away. Um,

142
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,240
so I didn't have the family support. Uh, I've never had a close relationship with my sister,

143
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,920
though I would love to. It's just, we've just gone in different directions, I think with life.

144
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,880
Um, and yeah, my, I don't, didn't have any kind of relationship with my father. So, um,

145
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,760
I didn't have anyone to go to for guidance. Uh, so I was kind of in and out of, you know,

146
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,480
dating when you were at school, college and, uh, you know,

147
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
But none of your boyfriends knew that this was happening.

148
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,920
No, I may have communicated it to one. And I think part of that was out of shame. I think,

149
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,040
think about the stigma that's associated with mental health issues, depression for one. Um,

150
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,240
but then to have an eating disorder and me being the perfectionist, high achiever,

151
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,320
um, you know, driven woman that I was, there was no way I wanted to share this weakness.

152
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
And especially given that I was, you know, educated, I've done a bachelor's in food science

153
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,960
and now I've got a master's degree in nutrition. I should be able to control this, you know,

154
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,640
in that is that word control. So I, I was terrified to tell anybody. Um, so I was

155
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,960
suffering in silence and it probably went that way for 10 years.

156
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,720
And during that 10 years, this pattern of behavior was still continuing. Um,

157
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,440
we're going to talk a lot about training. We're going to talk a lot about, you know,

158
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,520
bodybuilding and stuff that you've done more recently, but kind of helped me understand,

159
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,760
like, what did you physically look like at the time? Did you look as fit as you look today?

160
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,400
Did you, did you have more of a sort of slender build? Were you more muscular? I mean, I,

161
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,520
it, I think there's a, I think part of the issue, and I know this isn't true, but I think it's part

162
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,320
of the stereotype is when we think of somebody with an eating disorder, we picture an individual

163
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,960
probably in different extremes. You know, I think when we think of someone with anorexia,

164
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,880
we think of someone that's incredibly thin and, and you know, they appear unhealthy and how thin

165
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,480
they look. Conversely, I think when we picture somebody with bulimia, we usually think of

166
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,320
somebody that's a little overweight. Um, were you sort of somewhere on that spectrum?

167
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,120
I was right in the middle. Um, I think again, because of the amount of activity that I was

168
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,440
doing, um, that prevented me from being in this state or a mental state of anorexia. So I never

169
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,560
got to the point where I was dangerously low body weight. Um, but I, I was a healthy body weight and

170
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,840
I was still, you know, sprinting track training. Uh, I would say I was above average muscularity.

171
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,000
I was, that was kind of when I just started getting into, uh, you know, do you remember the

172
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Les Mules, um, like classes that they would have at the gyms where there's, um, like combat class or,

173
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:25,160
uh, kickboxing or a body pump. So I was doing, you know, some light resistance training. Um,

174
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,760
my actual like interest in bodybuilding didn't start until, uh, much later after college. So

175
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,560
yeah, I was, I was healthy body weight, but I think like, if we look at, you know, the research for

176
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,280
people that do suffer with binge eating disorder and bulimia, they tend to be normal weight too,

177
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,960
you know, above, above normal weight. So yeah, I was right in the normal, no one would have known.

178
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,440
And you mentioned also, I think that you had a suicide attempt when you were six, was it 16?

179
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Yes. And was that, I mean, I don't want to ask the obvious question. How was that not a wake up

180
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:05,480
call to your parents? It was, um, one of the things that was really disappointing and I think

181
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,120
it just enhanced the sadness. I get a little bit upset than emotional thinking about it. But,

182
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,000
um, again, just to kind of outline just how incapable like my father was of communicating.

183
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,120
And it's not that he's a bad person. It's just, his backstory is incredible. Like lost his mom at

184
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,080
age 13 through breast cancer was raised by an alcoholic father, four brothers, like beaten,

185
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,680
you know, really, really sad. He didn't know how to communicate. And I remember at that point, um,

186
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,520
my mom was very upset when that happened. And I think my dad came into my room and was like,

187
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,080
you're a fucking idiot. And he walked out, you know, sorry to have that from like somebody that

188
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,400
you're like, wow, I thought like you loved and cared about me. It was, he was never somebody

189
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,600
that would have had a clue where to start. Um, my mother on the other hand was like overbearing

190
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,720
and that was the problem. Like she didn't, I knew that she was trying to help, but part of the reason

191
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,360
that I'd gotten to this, uh, space anyway, in combination with the sexual assaults, uh, and

192
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,160
then some of the things that my coach had said about, um, my training, which led to the ED disorder as

193
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,760
well, um, was that she was just way too controlling, wanted to just do everything for me, whether it

194
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,600
was live vicariously through our sports, which I understand. And I've forgiven my mother for that.

195
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,200
And you know, she's just doing what she knew, but, um, yeah, she tried to get me in touch with the

196
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,840
right health professionals. Um, but I think just lack of, you know, knowledge resources, um, not

197
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,320
having good connections herself. Um, and she worked in the medical industry, um, as like

198
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,360
administration for years before she became a stay at home mom. So even not like even through her

199
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,960
networks, she just didn't have the tools. And it was right about the time where I was ready to

200
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,280
bounce and go to college and I had to fly and move away, uh, essentially. So the ability for her to

201
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,400
kind of control and manage, um, you know, what I did with my health and now I'm kind of becoming an

202
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,720
adult. Um, it was a lot harder. So I think in some ways I'm really grateful that I stepped away from

203
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,320
Tasmania and, you know, took on other opportunities that didn't require her support because I think,

204
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:29,080
you know, if you get, um, I guess, babied for your, you know, young teenage years, uh, and enabled,

205
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,560
I, I would never have had the life skills to, you know, be the person that I am today to

206
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,280
know what it's like to step out and take risks and, you know, fear. I don't have any fear of failure.

207
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,880
Um, and I think part of that was developed from me just moving away and stepping out from that control.

208
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,440
I want to kind of go back to still the understanding the eating disorder a little bit more. Um,

209
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:02,120
did you, did your, um, self image of your body seem sort of, um, inaccurate with what you now

210
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,840
look back at as reality. In other words, does, does everyone with an eating disorder necessarily

211
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,120
also have a skewed view of their body image or can, can that be uncoupled and the eating disorder

212
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:23,720
is simply a control tool that can be unrelated to, um, a misbelief, a misguided belief about body

213
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,360
image? I don't think dysfunctional thoughts. Yeah. So I think it really depends on the individual.

214
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Um, I don't, uh, I couldn't recall all of the exact criteria, um, or like characteristics, behaviors

215
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,200
that, um, you know, clinically define, um, anorexia or binge eating disorder or the like,

216
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,240
cause they are all slightly different in their own way. Um, but for me, at least I can say that

217
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,360
initially it wasn't, um, my body image that I was concerned about. It was control. Um, and I think

218
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,000
that's kind of then developed into like obsessive compulsive for some things. It was like anytime I

219
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,920
felt stressed, uh, anxious, dropping whatever emotion, um, as I grew that, um, control, the

220
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,480
desire to control came back and I kind of crafted this little environment where when I lived on my

221
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,480
own at school, uh, and then, um, post-school past postmasters, when I went off and started my career,

222
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,800
um, my environment was built in such a way that I basically shielded myself from stresses,

223
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,520
potential triggers, whether it was food, environmental, social, um, so that I could

224
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,760
live in control and that gave me comfort. So reality check, when you become an adult and you

225
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,600
have to be flexible and nimble and pivot and, you know, learn to adapt under stress, which

226
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,160
my goodness, I feel like my life was extremely stressful for a lot of different reasons, but I

227
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,920
just had no coping skills. So I didn't, it didn't start as a negative body image. It was simply,

228
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:06,040
um, the desire for control. However, as I kind of found myself, you know, more and more involved

229
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,760
in sport and as my physique did change, um, and as I started to connect the dots with my

230
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,080
train, uh, athletic performance with superior physique, low body fat, more muscle, uh, and then

231
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,280
the praise that I would get externally from people that then became the obsession. It was, you know,

232
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,000
it's how I look. And that was where I found myself worth. That was where I, uh, felt valued and

233
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,280
appreciated and, you know, people respect me and for a good part of my life, I think it became my

234
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:43,400
identity and it was impossible to break and that just fueled the disorder. Yeah. So I can only

235
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,960
imagine which then leads to the inevitable question of how do you break that cycle? Um,

236
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,680
oh, through a lot of hard work. And this is one of the practices, I guess, that I've incorporated

237
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,480
only very recently into my own like nutrition coaching, um, and with our team as well. And

238
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,400
that is really, um, working in collaboration with allied health, um, particularly mental health

239
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:15,240
experts. So for me, until I actually started having regular therapy and I'm not talking like

240
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,960
once every six weeks for review, which is kind of the expectation, I guess, in the clinical world,

241
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,200
I know for me as a dietician, um, we would see our patients, um, you know, maybe you do a four

242
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,680
up for a four week review or a six week review. Um, so it was really infrequent, but that's kind

243
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,880
of how I had been exposed to it with my parents when mom had gotten me into therapy. When was that?

244
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,320
That was when I was about 16 when I was living in Tasmania. Yes. Yeah. They put you into kind

245
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,360
of an infrequent therapy. Yeah. So I would have to travel to Hobart. I saw a specialist down there,

246
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,320
um, who, you know, worked with females, predominantly any women's health issues,

247
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,320
but eating disorders and, uh, nutrition. So, um, it was infrequent, but I remember loving those

248
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,720
little trips because it was like the one time that I was like, Oh, my mom cares. Wow. We get to go and

249
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,400
stay in Hobart and we get to go and spend time together. And she cares about me. And it was just

250
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,640
like, it's a sick relationship to think like that was so exciting for me, but that was what was fuel.

251
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,440
It was almost like that attention was good attention because I never felt like anyone cared

252
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,520
like about me outside of like your credentials and that kind of thing. Now, as you think about

253
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,920
sort of the post college life, um, did you think that you had things under control or did you think

254
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,280
that this is a dirty little secret that is totally out of control? I think it kind of came in

255
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,360
waves. Um, and I think like any kind of condition, you know, it's all works along a spectrum. So

256
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,800
I definitely had periods where I felt like, um, I was managing the symptoms, um, and the feelings,

257
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,640
the emotions that kind of came along with that disorder. Uh, okay. Um, but as soon as things got

258
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,680
a little bit stressful or I had it, you know, extra assignments due, or if I needed to like

259
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,960
from a financial perspective, you know, I need to do two full weekends of work back to back. And

260
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,600
that's the only way that you're going to be able to have groceries next week or put gas in your car.

261
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,840
Um, you know, when anything extra kind of came into my life, I just lost it. It was, um, like

262
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,080
extreme, um, you know, binging purging, secret eating, um, was really something that I struggled

263
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,440
with. Um, you know, I would go out for dinner with friends and I would try to like enjoy myself

264
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,400
and like partake in the food, but because I would restrict so aggressively, um, you know,

265
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,120
anytime that I did get outside my four walls of like comfort foods and things that were on my list

266
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,720
of, you know, these are okay to eat. Um, I was terrified. No one would know it on the outside,

267
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,240
but like I'd go out for dinner and it was just this uncontrolled, like it was like I had no

268
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,360
control to slow down my eating. So I ate so extremely fast. Um, and so many of my friends

269
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,720
as adults, like I have said to me, yeah, you really eat fast, but I've noticed a massive change,

270
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,400
you know, for the last few years, this is certainly for like longer term friends,

271
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,360
but you know, that habit stuck around. So I'd eat extremely quickly and I would almost binge eat.

272
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,280
And then I would usually order something else and take it home with the idea that I was going

273
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,720
to have it, you know, tomorrow. Um, and I'll, you know, portion it out appropriately. Um, but again,

274
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,640
because of that extreme restrictive behavior, it just meant I'd go home and then binge eat more.

275
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,160
And it was absolutely spiraled out of control. And I think again, my stress response at that

276
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,800
time, the only way I knew how to manage stress was to eat. And it completely, um, countered like

277
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:53,080
the goals that I had for my sport and my training. So yeah, it was hard. So how were you, um, able,

278
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,360
well, actually there's, let me start with a different question. What was the wake up call?

279
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,480
What was the, um, event or set of events that led you to think I have to do something different. And

280
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,960
it's, it sounds like I'm going to have to take therapy very seriously. Yeah, absolutely. So

281
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,720
it wasn't until I got to probably about age 25 at that point, I had moved from, um,

282
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,720
state. So I finished my schooling in, uh, Melbourne, moved to Gold Coast where I opened my own

283
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,280
business. So I actually already had my business in Melbourne, but you know, I basically was starting

284
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,440
from scratch. So a new clinical practice. Um, and then also, uh, working, I guess 50% of my work week

285
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,240
was also in-person training. Um, cause at that point I'd discovered like the love for resistance

286
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,560
training and I wanted to be able to incorporate those two things together. So, um, my business

287
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:50,120
was going crazy, like busy, busy, busy, busy. Um, I just had some success in the bodybuilding space

288
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,880
and I got to the point where my anxiety was so hard and I, I didn't even know what anxiety was.

289
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,800
Like I'd never had, I didn't, wasn't able to identify or put a word with the feeling that I

290
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,000
had just like, it sounds so silly to think about it now because of course it was anxiety,

291
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,800
but like I couldn't even open my laptop. Um, because I was so stressed at the amount of work

292
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,480
that I knew I had to do. So I actually got to a point in business where I was experiencing

293
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:24,280
some burnout and I took myself to a therapist at that point. Um, so that kind of started it. And

294
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,840
then I ended up having to, uh, admit myself to like a rehab. So I traveled to back to Melbourne

295
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,680
to a very well-known like rehabilitation therapies, uh, location in like country Victoria.

296
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,680
And it was, um, I guess incorporated, um, I guess, counseling, uh, yoga practices, different

297
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,520
relaxation, um, type techniques. And then, um, one of the owners, I guess would kind of come and

298
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,840
work through just different nutrition things with you. And this was specifically for people

299
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,800
with eating disorders. Yes. And how long did you commit to go to this place? So I, I was there for

300
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,120
seven days. Um, so it was pretty short, but it was very intense. Like you had a schedule mapped out

301
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,520
from the minute you woke up to the moment you went to bed. So, and how difficult was that for you to

302
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:17,960
make the decision to shut down work for seven days? Terrifying. Um, I, I remember calling my mom

303
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,200
actually, and she was bawling. And I, I, we rarely spoke, um, not because, you know, we didn't have

304
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,440
a better relationship as adults, but I think we just kind of grew apart. So calling her and, uh,

305
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,600
I guess she knows like, if I'm going to ring my mom, there's probably something wrong. Um, yeah,

306
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,480
I was just mortified because I was so stressed about like losing hours work. Cause I was so

307
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,760
passionate about, you know, I put my clients, but you know, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

308
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,840
But you know, she said, look, financially you're going to be okay. Like just take, just take a week.

309
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,320
You know, it doesn't have to be exorbitant. The therapy was quite expensive, but, um, it was very

310
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,120
well worth it. I'm going through this, you know, I haven't really resolved my eating disorder.

311
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm at business burnout stress. So it was just, to me, it was like overwhelming. And I think at that

312
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,680
point again was the second time in my life where I felt, um, some of those suicidal thoughts. I don't

313
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,240
think that, um, I kind of talked with my therapist and she'd said, well, do we need to bake, correct you?

314
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,440
And I was like, no, no, I think I'll work through this, but it's the first time that I felt this,

315
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:30,680
um, like hopeless. So how much of an impact did that seven day, um, inpatient, uh, rehab have on you?

316
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,920
Not as much as I would have hoped. Um, I think to think that any, anything, you know, that that's,

317
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,560
that's that short in duration is going to cure you is very foolish, but it opened my eyes to

318
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:51,000
the benefits of, um, you know, relaxation, meditation, um, and the value of communication

319
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,200
and being transparent and open. And that was not a behavior that I was moved at. Um, for that 10

320
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,680
year period prior, I was very closed off, very reserved, didn't share very many things at all.

321
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,080
I was very private. Um, so I think I saw the value in, you know, what it's like to kind of

322
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:19,560
work through issues rather than suppress them. Um, and once I finally moved to America, uh,

323
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,800
I got myself straight into weekly therapy. So I have had therapy sessions every week since 2016.

324
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:35,080
I've probably missed, I dunno, maybe 20 weeks just through travel and business. So it got me on

325
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,080
the right path. And then what were sort of the breakthroughs that occurred with that type of

326
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,920
much more consistent therapy? So I think number one, it made me accountable and it made me speak,

327
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,800
made me talk, um, and helped me kind of reflect back on, you know, my past, which I'd never done.

328
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,560
I had never given two thoughts about my upbringing. Um, I feel like now it's all I talk about,

329
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:05,000
it all I think about, but so much of what I experienced was bottled up in, you know,

330
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,280
the past traumas and, uh, those, those different styles of communication. So I think gaining an

331
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,680
appreciation and understanding for why I felt the way that I did was incredibly valuable. It was

332
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:26,600
like, Oh, I've now got some data. At least it made sense to me. And then I think we started kind

333
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,280
of discussing, you know, where are the dysfunctions in these beliefs? Let's start picking up these,

334
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:39,720
um, you know, different sets of thoughts that you have, um, and let's deconstruct them and how might

335
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,960
these look different for a healthy mind. And through so much self-development reading,

336
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:53,640
also finding myself spiritually, which is another major part of this piece, uh, the story, um,

337
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:03,800
it really helped me to understand that I was enough as a human, despite my, um, accolades

338
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,280
in sporting accomplishments and that like I'm loved and I don't need to keep proving myself

339
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,880
to, you know, all the people in my life. And it was like this huge weight to lift it off my shoulders.

340
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,360
Part of that was, um, one of our staff, um, invited me to go to church one day and I'd only been to

341
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,000
church once when I was young, uh, with a boyfriend. His family were a Christian. So my experience with

342
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:37,640
like religion was not negative. I'd say I grew up like, um, agnostic. So I don't think my parents were

343
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,880
anti, you know, religion, but they certainly didn't hold any beliefs of their own and it was not

344
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,280
something we discussed. So going to church and this was a non-denominational church, very progressive.

345
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,640
The pastor was just like incredible. And every message every week I kept going back. Um, and I

346
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,680
was like, wow, this is so relatable. There's so many things out of the Bible that like, it's just

347
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,120
so good. It's like such a good information. It was like, this is what I've been missing my whole life

348
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,000
because I felt for a long time that I didn't have purpose. And part of my decision to keep moving

349
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,200
and traveling was to feel like what's missing. Maybe it'll be here or maybe if I go to this

350
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,360
country, you know, the people will be different and I'll resonate with them better. Um, but it

351
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:30,440
was something in here that was missing and yeah, going to church and reading it just, that was

352
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,960
probably the one thing that changed my life. Um, and since then I have never been happier. Sorry.

353
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,400
So I think there's sort of two things that are interesting in the story that I think are, are

354
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,080
important and illustrative for, for anybody struggling with anything. And one is that the

355
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,480
improvements didn't happen quickly and that it's kind of nonlinear. So, you know, you, I, I'm

356
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,120
actually struck by the fact that, uh, you know, you said, look, I did this seven day intensive

357
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,560
thing and it helped, but it didn't help as much as maybe I wanted it to. Um, but I think the

358
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,080
encouraging point is here, uh, you kept sort of at it, right? You know, it was, you know,

359
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,480
it would be years before you would find yourself in daily or weekly therapy. Um, I guess the other

360
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:26,120
thing is, uh, when I think of my, uh, addictions and struggles, I think like any addict, um,

361
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,000
let's just pick alcohol cause it's an easy one for people to identify with externally.

362
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,320
You know, they say that an alcoholic is always an alcoholic. It's just a question of,

363
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,560
if you're in recovery or not, but if, if, if an alcoholic commits to no longer drinking,

364
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,760
they still need to be mindful of their behaviors and still need to be cognizant of the fact that

365
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,320
they can slip back into drinking. Yes. And that doesn't mean they can't be around people who are

366
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,120
drinking, but they have to understand themselves and understand those limits. Um, that's certainly

367
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,640
going to be true for me for the rest of my life. I know what my addictions are and I, and I, I know

368
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,400
how they need to be managed and they're always there. So do you feel that way as well?

369
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:13,640
Absolutely. So I think there is this idea that you can completely recover and I don't think that

370
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,680
anybody truly recovers. Like you said, once an addict, always an addict, you're in recovery,

371
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,520
you were not recovered. Yes. Now I think with something like that, you know, there's the

372
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,840
physiological, you know, symptoms that you need to manage as you come out of that, you know, you've

373
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,800
got a chemical dependence, but for something that is psychological, um, you know, there's

374
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:39,400
obviously chemical imbalances in some, um, in some of these conditions, but I think there's also

375
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:47,720
a strong need for your desire to, to change and to improve. So I think it wasn't until like I had

376
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,320
kind of committed to myself and said, you are never going to purge again. And I remember,

377
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,400
and I actually have started writing a book about this actually, uh, which will be hopefully very

378
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,720
helpful for a lot of people that are going through the same kind of thing. But yeah, I remember

379
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:10,280
sitting on my bathroom floor one day, um, balling, just like emotionally exhausted, physically

380
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,240
exhausted. And it was during a contest prep. Um, you know, the, the most difficult thing that one

381
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,360
could probably ever attempt to do, um, which is get extremely lean and try and control your body,

382
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,240
which wants to control you essentially. Um, and I remember just saying like, you're not going to

383
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,920
do this anymore. And I think as soon as I really believed that, like I didn't want to purge anymore.

384
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,000
I was exhausted. Um, that's when things started to change. And I think the more I talked about

385
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,360
that with my therapist, um, where I no longer had a compensatory mechanism, I wasn't going to let my

386
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,240
do myself do that. And I also wasn't going to try and overcompensate with activity because that was

387
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,640
something else that I would do. If I didn't purge, I would feel so restless and anxious and guilty if

388
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,920
I didn't go and do a, you know, a 10 kilometer run because I'd work out, I came, well, I probably

389
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,440
ate this many calories in that purge. And then really I've got no idea because I threw some of

390
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,840
it up. And it was just this horrible, like sickening feeling. Um, it's hard to talk about really. It's

391
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:14,360
kind of gross, but you know, once, once I kind of didn't have these outlets anymore, it forced me to

392
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:21,720
get real with my intention for eating. It forced me to become mindful. It forced me to slow down

393
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,760
and you know, become present with my meals and to really like listen to what my body was saying.

394
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,920
And that was really hard because, you know, of course, if you've restrained from, you know,

395
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,240
certain food, alcohol, drugs for a long period of time, all you do is think about that thing.

396
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,400
Right. So for me, like I'd restricted, like I would allow myself a little bit of ice cream,

397
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,800
um, until I learned about flexible dining, of course. And then that, that changes a lot of

398
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,040
things, but that's another story. But like, you know, I'd restricted cookies and you know,

399
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,280
just nice fun cereals, like normal foods. And I just couldn't control myself around them anymore.

400
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,880
So that was so difficult because I just felt like I was going crazy. I'm like,

401
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,120
what is wrong with me? I remember saying to my therapist, like couple of years into therapy,

402
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,080
why do I still want to eat the entire type of ice cream? I feel like I can't just make myself

403
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,520
one serving. I want to eat the whole thing. And she's like, well, Holly, like you've restricted

404
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,840
this for 10 years. Like why, what makes you think that you're going to cure this, um, desire

405
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,400
overnight when it's been something that you've built a habit that's ingrained over, you know,

406
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,240
your lifetime with this disorder. So I think once I started having a little bit more compassion

407
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,280
for myself and, you know, forgiveness and reducing the amount of judgment that I had

408
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,840
for myself as a human, like you're, you're a screw up. You're what's wrong with you. You know,

409
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,840
once I started to be kinder to mess myself, that was when I started to make a little bit more

410
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,000
progress. And I hated the outcome at that initial, like going through that initial trans, um,

411
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,440
transformation, because it meant I gained so much weight, so much weight. And at this point,

412
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,560
I hadn't really tackled the underlying cause either. Like the, the why, which was, I felt like

413
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,440
my body need, that was the thing that would give me value. So I'm trying to do this just to stop

414
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,160
the binging and the purging. So for me to see my body weight, you know, exceed like 70 kilograms,

415
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:31,240
like right now I sit at about 63 kilos. Um, so to get to like 75 kilos at the peak of my recovery

416
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,040
was the most uncomfortable I think I've ever been. And I think anybody that struggled with body weight,

417
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:45,800
you know, weight gain, uh, can appreciate that feeling. And I just had to do it. Um,

418
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,800
So meaning like, was the, was the therapeutic instruction, like you need to sit in the

419
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,720
discomfort of this weight gain? Yep. Um, that was one of the first strategies that I had to work

420
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,720
through for my anxiety. At this point, I'd also developed a social anxiety. It was, it was just

421
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,760
like this, the lid had been taken off and all these things were like, you know, immersing themselves

422
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,520
in front of me and I, I had no idea how to manage them. So yeah, learning to sit with that discomfort,

423
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,440
um, and be okay with that. So now like part of that process was discussing the feelings

424
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,040
and that was really when we started to identify, okay, what are the feelings that you have now

425
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,200
that you've gained weight? And it of course led to, uh, I feel horrible. I'm disgusting. This is

426
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:44,120
so unhealthy. Um, you know, I hate myself, like just such horrible words, um, to describe myself.

427
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,600
And you know, I think one of the things that at the time the therapist had said was,

428
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,760
what would you say to a client? Cause at this time, like I'm practicing dietitian. I've been

429
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:59,800
a dietitian for like 10 plus years. So, you know, I really had to go, okay, what would I say to my

430
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,480
clients if they said that? So I had to start treating myself like I would my clients and

431
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,240
yeah, there was a big shift then in, you know, just that, like I said, compassion, um, that I

432
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:19,880
had for myself. So yeah, I think. So how did that work? I think that's a wonderful test. I call it

433
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,120
the Rick Elias test. He's a friend of mine who describes it, uh, even one step further, which is

434
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,280
what would you say to your best friend if they were saying these things, if they were in this

435
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,200
situation and it's amazing how much it totally changes and softens the tone. It really does.

436
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:46,040
Yeah. I think, um, you know, the first thing that springs to mind was, um, but what about your

437
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:52,120
physical appearance? Um, well, what does our friendship have to do with your physical appearance

438
00:42:52,120 --> 00:43:01,320
if it was a friend and nothing, it, it was like, I don't have any like logical reasoning for believing

439
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,680
this to be true. Um, and so many people like clients would say, Oh, you know, I've got this

440
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,840
holiday, um, catching up with some friends that I haven't seen in a long time. We've got this,

441
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,440
you know, it's always a wedding or some kind of, you know, special event where

442
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,440
they feel the need to look a certain way. And I said, do you think you would have been invited

443
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,560
if you were, um, you know, 10 kilos heavier and like people are like, yeah, of course. I'm like,

444
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,520
those relationships aren't built on your aesthetic. It is built on your, you know, your character.

445
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,720
There's obviously something admirable that people like about you that has nothing to do with your,

446
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,160
you know, appearance. Uh, it's a common interest, you know, the ability to connect over things and,

447
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,640
maybe your sense of humor, like, you know, insert whatever characteristic it is.

448
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,400
And I think when I started kind of talking to myself in that way, I was like, Oh yeah,

449
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,760
I actually still can have fun on the weekends. Um, and it has nothing to do with my,

450
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,880
the weight on the scale or my body fat percentage. So

451
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,160
part of what is so interesting about your story makes it so hard to reconcile, which is,

452
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,840
um, everything we just talked about, which then co-exists with one of your passions,

453
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:19,480
which is bodybuilding, which, you know, seems to me to be this single activity that would most

454
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:26,920
raise the risk of the one thing you're trying to prevent. Right. I mean, I guess if you were a jockey,

455
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,440
or a gymnast that might be close on the list as well, but, but even those entities wear more

456
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,880
clothing than a bikini. So, so you've, you've chosen to have this hobby outside of your job,

457
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,160
but it's really related to your job, right? I mean, it's in many ways, it's the pinnacle of exercise

458
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:55,640
and nutrition as it pertains to aesthetics. And you've also chosen to do it in the drug free

459
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,400
category. So you, you don't get to rely on any additional biochemistry. You have to do this

460
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:09,480
just through training and nutrition. Um, there's an, I don't know if irony is the word, but, but,

461
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,880
but there's something in there that's worth exploring. And I, I imagine this has come up

462
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:21,640
repeatedly with your therapist. Absolutely. So yeah, it's, um, it's been a really long journey.

463
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:28,200
And there was a point just a few years ago where I really questioned my decisions to remain a coach

464
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:36,280
and to be in the, you know, nutrition and exercise space, um, because of the hypocrisy that I felt

465
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,800
with, you know, what I was coaching on. So again, I think I can say that for the first 10 years of my

466
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:55,480
practice, I had no desire to change my beliefs. I believed truly, um, from the bottom of my heart,

467
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:03,160
that in order for me to be successful in business, to, um, you know, support others the best that I

468
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,720
possibly could and to be taken seriously in an industry that is largely, you know, dominated by

469
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:17,080
males. Um, I needed to not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. So I never addressed that belief.

470
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:22,040
I believe that I needed to be lean. So I never did anything about it. I felt uncomfortable that

471
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,280
whole time. Like the psychological stress that I had. Can you by the way, give me some examples on

472
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,600
this for, I mean, I don't, what body fat are you at when you're on stage? Um, it depends. So I

473
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:39,960
compete in, I have competed in figure for IFBB, which is, um, a non drug tested Federation. Um,

474
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,560
and I have since moved away from that. Um, but for those girls, you're probably looking at just on 10%

475
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:51,720
body fat. They're extremely lean. Um, and now that the division that I competed in, which is the

476
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,400
fitness category and it's for a different Federation, it's a slightly, um, smaller body,

477
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,240
but still very, um, muscular and very lean. Um, I probably get down to about, you know,

478
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:12,440
10 or 11% body fat. And just to make sure I understand at 10 to 11% body fat, does your

479
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:19,640
menstrual cycle still continue? So for majority of my competition history and competing life,

480
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:27,240
yes, it would completely stop. Uh, in fact, for about five years, I did not have a period.

481
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,760
And that was even with the return of, you know, calories back to a normal amount,

482
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,920
even with the return of body fat, you know, back to, you know, normal healthy levels. Um,

483
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,600
I think it was just the years of, uh, you know, binging and purging.

484
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,040
I mean, think about just from an evolutionary standpoint, what that's telling you that is

485
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:52,920
telling you that again, evolution has one purpose for you and it's saying you are not even fit

486
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,880
enough to do this. Yep. Yeah. And I mean, a lot of people ask like, is it a healthy sport and is it,

487
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,840
you know, dangerous to get that, that lean? And I would say, well, it kind of depends because,

488
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,960
you know, I know there are a lot of females that particularly in that, you know, line of work,

489
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,240
if you're going to call yourself a professional in the bodybuilding space, they don't have the desire

490
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,160
for, you know, families. So fertility isn't even an issue. Yeah. No. And I'm making no judgment

491
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,440
about that. I'm just thinking about it from an evolutionary standpoint. Absolutely. It's

492
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,480
basically saying the one thing you were put on this earth to do evolution is putting the brakes

493
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,200
on because it's basically saying you don't have enough excess energy to care for another life,

494
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:38,520
to carry another life to term. Absolutely. Um, it's, it's really scary. So you, you, there's,

495
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,480
there's no, no doubts about it. Um, it's not a great thing for our, you know, for females to

496
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,280
be that lean, we're not meant to be that lean. Um, and I think unfortunately, you know, it's

497
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,800
just something that has grown with, you know, the changes in times, society shift. I think there's

498
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,880
been a lot of segue and improvements with, you know, the ideals for females. I think it used to

499
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,520
be extremely slim. You know, you think about the really tall models, you know, runway models that

500
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,400
used to be like the, the look that everyone wanted to go for. And I'm actually really happy

501
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,440
that I think we're seeing a shift just with the general population to, um, you know, empowering

502
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,000
females with resistance training and strength training. Um, because to me, that is far more

503
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,480
beneficial than, you know, starving and, you know, being a bean bean pole. So I think there's,

504
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:33,640
that's promising, but for whatever reason, we seem to kind of find ourselves back at this

505
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:42,920
extremism, um, you know, ideal and, you know, extra extremely lean women are simply not healthy.

506
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:50,280
Now, do all women lose their menstrual cycle when they compete? Um, no, I've had probably a 50 50,

507
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,320
um, with the competitors that I've worked with that still have normal, um, menstrual cycle, or

508
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,920
it may not stop, but it becomes, you know, irregular. It's, um, all over the place. In fact,

509
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,520
my last competition, I was actually getting a cycle like every two weeks for about eight,

510
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:13,800
probably 16 weeks of a contest prep, which was really bizarre. Um, but that was after also not

511
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,800
having had a period. So it took me a few years to recover my period, um, through, you know, the,

512
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,960
the process of reverse dieting, the recovery diet, um, and allowing myself to gain some body fat and

513
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,160
have an off season where I, you know, got an adequate amount of calories and was able to fuel

514
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,360
my body to a point where, you know, my hormones are working and functioning as they should. Um,

515
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,560
but yeah, then the other 50% of people do completely lose it. So how do you,

516
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,880
how do you now think about this? Right? If you, if you could go back in time and talk to yourself,

517
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:55,240
uh, when you were 18 years old, would you, would you say to Holly, then, you know,

518
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:01,160
just stay away from the fitness industry, stay away from bodybuilding, uh, get your degree in,

519
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,280
you know, economics or business, you know, something like that. Like, do you think that

520
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,840
even though where you've ended up now seems like you're on a path to recovery.

521
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,760
Do you feel that you were just flying too close to the sun all of this time?

522
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,440
Yeah. So I have asked myself this question a lot. Um, and people will say, you know,

523
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:31,000
what would you do differently? I think that if you spend an equal amount of time working on

524
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:39,160
your mental health and that is, you know, coupled with, you know, diet and exercise,

525
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:47,000
I believe because I'm in this place right now where, wherever I am, uh, along the spectrum

526
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,600
of body fat, um, wherever I am, you know, in my competition on season off season, um,

527
00:51:53,160 --> 00:52:01,400
I could truly say that I am good, like with myself, wherever I am, the things that will limit me from,

528
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,760
you know, getting to the point like, like obesity or like an unhealthy body weight, um, would

529
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,880
probably be like, again, extreme habits, like taking anything to the, um, to the limits where,

530
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,800
you know, you're just completely careless with your food and careless with exercise and you

531
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,960
just don't have any interest. So I don't think I would ever like allow myself to get to that place

532
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,560
because it just wouldn't feel good anymore. Like I try to really, uh, be conscious of, okay, what,

533
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:34,280
what leads to you, you know, number one, feeling happy. Um, and then also what's good for your body.

534
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,960
How do you feel best? Where do you perform best? Um, how do I think and function best? So,

535
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,920
you know, outside of that, I just, I feel like you can be in this space, but I know a lot of people

536
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:53,320
are not doing the work that is required to, um, shift their why. Because I think that's really

537
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,720
important for people that are moving into the bodybuilding space. So I want to just kind of walk

538
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,200
through, let's say your most recent contest. You just had a contest a couple of weeks ago, right?

539
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:11,640
Um, so I want to walk through the training and the nutrition for the entire prep. So let's just

540
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,240
say six months leading up to the contest. So kind of a bulking building phase and then a cutting

541
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:23,560
phase and then a post phase or a recovery diet phase. Um, and even though in your case,

542
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,680
the stakes are really high, it's a professional bodybuilding competition at the highest level,

543
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,520
right? It's a world Federation, but for someone listening to this, it could be like their wedding.

544
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:41,960
Right. It's like, you know, a woman who wants to look her best at her wedding, um, and might

545
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,760
acknowledge that like she, it's going to not be the most sustainable she can be, but wants to do

546
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:57,160
it in a way that's not harmful. So, um, let's go back as far as we need to six months, nine months

547
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:04,840
a year. What is the training? How do you periodize it? What are the principles of nutrition? Um,

548
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,800
and everything I want to understand what the cutting phase looks like. And I want to know

549
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,800
what this, this, cause my wife was telling me, cause you guys were talking about this,

550
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,640
the, the recovery phase is also very important. How you come out of the competition without doing

551
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,880
what would be natural, given that you're starving is just to go, you know, go wild. So let's go back

552
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:30,840
to the beginning. Uh, it's time to start adding muscle and, uh, and bulking up.

553
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,920
Yeah. So I think, well, first and foremost, I'd say majority of the people that, you know,

554
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,680
our team work with are just gen pop. You know, they're not, not quite as, uh, extreme or high

555
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,760
up in like the professional athletes status status that I am. Um, but the wonderful thing is that

556
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,480
the processes are honestly no different. The only true difference between somebody that is,

557
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,880
you know, a professional athlete, um, versus your stay at home mom who wants to, you know,

558
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,120
look good for, you know, they've got a girl's trip coming up or something, you know, next year or

559
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:11,000
wedding, like you said, um, would be the extreme or the, the degree to which we take these processes.

560
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:18,360
So for most people, when we first start, um, I kind of want to have an idea about like,

561
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:24,520
what's their goal? Uh, what do you like ideally want to look like, or sometimes there's health,

562
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,720
you know, health, um, goals as well. But I will say the majority of people that come to us are

563
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,480
also looking to, or primarily wanting to change their physique. So we need to get a good

564
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,040
understanding of what, what that looks like, because a lot of, a lot of women will say,

565
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Hey, you know, I'm down for this resistance training that you're talking about, but I'm

566
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:51,320
terrified of getting, you know, too bulky. Um, and that is going like how we approach this whole

567
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,520
thing comes down to the individual's definition of like, what's bulky look like to you. Yeah.

568
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,880
What percentage of clients that you guys have look at you and say, I don't want to look like you.

569
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:10,040
That's too much muscle. So I would say that, uh, most of my clients, 90% of my clients,

570
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:16,680
um, like this ideal, I think most people would say, yeah, I am not too bulky. Holly, you look great.

571
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,400
I have had some people like, Nope, your quads are way too big. Nope. I want to fit in my jeans or,

572
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,200
you know, something like that. But for the most part, um, like my physique, like that fitness

573
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,200
looking fitness model physique is something that most women, um, I might be generalizing, um, but

574
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,160
aspire to, but again, it depends, you know, if I'm talking to an endurance athlete versus somebody

575
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,160
that, um, you know, has come from a sporty background and they're trying to do something

576
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,600
that's very, you know, anaerobic might be a different, um, uh, physique ideal. Cause that

577
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:53,160
would not be beneficial for their sport. But, um, we want to, we want to identify that first. So we

578
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:59,400
go through, you know, it's very unlikely that women will get to the point where they look like a

579
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,280
female bodybuilder. Like these things don't happen naturally. Like that, those bodybuilders,

580
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,920
like that, that physique, that look, um, is not obtained without performance enhancing drugs.

581
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:17,960
Um, my physique and great genetics and it's extreme training, personality,

582
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,880
perfect nutrition. Yeah. We call it the myth of accidental muscle. Yeah. And I still, you still

583
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,040
have to admire those people to spite them being on, it's not easy. Like it's still not easy, but

584
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,320
you know, they've got some support. So for me, like if someone was looking to make change their

585
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:40,760
physique to, um, you know, this level of muscularity, um, that's still taken me like seven years of

586
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:48,280
very consistent nutrition and training. Um, where, you know, I've, I have probably missed less than,

587
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,040
you know, 10 weeks a year of training. Like, and I have been like that for 10 years.

588
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,840
So you're not going to accidentally grow muscle like this, even without, you know,

589
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,440
some serious consistency. And how do you help them identify the actual goals? I think this is

590
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,440
an important state. So when a, when a, when a client, and I just want to, I'm going to use

591
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,840
a female example here and focus that. So, so if, if she comes in and says, look, I'm getting

592
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:18,360
married next summer and I want to look my best, is that not specific enough, right? You want to say,

593
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:25,160
well, right now you weigh this much and your body fat is this a year from now. Do you want to weigh

594
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,880
this much and have your body fat be this? I mean, what degree of granularity do you need to set the

595
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:35,880
goal to, to, to set the path? Absolutely. So I am pretty granular compared to some of even our other

596
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,040
coaches. I think all of our processes are slightly different. I guess the principles at the end of

597
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,840
the day are the same. Um, but I'll often say like, is there somebody that you follow on social media

598
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,560
or that you've seen in magazines that you like really like their physique just to help me get

599
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:54,200
a better understanding? Um, because it does really vary. And sometimes I've been very shocked. I'm

600
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,360
like, Oh, okay. All right. I actually don't really need to do a whole lot of, you know, building for

601
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,240
this individual, um, you know, based on where they currently are. So that building phase may not even,

602
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,160
you know, be part of the equation. So, uh, that we also have a look at their scale weight and their

603
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,120
current body fat percentages, which will, um, preferentially have them send us through DEXA.

604
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:20,520
We take a look at all their biomarkers, that type of thing. Um, and then from there, I kind of plot

605
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,040
a bit of a trajectory. So if they do need to gain, you know, a significant amount of muscle in that

606
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:32,440
12 months time, um, I will basically map out, um, you know, week for week using some equations,

607
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,560
like, okay, this is basically how many weeks of building we would need to do as a natural,

608
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,360
like drug-free person. And tell me what you believe the limits are for women. So, uh, it's going to be

609
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,160
a little bit lower than males. And part of that is just, you know, due to their ability to, you know,

610
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,520
build more muscle mass and, um, I guess, sex differences and that type of thing. But we can

611
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:01,240
still do a lot of, like a lot of positive work in an off season. So in an eight week period,

612
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,440
I was actually looking at a study very recently, um, for natural athletes, we're able to acquire

613
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:13,800
somewhere just under the amount of one kilogram of fat free mass. So fat free mass isn't just

614
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,600
skeletal tissue. We've got to take into consideration, you know, the increases in, um, you know, water

615
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:25,240
mass increases in all of these other things. So that's my record, by the way, in the one year I

616
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:32,360
dedicated to the most improvement was 13 pounds in 12 months of fat free mass. So it's about

617
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:37,320
a kilo per eight weeks. Yep. That sounds, that sounds dead on. And you're saying that's true

618
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,200
for men and women. Yeah. Well, again, it depends on, you know, the individual, how, how much time

619
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,200
are they willing to invest in this goal? Where is it on their priority list? You know, it really

620
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,520
comes down to their training volumes. How well are you going to adhere to your diet? How are you

621
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,720
going to adhere to these other variables that all impact, you know, your rates of muscle gain? So do

622
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,680
you know what the largest amount of lean mass you've put on in a year has been? So I haven't done it

623
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,360
over 12 months. Um, but I do know that between two competitions, one at the beginning of the year,

624
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:12,440
uh, one towards the end or last quarter, uh, I put on about six kilograms. So that's more,

625
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,640
that's like 14 pounds of lean tissue. So it was a lot. And that was me going into the

626
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,160
university of South Florida. We were doing my, um, uh, BMR testing. I did muscle thickness testing.

627
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:29,880
So this was all, you know, fairly, um, accurate methods of determining like hypertrophy. So that

628
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,960
was, that blew my mind. But again, I would say I've put on muscle very easily, like, um, which,

629
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,200
you know, maybe there's a genetic component to that, but I'm also very like regimented with my

630
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:49,560
training and the period of time when that happened, I was very, very fluffy. I was very

631
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:54,280
fluffy. I allowed myself to put on a lot of body fat. Um, Oh yeah. So I want to ask you about that.

632
01:01:54,280 --> 01:02:01,400
So in the, with the six kilos of lean tissue, how much fat tissue came with it? Um, six kilos,

633
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,400
like for me, in that particular episode for you. Oh goodness. Um, it was probably about, uh,

634
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:15,880
oh, 30% on top of. So yeah, if I had six pounds, so two pounds, two kilos, two kilos of fat. Exactly.

635
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Okay. Yep. So basically your body fat probably went up a little bit. Yeah. As you put on a lot

636
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:29,880
more lean mass. I'd say I probably went up by about 30%. So if I started this build, um, at,

637
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:35,320
you know, 12% after a show, I got up to 19%. So actually it's more than that. I remember being

638
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,600
19% body fat at the end of that build. So yeah, that's, that's kind of amazing Holly that, that

639
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:47,800
to me, if a guy made that change, that would be considered impressive drug-free so that a woman

640
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:53,800
could do that. Um, and again, let's just posit that you have great genetics, but it gives, it gives us,

641
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,520
it gives us a range that there are women with lesser genetics who might be able to do half of

642
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:04,120
that in a year. They might be able to put on three kilos in a year, which is still seven pounds.

643
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,640
And I think I also have to be very, you know, transparent about this. So I was in a position

644
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:16,120
too, where my ability to kind of step back from my other obligations and priorities, um, has been

645
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:23,080
like fair, I'm not going to say easily facilitated, but you're doing this as your job. Yes. Right. So,

646
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,320
you know, I remember and recall through that training block I had programmed,

647
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,680
you know, progressively overloading, like my first week of a, um, as a cycle might've been

648
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:38,360
three working sets of everything on my list. And I might've had six or seven exercises by that

649
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:44,840
sixth week of training, I would be pushing like five working hard sets, high training,

650
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,280
intensity, you know, RPEs eight nines of like my first three exercises and then four of everything

651
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:57,480
else. Like the volume I was getting up to was insane. So talk to me about hours in gym per day

652
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,520
in the beginning of the build phase versus the end of the build phase. I hit it hard

653
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:08,360
pretty quick, pretty early. Um, I also had a bit more of a reactive style to deloads. Normally I

654
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:13,400
would plan intentional deloads. The whole purpose of that build was to get as much muscle on me as

655
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,480
I could in a very short timeframe. So, um, the volume probably went up by about 50% within the

656
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:29,240
first, you know, 12 weeks. Um, and then it just continued to grow. So, uh, the time that it would

657
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:36,200
take me varied from maybe 90 minutes in like the earlier part of that build phase, um, all the way

658
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,480
up to two, two and a half hours daily. And I was doing five sessions a week at that point. So it

659
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,480
was a big commitment. And then were you doing any cardio at that time? Minimal. I would just hit a

660
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:52,280
daily step target, um, with about 10,000 steps and cardio was not even part of the equation. Got it.

661
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:58,760
So averaging to up to two and a half hours a day in the gym, five days a week. So again, we're

662
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:05,720
talking about good genetics coupled with 15 hours, a lot of training. Um, some of the people

663
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,680
listening to this podcast, I'm guessing will be more women than men. Uh, won't be as familiar with

664
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,600
RPE. Do you mind explaining to people what that is? Cause it's going to be an important concept as

665
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:21,000
we talk about resistance training. Yeah, absolutely. So RPE, uh, is or stands for a rate of perceived

666
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,640
exertion. So it's a measure of training intensity and training intensity is one of the principles

667
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:35,080
that need to be, uh, increased over your, um, training lifespan in order to facilitate hypertrophy.

668
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:41,720
So, uh, I guess I can reflect back on my early training days and I didn't even have a training

669
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,120
RPE. There was no training intensity. Um, you know, there's, I guess another one that we can

670
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:51,480
refer to, which we use on our workout builder programs is the RIR, which is repetitions in

671
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:58,600
reserve. So you're basically an IRR, RIR of three would mean that you've got three repetitions in

672
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:04,040
reserve all the way up to an IRR of zero, you're hitting failure. So whatever weight or load you

673
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:12,360
select for your lift, you are going to your drop essentially. So my training, when I first started

674
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:20,280
lifting, um, incorrectly, um, was so low, like I never challenged myself. Uh, and again, I know that

675
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,840
we wanted to talk today about our bodybuilding versus powerlifting and how they may be beneficial

676
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:31,400
for, you know, females. Um, I am so grateful for the time that I spent powerlifting because

677
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:38,520
that style of training, um, kind of threw me into understanding training intensity and what my true

678
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:44,840
strength was. So there was a lot of carryover to, you know, how quickly I was able to, um, you know,

679
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:51,640
select weights for my bodybuilding style of workouts. Um, and that advanced me so quickly.

680
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,200
So just to make sure I understand you're saying when you were younger and you were doing fitness

681
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:01,000
training and even training for track and field, you were never pushing yourself in the weight room.

682
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,760
Your art, your, your RPE was below five. Your RIR was above five. Yep, absolutely. Yeah. We,

683
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,200
and we were never even given a training intensity. It was just do three sets of 12.

684
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:17,160
Yeah. So right now, when you say in these, in this building phase, when you say RPE eight,

685
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:23,080
meaning you stopped and you had two in the tank, um, you could have potentially squeezed out two

686
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:29,240
more. And you said, so if you're doing RPE eight to nine, these are near failure sets all the way

687
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:36,520
through. Yep, absolutely. Focus on, uh, how would you split those five days? Was it a leg day,

688
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,920
a push pull day? How are you splitting those days? Yeah. So look, I think, um, if we all look at how

689
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:49,800
I kind of set up a training program, there are so many ways that you can go about this. Um, and,

690
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,360
but they all do need to follow, you know, the principles of hypertrophy. And I guess number

691
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,920
one is, you know, exercise specificity. We need to make making sure that we're training in such a

692
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,960
way or a modality that he's going to have the desired outcome. So obviously building muscle

693
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,680
and then choosing muscle groups that you want to build during that timeframe. So for me, that

694
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,440
looks like a group, glute hypertrophy. Um, that's kind of the main area that most women, or at least

695
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,320
those that I'm experienced in working with, uh, really want to improve, um, because that has a

696
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:25,320
lot of benefits for many things from normal day-to-day activities, bending down, squatting, um,

697
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,560
through to, you know, improve strength across all sports, jumping, da, da, da, da, da, da. You know,

698
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:35,800
there's so many benefits. So, um, glute hypertrophy took up a big part of my training volume. Um,

699
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,840
shoulder hypertrophy was another one that I really, uh, focused a lot of my training volume on to kind

700
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:46,760
of create the, um, you know, the capped shoulders and the illusion of a narrower rate for waste.

701
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:54,120
Um, so thinking back to that build, most of the training that I was doing was lower body. So I

702
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:59,640
actually did four lower body sessions, believe it or not per week. And then one upper body session.

703
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,680
So it sounds crazy. Yeah. It does sound crazy. And those four lower body sessions,

704
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,120
were you still dividing the legs up or were you hitting the same muscles of the legs four days?

705
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:16,440
So, uh, I think my programs are varied and again, I would kind of triage, um, to kind of give my body

706
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,560
the recovery that it needed. And again, it was very reactive style of deload. So I would start by,

707
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:30,120
I guess Monday might be spread out by doing quad hamstring, glute, carve, um, quad hamstring.

708
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,640
And then that might be that workout. Uh, I may have a second day, which looks like, uh, glute

709
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,040
hamstring quad, or I would prioritize again, the muscle groups that I knew I wanted to build.

710
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,280
So, uh, then I would have a rest day because back to back two days of leg days, pretty intense.

711
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:52,360
Um, and then I would probably incorporate an upper body session to again, a second day of

712
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,800
complete rest from my legs. And then I would finish out the week by doing like a Thursday session,

713
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,800
lower body two days off, come back in train on a Sunday, another lower body session. So

714
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:12,040
there was a lot of training volume. And I just want to say that I would never do that for somebody

715
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:17,400
that was brand new to training. Um, that volume would be radically reduced. Okay. So what would

716
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:25,160
it look like for a person who has some exercise background, like they, they go to, you know,

717
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,760
orange theory fitness twice a week and they, you know, they're, they're a relatively active person,

718
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,120
but they don't have any powerlifting experience and they've, they don't know the difference between

719
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,480
RPE nine and RPE five. Right. So they're not, they're not there. How would you, but they still

720
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:47,240
have this ambition of building. They want to put on five pounds of muscle in the next year

721
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,240
and lose three pounds of fat. Like that's the physique goal.

722
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:57,080
Yeah. So first and foremost, I would say like, again, if this is like literal, literal, literal

723
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:03,000
practical takeaways, I would say number one, find somebody that's evidence-based first and foremost,

724
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,520
ideally find somebody that can also that's evidence-based, be with you in a gym setting.

725
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:14,600
They do one-on-one training because there is so much value and knowledge to be learned just one-on-one

726
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,840
spending time with someone that's got more knowledge than you in that space, um, developing

727
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:24,440
optimal training techniques, developing the right movement pathways. And boy, I have seen some doozies,

728
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,240
you know, clients are being trained in the gym by someone that has no idea how to squat or deadlift.

729
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:35,480
So another little plus if you can find somebody that does powerlifting or has done

730
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:41,880
bodybuilding and powerlifting. Um, I think that is like a little golden egg. They, there's not

731
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,360
a lot of these people out there, but, um, incorporating that evidence-based approach with,

732
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:53,000
um, experience with women and powerlifting and bodybuilding. That's like the perfect ideal.

733
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,880
And experience with women because of what difference specifically? Is it anatomic

734
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,120
differences in movements or is it just the assumption that women are coming in with lower

735
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,960
training volume? No, I think, look, there's plenty of men out there that can do that as well,

736
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,680
but I think you've got to connect with the person that you're working with. And I think

737
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,440
now if you've got a male that's extremely experienced, um, you know, in all of those

738
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:25,960
things, then of course, I may, I may all can be great, but I think, um, having gone through

739
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:31,640
different body image issues, having that understanding and appreciation for maybe

740
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:38,680
body dysmorphia, uh, having an appreciation for menstrual cycle, you know, I think men that are in

741
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,680
fitness industry, and I don't want to generalize because I know there's a lot of really intelligent

742
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:48,600
guys out there, but there isn't a lot of work like just the general personal trainer, um, and the

743
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,120
amount of time that they spend, you know, learning about the reproductive system and how

744
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,400
that can impact strength and, you know, subj- subjective performance and, um, you know,

745
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:04,200
the implications that that can have on your mood, your psychological state, and just the plethora of

746
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:11,000
like what being a woman encompasses. I just think that women tend to do better with female trainers,

747
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
but again, it's, it's harder to come by. So that's what I mean by that. So what would you

748
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,600
design for a client in that situation? So let's just make the, I'm just gonna make it even harder.

749
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,800
This is a woman who wants to gain five pounds of muscle and lose five pounds of fat in a year.

750
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,840
In other words, they want to weigh, they're not, they're fine weighing the same amount next year,

751
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,480
but the change in body composition is going to be dramatic. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So first and

752
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,800
foremost, I would be looking at, okay, what realistically can we gain in, you know, an

753
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,440
eight month timeframe? So that's the period of time you want to build up. Yes, absolutely. So

754
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,040
first off from a program design standpoint, we would want to start with a fairly low training

755
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:57,640
volume if this is somebody that has not, um, you know, done a whole lot of resistance training.

756
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,760
So we would start by selecting the muscle groups and the exercises that target the areas they want

757
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,160
to build. Um, and we would progressively overload that, um, training. So it might start with, you

758
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:15,800
know, one working set for every exercise in week one. That little. Yep. That little. So, uh, typically

759
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,120
I would start with a program that is like 40 minutes maximum, 30 or 40 minutes maximum.

760
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,440
How many warmup sets to get to that working set? Typically, probably one or two. Um, and part of

761
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,960
that would also be just helping with the demonstration of technique and kind of getting

762
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,760
that movement pattern. And what would be the RPE of the one working set? Starting off like an RPE

763
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,920
six or seven in a week one set of 10, but weighted to an RPE of six or seven. Yep, exactly. Which

764
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:44,440
again, just for the person listening means you're going to do 10 reps of this thing. But if, if

765
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:50,200
your life depended on it, you could get 13 or 14. Exactly. Yep. And just one set. Yep. So you

766
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:55,480
might start with three days a week. It's, and again, we've got to incorporate the, uh, person's,

767
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,280
uh, ability to sacrifice time for their training. So, and so the other thing I'm taking away from

768
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,000
this Holly, cause I wouldn't have thought of this. So I'm glad I'm asking this question.

769
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:09,240
It's better that she does one set of leg extension, one set of leg curl, one set of

770
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:15,800
single leg RDL, one set of leg press, do, do, do, do, do, do, instead of just five sets of leg press.

771
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:20,040
Yep. Yeah. And I think part of that as well, um, it's teaching her enough. It's giving her

772
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,360
the education on this so that you can now build on that. Yeah, absolutely. Well, you're learning

773
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,680
what muscle, uh, what exercises target certain muscle groups and you're also minimuming the,

774
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:34,360
minimizing the risk of them, uh, getting injured or ending up with extreme, you know, delayed onset

775
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,600
muscle soreness. Um, the last thing that you want to do is put together a program that is

776
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:44,680
too difficult and the next day they can't even walk. Like how, how well is somebody going to,

777
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,400
um, or likely to comply with that program? You know, thereafter, they've had that level of pain,

778
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,480
um, from a session, it's going to be really low. So we want to have good adherence from the get-go.

779
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,080
So, and it's also, I guess more interesting, like it's sort of the diversity of the program.

780
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:01,560
Exercise diversity. And I think women, um, definitely, well, men and women as well,

781
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,680
but I think males are probably happy to do a lot more repetitive type training, um, you know,

782
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:12,360
to get to the end result. Females, we like a little bit of diversity. So how many days a week are you

783
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,360
doing this and are you mixing upper and lower body on the same day at the beginning? It doesn't really

784
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:21,400
matter again, the primary driver of what, um, or how I would put together that workout would really

785
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,840
be like training volumes. So whether or not you do, you know, lower body and an upper body or whether

786
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:33,160
you do a full body training session, it doesn't really matter. Um, I would probably be deferring

787
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:39,080
to what's your history like, what's your experience? What do you like doing? Because on paper, it

788
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,760
probably doesn't really matter that much. What's more important is that I can get you to stick to

789
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:49,880
this. So, so how many weeks are you in that phase? Yep. So typically I will write a mesocycle for

790
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:55,320
somewhere between four and six weeks. So again, my decision for four weeks versus six weeks is

791
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,040
the person's ability to adhere to the same program for that amount of time.

792
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:04,600
I know for me, when I first started, I, if I had to do the same program for more than two or three

793
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:11,160
weeks, I was like, this is so boring. Like as if it's even working, let's change it up. So again,

794
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,000
there's a lot of personal preference, you know, when it comes to putting those programs together.

795
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,720
So I personally write my programs for six weeks. I can handle anything for six weeks. It's repetitive,

796
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,040
but you've got, you know, maybe three or four, maybe five programs again, depending on the levels

797
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,600
of the individual's experience levels. So you've got quite a bit of exercise diversity, you know,

798
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,360
within a seven day period. So tell me some of the lower body exercises you would have

799
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,440
a relative newbie, but not a total novice do you would cycle through what for lower body?

800
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:48,120
I think my favorites for compound lists are always going to be your typical power lifting

801
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:55,480
movement. So I always try to incorporate some kind of squat or hinging variation or deadlift.

802
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:01,000
So the degree of flexibility just with those two exercises alone is enormous. Like you can do

803
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,120
heels, elevated squats, spiff machine squats, box squats, pause squats, and as in squats,

804
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:12,040
like there's so many variations, but what do you, so if you have a woman who's never done anything,

805
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,320
basics, and that's what you're going to start with like a goblet squat or a back squat to a box or

806
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,760
yep, absolutely. Body weight squat would be actually the first thing. So I'm just looking

807
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:26,760
at movement pattern to begin with. Um, and then we start to add loads and I typically start with

808
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,880
a barbell and my preference is low bar squatting. I like to teach, well, actually it depends on the

809
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:38,040
person's anatomical makeup because high bar squatting might be better suited to, uh, an individual

810
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:43,240
that's got very short femurs compared to somebody that has extremely long femurs like I do,

811
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:47,080
low bar squatting. And I'm basically leaning over, looking at the ground when I squat just

812
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:52,840
to clear my hips or to be able to clear my hips. So, um, keeping it basic. And when you say low,

813
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,840
high, you mean the position on the track position of on, on the, on the back. Yeah, absolutely. So,

814
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,560
there are advantages, I guess, of having a low bar squat in that it, um, if you think about

815
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:07,400
like the moment arm, if you hold a weight plate, um, right in front of you, that's 20 pounds,

816
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,000
you can probably do it for a long period of time. If we extend their arms out, how long do you think

817
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,560
you're going to hold that 20 pound weight? Too long. Not very long. So similar, um, hypothesis

818
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,440
is that when we put the squat bar lower to our center of gravity, um, we tend to have a little

819
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,760
bit more strength and power. And that was a big difference for me as somebody that had crazy long

820
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:31,880
levers. Um, I was a terrible high bar squatter. Um, my strength went up like 50% by shifting to

821
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,520
that low bar position. So again, you asked about that. But is that only because your femurs are so

822
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,320
long? Correct. Yes. And there's other reasons as well. I think spine length as well. I have a long

823
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,600
spine, very long torso. So again, I want to bring that, um, barbell back into closer to the center

824
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,080
of gravity. So I'm very low on the back. Um, and I realized I'm totally deviating from what you

825
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:57,000
asked me, but keeping it simple with the squats. Are there any women that you look at and you just

826
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,760
say, you know what, it's not worth, you're never going to be a power lifter. It's not worth the

827
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:06,760
risk. I don't want you squatting. Um, I would say, uh, anybody that's got, um, some serious

828
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:13,080
like injuries, like a history of, um, hip injury knee injuries. Um, but again, my area of expertise,

829
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:17,080
um, isn't in like a rehabilitation. So I'm normally working in conjunction with, you know,

830
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,400
a physical therapist or chiropractor or something like that. Are women, do you find women who have

831
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:26,280
never done this kind of intimidated by the idea of that big 45 pound Olympic bar going on their back?

832
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:32,200
Heck yes. Absolutely. It is intimidating. I can't imagine. I mean, it's, I think if you've not done

833
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,840
that before, it looks really scary. Terrifying. And I think people's like fear is that the bar's

834
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,760
going to come down on, on top of them. It's going to turn them into a pancake. Yeah, absolutely. So

835
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,040
first of all, when you're first starting, you're not going to be loading the bar that heavy, but I

836
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:49,720
think, um, I work with like the catch bars on. So, um, a technique that I would do and incorporate

837
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,440
into a new person's program. If I was training one-on-one would be the Anderson squat. So you

838
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,920
basically start with the bar on the catches. So you position them at a high. You start in a low

839
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,600
position. Yeah. Yeah. So you're finding the, uh, clients, um, I guess, uh, horizontal position at

840
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,360
the bottom of the squat and that's where you start. So the, the thighs are parallel to the ground. Yep.

841
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:17,160
You start in that position and the rep is up, down. Yeah, absolutely. So that's a really, um,

842
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,360
empowering exercise that I think helps build confidence. So I'll do that in conjunction with

843
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:28,200
other squat variations, um, because it is, you know, it's such a big movement you're using. It's

844
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:34,520
like multi-joint, uh, big muscle groups. So it's also going to help contribute positively to energy

845
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,320
expenditure compared to just doing, you know, isolation exercises like triceps and biceps.

846
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:45,000
In fact, I rarely program arms for women anymore because at the point where, and again, it depends

847
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,760
on their goals, you know, if they're a kayaker or something, they need arm strength. I'm going to

848
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:55,000
probably do that. But for aesthetic reasons alone, most women, once we get rid of the body fat,

849
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,520
they've got great arms because just by way of the, you know, muscle engagement during these big

850
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:06,760
compound lifts, um, you're using those muscles anyway. Okay. What's your preferred deadlift if

851
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:12,840
you had to choose or how do you think about navigating trap bar versus traditional versus

852
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:21,160
sumo? Anatomical like structure of an individual. Um, so people that have exceptionally long arms

853
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:27,640
are extremely good deadlifters typically, um, because they basically don't have to lean

854
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:34,040
forwards very far to have a bar in their hands. Um, my arms are like T-Rex arms. Like they are

855
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,280
disproportionately shorter than everything else, but also is great and creates the illusion that

856
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:46,520
I have massive arms when I don't really. So for me, um, like I am not any way, shape or form,

857
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,080
like built to be a good deadlifter. So you might be more of a trap bar deadlifter.

858
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,880
Whereas he's more of a sumo deadlifter. Yeah. But when I do deadlift, I, for that reason,

859
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:02,200
I do sumo because by widening my stance, I can now get lower to the bar and then I don't have to be

860
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,120
so horizontal to get down to reach. Yeah. Yeah. The traditional would be very painful for you.

861
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:15,400
Oh, it is my spine and I've also extremely long spine. So for my, my, um, my deadlift is so ugly.

862
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,880
It's very tech, like it's technically it looks disgusting, but I'm doing all the right things.

863
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:25,400
Like we know that a little bit of spinal curvature in a deadlift is okay. If you are

864
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:31,880
activating, you know, your core and you're keeping tight. Um, so yeah, I have a hunchback of notred

865
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,480
arm looking, um, conventional deadlift, which is feet together. Um, but sumo deadlift is my

866
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,000
preference because it enables me to get closer to the bar. And I just feel like I'm in a better

867
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:49,240
position to execute. So interesting, right out of the gate, we're going to take, uh, you know,

868
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:54,200
a woman who's never done these things before, and we're going to program in some, some getting to

869
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:00,520
know the squat, getting to know the deadlift. Um, you're going to also include isolation exercises

870
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:06,440
and I assume they follow in the workout. So you'll start with the prime movers and the combined hip

871
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:12,600
hinges, and then you'll move to leg extensions, leg curls. Um, what about, uh, where do, where

872
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:18,600
do split squatting and lunging fit in? Yeah. So typically I will, uh, incorporate, you know,

873
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:24,920
at max, you know, to cut large compound multi-joint exercises. Typically they are like the first,

874
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:30,600
you know, six to eight sets are your best sets. There are like working sets. And then

875
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,840
what we tend to see is that any volume that's accrued, you know, after those eight first

876
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:40,440
working sets tend to, you start to have like diminishing returns. So big movers first,

877
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:45,400
isolation, accessory exercises, seconds. So again, the way that I would structure in something like

878
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:51,000
lunges or leg extensions or a hamstring curls or calf raises, it depends on what that person is

879
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,680
wanting to build. Truly. That's, that's all it is. So again, if we look at the, um, I guess,

880
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:03,640
minimum dose for a hypertrophy, when we look at like total set number, we want to be shooting for

881
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:09,400
somewhere around, you know, probably the 10 to 15 range per muscle group. Um, there are a lot of-

882
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:15,080
When you say per muscle group, you're counting quads distinct from hamstrings, distinct from

883
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:19,320
glutes, distinct from calves. The trouble is, and I guess a lot of people have a difficulty,

884
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:24,040
um, you know, trying to write their own program is that certain movements are hitting multiple.

885
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:29,400
So I will often just give us, you know, yep, that counts as this exercise and that muscle group.

886
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,280
And it counts as that. A dead lift is going to triple everything. It's hitting everything. But

887
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:39,480
when you do the leg extension, it only counts for quads. Leg curl only counts for hamstring.

888
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,080
Exactly. Okay. So you're going to, you're saying we want, by the end of this workout,

889
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:48,840
we want to have 10 to 15 boxes checked for each of those muscle groups. So let's just go through

890
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,560
some of them. So your, your favorites for glutes, obviously a squat and a dead lift. Yep. Absolutely.

891
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:59,640
That single leg RDL. Uh, interestingly, I actually was looking at a systematic review, uh, on glute

892
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:07,800
hypertrophy recently. Um, and I guess they were using, um, muscle activation as opposed to true

893
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,640
muscle thickness testing or some of those other more accurate methods of, um,

894
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:20,200
hypertrophy. Um, but step ups were actually as good as our glute activation as some of your,

895
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:26,280
you know, hip thrusts and, you know, squats, um, particularly some of the horizontal style

896
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:32,520
step ups or lunges where you're coming across the body. So like a cross bench step up where

897
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:38,440
you're taking the foot down one side and then coming back up, uh, where there's a lot of stretch,

898
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:45,160
uh, and lengthening taking place in the, in the glute. So yeah, for, for, for glute hypertrophy,

899
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:51,720
uh, there's always, you know, a hip thrust, a hinge of some sort or a bridge, um, usually some

900
01:26:51,720 --> 01:27:00,520
kind of abduction. Um, an abduction is basically, uh, taking your knees out, um, as opposed to

901
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,320
adduction, which is bringing them together. So I'll find, um, different machines that, uh,

902
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:11,480
enable that. I can also do those on the cables as well with like an ankle attachment. Um, so they're

903
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:19,160
the primary ones that I would use for, for glutes. Those are great. Okay. So deadlifts, squats, hip

904
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:25,320
thrusters, step ups and abduction. Yep. That's a lot. So you got a lot to choose from there to just,

905
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,520
you got to get 10. So you don't have to be doing all of them every time. Yep. And to be honest,

906
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:37,000
like as, as that individual progresses, um, over, uh, I guess a seven day training block,

907
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,440
like we may be working up to, um, you know, 30 sets on, um, you know, each individual muscle group,

908
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:50,440
if they're able to, to execute that, um, over a seven day period because of their training

909
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,120
frequency, obviously, you know, a beginner, we're probably going to be looking, you know, over a

910
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,920
seven day period, they may get, you know, 10 to 15 sets, um, with their three or four training

911
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,120
sessions, but someone that's more advanced really maybe pushing like up to 30 sets, uh, maybe even

912
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:09,080
more. But again, there's a point where we have like diminishing returns where, uh, the inflammatory

913
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:13,560
response to that training, um, just makes it impossible to continue making progress in which

914
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:19,560
case we have the D load. Okay. So then for quads, obviously a lot of what you mentioned is going to

915
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:24,040
hit quads, certainly the squat to some extent, the deadlift, depending on how they do it,

916
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:31,880
the step up, certainly, uh, RDL won't, uh, abduction won't. So then you add some dedicated

917
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,880
stuff like leg extensions. Yep. So leg extensions are a really simple one. Obviously minimal, uh,

918
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,080
set up straight on the machine, but I also like a different leg press variations, uh, and different

919
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:49,480
squat variations that get our knee into a position where there's far more forward knee travel. I know

920
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,320
there's a lot of, uh, contradictions. I used to hear that all the time. Like don't put your knee

921
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,720
over your toe. You know, it's dangerous for your knee. Now, if someone's had a history of knee

922
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:03,400
injuries, that's something that you would want to take very slowly, um, very progressively. Um,

923
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,960
but anything where we can get the knee traveling past the toes. So by elevating your heels in

924
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,960
something like a barbell squat, my preference is honestly on a Smith machine because it really

925
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:17,240
controls the movement pattern. Um, and you only go forward. Sorry. And so people know the Smith

926
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:23,080
machine is the squat bar that has the hooks on it. That's in tracks, right? So the part, the path is

927
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:27,960
vertical on its control. Yeah, it's completely fixed. So, uh, I love that, that exercise. I think

928
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:34,280
targeting my quads, that's been a huge help. Uh, and then also foot positioning on the leg press. So

929
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:41,080
again, you're looking, uh, to have at the bottom of the movement, um, where your, uh, quads are in a,

930
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:48,040
uh, lengthened position. Um, you want to have lots of forward knee travel and I won't be specific in

931
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:53,000
where you should put your feet because feet placement honestly depends on the machine that

932
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,480
you've got access to because I've had some, I've had to put my feet up quite high because of the

933
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,760
movement plane. So it's less where the feet go and it's more where the knees and toes are in

934
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:09,160
relation to each other in the bottom position. Yes, exactly. Yep. So that's kind of the,

935
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:15,320
so are you saying to the, to the, to the client, um, we want you to work to your level of comfort

936
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:20,040
in getting knees over your toes in the leg press and that's going to maximize quad development. And

937
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:24,920
obviously you're going to work the back of the leg in the opposite position. Yep, exactly. So,

938
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,720
and then also there's a lot of benefits to doing like single leg work to, um, so many of us. And

939
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:35,080
I was honestly disgusted at my own, uh, imbalances. When I tested it the other day, I was doing some

940
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:41,400
single leg squats, um, you know, from a, just a sitting to a box, then, uh, standing on the box

941
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:47,480
to going to the floor only. Um, and it's very easy, you know, with lots of repeat training and

942
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:53,240
lots of repeating the same movements, um, where we have a bit of a discrepancy. So I really like to

943
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:58,920
incorporate at least one single leg exercise, um, for every session. If we start to add too many

944
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:04,200
single, um, all leg movements, your program end up, you know, it's extremely long. So that's,

945
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,560
that's a real consideration. You know, not everybody has three hours to train. So we want

946
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:13,480
to be concise and to the point. Okay. What are some of your favorite hamstring hits?

947
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:21,160
So, um, my favorite is a seated hamstring curl. And the reason for that is, um, it is better

948
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:25,800
able to isolate your hamstrings than say a prone hamstring curl where you're in the, uh, you're

949
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,120
laying on your stomach and you're kind of curling the machine in towards your hamstrings. And part

950
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:35,000
of that is just because of the position of the movement. Um, when you're in a seated hamstring

951
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,640
machine, you've already got tension on the hamstrings because we're sitting in this kind of,

952
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:46,520
you know, upright position. Um, so it's a lot more tension on the hamstrings. And if you're in a

953
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:52,440
prone position where your hips are far more open, um, we, we don't get the same kind of, um,

954
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:58,280
shortening of the hamstrings. So my preference is to do a lot more volume on a seated machine.

955
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:05,240
Uh, and then I'm not saying you don't do any, you know, prone work, um, but I'll do less of that

956
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,400
exercise. The other exercise that I really love for hamstrings and glutes, particularly the

957
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,640
hamstring time, which I think a lot of women, you know, you'll see the bikini competitors

958
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:21,400
specifically have these incredibly like tight, um, you know, hamstring attachments, um, to their

959
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:26,520
glutes. Um, a lot of that is conditioning, which basically just means getting rid of all the body

960
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:34,760
fat. You will see that. Um, but, uh, arteals and banded, uh, arteals. So tell folks what an

961
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:42,360
arteal is. So a Romanian deadlift, uh, I guess you are, it's a hinging exercise and you're shifting

962
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:47,480
your hips back to lengthen the hamstrings. So you were loading the hamstrings in that exercise.

963
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,600
You can do, we'll, we'll link to videos of all these things that people can see.

964
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:56,600
Awesome. Cool. So, um, you can do that with dumbbells. You can do it with barbell. Uh,

965
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,840
you can do it with kettlebells if you don't have access to those.

966
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,680
And do you prefer to do these single leg?

967
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,560
So I'll do both. Um, again, I, for a compound movement, if I'm trying to hammer my hamstrings,

968
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:12,680
I probably will start with an RDL because it's a big movement. You know, we're talking multi joint.

969
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,640
And when you do it two legs, you're loading on your back.

970
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:19,080
No, in front of me. So the barbell hangs in front of the dumbbells.

971
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:24,280
So, you know, for, for me, when I first started, it's crazy how quickly you can progress if you

972
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,200
work at it. I remember picking up 20, 25 pound dumbbells to do my first set of RDLs for sets of,

973
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,760
you know, 12 and now I'm all the way up at 90 pounds dumbbells for a set of 12 RDLs, which

974
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:42,360
you're holding to 90s in each hand. Yeah. So I would never have thought that I could do that.

975
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:50,280
And again, credit to my time in powerlifting to help me identify what I was really capable of.

976
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:55,560
Yeah. So what impresses me is not your hamstring strength to do that, but your grip strength to do

977
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:02,760
that. Most men cannot hold two 90 pound dumbbells. Really? Absolutely.

978
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,400
Look, I gotta be honest, I get a little bit of help. So again, there's benefits to...

979
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,400
Oh, are you using a grip? Are you using a wrap?

980
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,720
Grips. Absolutely. So, and again, I, people will say, oh, that's cheating. Like I don't

981
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:19,560
want to use something that cheats, like use your raw grip strength. If the point of the exercise...

982
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,920
Yeah, the point of exercise is to hit your hamstrings.

983
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,800
To hit your hamstrings, what's going to be the limiting factor? So,

984
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:33,160
grips are like a no brainer for me. Now, when you do single leg, do you do

985
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:39,160
contralateral weight or ipsilateral weight? In other words, if your left leg is on the ground,

986
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,440
are you going to hold the weight left hand or right hand?

987
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:48,040
So again, for a beginner, I would do opposing because you're going to have greater stability.

988
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:53,000
As you become more advanced, then same leg, same arm. Absolutely. I think it just challenges you

989
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,840
with different ways. It calls upon different muscle groups to help with stabilizing. So

990
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,200
for the client that we were discussing before, that's, you know, kind of has some experience

991
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,920
once the game muscle. I'd probably over the course of that six week mesocycle, sorry, over

992
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:12,440
the course of maybe their second or third training mesocycles, I might incorporate, you know, the more

993
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:18,760
advanced variation of a single leg RDL. It might start, you know, opposing to leg and then as they

994
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:25,160
advance, I would move it to a single leg over, you know, that 18 week, 24 week period. Yeah.

995
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,200
Okay. So, and then calves, what are you doing for calves?

996
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:34,600
A combination of both. I originally wasn't doing any calf work because from an aesthetic perspective,

997
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:41,960
it's not something that you see a whole lot of, I guess, but probably, you know, six sets per week.

998
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,840
I'd probably start again for someone that's brand new, like three sets. And then maybe in the week

999
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:54,120
two. Of what? Standing toe presses? Seated? Seated or standing? I believe based on the research,

1000
01:35:54,680 --> 01:36:01,880
seated tends to be a little bit better for hypertrophy outcomes. Don't ask me the mechanics,

1001
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:08,600
this is not my area of expertise, but a study that I did a post on very recently was looking at the

1002
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:15,320
different feet positions. And I used to be, first to put my hand up and throw myself under the bus,

1003
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:21,240
do the toes in, like pigeon toes, calf raise. Pointless doesn't really yield, you know,

1004
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:28,280
any meaningful results. Neutral stance and toes facing out tend to be better for optimizing

1005
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:34,120
hypertrophy of, you know, I guess different aspects of your calf. On their upper body day,

1006
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:37,480
how do you focus? Now I know you, I mean, I'm still surprised to hear that you're not doing

1007
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,520
a lot of upper body for a woman. And what you're saying is the most important thing is taking the

1008
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:49,720
fat off to let the muscles show. Yeah. But in that one day, what are they going to do for

1009
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:54,840
for chest, for back, for shoulders and arms? Yeah. So I think one of the main things again,

1010
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,120
that does differ between men and women's training programs is chest volume. So men typically want

1011
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:06,520
to have Jack biceps, Jack triceps, big chest. There's less of an emphasis on that. So the women

1012
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:15,000
in even in the fitness categories seem to be judged a lot on glutes, hams, shoulders, quads.

1013
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Back is so like, it's less important. They want to see a conditioned back, but it's not really

1014
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,160
where a lot of the judging and time is spent. Unlike, you know, traditional bodybuilders where

1015
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:31,000
like you look at your chi greens where it's just got lat on lat on lat. So I will incorporate,

1016
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:38,200
I guess, different back exercises, more predominantly in a program that I would for chest.

1017
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:44,680
I defer back to the client. Do you want to do chest training? I love bench press. Like again,

1018
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,600
I've done powerlifting. So to me, like that's so empowering, like trying to hit a one-rip max

1019
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:54,360
on a bench. I love that, but I'm not everybody. So again, I defer to the person that I'm working with.

1020
01:37:54,360 --> 01:38:00,520
And let's assume that she has no interest in her strength on a bench. It's really coming down to

1021
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:05,160
how she's going to look in the dress. Aesthetic. Some people really need, you know, a lot of chest

1022
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:10,680
training or conversely, they need a lot of back training due to their posture. So that's a big

1023
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,720
consideration. But if a woman is sort of hunched forward. Yeah. They're really kyphotic. They've got

1024
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:23,800
that rounding. They probably have extremely tight pectorals and weak back masslature. So in that case,

1025
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:29,960
I would do a lot more volume on back and I probably wouldn't spend any time on any chest work. So,

1026
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:35,160
you know, for that final one training session, I might be looking to hit, you know, 15 sets of back

1027
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:40,920
and no chest at all. And what types of exercises would you do? So I would target the wide back,

1028
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,960
mid back. So we're looking at our lats to get the lat, the width of the back. And that can help,

1029
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:53,160
I guess, from an aesthetic perspective to create the illusion of a really small waist. So our wide

1030
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,040
grip pull downs, wide grip pull ups, assisted pull ups for somebody that's just beginning and then

1031
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:03,320
progressing to bodyweight pull ups and then weighted pull ups. So again, through, you know,

1032
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:08,920
the course of somebody training consistently over, you know, nine months, say there's a very

1033
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,360
good chance they could go from doing no bodyweight pull ups to weighted pull ups. Now, most women

1034
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:21,720
can't do a single pull up unassisted, correct? I'd say that probably 90% of females would not

1035
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:28,520
be able to do a single bodyweight pull up. And how many can you do? I think my last AMRAP was like 20.

1036
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,640
20? Yeah. Okay. So you're at the point where you would use weight.

1037
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:38,760
Yeah, I had some weight, but not a whole lot. But, you know, Beth Lewis, who you met briefly

1038
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:45,560
the other day, you know, Beth is convinced that you can get any human being to do a bodyweight

1039
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:53,240
pull up. Absolutely. Absolutely. There'd have to be something, you know, like from a neurological

1040
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:58,280
standpoint that would inhibit someone from being able to. It was a lot of work. I was that

1041
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:03,160
person. I could never do a pull up. I remember like when I first like got into lifting, I started

1042
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:09,320
with bands, like the thickest green band possible with my feet in to help me. And I could do about

1043
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:18,520
five reps with that. So yeah, the thing that really facilitated my strength in pull ups,

1044
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:25,560
I program those every single program for years, every program. And it was always the most

1045
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:29,800
intimidating exercise. I hated it, but I'd always put it first. So I'd always been nervous going to

1046
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:35,000
training. Um, if I knew I had an upper body day, cause I had to do like pull ups, but yeah, I went

1047
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,560
from not being able to do like any body weight to being able to do 20 body weight over the span of

1048
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:45,800
like five years. But I can tell you now, uh, there was probably maybe three or four programs

1049
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:53,000
over that entire timeframe that I did not program specifically put ups. And was the progression using

1050
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,640
less and less and less resistance on the bands, but always sort of targeting a certain rep number.

1051
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:02,040
Yeah. So I would pick, you know, somewhere in the hypertrophy rep range. So that's typically

1052
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:08,760
anywhere from eight to 12. Um, and yeah, once I could do, you know, 12, um, reps with a certain

1053
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:14,120
band, I would progress to the next like lighter resistance. And I just kept going. Once I got to

1054
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:19,080
12 body weight pull ups, I was like, Oh, okay. Now we added like the weight belt with a little,

1055
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:23,240
you know, two, two and a half pound kettlebell kettlebell or something. And, you know,

1056
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:27,560
progressed that way. How much are you varying your hand position for both yourself and then

1057
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:33,000
obviously for the client in this situation? So for me, I, again, and this was primarily because of the

1058
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,880
aesthetic goal, which was to widen my lats. I would do a lot more, um, like prone grip. Um,

1059
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:45,880
I guess I kind of targeted my rhomboids a little bit more, um, which would be a close grip pull up.

1060
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,760
Um, but I, I don't know why I didn't, I didn't really do a whole lot of those. Sometimes I would,

1061
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:57,640
change up my variations. So if I had three sets programmed to failure, say, um, my first set to

1062
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:02,200
failure, I would do wide because that was the muscle group that I wanted to work the most.

1063
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:06,680
Then I would switch to a neutral grip and then I might switch to an underhand grip.

1064
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,520
And how much time do you need between sets to failure on pullups?

1065
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:15,160
A long time. You do not want to rush that. Um, sometimes it would take five minutes between

1066
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,320
sets. And I think that's where a lot of people find themselves, um, not being able to make

1067
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:25,000
progress and not just with pullups, but for training in general, they go way too fast. And

1068
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,960
then the consequences, they're not recovered when they start the next working set. Um, and because

1069
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,640
they're still fatigued, they're not able to execute the next working set with, um, to the same number

1070
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:40,360
of reps because they're not recovered. So they may have to drop those weights and pick up something

1071
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,640
lighter. Um, I used to do that. And as a trainer, I'd be on the floor, you know, you'd have 60

1072
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:51,240
minutes for the client and you want to rush. But the reality is if you can slow down your workouts

1073
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:58,360
and take as much time as you need. And my rule of thumb is when your heart rate is back below 100

1074
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,440
beats per minute. Uh, for me, it probably is a little bit lower for men. I think males tend to

1075
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:06,840
have slightly lower heart rate than females. Um, so once my heart rate is back under a hundred,

1076
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,640
that's when I know I'm like, okay, yeah, I can probably think about doing my next set.

1077
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:15,160
Okay. Interesting. I'm glad you mentioned that. I was going to ask about your rest phase. Um,

1078
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:21,480
okay. So anything you want to say about arms before we move on to the next metaphase?

1079
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:25,720
If you like arms, do arms. If you don't like arms, don't worry about it.

1080
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:29,320
Wow. This is, this is so paradoxical. I would guess looking at you that it's like,

1081
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,760
I haven't done a bicep curl or tricep extension in 12 months.

1082
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:40,760
So those arms that you have are simply the result of all of the stuff you carry.

1083
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,560
Yes.

1084
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:45,560
The heavy things you're lifting with your hands like deadlifts and RDLs,

1085
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,920
and coupled with obviously getting rid of, you know, fat.

1086
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,680
Absolutely. I think especially for something like pull-ups, you do actually get better at pull-ups,

1087
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:58,760
uh, the less body fat you have and the lighter you get. Um, there's a, you know,

1088
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:02,360
there's a point where it crosses if you lose too much muscle, but, um,

1089
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,520
again, this is a very interesting point, right? Which is you can, we can joke and say, look,

1090
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:10,520
biceps and triceps are not the most functional muscles in the world, but being able to do a

1091
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,560
pull-up, being able to do a deadlift, that confers great benefit to life skills.

1092
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,080
Oh, absolutely. Yes.

1093
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:22,520
And so, so in some ways your bodybuilding training much more mirrors functional training

1094
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,760
than what I would have expected.

1095
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:27,000
Yeah, absolutely. But I mean, I think

1096
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,320
Now let me just play devil's advocate for a moment. How much of that is your genetics?

1097
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,400
Do you just genetically think you have big muscles in your arms and that's why you can get away with

1098
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:35,960
this?

1099
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:41,240
Look, I think if I was to look at my parents, like my dad is freakishly muscular for somebody that

1100
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:49,720
doesn't do anything in the gym. He like grew up, I guess, being in very like laborist type jobs.

1101
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:57,720
So like he's always been extremely lean. Uh, and I think he has short, um, humorous like I do. So I

1102
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:02,280
guess it kind of creates this illusion of more muscle. It's easier to grow. It looks, you know,

1103
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,360
if you think about a long muscle, it's a lot more muscle you've got to grow to make it look big.

1104
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:13,320
So, um, I think just my, the way that I'm put together probably has assisted in some ways,

1105
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:16,840
but that's not to say that it's not possible for other people as well.

1106
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,160
Do you do some deltoid stuff?

1107
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,080
Lots of training for shoulders.

1108
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,400
So what are your, what are your sort of hits on deltoid?

1109
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:29,800
Um, my favorites are probably scrape the rack shoulder press. I don't know if you've ever done

1110
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:36,280
those, but essentially you're up against a squat rack, um, with a barbell on, you can do it kneeling

1111
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,960
or standing. I like kneeling because it eliminates, um, the ability to cheat when you're standing.

1112
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:46,680
You can use a bit of momentum to keep pushing. So kneeling, scrape the rack press, and you're

1113
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,480
basically driving that barbell into the rack.

1114
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,040
And what angle, what's the humoral angle at the top?

1115
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:56,280
Um, well, you're pretty basically extended pretty vertically.

1116
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:56,520
Wow.

1117
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,920
Yeah. So you have to have good range of motion and mobility for your shoulders. Um,

1118
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,600
one that I don't do with everybody, but I do, because I do have a lot of mobility with my

1119
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:10,440
shoulders behind the neck shoulder pressing on a Smith machine. No, I only do it in on the

1120
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:15,880
Smith machine because it keeps me in a very safe, uh, fixed plane. Like it's not allowed.

1121
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:21,240
I'm not using dumbbells where I'm swerving everywhere or a free barbell. So I really

1122
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,560
like that because it's, I had some shoulder injuries.

1123
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:28,440
What about for somebody who can't put, who can't really press overhead due to shoulder

1124
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,520
injuries or impingements and things like that?

1125
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:35,960
Yeah. So again, I would, my area of expertise isn't specifically on like rehabilitation,

1126
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,080
but I would be working with a specialist with that, but lateral raises is probably another thing

1127
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:47,800
that people can do, um, to improve their, um, like medial shoulder, uh, and also then re-adults.

1128
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:53,560
So you can do like a reverse pec fly where you're kind of pushing away. If you've got access to

1129
01:46:53,560 --> 01:47:01,320
cables, you can do a cable crossover, um, to hit your re-adults and, um, what else? Just face

1130
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,920
pulls, those types of exercises.

1131
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:09,960
Okay. So let's say we've progressed the intensity of all of this, uh, which means we've, we've

1132
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:15,960
overloaded. So we've added sets, we've added reps, we've added intensity. We're eight months in

1133
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:23,400
and let's assume we've hit our hypertrophy goals. Uh, you do another DEXA and remember

1134
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:29,480
the initial goal was gain five pounds of muscle, lose five pounds of fat. If she has met her

1135
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:35,080
hypertrophy goal and gained five pounds of muscle, how much fat do you think has changed at that

1136
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,560
point? Do you think she's up neutral?

1137
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:46,280
Absolutely. Uh, it depends on their dietary intake, to be honest. So, um, I think we can

1138
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:50,840
go through a, you know, a period of progressive overload with an intentional building phase,

1139
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:57,640
and do all the right things when it comes to the resistance training. But the other key piece to

1140
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:03,960
the success of that build is diet. So how much was the client able to adhere to their

1141
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:09,720
dietary requirements during that time? Um, you know, it's probably like 50% of the, the outcomes.

1142
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:17,080
So I think going back to the beginning, if, um, I'm going to just create a stereotype, which is

1143
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:24,600
she was sort of reasonable in total energy intake, but protein deficient relative to your goals. So

1144
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,880
what would be your protein goals for her? Yeah. So it's honestly exactly the same as it is, um,

1145
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:34,680
males to females. Um, the only difference is going to be the absolute total target that we

1146
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:40,280
have for a female, because our body lean body mass is a little bit lower. So the required, um,

1147
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:47,560
or the, the protein reference ranges to optimize, um, hypertrophy are anywhere from say 1.8 grams

1148
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:53,720
of protein per kilogram of lean body mass, uh, all the way up to three grams of protein per kilogram

1149
01:48:53,720 --> 01:49:01,160
of lean body mass. So, um, based on the individual's dietary preferences, um, and what foods they like,

1150
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:06,600
some people love protein. I've had clients that can't stand it. And it's a real struggle with them

1151
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:11,880
too, which blows my mind. Cause I would probably live on meat if I had to pick one food group that

1152
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:18,200
I'd have to survive on meat for the rest of time. But, um, I would pick something that is realistic

1153
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:22,680
for them within that range. So, you know, for some, you ate that whole 16 ounce steak yesterday by

1154
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,360
yourself. I was hoping you were gonna, something there's gonna be a little piece left over for me.

1155
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:33,160
I told you, I do enjoy protein. So, but yeah, I think it really comes down to, um,

1156
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:40,040
their preferences and there isn't one number that's better than another. Um, but consistency

1157
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:43,880
is important. So we don't want to be chopping and changing your protein and, you know, bouncing all

1158
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:50,200
over the place, um, for a couple of reasons. And that is that you can potentially, um, reduce or

1159
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:57,480
limit your potential. Um, but it also impacts your energy balance because protein, um, has a far

1160
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:03,160
higher thermogenic effect of food than, you know, carbohydrate and or fat. So if that's bouncing

1161
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:08,520
around, you're effectively moving and shifting your energy balance. So, you know, that, that would

1162
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:14,760
not be favorable for somebody that is trying to gain muscle and, you know, 90% of their protein

1163
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:20,120
their dietary calories are now coming from protein. Um, you know, it's actually might be

1164
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:24,200
shifting their energy balance in a negative direction. And if she was starting out, let's

1165
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:31,000
just, I'm making math up, but she's 140 pounds and she's okay being 140 pounds at the end,

1166
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:38,280
but that 10 pounds swap in body comp is important. Um, do you basically, and let's assume she's

1167
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:45,000
weight stable coming into this exercise. Do you, um, basically keep her calorie stable and just

1168
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,640
switch the macros around to increase protein? Yeah, initially, absolutely. I would have a

1169
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:54,440
look at what her current dietary intake would be. And, um, if it was below the recommended reference

1170
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:59,960
range, I'd pick a number that, you know, aligned with her lean body mass and her ability to nail

1171
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:05,640
that number consistently. Then progressively throughout that building phase, we would want

1172
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:12,920
to be, you know, slowly adding in calories. Um, if we look at the, um, overfeeding studies,

1173
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,040
which unfortunately there is not as much, um, information available to us as there are like

1174
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:23,240
weight loss studies, but of those that we do have, if we were to compare, um, somebody being in a,

1175
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:30,040
like a surplus of say 20% above their maintenance calories versus 40% versus 60%, um, what we tend

1176
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:36,360
to see is that the best results, and I should quantify what I mean by best, um, the most amount

1177
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:42,520
of muscle mass that would be gained during a given timeframe would be optimal at about that 20% mark.

1178
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,720
If we go up to 40 or up to 60, what we just end up seeing is excess 40 fat gain. It doesn't like

1179
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:52,280
continue to get better the more you eat. So do let's just, again, let's making this up. She's at

1180
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:59,400
2000 K cal coming in. Does that mean you're actually going to put her at a surplus, even though

1181
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:04,280
you don't want her to gain weight. You just want her to gain lean mass. Well, I think to begin with

1182
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:08,600
just for the initial week, I like to, if someone can tell me that they're eating a certain number

1183
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:12,360
of calories, I want to see the data. Let's assume that you did that. Let's assume you did a food

1184
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:17,000
log and she comes in at 2000 weight stable. Yep. So if that's her maintenance calories, um, that's

1185
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,160
not optimal. We want to go to a small, you take it to 2400. Yeah. Well, it might be a, yeah, it might

1186
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:26,120
be a 10 to 20% surplus. And again, part of that decision is also based on the individual's

1187
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:32,840
comfort with adding body fat. And for females, that is the hardest group of people that I work

1188
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:39,160
with to encourage to gain body fat. So usually I'm working within a far more restrictive

1189
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:43,080
calorie surplus. And I would, if I'm working with a male client, they're a lot more open to gaining

1190
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:49,000
some body fat to facilitate their gains. So if I'm being real optimal would be 20%,

1191
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,520
most women will not adhere to that. So I'm probably going to prescribe something that's

1192
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:59,320
more likely going to reflect the reality. And that is like a 10% increase above their maintenance.

1193
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:07,000
And how would this change if she said she's 140 pounds, she wants to weigh 130 next year. So she

1194
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:14,760
wants to lose 10 pounds, but wants it to all be fat loss. So this will also improve body composition

1195
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,520
because she's going to just lose 10 pounds of fat, but wants to lose no muscle, which still

1196
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:24,840
functionally means putting on some muscle to offset the fat loss. Would you then not put her

1197
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,560
in a calorie surplus during the building phase? No, I still would because her ability to acquire

1198
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:38,440
that new tissue is going to be. It's energetically demanding. Yeah. You need surplus energy to come

1199
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:42,840
from somewhere. Now, if somebody is starting with a higher body fat percentage, now we've got somebody

1200
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:49,240
that has, you know, they have an energy reserve and we can petition that stored body fat. And

1201
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,960
that's the whole concept behind, you know, body re-composition. So for some individuals, if they

1202
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:59,160
do have body fat, I may not need to put them in a major surplus. So it's so client dependent, you

1203
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:04,120
know, I have to look at them and the complete pictures. So, um, it might not be a massive

1204
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:09,320
surplus at all. If they were, you know, 20% body fat, it might just be, let's nail these calories

1205
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:13,800
for the next six months. And over time, we will see some positive changes because you've got

1206
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:19,800
enough body fat available to help with the building and the foundations of that new skeletal tissue.

1207
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:25,800
Okay. So now it's eight months in. Yep. We're two thirds of the way to our goal.

1208
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:30,760
She's on target for lean mass. She's also, of course, added a little bit of fat mass.

1209
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:39,080
You now have four months to get that fat off and keep the lean tissue on. What changes in nutrition

1210
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:44,440
and then what changes in the gym? Yeah. So changes in the gym initially are negligible. I think

1211
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:50,200
there's a misconception that suddenly everything changes when you start dieting. The goal for

1212
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:57,640
dieting is truly to be able to keep you on as higher calories as possible with as little

1213
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:05,000
increase in activity as possible, whilst still achieving a targeted rate of weekly weight loss.

1214
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:10,440
So to begin with, their training may say exactly the same. It might make, we might make a couple

1215
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:14,840
of tweaks because they're bored and they need to change up. But the concept, the principles of that

1216
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,000
training program and the structure does not change unless suddenly they decided that they

1217
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,800
no longer want those giant glutes and we put back in, you know, chest training. But, you know,

1218
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:29,800
the principles say the same. From a diet perspective, that is again, we kind of look at,

1219
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:34,840
okay, now that we've acquired a little bit of body fat, we want to get all of that off, you know,

1220
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:41,640
in time for this, the wedding or whatever the event is, I basically do a back calculation.

1221
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:50,440
So, and I pick a targeted weekly rate of weight loss that does not exceed more than 1.5% of their

1222
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:57,720
body weight. So. Per what unit? Week? Per week. Yeah. If we, again, if you look at the. That still

1223
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,800
sounds like a lot. It is, it is. It can be a lot. And some people may not have the. That could be

1224
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:06,760
two pounds a week. Yeah. Again, but it would be relative to the individual. So, you know,

1225
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:12,920
200 pound male, that's a lot. But even this 140 pound woman. Yeah. 1.4 pounds. That's 1%. So,

1226
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:18,760
we're looking at close to two pounds. So, again, we've got to be realistic with how much can be

1227
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:25,160
achieved in a seven day period for that person. So, choosing that percentage rate of loss is

1228
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:31,640
important. Why it's important is because we, when we see extreme dietary interventions carried out,

1229
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:39,320
continuous diet interventions that push weight loss beyond those numbers, we are increasing

1230
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:45,240
the risk of metabolic adaptation. So now we're starting to look at, you know, more, I guess,

1231
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:52,760
adaptive mechanisms, a greater response to dieting or our self-defense system really, you know,

1232
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:59,320
ramps up. We become far more efficient. So, we want to keep the rate at that, that level.

1233
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:06,280
And that will help to keep your BMR, your basal metabolic rate nice and high. And it's protective

1234
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:11,320
of your muscle mass beyond that one and a half percent. That's when we really start to see people

1235
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:17,640
actually losing a greater percent of muscle mass and lean tissues as opposed to fat loss. So,

1236
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,880
you know, I think a lot of people will argue with me in the first few weeks when we,

1237
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:25,320
you know, put together a program for them. They're like, that just doesn't seem like enough weight

1238
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:30,840
loss. I'm used to seeing, you know, two kilos a week. And I'd say to you, so if you're worried

1239
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:34,920
about the number on the scale, if that's all you're worried about, what have I said to you

1240
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:40,280
that that two kilos, you lost not a single bit of fat, it was mostly lean tissue. Is that still okay?

1241
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:44,840
And they're like, Oh, okay. So, you know, we've got to be realistic with what you can do in a week

1242
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:51,800
and how it might impact muscle loss. And then determining what calorie deficit that actually

1243
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:57,160
requires. So, we have a really wonderful, I guess, calculation in one of our books,

1244
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:00,360
The Complete Contes Brett Guide. And I believe it's also in Fat Loss Forever.

1245
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:11,000
And that outlines what amount of calories is required to lose a certain amount of body weight

1246
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,560
in grams. So it's a really neat little equation. And we can calculate very accurately for the

1247
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:21,560
average person that doesn't have crazy, you know, a really fast metabolism or really slow

1248
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:26,520
metabolism, what the deficit is that they need to lose that one and a half percent or whatever

1249
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:32,440
number it might be. So, it's really neat. I can pretty much forecast exactly what someone

1250
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,000
has. How does a person do this practically? So there's, on the one hand, there's the calculation,

1251
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,880
which let's just say it comes out and says, okay, we're going to reduce your intake from what was

1252
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:49,560
2400 now down to, you know, 1875 calories. But then there's the application of that, right?

1253
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:54,840
Which is, you know, if this person doesn't have a chef that can prepare every meal that they're

1254
01:58:54,840 --> 01:59:01,640
going to eat with a scale, how do they go about doing that? I mean, this can be really difficult

1255
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,840
stuff to go weighing everything. And I don't see how you could reach that level of precision

1256
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:12,120
without a scale, right? Yeah. So it is really tough. And I think one of the things that I will

1257
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:20,280
say to people that I've worked with is there is so much value in giving or I guess dedicating a

1258
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:28,360
set amount of time to weigh your food, to get familiar, to calibrate and learn, you know, what

1259
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:34,680
what a four ounce piece of chicken looks like, what, you know, ex food weighs on the scale. I

1260
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:38,680
think having that knowledge and an understanding of what it represents from a caloric perspective

1261
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:47,000
and from its macronutrient, like the constituents of that food, knowledge is power. And I really

1262
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,280
struggle with people that like don't want to invest that time because that is a lifelong skill that

1263
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:57,240
once you know how to do it, and it might take you six months to get the hang of it. But like for me

1264
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:03,240
now, I can, and I've been doing this for over 12 years, is I can estimate anything and eyeball it.

1265
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:11,960
So you get really good. So there is a lot of, I guess, accountability coaching, homework tasks,

1266
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:18,840
I think getting them like practical tools and resources to learn how to do that,

1267
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:23,800
which is kind of what's involved in that whole, you know, weekly check-in and that coaching process.

1268
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:30,680
So as she gets closer and closer to, you know, this, this event, again, let's just use it as

1269
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:37,240
this wedding example. So she's four weeks out and, you know, do you have a sense of where she

1270
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:42,840
would need to be a month out on those goals to hit the target? Yeah, absolutely. I think when we get

1271
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:51,240
to probably within three to 5% of their, their goal body fat percentage, like that's when I can

1272
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:58,840
start to tell. So there's a lot of, I guess, photo exchange. So we have so much data that we collect

1273
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,840
for a client and that can be super helpful to make, you know, accurate analysis, but there's

1274
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:09,720
so many benefits to also having that supplemented with, you know, an actual physical picture.

1275
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:13,800
And if we're not always looking at somebody's DEXA scan, you know, every six weeks as they're

1276
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:17,880
going, which is not always feasible for every client, depends on the clientele that you're

1277
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:23,240
working with, but we don't always have that data available. So it really does come down to looking

1278
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:28,680
at their, you know, macro tracking, watching their weight trends, and then coupling that with

1279
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:34,920
their pictures to be able to see, you know, body fat loss is actually happening. And the situation

1280
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:40,440
I described 130 or 140 pound woman who's going to be the same weight a year later, but have a

1281
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:46,600
five pound switch. How visibly different is that? Probably not as much as you would think. Okay. So

1282
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:52,680
maybe that goal wasn't ambitious enough. No, but if that was, and again, you have to look at what

1283
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:58,520
is required for somebody to, you know, develop the muscularity of like a, an elite fitness

1284
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:05,640
professional. That's like a 10 year process for some people. So I think again, that, that five

1285
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:11,720
pounds is realistic for somebody to add, but how notable is that going to be? You know, it depends

1286
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:15,880
on what they're starting with too. It really does. It really does. And I think how lean they get at

1287
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:21,320
the end too. And sometimes the first attempt at fat loss, it doesn't get you to the goal and it

1288
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:27,720
takes multiple attempts of coming out of this diet process through recovery diets and then fat

1289
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:34,280
loss again, and then another recovery diet before we really start to kind of achieve the ideal that

1290
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:40,520
that client is wanting. So let's talk about that. So she hits her goal, which is five and five,

1291
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:47,000
and she's pleased in that she hit her goal. She looks better in her wedding dress than she would

1292
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,880
of a year sooner. But to your point, she's like, I have greater ambitions here. I would like to be

1293
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:59,720
even leaner a year from now. And I like this process, but I don't feel like being as restrictive

1294
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:08,840
right now. So I'm about to go on my honeymoon to Italy. Sounds amazing. How do I recover from this

1295
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:13,960
without doing, without undoing all the good I did in the last year? Yeah. And I think, you know,

1296
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:19,160
again, looking at the research that we have and, you know, some of these longitudinal studies

1297
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:29,320
that show us what happens with fat loss and, you know, the success, the success rates of fat loss,

1298
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,440
you know, over a dietary intervention, people don't necessarily have a difficult time losing

1299
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:42,440
the weight. It is this inability to keep it off. And a lot of that is actually, I guess,

1300
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:49,880
the reasons that it occurs is because typically outside, you know, good governance of a good coach,

1301
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:55,240
people do things in such extremes. So they've done everything wrong during their diet phase.

1302
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:00,440
And the consequences, they've lost a lot of muscle mass during that fat loss that negatively impacts

1303
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:05,800
their basal metabolic rates. And now their metabolism is, you know, their body's requirements

1304
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:11,800
are a lot less. They're coming up against hormonal changes that impact their appetite

1305
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:17,240
regulating hormones. So most people, you know, post diet experience some talk, some form of

1306
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:22,760
hypophagia, which for people that don't know what that is, it's just like that excessive extreme

1307
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:30,280
desire to eat more than what is physiologically required by their bodies. So if they aren't

1308
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:35,240
conscious of that happening, and they're not aware that there are these hormonal changes,

1309
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:42,520
the natural inclination post diet is to go back to what you were doing before, especially if you

1310
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:47,000
haven't chosen a dietary approach that works for your food preferences. And this is where we see a

1311
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,040
lot of people struggling with, oh, I've tried this diet. It didn't work. Tried this one. It didn't

1312
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:59,960
work. And then they end up going back to what they like. So if you can slowly reintroduce your

1313
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:07,240
calories post diet, um, and unfortunately that means that that whole process still feels like

1314
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:11,640
the diet. And I can say like, as somebody that has, you know, just a few weeks ago, finished my

1315
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:17,560
competition, I didn't get as lean. So the hunger response was not as severe as it's been in the

1316
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:25,320
past, but it's still there. It is really hard to continue to regulate when the goal is now

1317
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:31,240
out of sight, or at least the goal that you were getting close to is leaving because doing a reverse

1318
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:38,200
diet there, you're not getting that positive visual response. This is intrinsic and you can't

1319
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:44,200
see your metabolism improving. The only data or evidence that you have when you're reversing

1320
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:48,520
is seeing the small little increases in calories. Like, oh cool, I get to eat a hundred more calories

1321
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:54,280
this week. You know, so it takes a good number of weeks to be able to get your calories back up to

1322
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:59,560
a point where it's like, oh, it's me. It's made a meaningful difference to my life. You know, I can

1323
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:04,760
have, you know, a couple of glasses of wine now with, you know, my friends and I've been able to

1324
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:11,160
incorporate my dessert again. So it's a really difficult, um, process. And a lot of people-

1325
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:12,520
And how many weeks does that last?

1326
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:17,320
It depends. And again, for a lot of folks, you're trying to get them

1327
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:23,320
initially rule number one for setting a reverse diet after you've finished

1328
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:28,520
being in a deficit is just finding your new maintenance calories. Um, and you can assess

1329
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:34,280
that by looking at how much weight you have lost over, you know, the weeks, the final couple of

1330
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:39,560
weeks in your, um, fat loss phase. So we can go back and predict what they are for our time.

1331
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:43,720
So for this woman, technically, if her maintenance was 2000 coming in,

1332
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,680
it's probably going to be a lot lower.

1333
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:47,240
It's probably going to be, oh, I was going to say a little bit higher because even though

1334
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:50,120
her weight is the same, she has more muscle.

1335
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:53,880
She may have more muscle mass, but it depends how lean she wants to get because-

1336
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:57,880
Oh yeah, yeah. But this is saying, um, you're, you're saying if she wants to continue to get

1337
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:04,920
leaner, not, I'm saying if she's happy to stay at that 140 for another six months before she

1338
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:11,320
begins her next cycle, she might actually come in at 2100 to 2200 calories before you then say,

1339
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:14,760
okay, now the time is we're going to take off another five pounds of fat.

1340
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:20,200
So I completely understand what you're saying. However, the problem is even if she has added

1341
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:25,240
five pounds of muscle mass, which we know in theory, you know, muscle is very energetically

1342
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:30,440
demanding tissue. It requires more calories. So you would expect there to be a shift,

1343
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:36,040
a positive shift in their BMI. Yes. When she did that at the end of the build, yes.

1344
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:41,880
But that fat loss phase that someone did to get the weight back down, again, depending how long

1345
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:49,720
it took, how extreme we had to go, um, and how, uh, equipped they were to execute the deficit we

1346
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:54,840
needed. And what I mean by that is, did we need to do a whole lot more cardio to create the deficit?

1347
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:59,640
What was the intensity of that cardio like? She could have lost some of that muscle during

1348
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:06,760
the fat loss phase. And evidently you will lose muscle anyway. Like it's, you will always lose

1349
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:12,200
muscle mass when you attempt to fat loss phase. Um, but how the leaner you get the greater the

1350
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:17,720
risk of that muscle losses because you no longer have that caloric cushioning to, um, support that.

1351
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:23,720
So, um, her metabolism, even when we go back to her new maintenance calories, after she's added

1352
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:29,000
more muscles, so physically she's going to look better, she still may be lower at the start of

1353
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,720
that reverse diet, which is really interesting to think. So there may be some work that's needed

1354
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:38,200
to be done reversing just to get her back to maybe that 2000 calories that she was on.

1355
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:44,440
She may not be able to go straight back to that. It takes weeks. So the way that you do that is

1356
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:50,920
slow and incremental increases week by week. Um, and you observe the weight gain and then you

1357
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:58,120
adjust, respond accordingly. So I guess before we wrap, um, are there any other specific differences

1358
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:04,440
in sort of male and female training that we could shed light on? Yeah. So I think, you know,

1359
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:09,240
outside like the specificity of like putting together an actual program and targeting certain

1360
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:16,360
muscles, muscle groups, rather, um, people may have actually heard, um, somewhere along their

1361
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:23,080
fitness journey that women tend to do better with higher rep ranges and males do better with, uh,

1362
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:29,400
lower rep ranges. And traditionally I think there's, there's a reason why we tend to see that,

1363
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:34,520
that style of programming, um, you know, more prominent, you know, in the gym scene.

1364
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:40,760
And part of that is due to, I guess some of the differences in sex hormones. Um, and that kind

1365
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:47,800
of has an impact on our muscle fiber type. So females actually have a greater percentage of type

1366
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:55,880
one muscle fibers than do males. Um, and the positive consequence of that, um, difference

1367
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:02,040
there for females is that it means that we're better able to transport nutrients, uh, into the

1368
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:09,560
tissues and also clear, um, different metabolites, um, you know, during activities. So the benefit

1369
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:16,360
there is that women tend to be less fatigable, um, when it comes to training. And, uh, another

1370
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:21,720
thing that kind of coincides really nicely with that is that women, um, again, in both the fed

1371
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:28,680
and the fasted state tend to do better at utilizing, um, fatty acids. So again, it means that we're

1372
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:33,880
less reliant upon some of those glycolytic, um, you know, pathways or anaerobic processes. So,

1373
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:41,880
um, we do better, um, in, as when it comes to recovery from, um, different types of training.

1374
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:48,280
So when it comes to building out that training program, again, I'm being pretty meticulous here,

1375
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:55,720
but men, I would often opt for a little bit more strength specific training. Um, and I guess if you

1376
02:10:55,720 --> 02:11:00,120
look at the definitions of strength training, it's the rep ranges between one to six. Um,

1377
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:04,760
then you've got your moderate rep ranges, or we call that the hypertrophy rep range. Um,

1378
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:08,200
I'll have more of that with females and then the,

1379
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,480
Which is about eight to 12.

1380
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:13,960
Eight to 12, eight to 15. And then we've got our endurance strength training, which is,

1381
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:22,520
you know, your 15 to 20 reps. So some like women will, um, say that they, uh, enjoy that type of

1382
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:27,000
training and they're able to tolerate it better, um, more so than some of the strength based

1383
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,680
training. But I would, I would still argue that females, when you're, you know, put in the right

1384
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:35,480
hands with a good qualified coach, um, that they could equally enjoy that style of training too.

1385
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:40,680
But again, that's thinking about like the actual differences, you know, that muscle fiber type and

1386
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,680
part of that's due to, I believe it's estrogen. Um, you know, women having a higher level of

1387
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:49,480
estrogen, we've got more estrogen receptors, I believe on our escalatal tissues. And that's

1388
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:53,320
one of the benefits, um, for, you know, the nutrient transport. So.

1389
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:59,080
That's interesting. Wouldn't that also suggest that women would have an easier time

1390
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:09,160
training without ingestion of glucose, right? Um, at least in theory. And yet I feel like maybe

1391
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:15,400
it's just looking at my wife, she does not like to train on an empty stomach. She needs something to,

1392
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:20,200
you know, she needs to be drinking or eating something beforehand. Yeah. But I think you

1393
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:24,120
mentioned you like to train on an empty stomach. I'm the opposite. So again, I think it's really

1394
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:31,000
subjective. Um, we can, the science can always say certain things, but we've also then got to

1395
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:36,120
take into the, into account, I think the individual's, you know, perception and often it's, you know,

1396
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:41,240
it is very subjective. Sorry for me as somebody that has struggled with like irritable bowel

1397
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:47,000
syndrome for, you know, the last 10 years of life, I can't think of anything worse than trying to

1398
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,760
train with anything in my stomach. I might have a couple of coffees in the morning, um, but I'm

1399
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:55,880
keeping, you know, pretty low gut irritant type foods, because the minute I feel some kind of,

1400
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:01,720
you know, distension or, you know, pain in my stomach, I cannot train. I would rather train

1401
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:08,680
hungry with a rumbling stomach than try to have to execute with a full stomach. So, but again,

1402
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:13,880
endurance training, very different to, you know, more anaerobic training, like the resistance

1403
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:19,240
training that I do is probably more, um, you know, anaerobic. So it might be just due to the

1404
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:25,080
differences in, um, you know, exercise type. Any other differences that we should be aware of

1405
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:33,560
as far as female and male, uh, either through response to nutrient or load? Um, I think,

1406
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:38,200
again, speaking to sex hormones, I think the menstrual cycle is probably the only other thing

1407
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:43,480
that kind of springs to mind. And, um, there's been a lot more, um, information becoming available on,

1408
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:49,000
um, that topic as it relates to, um, hypertrophy outcomes and strength training. And again,

1409
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,520
there's probably four studies, um, that are, you know, high quality at the moment that I can think

1410
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:02,280
of that, um, again, tend to be kind of on the fence. Um, half of them show that, um, you know,

1411
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:09,560
during the second phase, the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle, um, when progesterone is high and

1412
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:17,560
uh, estrogen is low, that subjectively, uh, strength decreases for females during training.

1413
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:23,400
Um, and then during the earlier parts of training, when progesterone is low, um, you know, people

1414
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:27,880
report to feel a lot better with their training, their performance is better, the strength is

1415
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:36,040
improved. But again, it's like, it's a 50 50 for clients. So when it comes to female programming,

1416
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:42,600
I as a default, and if it's, it doesn't seem to impact them, that's great, but I will default to

1417
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:48,040
setting deloads, um, on or around their menstrual cycle. So you might go two weeks on two weeks,

1418
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:53,240
like you could upload two weeks, download two weeks. Yep. Wow. Yeah. It might be in the middle

1419
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:58,600
of a mesocycle, but again, it, it depends on how serious they are about their progression, but

1420
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:03,240
guessing that's something a lot of male trainers don't think about. No, probably not at all.

1421
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:09,800
Absolutely. And like just ability to be adherent and like your energy mood, sleep, you know, all of

1422
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:16,120
those things can be impacted around your cycle. Um, constipation is another prevalent symptom of,

1423
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:22,360
um, you know, mentioned men's ease. So, you know, that, that absolutely impacts people's energy

1424
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:28,040
levels and like motivation to train. So yeah. How many times have you found yourself training

1425
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:33,800
clients post pregnancy and in menopause? Do you, do you have a high number of clients in those two

1426
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:40,040
categories? Yeah, actually, uh, more recently, my clientele has shifted more to middle age. I'd say

1427
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:49,160
majority of my clients now are probably 35 to 65. Um, and yeah, I think that transition going from,

1428
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:55,160
you know, uh, high levels or higher levels of normal levels of testosterone for females to low

1429
02:15:55,160 --> 02:16:02,200
level, uh, during menopause and the changes in estrogen, it's really hard on females. Um, and

1430
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:10,440
a funny story. My mom did not even know, um, that there was like symptoms that came along with,

1431
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:14,760
um, you know, menopause. She was like, Oh, I just, I knew women couldn't, you know, have children

1432
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:19,240
anymore, but she's not, you know, super scientific in any ways. She didn't know she was going to have

1433
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:24,120
hot flashes. No, she had no idea about any of these symptoms. And you know, for her, she was

1434
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:29,240
so upset and like just frustrated that she didn't have any energy or she didn't want to go for walks

1435
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:34,760
anymore or go to a Pilates classes, whatever she was doing. And, um, yeah, I said to like,

1436
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:40,200
there's so much benefit to number one, like going and getting those levels tested. Um, I believe

1437
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:45,800
you're a big advocate of hormone replacement therapy. Yes. Yeah. Um, just the, just putting

1438
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:51,960
somebody back into those normal reference ranges in the benefit that that has not just on like

1439
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:57,320
seeing a number move on, you know, their biomarkers, but what that does for their, you know, quality of

1440
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:04,680
life and how much more motivated people might then be to be active, you know, as we age and stay,

1441
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:10,040
you know, involved in sport. It's, it's crazy. And so do you see this difference than in clients where

1442
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:15,960
you have menopausal women who are not on hormone replacement therapy versus those who are,

1443
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:20,200
and do you see a fundamental difference both in body composition and work and work tolerance?

1444
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:24,760
Absolutely. And I would say, unfortunately for the women that aren't proactive and aren't on

1445
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:29,960
some kind of hormone replacement therapy, we tend to see those women coming in with extremely low

1446
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:36,040
calorie intakes and extreme exercise output. So it's like they're burning the candle at both

1447
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:40,280
ends and they're feeling frustrated because they're like, I already eat nothing. You know,

1448
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:45,320
I'm training multiple times a day. I'm doing all this cardio and I just, I can't lose fat or, and

1449
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:49,160
I've only gotten fatter, you know, during this process, which is likely to happen because if

1450
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:54,520
you've been dealing with those negative symptoms for a long period of time, like naturally, if

1451
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:58,840
you're not motivated and you don't feel good, you're not going to train. So, you know, people's

1452
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:03,720
quality of exercise goes down. Now they're losing lean body mass and they're probably,

1453
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:09,400
as I've experienced, aging tends to lend more towards the finer things in life. And, you know,

1454
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:14,200
you're gravitating towards, you know, more indulgent type foods and a different lifestyle

1455
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,600
that keeps you less active, unless you're very proactive about it. So people gain a lot of weight

1456
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:25,160
during that timeframe. So yeah, we obviously defer out to the experts for the hormonal

1457
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:31,960
replacement therapy and then integrate with our, I guess, interventions, the reverse diet, to get

1458
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:36,760
their calories back up to something that feels manageable. Now they're enjoying, you know, all

1459
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:41,720
their favorite foods again, they have a social life again, and they just feel so much better

1460
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:47,720
with that extra energy. And then the hormones returning to normal. And then what about women

1461
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:54,040
after having kids? You know, it's a lot of women will say, it's just not the same,

1462
02:18:55,560 --> 02:19:01,640
speaking about their body, right? So, and body composition. So, is there anything that you've

1463
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:08,040
noticed in clients where you think we have to do something a little bit different? You know,

1464
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:12,760
there's the 40 year old woman who's never had kids, and then there's the 40 year old woman who's had

1465
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:20,520
three kids and both of them are still premenopausal. But do you notice anything different between them?

1466
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:25,560
Yeah, I think the first one that's pretty smart is just the available time that they have for their

1467
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:33,480
goals. That is such a huge like consideration for all of this. I can think very distinctly of a

1468
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:37,480
couple of clients that I have that did not, or they've either had children and they've now grown

1469
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:44,520
up and moved out. So they have, you know, all the time in the world to, you know, do what they want

1470
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:50,120
to do with their hobbies and their physique goals or health goals. But for people that have children,

1471
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:57,320
it is really hard. And again, I think it comes back to managing expectations. I am the coach that

1472
02:19:57,320 --> 02:20:03,080
will turn people away if they, you know, use the goal that I want to achieve Holly, you know, 50

1473
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:08,440
pounds, I've got to do it, but they've also got three kids. You know, they only have a very

1474
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:13,560
limited amount of time that they can apply to, you know, meal preparation. Maybe they have a limited

1475
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:19,000
income and they can't have a chef, you know, like we do that comes in and helps out during, you know,

1476
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,160
those really busy times. They don't have a nanny full time to come and support them. So

1477
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:28,360
there are major differences in what can be achieved realistically. And I think, you know,

1478
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:34,520
kind of looking at someone's lifestyle, it is so important. And I think women don't give themselves

1479
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:40,040
enough credit for the amount of time that they are taking in these other obligations.

1480
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:47,960
But from the standpoint of that woman who's say 40, mom of three, who's got 10 pounds,

1481
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:54,200
she simply cannot shed. Can you guess whether most of that is going to come from

1482
02:20:54,920 --> 02:21:01,240
dietary restriction versus increased activity versus what combination? Do you have a sense

1483
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:04,920
just hormonally which one is pestering her? Because, you know, one of the things in our

1484
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:11,160
practice that really we don't put emphasis on due to the sheer ignorance around it is,

1485
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:15,080
you know, body composition, right? I mean, we will say to that woman, look, we're interested in

1486
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:20,200
making you as metabolically healthy as possible. That won't necessarily come with the improvement

1487
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:26,680
in body composition you had. It won't necessarily take you to your pre-pregnancy weight. But as you

1488
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:31,560
said, a lot of people are coming to you and that's their primary thing, right? They're, yes, I'd like

1489
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:35,320
to be healthier, but, you know, quite frankly, I want to be able to fit into the clothes that I was

1490
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:41,800
wearing two years ago. Yeah, that's a tough one. I have said multiple times to women, you need to

1491
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:46,600
get a new wardrobe. Like as simple as that, like it's the easiest thing or easiest way to instantly

1492
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:51,160
feel better about yourself. Now you've got a pair of clothes that are more flattering for your now

1493
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:55,560
physique. It's going to improve your mental health first and foremost, but it's not constantly like

1494
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:59,880
you're not pulling and tugging on the clothing that like it makes you think about your body. And

1495
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:04,520
if you're already in an unhappy place, like that's a bad place to begin with. But is it realistic for

1496
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:12,520
somebody to get back to their pre-pregnancy body weight? Maybe, but for a lot of women, if you have

1497
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:18,680
partaken in some kind of exercise, you know, whether it's running or swimming or cycling,

1498
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:23,320
if there's anything that's applying some kind of like load and resistance, you've probably added a

1499
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:29,400
lot of muscle since you were pregnant, you know, however many years ago too. So to expect that

1500
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:34,760
you're going to see the same number on the scale, often that's not realistic because they've built

1501
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:39,960
so much muscle over the course of their life that they would never be that way to get, and they'd

1502
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:46,600
have to lose all this muscle and some to get back to that. So I really wish that I could give you a

1503
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,160
better answer here. Do I see any differences like even from a hormonal perspective? No, not really.

1504
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:57,560
I think that with proper nutrition intervention and that is like optimizing somebody's metabolism

1505
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:03,240
through the process of reverse dieting. So we want to sit right on the edge of like every week,

1506
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:08,600
we're trying to positively adapt and get their metabolism to move up. And that can be done

1507
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,320
without any changes in lean body mass. Like there is a true adaptation that takes place.

1508
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:20,360
So yeah, we're trying to optimize their dietary interventions and get them, you know, doing what

1509
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:27,000
we know to be adequate from a training standpoint. Like that is what will help that person get to

1510
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,800
this end goal. And it just means it's going to take a lot longer for a mum of three, just because

1511
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:38,280
they don't have the ability to do it. Where do you think this goes from here for you? Do you plan

1512
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:45,720
to continue bodybuilding? I don't know. I think that part of me feels really compelled to stay

1513
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:53,720
in the industry and keep showing up maybe on a yearly basis to be an advocate for the people

1514
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:59,560
that are still suffering in silence. I think that there's so many people that have difficulties,

1515
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:05,320
you know, sharing their struggles, you know, reaching out for help, gaining, getting support.

1516
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:11,080
And I've seen a massive shift in the type of work that I'm doing and the education that I'm sharing

1517
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:19,480
now, because it's a really hard life to live and it can be very unrewarding. It can feel like,

1518
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:27,160
what's the point if you can't keep, you know, making progress and or if you never really

1519
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:33,400
if you never really work on the psychological dysfunction that might be happening, like what's

1520
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:40,600
the why? So I feel a little bit conflicted coming back and staying because I don't have the same,

1521
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:50,360
I guess the same feeling towards competing anymore. I don't, I no longer desire the leanness.

1522
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:56,200
I really don't. I don't, I can do the process now. And I was really worried about my last

1523
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:00,760
competition because I thought now that I don't have this eating disorder, am I going to have

1524
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:06,120
what it takes to execute? Like, or was that previously just driven by a psychological

1525
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:10,600
condition? So that was, it was nerve wracking, but I was able to do it, but I'm no longer attached

1526
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:18,520
to the body. So I want to be somebody that can be an advocate to help people realize that if you do

1527
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:24,120
the work, you can do these together. They don't, they don't exist, you know, exclusive to each other.

1528
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:30,040
I think you can do a bodybuilding show and not have some kind of eating disorder, but also

1529
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:36,600
recognize that it's, it's an extreme sport. It's an extreme sport and it requires a lot of sacrifice.

1530
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:43,800
And personally right now I'm so passionate about mental health and the idea of potentially stepping

1531
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:48,600
back from everything that I do, the fitness industry and going back and doing a PhD in

1532
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:55,400
the area of neuropsychology or mental health and eating disorders that it may not be something

1533
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:59,800
that I have in my foreseeable future. I just don't know, but I want to, I want to help people.

1534
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:04,280
I know that there is so many women that would benefit from learning that, Hey, I struggled

1535
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:09,400
with all of these feelings and, you know, low self confidence and low self esteem.

1536
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:14,440
And that there's another way aside from calorie restriction and dietary restriction that can

1537
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:21,880
lead me to the same positive, you know, outcomes and value as a human. So how do you think about

1538
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:31,320
aging yourself? I mean, how do you think about being 50, being 60, not looking like you do today?

1539
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:37,000
Yeah. Given the, the journey you've been on and the struggle you've been through and how closely

1540
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:43,960
those have been intertwined. My approach is all about longevity. I think, um, if you had

1541
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:50,200
asked me that two years ago, I would still be, I'm still going to look amazing, but I think my

1542
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:58,120
perception or my ideals about what my life should be, um, in order to truly, you know, be happy. Um,

1543
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:02,280
it doesn't look like me slaving away in the gym anymore. It doesn't look like me being a lifelong

1544
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:07,160
competitor. That doesn't mean that I want to let myself go and, you know, not have any interest in

1545
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:13,480
exercise at all. But I think I would like to remain, and I hate using this word, like functionally fit.

1546
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:17,480
But I want my body to be able to move. Like I want to be able to, if someone says to me,

1547
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:23,800
Hey, let's go for a 5k run. Like I want to be able to do that. If I, you know, need to be fast

1548
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:28,600
and agile for something. So I think my training is probably going to gravitate a little bit more

1549
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:34,440
away from the gym, um, and incorporates just some more hobbies and things that keep me active and

1550
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:40,440
functioning well. Um, but I will always lift because I know the benefits, um, that resistance

1551
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:46,040
training can have on your body. But you're okay with the changes that are going to come,

1552
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:50,600
which is, you know, you're not going to be 12% body fat. Yeah, absolutely. And I think even in

1553
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:55,480
like six weeks, I will no longer even look like I do now. Like I'm very content with the idea that,

1554
02:27:55,480 --> 02:28:02,760
um, I can still be healthy at a much higher body fat percentage. Um, and as long as I have the

1555
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:07,880
muscle mass underneath that body fat, I know that that is protective in so many ways. You know,

1556
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:11,960
I'm thinking about, you know, reducing my risk of like bone degenerative conditions,

1557
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:16,440
like osteoporosis when I get old, like resistance training, anything that applies, you know,

1558
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:21,800
tension and stress on the bone, you know, those little bone creating cells, you know,

1559
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:26,920
they ramp up and now I've got greater bone density. Like I think about that. My dad struggles

1560
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:32,520
severely with osteoporosis and arthritis. Your dad. Yeah, very much so. He's, he needs a double

1561
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:38,280
shoulder reconstruction. He went to it, but yeah, I think that's, that's kind of the message we,

1562
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:42,680
we give to our patients, both men and women, but I think it's more important for women to hear

1563
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:48,600
because I think, um, sometimes women are a little bit more governed by the scale than by what's,

1564
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:53,800
what's underneath. And again, that's a stereotype, but I see it. But it's real. It's real. And what

1565
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:59,720
we say is I'm much more concerned with how much muscle mass we can put on you and how much we can

1566
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:05,480
increase the density of your bones as you age. And even if we never take an ounce of fat off you,

1567
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:12,520
which by the way would mean you'd potentially even gain weight a little bit as you age.

1568
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:17,720
But if that weight is predominantly lean tissue and we're maintaining the integrity of your

1569
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:23,160
skeletal structure, you're going to live a better life. You are. And I think the first thing that

1570
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:27,720
women have to do, and again, I don't want to stereotype, but ladies, this is just the reality

1571
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:35,880
of how we are wired, uh, in today's day and age, but letting go of some of that, um, identity,

1572
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:40,920
um, and this belief that we need to look a certain way. Um, there's one thing to being,

1573
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:46,280
you know, feeling comfortable and confident. Um, but let's focus on the important things of life.

1574
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:52,040
And I think, you know, to me, after having gone through all of this and recovered, um, or actively

1575
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:57,640
and always will be a recovering, uh, person with an eating disorder, but you know, there's so many

1576
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:03,560
other things now to me that are so much more important. And, you know, my long-term health

1577
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:07,560
is important. Um, I do want to make sure that I've got good bone health. I don't want to have,

1578
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:14,440
you know, bone diseases. I want to be able to live my life to the best. And, um, you know, I think

1579
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:19,320
mentally as well, I'm probably going to stay active because of all the benefits that we know

1580
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:28,920
for mental health, like anxiety, um, depression, depressive-like symptoms. Um, I want to optimize

1581
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:37,320
like my health and staying so fixated on the scale and body fat and cellulite. Ah, it's like the least

1582
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:41,720
of my concerns right now, which is a really weird thing for me to say as someone that like used to

1583
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:50,600
feel like unless I was stage-leaning around, I was not a worthy human. So yeah, I think there needs

1584
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:57,720
to be a big shift in what we're delivering to our, like, to our patients and to our clients, because

1585
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:04,040
if we look at social media, it's really easy to get, you know, engrossed in, you know, social

1586
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:11,240
medias, thin ideals and filters. And I think the best step that I ever took was just unfollow,

1587
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:17,800
like all the accounts that are only focused on the aesthetic. I just, nope, I don't look at them

1588
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:22,680
anymore. I don't, like I read about the things that I want to learn more about. If I want to feel

1589
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:27,000
happy, gosh, I've got like a hundred books that I've read that are all on, you know, how to change

1590
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,840
your mind, how to be happy, what is life's purpose, um, how to break habits. Like that's where I spend

1591
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:39,720
my time now. I'm looking to optimize myself as a human. And yeah, it means that there's less need

1592
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:46,440
for all that aesthetic stuff. Well, Holly, thank you so much for sharing both the insights and also

1593
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:52,040
obviously the really deeply personal stuff that actually I think will probably resonate with many

1594
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:56,280
people, both men and women. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me. It's been awesome.
