00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Michael, so awesome to be sitting with you here today. I have been looking forward to

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,560
this podcast for probably about three or four months. And I appreciate you making the trek

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,080
out here to do this in person.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,440
Absolutely. Likewise, Peter, I've been looking forward to this one. It should be fun.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,480
My wife, by the way, I just want you to know called me like an hour ago to give me a ton

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
of crap for the fact that we're not recording this outside in the hundred and seven degrees

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,120
here today. She's like, you guys talking about the comfort crisis in your air conditioned

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,200
studio here. What? So she's kind of called us out on the fact called me out on this fact.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
Well she's not wrong. Yeah. I did think about that. I would like it might be interesting

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
if we actually did this while rocking, but here we are. We'll rock afterwards. It'll

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,040
be fine. And she was like, I mean, she wants to rock with us later today, which we will.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,760
She was mostly like, really, you should at least be just sitting outside doing this in

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,360
the sweltering heat and, you know, all that stuff. And so maybe she's right. I mean, we're

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,120
definitely way too comfortable right now.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,680
There's going to be a weight penalty for our behavior with the rucks. If we were planning

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,200
40 now, it's now 50, 55. So that's how we'll compensate. We'll all check out in the end.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
So look, people have heard me kind of talk a little bit about your book on previous

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,680
podcasts. People have also heard me allude to this obsession of mine in rucking.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,960
Certainly anybody who knows me personally is it's they're they're they're either

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,320
converted or sick and tired of me and my daughter who just got back from her first

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,880
sleep away camp in Colorado and Wyoming. So she was first time in 13, gone away for two

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,120
weeks. And, you know, this was a hard camp. You know, we sent her to a place deliberately

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,640
because of how hard this place was. And it's basically a camp where you go to work. So

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,880
they're, you know, taking care of animals, you know, doing a bunch of hard stuff. And so

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,360
in prep for this, we said, look, Olivia, you really ought to just rock with me all the

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,800
time because it will make it easier for you to go. And she just didn't really want to.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,840
I mean, I think when you're a 13 year old kid, the idea of going for a heavy weighted

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,120
backpack walk with your dad at five o'clock in the sweltering Austin heat is not that

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,680
appealing. The whole time she's there, you know, they have no electronics. You get one

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,280
time to speak with them. You get a 10 minute call at the middle of the thing. So the first

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,920
thing she said on that middle of the thing, she goes, Dad, I'm like the fastest hiker here.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
All that rucking totally paid off.

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,800
I love this. Yeah, I could not love this anymore.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,760
This is so cool to hear because they were like 10 to 12000 feet. So they're at altitude.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,880
And, you know, I was having her out there with 25 to 30 pounds in her pack.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,520
Very cool. And we have a lot of hills here, as you'll see later today. So it was it was

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,600
good for her. I also love that you sent her to a camp where she's doing hard things outside.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,920
It's a theme that runs through my book, as you know, that is so valuable for kids today.

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,800
I mean, so I teach at UNLV and seeing a lot of the students that come in where they're at

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,280
psychologically and sort of how embedded they are in, I would say, digital worlds and in their own

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,120
head and how things that I think most people would consider maybe minor inconveniences in life can be

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,880
so easily blown up. I think that ties back to a lot of what I'm talking about in the book.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,120
And I think the antidote to that is sending kids out when they are younger, trying to introduce

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,040
hard things into their life. And there's obviously a lot of different ways to do that.

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,560
But it sounds like what you did is a is a really cool thing.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,160
I mean, it's certainly one way to do it. And we had friends that recommended this place when we

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,960
reached out to friends who had older kids to say, hey, where are places you can send kids?

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,040
I mean, our actual initial hope was to send her to kind of a missionary camp where you could really

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,320
sort of see something challenging in Africa and things like that. A lot of times they just, you

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,120
know, for kids this age, we're not necessarily looking for that. But let's take a step back and

52
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,840
kind of, you know, just help folks understand a little bit about you. Remind me where you grew up.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,320
I grew up in Northern Utah. So a little town called Bountiful just outside of Salt Lake City.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Okay. Were you a skier? What was your main?

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,080
I like to say that snowboarding got me into college because when I was in high school, I was not a

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,960
great student. I liked to go out. I liked the party. I was into girls. I was into cars. I was

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,720
into all that kind of thing. Didn't really care about schoolwork. Now, would never do homework,

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,840
did okay in school. But with Park City Mountain Resort, they would sell you a season pass for

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,160
$99 if you got on the honor roll. That is the only thing that incentivized me to do any good at

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,280
school. So thank you, Park City ski resort. That is what got you into college. Yeah.

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,320
So you mentioned your, did your parents split when you were young?

62
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,480
They did. So my, well, I wasn't even born yet. So my mother was pregnant, five months pregnant,

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,160
and my dad took off. So their backstory, which I think is relevant to understanding the context,

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,960
is that my dad was always a heavy drinker, heavy drug user. When my parents met, my mom was into

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,120
that lifestyle too. So eventually my dad realizes, you know, maybe I'm a little too into this world.

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,640
So he goes to rehab. Now as part of his rehab, sorry, this is after you've been after you're

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,360
born. This is before I'm born. Okay. Yeah. So they were married at the time. They'd been married a few

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,880
years. So as part of his rehab, they give my mother the book that he is supposed to read in

69
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,480
rehab. And they say you read this so you understand what he's going through. Is it 12 step? It was.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay. Yep. So she, she goes, okay. And one night as she explains it, she goes, so I'm sitting in

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,120
the tub one night and I'm drinking a gin and tonic. And I get to this line in this book and it says,

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,440
try to drink and stop, try it twice. And she goes, Oh yeah, I couldn't do that. So she realizes that

73
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,080
she has a problem too. And she manages to get sober. So that's, that's the joke is my dad went

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,000
to rehab and my mom got sober. And so they got back together. He stayed sober for a little while,

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,240
you know, a little bit, just enough for her to get pregnant. And once she got pregnant,

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,000
it was, you know, there's, you don't have a drinking buddy anymore. The funds over. And I

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,560
think he wasn't quite ready for that. So he took off and my mom raised me, always been raised by a

78
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,520
single parent. Do you have a relationship with your dad today? I do not. I haven't heard from him for,

79
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,760
oh man, since I was like eight or something like that. Yeah. So given, you know, you,

80
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,080
how much of this history of your parents drinking did you know as you got into high school and stuff?

81
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:48,200
I knew my mom didn't drink and I knew the reason why she didn't drink. Now she was very respectful

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,080
of my dad. She wasn't going to give me any sort of details, but I was left to assume that the reason

83
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,520
that he was not in my life is because he didn't ever stop drinking. So that was sort of the context

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,080
around that. So when you get to high school and most kids are, even though not, you know,

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,880
sort of legally allowed to drink, but obviously that's when kids are most experimenting with

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,400
alcohol. Did your mom have any advice for you or did you have any thoughts about, you know, I,

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm born from two parents who both have probably suffered a little bit from this. I could certainly

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,760
have a genetic predisposition. Yeah. So when I was a kid, my plan was I'm never going to drink

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,880
because of that genetic predisposition. And I read books, it was kind of a nerdy kid. And then you

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,200
turn into a teenager and your brain starts changing and you look for excitement and risk and all of a

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,480
sudden the pull of social things becomes so much more rewarding than it ever was that I drank. And

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,040
when that happened, my response was why the hell would you not do this? Right. That was the answer

93
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,920
because the town that I grew up in, uh, I was, it was all one religion except all Mormon, presumably

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,240
all Mormon. Yes. And we were not Mormon, um, single parent. So a little bit of an outcast in that sense,

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,400
you know, it didn't have a dad around. And so I think you kind of, you're kind of trying to

96
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,320
figure it out. You know, you're, you're uncomfortable in these situations around people just,

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,400
just generally. And then you have a drink and all of a sudden that goes away. So it becomes this sort

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,480
of learned thing where you associate this with, with good things. All of a sudden I could talk

99
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,280
to anyone. I could talk to girls. I could say funnier things. It was a lot more clever, right?

100
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,040
So you get all this positive feedback and why would you not drink? Right? Now that eventually

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,960
worked for me until it stopped working. That's sort of the classic story. So today I'm, you know,

102
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm sober and there's a good reason for that. And I'm glad I am saved my life. Yeah. So talk to me

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,920
about the, um, the, the kind of realization that this isn't working for me. Um, you know, they talk

104
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:52,360
about how change happens really slowly and then really quickly. Um, and, and so what was the slow

105
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,880
descent into the quick realization and how many, how many, not everybody just has a one realization

106
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,160
where they hit rock bottom and they switch. Sometimes you have to bounce a little bit on

107
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,920
the bottom. 100%. I would say that I would, uh, I'd always noticed that I probably drank a little

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,040
more than other people. At the same time, there were no real repercussions for that until I was

109
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,480
maybe 23 or 24. I was living in New York city. I was going to grad school. I was living alone

110
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:31,000
and I had no one watching me and I had bars that closed at 4 AM and that's a potent combination.

111
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,080
And I think that was when I started to realize, Oh, like maybe this isn't good. And I remember,

112
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,160
I remember exactly when I sort of realized it as I went, uh, went on the internet like you do

113
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,960
consulted Dr. Google and you know, signs you have a drinking problem and it's like these

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,360
10 questions or whatever it was. It's like, I'm going yes to that one. No to that one. Yes,

115
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,560
to that one. No, to that one. Yes. Yes. And I go, Oh, five or six out of 10, I should be fine.

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,240
It gets to the bottom. If you have answered yes to one or more of the, I just go, uh, oh.

117
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,560
So that's when it gets on your radar. And I think I told myself,

118
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,840
well, I'll just quit when it gets bad enough. Once I reach eight out of 10, then I'm stopping.

119
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes, exactly. So then you just start racking them up over the years. And for me, you know,

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,640
I had tried to stop drinking probably probably started trying to stop when I was about 25 in

121
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:35,160
different ways and it never worked. Just never worked. And why, why is that? I mean, I'm sure

122
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:43,960
you are not the first person to come to that realization of just willpower alone without

123
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,920
maybe a broader system or structure or awareness is tough. Why do you think that's the case?

124
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,520
I think there's a lot of things behind it. I think some of them are developmental. Most people tend

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,680
to get sub out half of people will end up getting sober around age 30. So I think certain things,

126
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,000
the same things that are happening in the brain that draw a teenager towards alcohol and make it

127
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,880
this great association, they start to kind of shake out over time, right? You take on responsibility,

128
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,040
you have all these other things in your life that all of a sudden make that you start to realize

129
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,680
maybe this isn't as good for me. I also think that eventually the balance just tips where

130
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,000
the short term relief just doesn't isn't as good as what this long term thing could be. And I think

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,600
that coming to that realization takes a long time. Like you said, a lot of bouncing. And for me,

132
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,520
it was just one morning I woke up, I was living in Pennsylvania. I was working at a magazine that

133
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,480
was based out of there. We had an office in New York, but her editorial office was in Pennsylvania.

134
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,080
And I woke up and my house is a mess. I'm a mess. I'd had mornings. How old? I was 28 years old.

135
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,400
And I'd had mornings like that before. And for whatever reason this morning, it was like,

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,440
you could kind of see where this path was going. And it was very clear to me that if I were to

137
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:16,440
continue this drinking, I was going to die early. Now, whether it was 35, 55, 75, I didn't know,

138
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,360
I just knew that it was going to be earlier. And tell me about your relationship with your

139
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,760
mom at this point. Does she understand how much you're drinking? Is she? No. So I always hit that

140
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,240
from her. We've always been very close. You know, we were always a team. Yeah. And so I kept that

141
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,400
away from her. She would travel when I was a kid and in high school. So I would even only drink

142
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,080
when she was out of town, she was gone about a third of the year. So even things like behaviors

143
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,520
like that, I just didn't want her to know. And sort of, and it's interesting when you kind of

144
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,000
contemplated getting sober, did it occur to you that your mom could be the most important ally in

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,440
that given that she knew what it was like as well? Well, I think that so the morning where things

146
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,400
became more clear to me, she was the first person I called, right? I had told people. So now you're

147
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,920
telling her two things, which is I'm getting sober, the implication of which is I'm an alcoholic.

148
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,880
Yeah. Which you didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That was a phone call. She didn't want

149
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:24,920
to take, but was happy to take. Right. And I could also see that. So I could see this one path would

150
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,000
lead in an early death probably. And more importantly, it was like, you're going to lose

151
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,200
everything in the process. You know, at the time I had a girlfriend who I really loved and I was

152
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,720
starting to realize like, Oh, this is a, this is a really good person for me. We're now married.

153
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,000
What did she think of your drinking? She aware of it fully or? Yeah. Yeah. She was like, you got,

154
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,440
like, you got to get a handle on this. She basically put it, you're a really good,

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,080
cool dude when you're sober, but you start drinking and you're obnoxious.

156
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,880
And I was, you know, and I knew it too. But once you get in that cycle, it's like, if you're, if

157
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,760
you drink like I did, it was, well, if one's good, two's better, three's even better. Four's even,

158
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,440
but just keep stacking them on, you know? And so once you start drinking, something happens in your

159
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,760
brain where all of a sudden just your entire thinking and universe. I mean, this is, you know,

160
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,080
I have such empathy for someone who's gone through this, but I can't actually relate to it because,

161
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,480
you know, we are all wired kind of differently, right? And I don't have that chemistry in my

162
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,360
brain. Alcohol doesn't do it for me, which is not to say I don't like to drink. I love certain types

163
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,760
of tequila and wine and there's even one beer I like. But I can never recall like feeling what

164
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,600
you're feeling, though intellectually I can understand what you're saying and I can only

165
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,040
imagine how difficult that is because it becomes a reinforcement loop and those can be very

166
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,280
difficult to break. Yeah. The problem is the solution is the problem is the solution. Yeah.

167
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:09,240
Right. So that becomes a challenge. And where was I? Well, basically the other path is that I could

168
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,280
see, you know, this is going to be hard. It's going to be very uncomfortable. I'm going to have

169
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,160
to relearn everything. I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to try this thing. And, you know,

170
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,360
I'd gone through stints where maybe I wouldn't drink for a few weeks, but I was like, I'm going

171
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,360
to take action and taking action was picking up the phone and calling my mom. And then did your

172
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,920
mom suggest the 12 step program? She suggested that I talk to people who were similar to us. Yeah.

173
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,000
So I started becoming active and just meeting other people who were sober, you know, and

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,320
having to a big part of it for me, which I think is one of the reasons why this book came about

175
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,160
is that I had to realize like, I don't have to be comfortable all the time, you know, because

176
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,240
alcohol is the ultimate comfort blanket for me. If I had stress from work, it became this really

177
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,880
learned behavior where if I just had a drink, then problems gone. But that ultimately was backfiring

178
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,040
on me over time, like in a very severe way. How many of your friendships were sort of predicated

179
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,920
around alcohol consumption? And therefore, once alcohol was gone, those friendships didn't make

180
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,520
a lot of sense. That's a great question. There's a few that they stuck around. I have some really

181
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,280
good friends who I remember I got sober, I got sober on December 15th. And I had planned to hang

182
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,760
out with a friend on New Year's Eve who was kind of my drinking buddy. And I had to call him and

183
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,800
be like, Hey, man, like, not drinking this weekend. He's like, Oh, I don't care. We can just go golf

184
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,920
or something. And it was just like, Oh, what a relief. Like, yeah, like that dude, I owe him a lot.

185
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,320
But then some, it's like, you just realize you don't have as much in common with them after the

186
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,880
it's not so much the drinking as it is, you only have this one thing in common. And so once that

187
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,840
thing goes away, it's like, Oh, well, cool. This was fun hanging out. We're probably not going to

188
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,880
call each other again. And that's okay. To me, that's like the subtle part of this that's really

189
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,240
complicated. And I may have told the story previously on a podcast, but I can't recall.

190
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,960
And when I was doing my residency in Baltimore, you know, at the time, it was certainly the heroin

191
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,800
capital of the United States. Now, I don't know if that's still the case. And, you know, opioids

192
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:23,320
have expanded far beyond heroin. But we definitely took care of, I mean, just it's almost like

193
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,640
everybody that walked in the ER with an abscess in their arm or something like that was addicted

194
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,440
to heroin. And, you know, the best advice I could ever offer, though it was not particularly helpful.

195
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,080
I mean, it was it was intellectually true. But like, I don't know how you act on it was,

196
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,000
listen, you're going to die from this. Like, it didn't kill you this time. You had a huge abscess

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,280
that I cut open and drained and pulled old needles out of. And you're really lucky to be alive. And

198
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,000
you're going to be on IV antibiotics for a few days and then oral antibiotics for a lot longer.

199
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,320
You only get a few more of these. And that's going to be the last one.

200
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,640
But I realize you can't just leave here and go back to the row home you're living in with all

201
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,480
the people that are doing that same thing and expect to stop. Yeah. So if you want to quit

202
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,960
heroin, you need a whole new group of people to be with. That's just such a devastating thing to

203
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,840
contemplate when your entire life is centered around this block of Baltimore where everybody

204
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:35,640
is using. And, you know, some doc is saying, look, this is going to kill you. But it's not just that

205
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,080
you need to stop this thing that is the ultimate comfort blanket. It's that you need a whole new

206
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,160
social, you need a whole new social group. You need to be around people that don't do this.

207
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,080
Yeah, exactly. And that I mean, that plays out.

208
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,680
Just devastating. Yeah. And it plays out in the research. You look at research on

209
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,160
alcoholics and I think there was a group that tracked alcoholics who, you know, at day one of

210
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,480
the recovery for a year and the people who still stuck around their normal friend group, only 15

211
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,640
percent of them were still sober after a year. I'm amazed it's that high. Truthfully, the group

212
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,320
that got a totally like stopped hanging out with those people, started hanging out with different

213
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,480
people. 60 percent of them were sober after a year. So it seems to me that your wife being sober

214
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,920
is a, I mean, I don't know. She doesn't know like she became sober in the sense that she was,

215
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,200
but the fact that your wife was not a big drinker. Yeah. Is probably the single biggest factor in your

216
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,520
life. I'm guessing. Super helpful. Yeah. Very helpful. I mean, I know it's definitely harder

217
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,600
for people who have a significant other who is continuing to drink heavily. A lot harder because

218
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,480
you're around that all the time. Probably the conditions that maybe led to some of your

219
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,560
drinking haven't changed at all. And, you know, it almost becomes an illogical decision not to drink

220
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,000
sometimes in the short term, you know, because for someone who has an addiction,

221
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,320
using the substance is a relatively rational decision in the short term. Totally. You know,

222
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,240
yeah, but it's just completely adaptive. Not only maladaptive in the long term. Yeah. So,

223
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,320
you know, how did you think about that issue, which was, okay, I have this adaptation that

224
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,960
serves me well in the short term, not serving me in the long term. But what's the adaptation for,

225
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,720
you know, how much of this is related to your abandonment as a child by your father. And did,

226
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,440
you know, because one could say that that's the potential root of this coupled with the

227
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,520
genetic predisposition, right? So you have these, which is kind of the way things work in life,

228
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,920
right? You have sort of an environmental and a, you know, genetic component to something. Did you

229
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,360
at the time think I should also probably figure out like how much of this is driven by that feeling

230
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,640
or that, that, that, that vacancy? I would say early on, you're just trying to figure it out

231
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,040
day to day. You're just trying to not drink. You're just trying to make the next right decision.

232
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,040
I think you start to unpeel that onion over time. And it's something that takes a long time,

233
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,840
you know, and everyone has their own onion, whatever it is that needs that unpeeling. And

234
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,760
just like with a real onion, sometimes you cry during it, but it's the right thing to do.

235
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,120
Yeah. So the magazine you're working at at that time, what do you, what's your, what's the,

236
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,200
what are the kinds of stuff you're writing about? So I was mainly in fitness and nutrition and

237
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,840
performance. I did some mental health stuff. So all kinds of different articles I was running,

238
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,640
basically all the fitness coverage for mental health is what magazine was. And I was,

239
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,040
which is how we met originally, wasn't it? I think it was. I feel like you interviewed me a couple of

240
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,520
years ago on, on something that was related like a men's health piece. I don't remember what it was

241
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,440
about. Yeah. I think Bill Gifford introduced us, right? Yeah. I think it was him. Cause he,

242
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,280
his background is with men's health, right? Yep. So Bill introduced us and yeah, I worked there for

243
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,600
six or seven years and that's where I was working at, at the time. So where did you get this idea

244
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,920
that we are in a crisis of comfort? Few things happen. So one is that working at that magazine,

245
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,040
I noticed that every single thing that I was writing about, cause I mainly am working on

246
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,760
lifestyle, health, performance, fitness, nutrition, that kind of stuff, mental health.

247
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,240
I noticed that anything that I'm writing about, you have to go through a short term discomfort

248
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,160
in order to improve. If you want to get fit, you're going to have to exercise

249
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,040
harder than you are now. If you're not, if you want to lose weight, you're probably going to be

250
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,800
hungry at some point. If you want to improve your mental health, just like I experienced,

251
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,960
you might have to ask yourself some hard questions about why do I feel this way? What's happening?

252
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,840
What's the underlying behavior and motivation? And that's not always comfortable. So I make that

253
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,400
observation. Then I get sober, which is the ultimate. Yeah. That was really, really hard.

254
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,160
What year was this? December of 2014. Yeah. 2014.

255
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,480
That was exceedingly hard, but after things sort of started to settle,

256
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,480
after you're done with the white knuckling, how long is the white knuckling? For me,

257
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,840
I would say there were times it was probably shorter than for some people. Cause I think

258
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,120
I was just done psychologically. Like it was sort of like, okay. But part of the white knuckling,

259
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm sure is also just the physiology, right? You're really giving up something that. Yeah.

260
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,680
So you're having to relearn all these behaviors, which is really tough and

261
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,880
figure out how to deal with things. Um, but soon, like literally everything in my life

262
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,720
got better. Everything you could measure got better. Your performance got better at work.

263
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,520
Performance got better. My writing got better. My finances got better.

264
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,960
I lost weight, all these things. Uh, but more importantly, I would say internally is where

265
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,680
the change really was. I mean, I was just like, wow, like things have changed. Let's keep this

266
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,640
energy going. And I got that from being willing to sort of step into the fire to enter the cave

267
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,640
that was the one that I feared. Right. So that sets the stage for this idea that,

268
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,480
okay, going through discomfort often leads to something really good. And in the long term,

269
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,240
it's a necessary buy-in for change. And I kind of start thinking about this idea of comfort and

270
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,000
make some observations like, well, wow, you know, life is pretty comfortable in a lot of different

271
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,920
ways now. And then what sort of really brought the idea that would ultimately become the book

272
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,120
together as I do this back country hunt with Donnie Vincent, who's this back country bow hunter

273
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,360
filmmaker, and I profiled him for men's health magazine. So we go on this elk hunt. He was up

274
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,320
there for maybe two weeks. We're in Nevada up in the mountains. And I was only with him for maybe

275
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,680
five days or something like that. But you know, it's a backpack hunt. So, and what led you to want

276
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,040
to do the profile on Donnie? I came across a YouTube video of his and it's called who we are.

277
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:08,760
And I think that I had always been interested in the outdoors somewhat. I'd always had, I'd kind

278
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,720
of been interested in hunting. And I think part of that goes back to maybe my father. So his

279
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,840
profession is a hunting and fishing guide. So I just kind of had this interest in it, you know,

280
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,920
it's like a thing that was on my radar because of that. But I had never really come across material

281
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,240
around hunting that really spoke to me. You know, when you turn on the Sportsman's channel,

282
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,000
it is, if you've ever watched the Sportsman's channel, it's the Sportsman's channel, right?

283
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,840
And Donnie talks about hunting. Totally different way. Totally different way.

284
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,920
It was, I mean, he, I like to describe him as being part locavore, part naturalist,

285
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:54,200
part environmentalist, part conservationist, part ultra athlete. And which is funny, because that's

286
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,600
the way I was introduced to it. So that's the only thing I can relate to, which is why I don't think

287
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,800
I know what's happening on the Sportsman's channel or whatever it's called. Like I, you know,

288
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,320
for better or worse, like I just, my only exposure to hunting, it sounds like came about through the

289
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,040
same way that Donnie, I've read, you know, what you've written about him. So, so I thought that

290
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,160
was interesting. And I thought that he was talking about it in an interesting way. And I thought that

291
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:26,680
there was a lot of things, you know, knowing what I knew in the health space, I thought there's a lot

292
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,160
of different things that are probably happening around this that are good. So I joined him on this

293
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,960
hunt and we backpack in up to like 11,000 feet. And I'm freezing cold. This is in Elkhun. So this

294
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,720
is September, October, September. And I'd come from Vegas where it was a hundred something and

295
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,280
we get up to these super high peaks and it's freezing cold at night. And I didn't pack well

296
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,240
enough. Let's just say that I'm sleeping in the dirt, starving the entire time because you're on

297
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,800
public land. We're on public land. We're only packing in so much food because you don't want

298
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,040
to carry that around. Getting water requires that we hike down to this stream, hoof it up.

299
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,440
Sitting in the afternoon sort of glassing is very boring. Yeah. Because most people don't understand

300
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,240
that you're, you really only can shoot the elk at dawn and dusk. Yeah. The rest of the day, you're

301
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,680
just doing recon. I had no idea. Had I known that I might've brought up crossword puzzle, but instead

302
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm just sitting there going, Hmm. You know, looking around and it's like, Oh, all of a sudden

303
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm bored again. Um, on and on. And during the five days, did he get an elk? He got one right

304
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,520
after I left. So I didn't get to see that, but also the, the underlying census, we got really close

305
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,720
to one. It was just a little too young for him. So we got within, oh, like 40 yards and this thing

306
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,160
didn't see us. And it was just like, I mean, I was just saucer ride. Oh my God, that thing is huge.

307
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,720
You know, they're, they're magnificent creature. It was unbelievable to see it that close and in

308
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:05,000
the wild. And what ended up happening is we, we got in really close and a coyote came in because

309
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,320
he's waiting for Don, like he understands, Oh, this guy's going to kill it. I'm going to have dinner

310
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,240
too. Um, so that elk spooks and takes off, but I get back home to Las Vegas and I feel great.

311
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,800
Like, man, I haven't felt this good since I was like, just got sober when you're riding that

312
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:30,120
pink cloud off into the sunset, man. You know, and it occurred to me, you kind of have this moment

313
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,200
where you're like, man, the world I'm in now is so different than the world I was in up there.

314
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,760
And it's different because this is comfortable in every way. And that has,

315
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,600
it was uncomfortable in almost every way. And yet that, yeah. Why did that feel better? Right?

316
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,040
That doesn't make sense. Right. And yet that world is the one that humans lived in

317
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,400
for pretty much all of time. 99.9996% of our genetic evolution. Yes. So you go,

318
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,240
whoa. Well, that's interesting. Now we've had this very, very rapid tip into comfort. So you start

319
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,960
to look at, start to look at all the things that most impact my daily life. I couldn't live in

320
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,320
Las Vegas. We're not for air conditioning. I drive to work as I stream entertainment from my XM radio.

321
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,720
Right. Uh, I don't have to be alone with my thoughts. I have this easy, you don't have to

322
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,360
hunt or gather any of your food. No, I don't have to work for any of my food. My food is also

323
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,600
exceedingly calorie dense. If I want it to be, I can eat it anytime. There's an abundance of it

324
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,240
on and on and on. And so I just wonder, okay, well, how are all these other comforts affecting us?

325
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,640
Right. Have we almost become too comfortable? And what happens if you sort of push back against this?

326
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,680
And I guess what are the key types of discomfort that we evolved to face and do those still help

327
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:08,680
us today? So there's the question. And that ultimately led to me going, well, that's a,

328
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,920
a lot of material. This doesn't sound like a magazine article. It sounds like a book.

329
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,440
So you write the book proposal and we shopped it out. And it's funny because this whole process,

330
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,880
uh, you know, you have a book agent and stuff and they're going, well, this is a really good idea.

331
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,800
And I think I'd like to read it, but I don't, I don't know what the hell it is. Like what,

332
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,520
what section does it go in? Right. Because when you read the way that I tell the book,

333
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:39,560
which we'll get into as I did this 33 day trip in the Alaskan Arctic, and that is the overarching

334
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,360
narrative of the book. And as I'm facing these important discomforts that humans used to face

335
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,480
in the past that can still be beneficial to us. Now that our world is comfortable, I spend chapters

336
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,400
on those. So I'm kind of weaving the stories in and out. And it was kind of a confusing thing

337
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,680
for them to wrap their heads around. They're going, is this in the adventure section? Is it

338
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,400
self-help? Is it like, what is it? But we took it out and luckily someone was like, well, I think

339
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,680
I can probably do something with it too. So I, I love the way it's written. Um, and as you know,

340
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:13,480
I gave it to my daughter and I love that. Yeah, nothing makes me happier. Yeah. So, um, of all the

341
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,400
we'll, and we're going to go into each of these in some depth, but I'll tell you the one that

342
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,640
nagged at me the most, because most of these discomforts I've thought a lot about, right. And

343
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,480
I've, um, but the one that I don't think I'd really given its due to was boredom. In some ways,

344
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,600
that's the most insidious comfort we've cured. Yes. Um, I love the way you talk about it,

345
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,720
right? Cause it basically we, you know, I think you say sort of like in the 1950s television,

346
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,480
no, no, no. So it's go back 1920s radio, right? So that's the first time you've got this

347
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,480
external source of input that you can kind of numb your boredom with, um, which is passive

348
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,320
rather than active. I think that's a part of it as well, right? So you could have read before then,

349
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,640
but reading is not really boring, you know, uh, reading is not necessarily the same type of a

350
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,400
remedy. Um, and then we talk about televisions in the 1950s and the 1960s, but I love what you

351
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,040
describe is what is it June 29th, 2007 is the death of boredom. Yes. The advent of the iPhone.

352
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,800
And I think that that shifts. So if you sort of back up and look at how much time people spend

353
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,600
engaged with digital media today, when I wrote the book, the average was 11 hours and six minutes.

354
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,280
It's now past 12 hours. Yeah. So, so I had my team look at this because I'm like, this can't be right.

355
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,520
Like I said, first of all, that must include working at the computer, right? Does it,

356
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,640
I think it might. And I've always, that's been a question in my mind as well. Yeah. But when you

357
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,040
look at cell phone usage, it's up to like three average hours television, television. I will say

358
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,640
this television is the most dominant at capturing our attention. And how much of that is the TV is

359
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,360
while I'm cooking, but I'm not watching it because when I go through these numbers,

360
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,920
there's one of two possibilities. One is I am so out of touch with how the world lives

361
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,600
or it's capturing things that aren't direct, right? Like, cause I've seen that I've looked at

362
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,280
these data where it's like 12 hours and yeah, TV's the biggest chunk and smartphone and computer and

363
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:35,000
and stuff like that. And I'm thinking like, if I could watch six hours of TV in a week,

364
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,800
that would be a big week of TV. And that's only during a week when there's a Formula One race.

365
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,400
Right. Right. Like it's not, it's, it wouldn't be on a regular or a non F1 week.

366
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,320
So how is the average person watching four hours of TV a day or whatever it is?

367
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,800
I think it's definitely possible because think about the data from Netflix

368
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,400
when they release a new series, something like a thousand upon thousands of people will binge

369
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:10,280
12 episodes in a weekend. I mean, that's so I guess you're right. I just, so Netflix,

370
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,000
they like, I binge watched Ozark. Yeah. Cause you know, and I was, I'm lucky I was able to do that

371
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
because it can't, you know how they, they missed a couple of years. Like that would have driven me

372
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,360
nuts. I liked that. I could just kind of watch it. You did it right. I did it right. But I don't

373
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,320
think I ever watched more than two episodes in a day. And there were lots of days I didn't watch

374
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,920
it. So when I say binged, I meaning I took like three months to watch it, but that felt like a lot

375
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,000
when Netflix released. So Netflix went all in, when they were trying to go to streaming,

376
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:52,280
they went all in, um, financing house of cards and sort of as a random thing, the decision that

377
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,360
gets made and who the hell made it. And they don't know why they go, you know, let's just put it all

378
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:03,880
up at once. Some crazy number of people binged the show, all of it, all of it. And they go,

379
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:11,640
Oh, what's this about? That's when binging, that's when binging show starts. So it's kind of this

380
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,960
random decision made by someone, probably just kind of a coin flip. Yeah. And I guess let's just

381
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:24,920
put it all up at once. The thing that I've been paying most attention to is the phone. And what

382
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:37,320
I've realized is like, if I compare myself to now versus pre Blackberry. So, um, I didn't get the

383
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,920
first gen iPhone in 2007, or I got it and then I returned it after a week because I thought it

384
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,440
sucked. But I only cared about email, right? So I was like kind of in the work mode of like email

385
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,720
and the email wasn't that good. And the phone wasn't that good. Like it wasn't actually a

386
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:59,480
good telephone. It dropped calls like the Blackberry was still the gold standard. But when I think about

387
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:07,240
what life was like before that, and I'm old enough to remember, there's a lot of time when you just

388
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,120
like you wouldn't, you wouldn't think to be sitting on the toilet looking at your phone,

389
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,600
right? Whereas now it's like, yeah, I'm pretty much always reading the news. Yeah, yeah, guilty

390
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,040
as well. And it's like, that is so weird. How if you think about something as silly as sitting on

391
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,200
the toilet, right? Like you're not there for that long. Do you really need to be doing anything else?

392
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,480
Right. So I started thinking about the idea of boredom from hunting, as we talked about that

393
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,920
it's a lot of sitting on a hill and looking for animals. So when we're when we are in the

394
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,800
people don't understand how sparse animals are. I think people have this view of like,

395
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,040
hunting is getting out of the back of a truck into a pen of animals and shooting them. Like,

396
00:36:52,040 --> 00:37:00,200
they can't fathom what it actually means to scour 20,000 acres for an animal. Yeah.

397
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,600
And I think people think it's action packed that you're always like, you're always on the move and

398
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:16,760
running. It's like, no, it is 99.9999% extreme boredom and 1.00001% pure panic. Yes, exactly.

399
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,120
That's a great way to describe it. So we would sit on the, these hills because we're timing our hunt

400
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,560
to the caribou migration. We're hunting caribou. So we're waiting for the, so you're now in the

401
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,200
Alaska. So we're in Alaska now. Yeah. And so we're waiting for these animals to come through.

402
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,800
Now this just wasn't happening. So five days in a row, not seeing anything going, well,

403
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,160
they should be coming through here. It's not happening. And I didn't bring a cell phone,

404
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,440
of course. I'm not bringing books, magazines, all that stuff. And it's like,

405
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,320
I love the stuff that you read. Oh, dude. So to entertain ourselves,

406
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,520
we read the labels on our food. So I can tell you a cliff bar has 250 calories, six grams of fat,

407
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,760
49 carbs, 10 grams of protein, right? Like these are the things you're getting into. And you know

408
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,960
what kind of carbs too. Yes. You're reading all the labels. I'm coming up with, you know,

409
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,360
who made your clothing, right? Wasn't it Hong? Yeah. Some guy named Hong. Yeah. Yeah. My

410
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:19,000
Kefaru bag, some guy named Hong. And I'm coming up with Christmas shopping lists

411
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,800
for like the next six years. Did you bring a journal? I brought one of the,

412
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,840
right in the rain notebooks that I bring on any journalistic assignment. Yeah. So that also led

413
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,680
to, okay, well, you know, each thing becomes boring eventually. Cliff bar reading becomes boring.

414
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,080
Learning about Hong becomes boring. So then I go, okay, well, I'll come up with some ideas for the

415
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,720
magazines I write for and come up with like 17 different ideas. And they're all like very good.

416
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,200
I start writing some of the book. So this leads me to sort of a point about boredom,

417
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,520
which is that boredom is an evolutionary discomfort that basically tells us whatever

418
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,200
you're doing with your time, the return on your time invested has worn thin. So if you and I

419
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,600
are, you know, it's a million years ago, you and I are hunting, we need food or else we're,

420
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,440
we're going to die. We're going to starve for hunting and no animals are coming through.

421
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,160
Boredom is going to kick on and it's going to tell us go do something else. And then we might go

422
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,160
pick potatoes or pick berries, whatever it might be. Right. So boredom tells us do something.

423
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,520
And in the past that something that used to be productive, it used to often move our lives

424
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,520
forward in a way. Well, now when we feel this evolutionary discomfort of boredom, we have

425
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,600
very easy, very effortless escapes from it, right? You just pull out your cell phone. We have like

426
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,720
the ultimate vehicle for stimulation and attention capture on our persons at all time. Right. So it

427
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:57,160
has really put a big dent in boredom and boredom does come with benefits. So there's these really

428
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,080
interesting studies around boredom and creativity and they're like totally hilarious too, is that

429
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,640
they'll take one group of people and they'll let them do, you know, whatever they want, put them

430
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,000
in a room and like people bought their cell phones or whatever. They'll take another group and they

431
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,160
will, they'll bore the hell out of these people and then they'll give them a creativity test.

432
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,600
And the board group always comes up with more, more creative answers than the non board group.

433
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,520
And I think it also gives your brain time to sort of process information in the background,

434
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,160
let things sort of happen. So when you think about the sort of cliche of you get your best

435
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,920
ideas in the shower, well, it's a cliche for a reason. It's because when we're focused outwardly

436
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,360
on the outside world, like in a screen, our phone, Netflix, even this conversation, your brain's

437
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,000
working hard to process that information. So it's kind of a work mode. When you have these moments

438
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,840
of boredom, you tend to go inside for a little while as you figure out what to do. You kind of

439
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,000
have some weird funky thoughts and that's kind of more like a rest mode for your brain. I call it

440
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,240
unfocused mode in the book. And that tends to sort of give your brain a little bit of time to rest.

441
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,800
And from that seems to come good things. And one of the researchers I talked to, he goes,

442
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,440
look, boredom is neither good nor bad. It really isn't. It's, it's how you, it's what you do with

443
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,400
it. And so what we do with it now, I think is increasingly becoming something that maybe isn't

444
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,200
moving our lives forward. So what I'm arguing in the book is I'm not saying, you know, burn your

445
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,440
cell phone and, you know, go back to a flip phone or any of that. But I am saying that I think we

446
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,360
need to think about putting more boredom back into our lives. Because a lot of times there's so much

447
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,680
talk around how we need to reduce our phone screen time, like reduce your phone screen time, reduce

448
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,720
your phone screen time. And I think that's a good thing. But what tends to happen to people

449
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,760
is they go, okay, I took an hour off my iPhone screen time. Well, now what do I do? So they

450
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,000
watch an hour on Netflix. Well, your brain doesn't know the difference. Right. So I think it's, it's

451
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,480
better to have time where you're just sort of unstimulated. So if something that I'll do in my

452
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,120
own life is just go for a walk every day, at least 20 minutes and just don't take your phone and just

453
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,200
kind of let your mind do what it needs to do. That also gets you out into nature, which has its own

454
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,360
benefits. I'm sure we'll get into and well, that's, that's, you know, we're going to talk about rucking

455
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,320
a lot. And so this will be the, you know, one of many, but some of something that I really, and I

456
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,760
always talk about this, one of my friends, when I'm getting them into it, it's like, Oh, and by the way,

457
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,680
you don't bring your phone, you're not listening to a podcast and you're not listening to music.

458
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,640
Like the whole key to this thing is going without the phone so that all you're hearing, you know,

459
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,080
we're lucky here, we get to do it and we're not hearing, like we're not on a road that's busy

460
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,880
with a bunch of cars going past it. So you're mostly just kind of listening to the wind.

461
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,760
But, you know, wherever you are, you're, you, you have to get into that zone of not being with the

462
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,920
phone, which for me was also like, I'm the king of efficiency. Yes. You know, I'm always listening

463
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,200
to an audio book or a podcast or I'm on a phone call. Like if I'm moving, those things are

464
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,200
happening. Yes. There is never a time when one of those three things is not happening. I was totally

465
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
the same way. And I started digging into this research and it really changed how I thought

466
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,840
about it. And I do think that I tend to get a lot better ideas. My mind goes to more interesting

467
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,880
places that it maybe needs to go when I am disconnected and don't bring that phone along.

468
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,400
That's ultimately going to sort of capture more attention. Going back to the hunting thing,

469
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:30,760
I find it takes two days for me on a hunt to find my senses. We were talking a little bit about this

470
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,200
before we started the podcast. You know, one of the reasons I like AccessDeer so much, not only is

471
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,760
it, you know, just from an environmental standpoint, it's, you know, you're doing something very

472
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,680
positive for the environment. The meat itself is incredibly healthy, tastes great. But the

473
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,240
challenge of hunting that animal is so high, right? It's just, you know, if you can shoot an AccessDeer

474
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:03,000
with a bow, you have earned that animal. And the reason for that is they have really good senses,

475
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,080
like their sense of hearing, their sense of smell. It's insane. And so if you try to go and hunt them

476
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:15,000
in a clumsy way where your senses aren't heightened, it's a joke. It's like they're

477
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,200
toying with you, right? Like they'll smell you a mile away. They'll see you a mile away. They'll

478
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,880
hear you a mile away. You're not going to get within their zip code. You can only get up on them

479
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:33,400
if you become as attuned to the wind, as attuned visually to what's going on, as attuned to every

480
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,480
sound you're making. And again, I'm sure a guy like Donnie can get in that zone in one second.

481
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,840
I need like a day or two. And again, I like you don't have your phone with you. You know,

482
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:55,720
you're not listening. You don't have earbuds in as you're making this move. And I remember each,

483
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,280
you know, on almost every hunt I've been on, I remember kind of what that transition feels like.

484
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,320
And getting there is hard. Like it is, it is boring as hell. It's totally boring. But you

485
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,880
have to kind of go through that for your senses to wake up, at least for me. Yeah. I mean, I think

486
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,880
two things. One that's short and one that's long. I think that that's kind of a metaphor for the

487
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,160
book as a whole is you have to go through that to get that benefit. And I think there's a lot of

488
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,120
different things that we've removed from our lives that going through can benefit us. The second thing

489
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:36,440
is that what you're saying, it totally jives with not only my experience, but there's this concept

490
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,960
called the three day effect. And it basically shows that after three days in nature, a lot of

491
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,320
good things tend to happen to people. So in the modern world, your brain tends to ride what are

492
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,480
called beta waves, frenetic sort of go, go, go associated with sort of stress, burnout,

493
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:00,040
this sort of thing. After your third day in nature, brain tends to start to ride what are

494
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,040
called alpha waves. And these are found in experienced meditators. They're like calm,

495
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:10,680
more focused, more aware. And you just feel like, I'm sure you felt it when you're out there. When

496
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,080
you first get into nature, you're kind of to your point, you're like, what's going on? You don't

497
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,960
really feel in tune. You're worried. Like, did I put the garage down? Is this my, you know,

498
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,200
my daughter have a ride to school, that sort of thing. Once you get to day three, it's like

499
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,320
focus centered, like you just feel like, like a Zen monk or something. Right. And I think there's

500
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:36,440
a good reason for that. There's a lot of things that are happening. And this is why, one reason

501
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:43,960
why some researchers are thinking of extended time in nature as a way to help help people with PTSC,

502
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,920
specifically veterans, because the benefits don't seem to wash off immediately. So this idea of the

503
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,520
three day effect, it's at the top of this concept that I write about in the book called the nature

504
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,800
pyramid. And it basically prescribes different amounts of time you should spend in different

505
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,760
types of nature. So this idea of three days and sort of more back country removed nature is at the

506
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,840
pinnacle of this. And it basically says we should try and hit that at least once a year.

507
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,600
You know, I never really thought of it that way, but that's, you know, as you know, if you go on

508
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,720
a hunting trip, that's another thing people don't understand. Like, if you're going out there to try

509
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,280
to, you know, kill an elk or a deer, like it's going to take you a week. And like my first elk hunt,

510
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,280
seven days later, I didn't have an elk. Yeah. Like that's not uncommon. Yeah, not uncommon at all. And

511
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,120
I would, I think most, I mean, the success, I don't know what the success rate is. It's maybe like

512
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,760
20%, I would say for the average. You know, it depends obviously, but in public land, it's really

513
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,560
got to be pretty low. Yeah. You know, you have to be like, you have to be an exceptional hunter to,

514
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,320
to get an elk on public land. Yeah. And I think another thing that people sometimes don't

515
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:58,120
realize about hunting is that you're not hanging out on a trail and going on the, you know,

516
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,840
the trotted ground. Like you are embedded in the wilderness. You are bushwhacking the entire time.

517
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,440
You're completely, you can be completely off the grid. Like you are in it. And I think that that's

518
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:16,520
what makes hunting compelling to me is that rather than becoming sort of a observer of nature,

519
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,920
you become a participant in it. And I wasn't sure how I would feel about that, to be honest. So

520
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,080
the first time I ever hunted big game was for this book. And I definitely had my reservations.

521
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,880
But Donnie told me, you know, I think you'd understand why we go out there and do this thing

522
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,600
if you were to actually hunt. And so I trusted them on that. And I can see the appeal.

523
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah, it's funny. My, my daughter again brought this up when she got back. I've taken my daughter

524
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:53,560
on one hunt with me when she was 10 or 11. And, you know, in retrospect, I'm really glad I did.

525
00:48:53,560 --> 00:49:00,760
And I don't know what I was thinking at the same time, because like, it's hard to see an animal die.

526
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,280
There's there's no way there's no getting around that. Like, I don't know, maybe if you've done it,

527
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,240
you get numb to that. But I don't think so. Even the most experienced hunters I know have a have a

528
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,360
real respect for life. And for you know, what I describe as the carbon cycle, like we're part of

529
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,280
it, too, right? Like we're, you know, we're going to die and our carbon is going to go back into

530
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:25,640
the earth and our nitrogen and it's going to fertilize something around us. So and of course,

531
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,040
the one axis to your she sees me shoot, it's a disaster because I forgot literally, I forgot

532
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,320
my front stabilizer. So, you know, we're booking it in at four in the morning, right? Because you've

533
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,400
got to be in position to try to see deer by like five thirty to get a shot by, you know, five forty

534
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,800
five or whatever. And I stupidly like just took the front stabilizer off my bow the night before,

535
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,960
something I would never do. And I forgot to put it back on. And we're an hour in and I realize I

536
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,240
don't have it and I don't have a choice. If we go back, we're done for that morning. So I'm like,

537
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,440
I'm going to be shooting this thing without a front stabilizer. I've never done that before.

538
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,320
It's doable, but I've never done it before. So to make a long story short, I get a 47

539
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:17,400
yard shot at this axis deer and I don't I don't hit my sweet spot, which is like you're on an

540
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,680
axis deer. It's not that big. It's only about that big. You've got to be able to get how much

541
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:28,120
the way the biggest ones in Hawaii are 200 to 220 pounds. This one was probably 150 pounds.

542
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:35,640
This one was not a monster. And instead, I hit him in the neck, but it hits his spinal cord because

543
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,880
he just dropped immediately. He was paralyzed. So now we've got to run up and stick a knife into

544
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,720
his heart to immediately kill him because, you know, on the one hand, you could say, well, he

545
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,400
doesn't feel anything, but you could argue psychologically this is pretty traumatic.

546
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,840
So it's not just like she sees a clean kill like she actually sees a very messy kill.

547
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,800
How did she handle that?

548
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,320
Amazingly well, she got a little nauseous when I because every time I shoot an animal,

549
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,880
I also want to take its insides apart. And so you're taking the meat off is one thing,

550
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,480
but I like to see the organs because I do think it really helps me to understand the anatomy well.

551
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,720
And I really like to see every detail of their anatomy over and over and over again. Plus,

552
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,040
we also eat the heart and some of the organs as well. So I think when I when we got into me taking

553
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,280
out the heart and doing all that stuff, she was like, I'm going to stand back here for a minute.

554
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,800
But otherwise, she did great. And then, of course, what did we do? Like we took that deer back to our

555
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,840
hotel because we were staying on another part of Maui and ate it and like shared it with everyone

556
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,120
who worked at the hotel. Cool. So we befriended the chef. And these are all people local to Hawaii

557
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,320
who know about what access do you do to their community, how they destroy their farms and stuff

558
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,960
like that. And many of them had never even eaten an access deer. And I was like, well, you're in for

559
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,120
a treat tonight. And so the chef prepared it for us and for the whole staff like fed like 50 people.

560
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:04,680
I love that. So it was it was it was really fantastic. And again, the point was the point

561
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,520
I was going with this. I had a point. Oh, I know. So my daughter is at this camp that she just

562
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,800
got back from. And she's talking all about she's like, well, you know, this counselor, that counselor.

563
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,040
And she's like, you know, one of the counselors there was a vegan. So for like a week, I went vegan

564
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,120
too. And I was like, Oh, what was that like? And she's like, Well, you know, it was all right. But

565
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,960
you know, probably not for me. And I was like, well, and I was like, so did the counselor tell you why

566
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,400
she was vegan? And because I've sort of explained to my daughter that there are generally three

567
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,040
reasons that people would associate with being vegan, right? There's sort of the like the animal

568
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,680
rights reason sort of like, and then there's a kind of the environmental reason vis-a-vis kind

569
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,440
of climate change. And then there's kind of like the perceived health reason. And I've talked to

570
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,440
my daughter in detail about each of these, right? And and I just wanted to kind of understand, I

571
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,440
said, So what was the rationale of the counselor who you were in? And she's like, you know, really,

572
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,760
for her, it was around the treatment of animals. And I was like, Yeah, I mean, I said, like, I

573
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,600
really respect that. And there's, there's almost a part of me that thinks you shouldn't be able to eat

574
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,160
meat unless you can kill it. That doesn't mean you have to kill everything you're eating. I'm not

575
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,560
suggesting that because that gets pretty complicated. But if you can't actually kill an animal

576
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,040
psychologically, maybe you should question whether you should be eating it. That would be at least a

577
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,080
discussion to have, right? And that's part of why I wanted my daughter to be able to see this so early

578
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,560
in her life, which was, look, anytime we're eating an animal, you have to understand like, that thing

579
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:35,480
was alive. What does that mean? Yeah. And so she, my daughter was sharing with this counselor,

580
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:42,520
like her experience, which is we eat elk and access to your like, most days. And she was like,

581
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,240
Yeah, the, you know, this counselor was super impressed. And I was like, that's a great sign,

582
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,680
like when when your vegan camp counselor is like, very impressed that you're eating wild game.

583
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,840
And, you know, Olivia was able to kind of explain the manner in which these things are killed, I

584
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:03,400
thought, you know, that's that's really cool to me. Yeah. And it gets back to your point, which is

585
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,440
it totally changes the dynamic of how you think about food. 100%. And it also makes you realize

586
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,360
how easy is it to be able to use a sophisticated weapon like this? And think about what our

587
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,120
ancestors had to do. Think about what we were doing just 1000 years ago. Yes. Like, I don't

588
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,120
know if you can see it, but right over there, we won't be able to show it on screen that you see

589
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,320
that bow on the wall. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So that a good friend of mine, Darren Aronofsky was doing

590
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:39,320
some filming for a documentary he was producing. And this is I think these are some hunters in

591
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,960
Papua New Guinea. And that's what they hunt with like that is there. So he actually brought me back

592
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:50,440
their act one of their actual bows and their actual arrows. And, you know, out to 10 or 20 yards,

593
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:57,960
they'll kill an animal with that. I was just in the Bolivian Amazon with the Chamane tribe. And

594
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,640
that's what they hunt with. They do a lot of fishing. They like okay, so how do you, you know,

595
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,320
kill to peer what a tapper I don't know how you pronounce it some sort of yeah,

596
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,000
they're just standing there and throwing like spears at them. Yeah. And they've got,

597
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,720
they've got bows like that. It's like, Oh my god. And here we are. So you realize like,

598
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,080
whatever I will ever do, or you will ever do or Donnie will ever do, it's still an enormous step

599
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,400
forward in technology to be able to use a bow an actual compound. Yes. Or something like that.

600
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,920
100%. And it, you know, it's fascinating because when I, when I kind of had my hesitations.

601
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,480
And was your hesitation around the act of taking a life?

602
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:42,280
I think that's ultimately what it was. Now my, I told myself is because we're journalists and

603
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,000
journalists don't get involved in the story. So you're just there to cover it. And I think that

604
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,360
was kind of a mental workaround for me to not have to, you know, I wasn't sure how I felt about it.

605
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,360
But I don't know. I mean, that seems like a reasonable point of view as well. Do you not

606
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,800
think that I could see that argument? I can see the argument. But I think ultimately it was just

607
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,800
a different experience. I don't think one's better than the other. I just think like you could have

608
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,600
been there watching Donnie do it. Yeah. And what was the other guy's name? William, right? Yeah.

609
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,280
Alternatively, by doing it now you're, you're writing about your experience.

610
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,400
I think that the, I'm glad I trusted Donnie. Let's just say that. I think that the,

611
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:29,800
the book ended up better. I think specifically the section where I talk about death is a lot

612
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:36,200
richer because of that. I mean, I feel like it is internally. The experience of actually hunting

613
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,520
the animal is, you know, I, I told him, even when I said, okay, to Donnie, I was like, I don't have

614
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,080
to do it. I don't have to pull the trigger. And he was, he kind of told me that too. He's like,

615
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,560
just plan on it, but you don't have to. And he wasn't pushing me either direction, but you know,

616
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:57,880
you buy a, buy a tag, which in Alaska, you can buy a caribou tag over the counter and go all the way

617
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,640
out there carrying the rifle around for a couple of weeks. And we finally get in a position where

618
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,960
we're on this hill and there's a herd on the other side of this valley on a hill and you know, Donnie

619
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,800
says, you know, if they keep eating their way down this hill, they're going to probably come over this

620
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,080
knoll. So if we can get on the other side of the knoll, we're going to be in a good position. So

621
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,520
when that happens, we just, we're on the move, right? We're kind of up and over the knoll.

622
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,480
We start cranking through the grass and the tundra, and eventually we kind of get into an army crawl,

623
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,760
you know, planning that these, this herd is going to come over the hill. And so we get in position

624
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,040
and you know, it was, it's like something out of planet earth where you're kind of watching this

625
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,360
hill. And then all of a sudden it's like the first thing you see are these antlers, these gigantic

626
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,720
antlers that first, and then it's like, there's one and two, and then eventually there are 30 and

627
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,080
they're all kind of coming. And we're looking at them because we're only wanting to shoot something

628
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:57,880
that's old. And we had, you know, from the spotting to help, we had thought, okay, there's probably

629
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,440
two older ones in there, but you know, you want to be sure. Cause we're super far away when we

630
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,040
made that call. How far were you when you guys made the first spot? It was pretty far. I mean,

631
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:17,880
maybe a mile. I mean, it's a big valley. And we eventually see in this herd that there's this

632
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,440
really old bull that's, that's limping. And so still at that moment, I'm going,

633
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,200
I got the rifle, I'm in position. I don't have to pull the trigger. But when we saw that limping

634
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:37,400
bull, it was like, okay, it felt right. And it was a tough process to get the shot off because

635
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,520
they're going in and out of the herd and you want a clean shot. And you know, Donnie at one point,

636
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,920
cause they were maybe within 150 yards of us was going to be the closest point. And I couldn't get

637
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,880
them in the scope and they kind of kept going. And Donnie kind of looked at me and goes, look,

638
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,400
if you don't have to take, if you don't want to take the shot, don't take the shot. But if you're

639
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,760
going to take the shot, you got to do it right. This is when you got to do it. You got to do it

640
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:05,080
soon. And right after that, it's like the herd sort of parted. It was right there. Just perfect

641
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:12,520
shot. Pulled the trigger, pulled it again. Herd ran bull fell. And my initial reaction was,

642
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:21,000
oh my God, like what have you done? There's, it was immediate regret, to be honest.

643
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,440
And sadness. We come up on the animal. That didn't help things. And

644
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,520
what was really interesting though, I had a lot of emotions around that.

645
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:42,520
And remind me what day of the hunt this was. This was probably a couple of weeks in. Yeah. So

646
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,960
we start breaking in town and all of a sudden that shifts the relationship there because you

647
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,200
kind of go, well, wait a minute. That's, that's me. You know, Donnie's like, yeah,

648
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,920
that's why we're doing this. That's why we're doing this. But you don't really understand that

649
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:08,360
until you experience it. And then it kind of occurs to me, dude, you eat meat all the time.

650
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,840
Dude, you eat meat all the time. And never, never questioned it. Never questioned it. You've

651
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:19,640
never felt one iota of emotion. And here you are now with this, like a mess. And not only that,

652
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:26,920
this animal that you just shot died more humanely and suffered less than anything you've ever eaten

653
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,400
to your, to date in your life. A hundred percent. It's not even a comparison. You lived a beautiful

654
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,760
traumatic life in nature, which is what it is. Let's not romanticize nature.

655
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:44,280
But wasn't in a corral, wasn't force fed antibiotics. And, you know, one of the things

656
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:51,000
that I really love about this project we're doing in Hawaii is, and we've only, I never appreciated

657
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,720
this until I met Jake Muse was the stress that an animal is in, in the final hours of its life

658
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:05,800
impacts the food quality. And even if you're eating the most she, she grass fed, organic

659
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:13,400
cow, make no mistake about it, the final hour or two of that animal's life is very stressful.

660
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,360
As it goes through the process.

661
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,480
As it goes through the process. Yeah.

662
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,400
I believe it.

663
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:23,480
And it's totally different when an animal gets, you know, a bullet through it and dies within,

664
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,040
you know, again, and we're trying to make sure it's an instant death for the, for that meat

665
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:34,120
process. There's, there's no cortisol surging through it. There's no lactic acid surging through

666
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,320
it. So yeah, what you did is actually about the most humane thing you could have offered that

667
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,560
animal relative to anything you've eaten, but also given to what its natural history is.

668
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,160
Like that's the other thing people have to understand. Like these old animals don't go

669
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:52,280
to old animal folks homes. No, they don't have graceful exits either. No, he's going to get,

670
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:57,160
he's going to get killed by wolves. He's going to drown crossing rivers because when they make this

671
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,000
migration, they have to do a bunch of river crossings. It's going to freeze to death. They

672
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,040
have a harder time. They have a harder time getting food as they age. So he's going to starve

673
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:13,960
to death. Or he's going to be killed by another caribou. Yeah. So it was really this, really just

674
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,760
a deep appreciation set in after that and sort of gratitude where you go, you're very thankful for

675
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,920
that meat, but also the fact that all meat, you know, I wish that our meat system, um, had some

676
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,440
changes to it, but you become grateful for all the other meat that we have. Cause you're like, wow,

677
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:37,320
like look at the buy-in that goes into this. You see that it is a life, you know? And so I think

678
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:45,720
it made me realize you kind of have this like very intense realization that for one life to go on,

679
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:51,080
another has to die to your point about the carbon cycle. And then the next step is, wait a minute,

680
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:59,880
I'm not left out of that. Am I right? Yep. And so this eventually gets me thinking about

681
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,040
about death in general and how, you know, I'm going to die. You're going to die. We're all going to

682
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,800
die. And if you think about that, like if you think about right now, we're just sitting here

683
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,840
having a moment very soon in their future, you're going to be having a moment. And then all of a

684
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:23,640
sudden there won't be a moment anymore. That is an uncomfortable thought. Right.

685
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,800
So I start thinking about that and this idea of, you know, death is the most uncomfortable thing

686
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:37,000
that we can, that we can think about. Really. When you do it right, you will ball up like a child.

687
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:44,840
But when I started practicing that, I found that it improved my life because it improved my behavior,

688
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,840
changed my behavior. When you realize you're going to die, all of a sudden you don't

689
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,560
pop off in traffic. Someone cut you off. You start to make decisions about work and what you're going

690
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:01,320
to do with your time that are better. It improves your interactions with other people, everyone from

691
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:13,720
my wife to the lady at the 7-Eleven. And the thing is that in the US, we don't think about death. We

692
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,200
sort of want to ignore it if you look at our structures. So we've talked about our food system.

693
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,440
Our food system is based around meat that you don't really know that it's come from an animal,

694
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,080
the way that it's processed. We even have euphemisms for different cuts of meat instead of

695
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:34,360
saying, you know, the muscles, the muscles that they are. And it's also in our funeral system.

696
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,560
Whereas after someone passes away, what do we do? We dress them up to look as alive and youthful as

697
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:47,480
possible. We have a viewing and then we're told to take our mind off it. It sounds like take your

698
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,440
mind off it. Don't worry about it. Don't think about it. And I just wondered what some of the

699
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:58,680
repercussions of that are. And it got me also thinking about, well, are there other ways that

700
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:07,080
places do this? And so this leads me to this trip to Bhutan that I take. So Bhutan is a very

701
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:12,840
fascinating place. I believe. And I mean, you know, you have a whole chapter on it, which is amazing.

702
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,240
And I want to hear all about it. Were there other candidate places you looked at besides Bhutan?

703
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:24,040
Bhutan came on the radar and it kind of became that. I think that's a place I should know.

704
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,800
No, it's an amazing discussion about the contrast. Yeah. So how do they die?

705
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,000
Well, I mean, first of all, what's so fascinating about them is they're

706
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:43,080
on if you measure it by GDP, they're 160 something out of like 184 or something. Yeah.

707
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:49,720
They just don't dirt poor. Yeah. But in a lot of happiness measurements, they rank in the top 20.

708
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:56,280
So they punch way above their weight and death, this idea of death and how they approach it,

709
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,600
I think factors in. There's a lot of things going on, but I think their relationship with death

710
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:07,400
does factor into this. And in Bhutan, it's they just take it into their life. So the Bhutanese

711
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,840
are told to think about death three times a day. It's kind of a cultural practice. Death is woven

712
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:19,240
into a lot of the art and the cultural dances and heritage. And there's even these little clay

713
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:28,040
pyramids called sasa. So this is mud mixed with ashes of cremated people. And they're all over

714
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:34,120
the country, all over the country. You take a turn, like an abandoned road and there might be

715
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,280
300 of them. They're in the window seals in the city. I mean, they're everywhere. So there's

716
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,840
this constant reminder and it flows in with this idea of impermanence and Buddhism. And I think

717
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:50,040
that Bhutan is a country really plays that up. So I traveled there to learn more about this.

718
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,480
And this was after the hunt. This was after the hunt.

719
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,640
Because it grew out of this understanding of, yeah.

720
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,960
And I met with three different people there. The first was a guy whose name is

721
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:10,200
Dachokarma Urra. And a Dachau is like secretary in the US. Like we have secretary of state.

722
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,720
Secretary of happiness.

723
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,040
Secretary of happiness. Yes. So I meet with him and he just does these happiness

724
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:22,680
measures all around the country. And he finds that I think 92% of Bhutanese say that they are

725
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,880
happy or less. They have different variations. They say, I think they have narrowly happy,

726
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,680
sort of like kind of baseline happy. Yeah. Very happy or like I'm extremely happy.

727
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,120
92% say they're at least some form of happy. And what by contrast, do we know what that is in the

728
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:44,760
US? I don't know. Although I know that some of our numbers there are dropping for sure. We're,

729
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:50,120
I mean, we're definitely not 92%. I want 40 comes into my mind, but definitely don't quote me on that.

730
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,080
So he does all these really fascinating.

731
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,640
It's hard for people to kind of wrap their head around some of this stuff, Michael. I'm quite

732
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:05,640
familiar with this research. I've talked a lot about it with Arthur Brooks, who also studies

733
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:14,440
this. And it's just, it's so perplexing until you actually go and experience places away from what

734
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:23,480
we do. Like I don't think one can cognitively appreciate what you're saying. If your only

735
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,040
exposure is what we are doing here, you sort of have to, you don't necessarily have to go to

736
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:33,560
Bhutan, but you have to see other parts of the world. You know, I, I, several years ago interviewed

737
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:41,080
this amazing physician named Tom Katana, who's like a missionary physician in Sudan. And he's in,

738
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,040
you know, one of the worst parts of Sudan, at least it was, it's, it's getting a little bit better now,

739
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,520
but it's in the Nuba mountains. There's about a million people there with no access to healthcare

740
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,880
who are being bombed by their government. So he's kind of running the hospital that takes care of

741
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,680
these people who are getting shrapnel and plus all the normal things that come up, you know,

742
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,600
infections and things like that. And, you know, one of the things we talked about in our discussion

743
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:10,280
was like the fact that nobody's depressed and there's only been one case of suicide that he's

744
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:14,680
ever seen. And it was probably related to a brain tumor that completely altered the person's brain.

745
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:21,240
I'm thinking to myself, Tom, the circumstances that you're describing sound so miserable.

746
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,600
How are people not just in a state of pure misery? And it turns out there's an amazing

747
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,280
sense of community, which we're going to talk about in Bhutan, right? Like there's,

748
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:38,760
there is no place you go to die that isn't around here. The oldest person, the youngest person,

749
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:48,680
everybody's together. And they're not, they don't seem to be any less happy, which again, it's

750
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:55,160
mind boggling that that can be the case. Yeah. And I think that there's generally more

751
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:01,960
economic equality too. I think that can affect it. I think there's a, the place definitely feels

752
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:12,920
slower, like much slower than the pace of life here. They have more exposure to nature, more time

753
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:20,920
in nature. Also they have no debt. I think that's, yeah, you mentioned everyone there, how do they

754
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,880
own their own homes? Obviously they're modest homes, but how, I just think it's inexpensive enough.

755
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:33,080
It's so inexpensive. Yeah. And there's, it's all universal healthcare. And the guy that I spoke to

756
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:41,400
is Dasha. He goes, look, our healthcare isn't perfect, but if you have a, you have something

757
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:46,200
that needs to be treated that is beyond what we're capable of treating, the country will pay for you

758
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:52,360
to the flight of India somewhere else. And just that's fully taken care of and fly you back.

759
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,080
So people generally don't have debt. And yeah, there is a big sense of community. So the what's

760
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,040
another, of course, there's so much healthier too. Is the other thing you said there's obesity rate

761
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:06,360
is 6%. 6%. Yeah. So that is one of the things that factors into it as well. They're generally

762
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:17,720
healthier. There's the entire country does not have a stoplight. Like what? Right.

763
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:23,800
There's no McDonald's or Starbucks or Burger King. I'm not saying those things are bad,

764
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:30,040
but I think what they've tried to do is really change the influence of or prevent the influence

765
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:35,640
of other places from coming in and sort of let Bhutan kind of figure itself out without other

766
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:44,200
places intervening. I don't know if intervening is the right way influencing that. And so that

767
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:49,000
seems to factor into it as well. I think most people, so I think the city of, I think the whole

768
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,240
country is maybe 3 million people. 600,000 live in Timpu, which is the capital. And then most

769
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,200
other people live sort of in the countryside and mountainsides and small communities of maybe 200

770
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:06,120
people. The stress thing is an interesting one. As I mentioned, we just kind of got back from

771
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:14,040
Italy. And the thing that I spent the most time thinking about while we're there is why is there

772
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:20,360
life expectancy four or five years greater than ours, despite the fact that they smoke nonstop?

773
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,360
Because this is the part I couldn't wrap my head around. And again, it's like I've been to Europe

774
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,600
many times. I've been to Italy once before. So it's not like this was the first time I was seeing it.

775
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,200
It was just the first time I really, really thought about it. I was like,

776
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:40,600
like smoking is the national pastime here. It's, and by the way, it didn't bug me, which is weird.

777
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,240
Like in the United States, when I smell cigarette smoke, it's like I have an allergic reaction. I

778
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,120
hate it so much. Somehow being in Italy smelling their smoke, I was like, look, it still smells

779
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:56,120
disgusting to me. But it just felt so culturally appropriate that I was like, you know, it is what

780
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:02,600
it is. I'm not going to be that American who's going to open my mouth and complain about smoke

781
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:08,120
in their country. But I'm like, their life expectancy, it's like four or five times,

782
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:13,720
four or five years greater than ours, despite the fact that they're participating in the single

783
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,000
most damaging thing you can do to your health. Well, of course, what I came to realize after

784
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,640
contemplating this for two weeks was everything else they're doing is so much better. Right. Like

785
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:32,680
they're eating a fraction of what we eat. And I mean, by the way, they're still eating pasta,

786
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:38,760
gelato. It's just the serving sizes are like this tiny. Yeah. They're much more active.

787
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:48,200
But the thing that really blows my mind is, and it's not surprising, is the pace. The pace is just

788
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:56,920
so much lower. It's just I really would believe and I don't know what metrics we have to measure

789
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:02,440
this, but I can't imagine they are under the stress that we put ourselves under. Now, the

790
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,200
flip side of that is because I've also thought a lot about this and talked a lot about this with

791
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,960
people. Maybe there's a reason the US is the world's biggest economy and maybe there's a reason

792
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,840
that most of the innovations are coming out of here and not Italy for that matter or pick, you

793
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,600
know, Bhutan for that reason. So I don't want to sound so naive to suggest that, you know, we should

794
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:28,600
all be like that. But you start to appreciate the trade off. Yes. Like we are paying a price

795
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:37,560
to be the world's leaders in innovation. We are paying a price to have unlimited access to food

796
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:46,360
and comfort that that, you know, when we were in Tuscany in the middle of nowhere, like you there

797
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:51,160
was no you know, the home we were staying in in Tuscany had no heat and no air conditioning.

798
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:58,840
So in the winter, it is freezing. And in the summer, it is basically just a sauna. It's a sauna

799
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:09,000
with with clay walls. Right. It's interesting. I mean, when I started to look at a lot of what

800
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:18,920
kills us now, it's all things linked to pace and comfort. Yeah, it's over nutrition, under movement,

801
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:25,800
under movement, too much stress. Yeah. And, you know, one thing that I learned, as I did this,

802
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,240
when it when it comes with stress, it's the question becomes, what is causing our stress?

803
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:40,520
A lot of it is manufactured, right? No one causes your stress, you cause your stress. Amen.

804
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,560
There's this concept in the book I talked about called prevalence induced concept change. And

805
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:51,160
that's kind of a nerdy way of saying basically problem creep. So these scientists at Harvard,

806
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,880
they did this kind of fun study. And they noticed this, by the way, they're waiting in line for TSA,

807
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:03,880
they're going to a conference. And they're looking at TSA, they're going, you know, a lot of people

808
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,920
who are clearly not that threatening get patted down, you know, it's like, grandma's getting the

809
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,920
full body pat down, because she had a half filled bottle of hairspray in her purse. And, you know,

810
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,400
they just pulled out my banana thinking that it was a Beretta or something. So they start to

811
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:22,200
wonder, you know, if all of a sudden, everyone just followed the rules, would they let everyone

812
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,600
flow through and, you know, just go on to your flight, or would they start looking for

813
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,400
successively smaller things, and they thought it would probably be the latter.

814
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,840
And I bet the reverse is true. If, if every fourth person coming through actually had a gun,

815
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:42,520
would the other three of us who have never carried a gun or threatening thing to an airport never get

816
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:49,000
patted down again, right? So they do this study. And there's two different studies they did where

817
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,680
they had people look at 800 different faces, and the people had to deem whether the face was

818
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,240
threatening or non threatening to them. So the people are going non threatening, non threatening,

819
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:04,120
threatening, threatening, non threatening, non threatening. What they did is about midway

820
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:11,400
through, they started showing the people successively fewer threatening faces. The other one they did

821
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,760
was very similar, except they're having them read these research proposals. So you would have to say

822
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,840
whether the research proposal is ethical or unethical. And again, somewhere in the middle,

823
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,720
they started feeding them fewer unethical ones. So you would think that people would just start saying,

824
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,840
threatening fewer times, they would start finding fewer things unethical, because it's like a person

825
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,600
either threatens you or they don't, right? And something either crosses this moral line you have

826
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,440
in the sand or it doesn't. Right, which you've already established through the first half of the

827
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,880
study. Well, it did. What ended up happening is they said that they said threatening the same

828
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:50,600
amount of times, same ratio times they found the same amount of studies. What word am I looking

829
01:17:50,600 --> 01:18:00,200
for now? How many ethical, unethical? Yes. And so what their takeaway was, is that as we experience

830
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:06,200
fewer and fewer problems, we don't actually perceive this, we simply go out and look for

831
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,680
other problems. We don't become more satisfied. But the thing is, is that as the world improves

832
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:17,000
over time, and I think we can agree that even though things aren't perfect right now, everyone knows it.

833
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:23,320
There's never been a better time to be a human being with respect to the benefits we have. Yes.

834
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,480
You're less likely, you know, compared to 100 years ago, you're more likely to be literate,

835
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:34,520
educated, you're less likely to die at any moment, on and on and on. But when you pull people, only

836
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,360
something like 12% of people think the world is improving. It's because we're always moving the

837
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:44,280
goalposts. And I think this makes evolutionary sense because in the past, when the world was hard,

838
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:49,400
when you did have serious life threatening problems, if you were always identifying the next problem,

839
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,640
okay, that's going to give you a survival advantage. If you're always, okay, we got to fix

840
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,520
this thing, this thing, okay, this is a problem, fix that, fix that. But in today's age, as things

841
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,760
become successively better, we look for problems where they maybe don't exist, or our problems

842
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,840
become more hollow. I agree with that completely. I think there's another issue at play here, and

843
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,840
I've thought about this so much. You know, the first time I started thinking about this problem

844
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,880
was 10 years ago when I read Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond's book, which I'm sure you've read,

845
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:22,120
and if people haven't read it, it's a great read. I suspect some of it is now dated, and there's,

846
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:28,040
you know, I don't know if he's written an updated version of it, but what it got me thinking about

847
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:36,200
a lot was how awful life was. I mean, there's just no other way to put it. Like, it's, it's,

848
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,120
we can sit here and talk about romanticizing some elements of a world with no iPhone.

849
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,400
The reality of it is, like, I wouldn't want to be one of the Hadza right now.

850
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,040
Even if you look at the Hadza today, which are one of the last tribes of hunter-gatherers,

851
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:58,520
so that's kind of our, one of our final windows into what people were doing 10,000 years ago.

852
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,600
There's, like, literally not a second of that that I think of as desirable outside of a vacation.

853
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,480
And by vacation, I mean, like, a hard experience you would go through for a couple of weeks

854
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:15,080
to make you more appreciative of what you have when you're back in plush Austin, Texas.

855
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:15,820
Yes.

856
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:25,000
But I can honestly say, like, I would never want to exist back in that world. It was awful. It was

857
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,480
so awful that I can't believe we survived it.

858
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,280
Yes.

859
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:36,680
I just can't believe I am tied to the genetics of people who managed to survive that.

860
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:42,600
It's unbelievable. And especially after we start to establish cities. Because then all of a sudden

861
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,680
you have one king and you're out in the field for 12 hours a day.

862
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,720
In service of that king.

863
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,160
In service of that king and you're starving the whole time and you have, you know,

864
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,960
you have all these problems with malnutrition. You're living in with, like, no sanitary.

865
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,360
It's just totally terrible.

866
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:06,040
Did you ever see that movie, The Duel, with Matt Damon and Adam Driver?

867
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:06,520
No.

868
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:12,600
So it's sort of it's loosely a true story based on the last time there was a duel,

869
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:18,360
the last time the King of France authorized a duel. And I believe it's sort of, I don't know,

870
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,480
I want to say 16th century, maybe 15th century. So call it like 500 years ago directionally.

871
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:30,440
Really good movie. I really quite liked it. But again, I'm like looking at the movie through

872
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,600
a different lens, which I'm always doing when I'm watching movies. And the lens I'm looking at it

873
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:42,040
through is this is a movie about the most privileged people in France, like the kings,

874
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:50,920
the knights, the most privileged. And at the time, France and England were the most privileged in the

875
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:57,480
world. So you're looking at the most privileged people in a society that is the most privileged

876
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:02,440
society on the planet. And this is only 500 years ago, which might sound like a long time, but

877
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:08,120
when we start talking about what 1159 33 means, people will understand how not long that is.

878
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:16,200
And I'm thinking I would rather be homeless today than the King of France 500 years ago.

879
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,480
Like it is unbelievable abject misery they lived in.

880
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,560
It's yeah, it's it's very crazy. And to your point, what you said earlier,

881
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,360
a lot of it gets romanticized and it's oh, yeah, you should you should check it out.

882
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,920
Go back there. See if you can. It's terrible. So it's a life is amazing to me.

883
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:41,880
I mean, yeah, yeah. So so yeah, I mean, that to me is the is the is the thing that you you're

884
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:47,000
constantly weighing, which is we have this incredible privilege today to be alive.

885
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:53,320
And all we need to do is to me, this is how I read the book, right? I don't read the book as saying

886
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:58,600
we need to go back and be hunter gatherers. No, it's sort of like saying, look, you have this

887
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,600
incredible. It's like a it's like an Uncle Ben moment with Spiderman, right? It's like with great

888
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:12,120
power comes great responsibility. We have this great power today. We have processed food, which

889
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,640
by the way, and the guy that you talk about in your book, I think does a great job of

890
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,360
explaining to you out of the gate. Hey, don't think processed means bad.

891
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:25,960
Processed is actually what allows us to like not get poisoned every time we eat food. Yeah.

892
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:35,560
So you have all of these things that allow you so much latitude. Do more with it. Right. That's

893
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:41,400
that's to me what really what it comes down to is we have the ability to help more people. Right.

894
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:47,960
You know, if you if you think about what it was like 500 years ago, if a person had mental illness

895
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:53,000
500 years ago, like I don't know how many other people were bending over backwards to try to make

896
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,600
their lives better because you were just too busy trying to survive. Yeah. Whereas today, like you

897
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:05,880
can help somebody else. Yes. That's the that's the responsibility that comes with the privilege

898
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:12,520
of having so much. You can afford to try to feed other people that aren't being fed. Yeah. And again,

899
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:17,480
in a world of over nutrition, it seems almost absurd that anybody would go without. Yeah.

900
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,400
Yeah. I think the argument that I'm making is that in a way, we've come become victims of our own

901
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:29,720
success. And if we don't have times that push back against what we have and sort of reframe

902
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:35,720
how lucky we are in the grand scheme of time and space and give us insight into these things are

903
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:41,720
all wonderful. But if I use them all the time, it seems like bad things tend to happen. Yep. Processed

904
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:46,680
food. Great. Keeps us all alive. It's why there's nearly eight billion people on the planet. The same

905
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,920
time if that is who don't have to move around. Like, yeah, think about this. Like we get to sit in

906
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:57,400
the same place. Yeah. Yeah. But if you're always eating the most comforting food all the time,

907
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:02,360
you're going to have some problems. It's great that you don't don't have to quote unquote exercise

908
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:07,080
or physically work for your food every day. It's great. But at the same time, if you never

909
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,640
reinsert exercise into your life to make up for that, you're going to have some problems.

910
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:19,480
It's great that I can, if I feel bored, I can go on Instagram and watch the most entertaining 15

911
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:24,360
seconds of my life and probably laugh my ass off for a week because I've found something so funny.

912
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,440
Which is hard to imagine. Like that couldn't have been done a hundred years ago. Yeah.

913
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:36,600
And here we are. But if you're always doing that, then it's like that comes with problems. So the

914
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:41,080
argument that I'm making in the book is that we need sort of moments that push back at us and

915
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:49,080
reframe things. If the entire history of this universe were laid out in a calendar year,

916
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:54,040
can you give some milestones? I love, I love where did you read about this or learn about this?

917
01:25:54,040 --> 01:26:04,120
I was, I was driving to work in my truck 29 and it was on a podcast. Someone walks through it and

918
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:09,160
I just started bawling like, you know, I'm driving past like a Chipotle, just this, you know, kind

919
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,680
of fitness bro. Like, Oh my God, that's so much time, you know. Why? Okay. Well, so tell, give,

920
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:19,480
give the answer. And then I want to talk about why that, what that meant to you emotionally. Yeah.

921
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,680
So the answer is that the big bang happens. The big bang happens on January 1st.

922
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,600
I believe that our galaxy forms, I might get the months like September, September,

923
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:40,440
earth forms in November, dinosaurs die off on December 25th. After appearing on December 20th

924
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,520
or something. Yeah. Yeah. They were around for, you know, five days on this calendar. Yeah. Yeah.

925
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,800
That's right. The 20, 25th to the 29th or something, right? Of December. Of December.

926
01:26:50,760 --> 01:27:00,200
All of human history that we have written down happens New Year's Eve, 11 59 starting

927
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,240
at 33, 33 seconds, 33 seconds in that is all of recorded human history.

928
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:13,320
That is how little time we've been here. It's crazy.

929
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:21,960
It is unbelievable. All of recorded human history is 27 seconds. The last 27 seconds of a year.

930
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:29,640
Yes. So for me, that was one of the things too, that, you know, I started thinking about

931
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,720
just that you're, it makes you realize you're not that damn important in the grand scheme of time

932
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:40,040
and space. Now that sounds like it's kind of, you're being hard on yourself, but at the same time,

933
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:44,760
I would go one step further. It's that you are completely unimportant. I mean, it's like,

934
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:52,040
you couldn't be less relevant. Yeah. And so that, you know, that can be unnerving at first,

935
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:57,400
but at the same time, I need to do the calculation of what an average human lifespan is.

936
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:04,040
Cause it's milliseconds on that scale. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And once you have that

937
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,520
realization, I think that it can change your behavior in a positive way.

938
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,040
Cause we're all here. We're all going to die. Right. Yeah. And so going back to this,

939
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,240
and again, it's just fresh on my mind. Cause I just kind of got back. So we're staying with

940
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:21,640
this friend in, in, in this place and in Tuscany and it's, uh, you know, it's like a 400 acre

941
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:28,440
farm that has been built up over years. So the first thing that was built on that farm was 500

942
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:33,560
years old, was like an old church and, and then like, you know, three, you know, and then 50 years

943
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,520
later, this other house got built. And then a hundred years later, this other thing got built and

944
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,480
then a hundred years. So the newest thing on this farm is 300 years old. The oldest thing is probably

945
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:49,000
five, 600 years old. That's your, that's your timeframe. And I had this sense that came over

946
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:57,960
me while I was there, which was, I felt so good being in a place where I knew so many people had

947
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:05,240
lived and died. Why do you think that was for the exact reason that you just said, which is it

948
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:10,760
really made me feel appropriately irrelevant. And I said to my friend, um,

949
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,520
so some of my friends in American, but he lives there like three months out of the year.

950
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:25,880
I said, did I not being facetious? So you can say no. But if I know, if I, if, if my death is

951
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,200
reasonably inevitable, like I have cancer or something like that, um, would you be cool if

952
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:36,440
I came and died here and, and was buried here? And he's like, yeah, man, that would be fantastic.

953
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:43,160
Because I feel like I would really like to kind of die in a place where I'm just a, you know,

954
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:49,080
I'm just an irrelevant piece of the long, beautiful history of our species. And then

955
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,640
I've never liked the idea of these, you know, funerals and things like that, but I'd like,

956
01:29:53,640 --> 01:30:01,080
I'd like, could I just be buried there, right? By the olive trees so that my carbon and my nitrogen

957
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:07,320
become a part of an olive tree that someone will drink olive oil from, you know, 25 years later.

958
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:14,200
Um, and I don't know how to describe it. Like I just, I'm sure there are some places in the US

959
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,840
where you might find that feeling, but again, certainly nothing here that's 300 years old,

960
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:25,240
let alone 500 years old, let alone a couple thousand years old. Um, and I just, I think

961
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:31,640
that as morbid as it is to think like that, I don't know. I feel like I'm excited about the

962
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:35,960
possibility of, Hey, will I be fortunate enough to have enough of a warning when I'm going to die

963
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:44,200
that I could go and die there? Yeah. It's so when I was getting sober, a phrase I learned is

964
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,440
rule 62. Don't, don't take yourself so damn seriously. And that reinforces that for me.

965
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,720
Right. It's like, I think people have a tendency to take themselves and the things in their life

966
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:03,080
so seriously. And once you realize it's things aren't that big of a deal, like you got one ride,

967
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:09,640
you don't have to always ride the gas all the time. You know, like you can slow down sometimes.

968
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:15,720
That's been relatively freeing for me. And also I think improved, I mean, if we want to talk about

969
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:21,240
improving performance at work and in life, like that's kind of a life hack because once you kind

970
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:26,520
of let off yourself, it's like, you're free to kind of do the things I think you want to do and

971
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:31,720
let your mind go where it needs to go, especially for me doing creative work. You know, if I don't

972
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,680
put all this pressure on myself, I'm like, fuck, no one's going to read this book in 200 years,

973
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:43,880
100 years, 20 years, like who knows, right? Just make it good. Like, it's a ride. You know,

974
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:49,800
I remember watching this documentary about the Grateful Dead, one of my favorite bands. They are

975
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:56,920
my favorite band. Oh, really? And I think it was maybe it was 67 when they're kind of coming up

976
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:02,600
and they take a bunch of acid as the Grateful Dead do living in San Francisco. And how big

977
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,920
was the band at that point in time? So they started by they, they rose by playing the original acid

978
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:14,360
tests that Ken Kesey would do that eventually got written about in the electric Kool-Aid acid test.

979
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:20,360
And so this would have been down three years after that, they're kind of starting to come up there in

980
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:25,640
LA and there's this big LA tower thing that this guy had like built over years and years and years.

981
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,280
And Garcia talks about, you know, people, tourists would come to see this big tower

982
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:40,040
this guy had built. He looks at it and he's like, you know, I want to just create things that live

983
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:48,440
and explode in the moment and just have fun, like in this moment. And that ultimately guided them as

984
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:52,680
a band forever. And that's, you can see that in their music, that every song is like its own

985
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,800
exploding moment. And that's kind of what we are as humans, right? No one's going to remember you.

986
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,280
You're not going to have this big monument to you. It's like, man,

987
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:05,560
ride this thing out. Like give yourself some space and just like, enjoy it, you know.

988
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:16,440
So what's Misogi? Misogi. So I learned about this concept from a guy whose name is Marcus Elliott.

989
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:22,600
He went to Harvard med school, but decided he didn't want to be a traditional doctor.

990
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,760
He decided that he wanted to get into sports science. He wants to revolutionize sports.

991
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,840
And he kind of ends up doing it in a way. He's the first guy to really bring

992
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:41,640
AI and movement tracking into pro sports. And by using this data, he can basically tell people,

993
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,880
the way that your knee caves in, as you do this, you might have a 60% chance of injury based on all

994
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:53,640
the other cases we've seen of men of your size in the NBA, whatever. So he's kind of all about these

995
01:33:53,640 --> 01:34:01,160
numbers and data and figures that can improve performance. But he also believes that what

996
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:06,440
improves performance and potential, it can always be measured in a way. There's intangibles that some

997
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:13,960
people have. And so to get to these, he does this idea called Misogi. Now the setup, the backup for

998
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:21,240
this is why it's important is that if you think about how humans evolved, we used to have to do

999
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:28,600
hard things all the time. No safety net. This could be from a big hunt, moving from summering to

1000
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,960
wintering grounds, tiger lurking in the bushes, all these different things. So we were challenged

1001
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,360
all the time. And if we failed, we would die. But each time we would take on one of these challenges,

1002
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,200
you would inevitably learn what your potential was, right? You would really have to dig deep,

1003
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:47,160
push, and you would come out of that. Assuming it went well, made it out the other side, knowing

1004
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:54,360
what you were capable of. But now in modern life, you start to see a shift where you can live a

1005
01:34:54,360 --> 01:35:00,680
decent life and you're never really challenged, especially physically in a way that sort of

1006
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:06,040
almost blends mind, body, spirit. You know, you'll have your running water, you'll have your food,

1007
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:12,200
you'll have your home, you'll have your family, and it's really great. But, you know, he argues, and I

1008
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,880
I'm with him on this, that if you think of human potential is like a really big circle. It's like

1009
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:22,520
most people are kind of in this little dinner plate size thing right here because we never explore

1010
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:31,240
those edges, really what we're capable of. So enter Misogi. And this is this idea that once a year,

1011
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:38,760
you're gonna go out into nature, you're gonna do something really hard. Some challenging tasks.

1012
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:44,840
So there are only two rules of Misogi. Rule number one is that it has to be really hard.

1013
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:50,840
So he defines this by saying you have a 50-50 shot at finishing whatever it is, this Misogi task that

1014
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:57,640
you decided to take on. And it has to be true 50-50 because now I think when people take on challenges,

1015
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,400
especially when there's a physical element, they pick things that they know they will finish that

1016
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:05,400
are within their capabilities. So if you look at how marathoners approach running a marathon,

1017
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:09,560
it's not, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to finish this marathon.

1018
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,920
Right. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to finish this marathon in under three hours or whatever.

1019
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:21,560
Yeah. The second rule of Misogi. Which I like as much as the first rule.

1020
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:28,600
So you can't die. Don't die. That is kind of a tongue-in-cheek way of basically saying,

1021
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,600
be safe on this thing. So to give examples. Wait, isn't there also a third sort of rule of Misogi?

1022
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,920
There's guidelines. Well, oh, I thought there was a, we don't talk about Misogi. Like you don't go and

1023
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:44,200
like your Misogi doesn't get up on Instagram. Yes. So that is, then there's two guidelines.

1024
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:50,280
The two guidelines are one, you don't talk about Misogi publicly. You can talk about it with

1025
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:56,040
friends with your, with your wife and close ones, but you don't put it on Instagram and Facebook

1026
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:02,520
and Twitter. And the reason for that is so many times now this rule, this guideline was a guideline

1027
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:07,880
before social media, but so much stuff that people do today is often for the gram.

1028
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:14,040
You want to do something so you can post it. And by removing this, all of a sudden you have

1029
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:17,800
this question of if you're doing something really hard and you want to quit, are you going to keep

1030
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,480
going for you knowing that it's not going to be for a pat on the back, some sort of social with

1031
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:30,600
social implications. The second guideline is that the Misogi should be somewhat quirky, make something

1032
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:36,760
up. The reason for that is because once you were removed sort of artificial metrics, that changes

1033
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:40,280
the game, right? If you're doing a marathon, all of a sudden you're thinking about your time. You're

1034
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,840
thinking about all these different things that are kind of socially constructed. Whereas if you

1035
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:50,200
just pick some random task, it's like, well, let's just see if we can do it. We have no, we have no

1036
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:55,640
framework for this. And that kind of opens up the door for some interesting experiences. So some of

1037
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:03,720
the Misogis that this guy has done is one year, him and a few guys, they got an 85 pound boulder

1038
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:09,320
and they walked it underneath the Santa Barbara channel. I think it was five miles. So one guy

1039
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,720
would dive down, pick up the boulder, walk 10 yards, drop it, go up. The next guy would dive down,

1040
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:19,640
rinse and repeat till you're at point B. But there's also simpler things like, here's this mountain

1041
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:25,240
that we see every day. Let's see if we can get up there in a single day, things like that. Now,

1042
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:34,280
the point of these, there's two big reasons for doing something like this. One is that it teaches

1043
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:40,040
you that you chronically undersell your potential. So if you choose an appropriately hard task,

1044
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:47,160
you are going to have a moment where you go, I'm done. I got to quit. I've reached my edge.

1045
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:51,240
There's, there's no going back from this. But if you can keep putting one foot in front of the

1046
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:55,480
other, then you get this other moment that's much more important. And that's where you look back and

1047
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:03,320
go, well, wait a minute. I thought my edge was back there, but I am clearly past it now. And that

1048
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:08,440
suggests that I'm selling myself short. And the more important question that comes from that is,

1049
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,160
okay, where else in my life am I selling myself short? So you see that you're capable of more.

1050
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:23,000
The second thing that comes from this is that it can reframe fear for people because we're wired

1051
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,720
to avoid failure at all costs because failure in the past used to mean death. So of course,

1052
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:34,600
we would want to not fail, but today failure isn't death. It's, I don't know, mistyping in an email

1053
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,280
misspeak when you're speaking to a group of people, something like that.

1054
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,800
Yet we still fear those kinds of things like their death. So sort of

1055
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,200
dancing on the edge of failure, you can realize that it's not that big of a deal.

1056
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:56,840
Now, when I first learned about this concept, it sounded cool. It sounded intriguing. The same time

1057
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:04,680
I'm like, okay, it's kind of quirky, just like some made up thing. And then I started really

1058
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:11,880
researching what was happening here. And we used to call things like this rites of passage. So when

1059
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,640
we had a young person who was at point A in their life, and we needed to get them to point B, where

1060
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:21,160
they were more confident, competent, a better contributor to the tribe, what would we do? We

1061
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:26,520
would send them out into nature to do something really hard. Right. And along the way, they would

1062
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,600
struggle, they would battle, they would have moments of doubt, but they would ultimately come

1063
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,280
out on the other side realizing that they were capable of a lot more. And they could bring that

1064
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:39,640
back into society and improve the tribe as a whole. And you saw these, what's interesting is you see

1065
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:43,800
these across cultures. This is, this wasn't that one tribe said, Hey, we're doing this thing. It's

1066
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,200
pretty cool. You should try it too. And that tribe put the word out. Oh, these just pop up.

1067
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,440
This arose independently throughout, throughout culture.

1068
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:58,840
They just, it just arises. And it's also in mythology. So if you look at the work of Joseph

1069
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:05,000
Campbell and the hero's journey, it's the hero exits the comfort of home. He or she goes into

1070
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,400
a trying middle ground, they're faced with battles. They have to go inward and they have to physically

1071
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:18,040
strive. And then they come back into society with the treasure or the talisman or whatever it is.

1072
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,320
Well, what is the treasure of the talisman? It's not the actual physical object. It's the way that

1073
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:28,200
person has changed and that change that they can bring back into society. And you're, you've seen

1074
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:33,320
a falling away of traditional rites of passage like this, which is why when you were talking about

1075
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:40,120
sending your daughter to that camp, I got so excited because I think kids really would benefit

1076
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:48,120
adults too. But kids in particular really benefit from having times where they get pushed to their

1077
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:53,320
edges and they have those moments where of doubt that they're not sure what they're capable of,

1078
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:59,000
but then they cross it and realize, Oh, I've got more on board than I really ever imagined.

1079
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:05,560
Because like you look at what people can accomplish when the conditions are a survive

1080
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:13,400
condition. It's incredible what people can do. And it also makes evolutionary sense to undersell

1081
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:19,480
yourself. Yeah. Keeps you safe. Keeps you safe. Yeah. You don't want to be the hold my beer guy.

1082
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:29,240
Right. That person dies. So it's a practice that I do in my own life. And as I said, it's when I

1083
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:34,120
first kind of heard about it, I go, yeah, sounds kind of fun. Also kind of like, yeah, quirky. And

1084
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,360
then when you start to learn more, it goes, Oh, wow, this is actually a powerful thing. And when

1085
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:44,120
you look at research on challenges in people's lives, the people who have the worst rates of

1086
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:49,720
mental health are the people who have had a ton of challenges, like an overwhelming amount of

1087
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:55,560
challenges and traumas. But on the opposite end of the spectrum are people who have no challenge in

1088
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,120
their life and no traumas. They have equally poor rates of mental health. So it's kind of a U-shaped

1089
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:05,960
curve where having enough challenge in your life that you learn that you're what you're capable of,

1090
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:10,520
that you can persist through things that you've got this seems to be healthy for people.

1091
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,800
So speaking of challenges, right, one of my favorite challenges now that we get to talk about,

1092
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:22,040
even though it would never rise to the level of a Misogi, but as a daily practice is rucking. So

1093
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:28,040
why is it that people like you and I have taken to this thing? And maybe we could start by just

1094
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:35,960
kind of defining what is rucking. Rucking is carrying weight for the sake of weight in a backpack.

1095
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:42,600
So the word grew out of military circles. So in the military, rucking is just a standard fitness

1096
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:48,360
practice. It is the main fitness tool that the US military and militaries all around the world going

1097
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:53,720
back hundreds and hundreds of years you use to build fitness for soldiers. It is just carrying

1098
01:43:53,720 --> 01:44:01,720
weight on your back in a backpack. And it's interesting because this is again kind of a

1099
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:08,040
feature that is unique to our species. Yes. I started thinking about this when I was hunting,

1100
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:14,680
because once you kill the animal and you have the meat, you have to pack it out. So if you look at

1101
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:19,400
why the human body is built the way it is and what we're physically good at, we're good at two things.

1102
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:24,760
The first is running long distances in the heat. So if you've read Born to Run or that was spawned

1103
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:31,400
from a 2004 paper in nature by Dan Lieberman. And we have all these adaptations that make us

1104
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:36,680
good at running long distances slowly in the heat. And we would use that to hunt on hot days.

1105
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:44,520
It's not even running. I mean, like over 24 hours, we could walk further in a day than an animal could

1106
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:50,760
go at whatever pace it chose. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. We don't have to be running. We can just simply be

1107
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,880
walking three miles in an hour. Yeah. We'll walk 75 miles in a day. We're unbelievable at covering

1108
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:00,840
ground. And animals on a hot day, four legged animals, they're not efficient at cooling

1109
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,480
themselves. We are. That's one of our adaptations. So we sweat our noses are really complex nasal

1110
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:10,280
cavities, a cool air, all these different things. And so we would chase animals down until they

1111
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:16,600
essentially toppled over from heat exhaustion and we would spear them. And then this leads to

1112
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:21,400
the second thing that we're good at, which is we would then have to carry that animal back to camp.

1113
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:26,840
And we also have adaptations that make us really good at carrying. And we are in fact, the only

1114
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:33,960
animal that can carry. Yeah, I was really surprised to learn how lousy primates are at carrying.

1115
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:41,640
They're terrible, very terrible. So we will still be more efficient. I think we can hold up to 33% of

1116
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:46,920
our body weight and still be more efficient at covering ground than most other primates.

1117
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:51,240
With no weight. With no weight. Yeah. Just on their own. They have this sort of tipsy,

1118
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:57,960
weird gate. There's a technical term for it. I forget it, but it's not efficient at all.

1119
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:05,560
And arguably, yeah, which I completely like, I, I weigh 180. I could easily carry a 60 pound

1120
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:10,360
kettlebell in one hand. It's easier if I could make it a 30 and a 30, but even a 60 in one hand,

1121
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:16,920
it's like nothing. Yeah, most people can. Yeah. Yeah. And to think that that's more efficient

1122
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:24,680
than a primate is with nothing. With nothing. Yeah. Yeah. And it definitely shaped us. And

1123
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:29,480
the experience of carrying out meat is really what made, had me starting to think that because

1124
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:34,680
I had been familiar with the Lieberman work and all that. And it was in my mind and thinking about

1125
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:40,280
how, you know, it's linked this, this running's link to hunting and, but then you carry and you're

1126
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:46,040
like, Oh, they would have had to do this too. Like we also seem to be the only species that can really

1127
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:53,240
do this well. And, you know, arguably we carried a lot more as early humans than we would have run

1128
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,960
because running is mostly reserved for hunts. Whereas you look at what is gathering. So you

1129
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,880
go pick up some stuff and carry it around as you get more stuff and then you carry it back to camp.

1130
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:09,160
And so I actually went to Harvard to meet with Lieberman and that was a really fun meeting.

1131
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:15,800
He's a fascinating guy. I enjoyed talking to him. But so I argue in the book that when you look at

1132
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:22,200
running is obviously popular jogging is a thing, right? Or is it yogging? I can't remember.

1133
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,320
Jogging.

1134
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:35,000
But carrying is not as a form of fitness and activity. And I ultimately ended up traveling to

1135
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,520
go Ruck HQ. And this is a, the tribe, I argue that has really adopted

1136
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:45,400
carrying is the military through rucking. That's like the only group who's really putting this at

1137
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:50,520
scale. And go Ruck is a company that makes backpacks that are specific for rocking and their

1138
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:56,200
founder, whose name is Jason McCarthy. He is, he sort of leaned into rucking as a, as a form

1139
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:02,280
of fitness. As I started to really look at the research on it, it's really great for us because

1140
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:05,640
you're working your cardiovascular system, but you're also working your strength system to a

1141
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,400
degree. So you're not going to get that with, you know, running or cycling something that is a pure

1142
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:14,360
endurance act. Whereas with rucking, you're getting the endurance, but also you've got

1143
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:19,240
load on your body. And so that is stimulating your muscles to a greater degree. And there's some

1144
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,440
really fascinating studies on backcountry hunters who will carry in loads, you know,

1145
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:31,080
into deep into the mountains and they'll test their body fat before and after. And those hunters

1146
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:35,160
across, I think it was a 10 day study, a small study. There's, you know, there's only so many

1147
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:43,960
weirdos like that. They lost 14% of their body fat and they actually stayed with same amount of

1148
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:50,520
muscle. Some actually gained like an ounce or two of muscle. So it's really good at melting fat

1149
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:59,880
and preserving muscle. And the other thing I think that's for me, something I really enjoy about it

1150
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:05,400
is, you know, most of my cardio is done on a bike. But as you said, there's no load on a bike.

1151
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:13,240
And I used to run a lot growing up. That was sort of my thing. And I'm really, I feel pretty

1152
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:20,120
fortunate that despite 60 mile weeks growing up, I still have perfectly fine knees and hips. But I

1153
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:25,000
also realize as much as I would love to go back to running, I don't want to poke the bear. I just,

1154
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:31,160
I dodged a bullet in life being able to run so much without hurting myself. But as I'm older,

1155
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:36,040
I don't, I just don't think that's the case. And I think when you look at, I think it's about eight

1156
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:42,280
times your body weight is the force experienced by your knees with every step when you run.

1157
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:47,640
Obviously weight matters and the lighter you are, the better. And it's not a surprise that the best

1158
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:53,240
runners are, you know, feather light for obvious reasons. But with walking, it's only about three

1159
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:58,920
times your weight. So when you're rocking, you're walking, not running. And yes, you're adding more

1160
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:06,520
weight. So let's say you increase your body weight by a factor of 30 percent. The 30 percent increase

1161
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:13,880
at a three X multiple of force is much less than your body weight at eight times the force. If

1162
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:19,400
you're running, in other words, as hard as rucking is with all that extra weight, it's still much

1163
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:24,840
easier on your knees than running. Yes. And you're still getting, I mean, yesterday was the first day

1164
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:29,080
I had rucked in two weeks. We just got back from vacation and I'd been walking nonstop while we were

1165
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:34,520
there, but it wasn't the same. Holy cow. Like much harder. Even just taking two weeks off. It's really

1166
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:43,480
like a type of workout. My heart rate hit like 165. I was in the 150s and 160s, which is totally

1167
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:48,120
uncommon for me when rucking. I'm normally in the 130s, 140s, but I guess because I was sort of

1168
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:55,080
deconditioned for not because all my walking in Europe was, you know, without load. Yeah. So it

1169
01:50:55,080 --> 01:51:01,960
really made a difference. It really showed me just how demanding it is. It is. And

1170
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:08,360
the injury data is really interesting to your point. When you look at studies on

1171
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:14,920
people in the military, what tends to injure soldiers is running that has, I mean, when

1172
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,600
they'll even throw people into, they'll do studies where they look at injury rates across something

1173
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:25,080
like a selection, which is, you know, a long process where these guys are being just hammered

1174
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,800
and they're all getting injured by running. That's not to say that some people don't get injured by

1175
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:37,960
rucking, but it's like very, very small numbers comparatively. And so for that reason, I think

1176
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:43,720
it's a lot safer, but it sort of also gives you to your point, your ability to get a higher heart

1177
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:50,280
rate than you would from walking and also preserve muscle. Yeah. The thing that I've got my daughter

1178
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:58,600
really embracing is the hills because on the uphill, you're just obliterating your heart and

1179
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:04,280
lungs, but also, and my daughter might be the only 13 year old to really be able to explain to

1180
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:08,680
you the difference between eccentric and concentric strength because all the times we're walking

1181
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,080
down hills, I'm explaining to her how this is working her eccentric strength and her quads.

1182
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:18,600
And this is where you get your breaks from. But I mean, I love the walking downhill as well.

1183
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:23,000
And, you know, really trying to be as deliberate about it as possible and really making sure

1184
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,920
because in life, that's where people fail. Right. So when you get older, you know, never mind

1185
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:35,400
running, it's like, can you walk downstairs without collapsing? Can you take a can you walk off a step

1186
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:42,120
and not hurt yourself? Well, if the answer is I don't know how to decelerate, the answer is no,

1187
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:49,000
you're hosed. Right. And there's no better way to learn to decelerate than with a big load on your

1188
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,840
back walking downhill. Yes. That will teach you how to decelerate. And that's not something you

1189
01:52:54,840 --> 01:53:00,600
get easily in the gym. No, it's it's not something you get easily running. It's you just don't get

1190
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,920
that skill any other way that I'm aware of. And if you do fall, you're going to be better off

1191
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:13,800
if you've been rocking because it also is rather good at improving bone density. Really interesting

1192
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:19,080
studies on women where it improves bone density better than weightlifting alone, better than,

1193
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:23,480
you know, cardio alone. And that becomes so important as women age. You look at

1194
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,600
women in sort of hunter gatherer societies that are always carrying things. I mean,

1195
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:34,680
they stay strong and vital their entire lives and they just don't get hip fractures.

1196
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:39,960
Yeah, I you stated in the book and we sort of loosely described it here, but I just think,

1197
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:47,000
you know, if the if you if if if McDougall argues we're born to run, I would argue we're born to

1198
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:55,480
carry. That is my argument. We are born to carry. If you look at what people what people in hunter

1199
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:01,480
gatherer societies actually spend their time doing physically, no one runs like you even look at the

1200
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:09,400
tar. Humara, they very rarely run and it's not for fun. It's for ceremonial purposes. You know,

1201
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:16,280
but work life is caring. Yeah. And, you know, a reasonably well trained person, we can get most

1202
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:21,640
of our patients to the point where they can carry their body weight. Now, again, you're not going to

1203
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:27,080
start out there if you're not well trained, but like a reasonably fit person could for a minute,

1204
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:32,840
carry their body weight in their hands. Yeah. Yes. You could carry it longer on your back. But

1205
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:37,560
but even the fact that we have the grip strength, the limb strength to carry our body weight

1206
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:44,280
is just fantastic. I mean, we one of the metrics we use with with female patients who obviously

1207
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,960
have less upper body strength is seventy five percent of your body weight carried for a minute

1208
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:52,280
is one of like our multiple. You know, we have many sort of strength metrics we put people through.

1209
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:56,040
That's a great one. Then that's that's you know, think about that for a moment. That's like that's

1210
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:00,120
pretty impressive, especially in light of what you said earlier. So so what are kind of some of the

1211
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:06,360
so so by the way, you know, I didn't even know what rucking was when I was kind of doing it in

1212
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:12,040
training for hunts. But I realized, you know, what I do now is so much better because then I was just

1213
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:18,040
using a weight vest. All right. So you'll see later our backyard is really, really steep. And

1214
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:23,320
so I would you know, in the weeks leading up to hunts, I would put on a 50 pound weight vest

1215
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:29,320
and just go up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down the hill. But why is it that a rucksack

1216
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:33,800
we would agree and argue is better than a weight vest? What is it? What is it offering over a weight

1217
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:39,240
vest? It tends to pull your spine into a better position. So most people today since we work

1218
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:45,240
in front of desks, we're slumped over all the time, we're naturally slumped. When you put weight on

1219
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:50,280
your back, it sort of puts your spine in a safer position. And that can actually seems to relieve

1220
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,040
and prevent back pain. So that is according to I spoke with Stu Miguel, who's the back expert up

1221
01:55:56,040 --> 01:56:03,000
in Canada. And he's a huge fan of rucking. He's a very careful person when it comes to exercise.

1222
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:09,560
In my experience with him, I mean, he's very nuanced. And he's a person I trust because of that.

1223
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:13,880
And he said, you know, rucking is a great way to add some durability to people in a way that's safe.

1224
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:23,320
The other thing I think about rucking, and I also own, you know, several rucksacks from Go Ruck now as

1225
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:29,880
well. The belt really makes a difference when you get that belt on your hips, because, you know,

1226
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:35,160
I had shoulder surgery four months ago. And one of the things I was super stressed about was not

1227
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:42,120
being able to ruck because, you know, I've got my shoulder operated on. And amazingly, I was

1228
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:48,040
probably rucking three weeks after surgery, and I couldn't do much else. Let's be clear.

1229
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:54,600
But how was I able to do that? Well, first of all, you know, you've got really well placed straps

1230
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:01,000
on your shoulders that are not, you know, it's not putting my joint at risk. And more importantly,

1231
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,640
the majority of the weight, because you control where the load is by how you adjust it. But I

1232
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:10,200
basically just said, I'm going to put all the load on my hips and I'll cook my legs a bit more, but

1233
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:16,360
I will spare my shoulder. Yeah. So that's kind of to me, the other thing about the rucksack that

1234
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:22,920
really, really beats the weight vest is that you have the distribution to load posteriorly,

1235
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,080
but you also can really distribute the load on your hips, which anyone who's hunted or done any

1236
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:32,440
backcountry stuff knows, like a really, it's so important to have your pack fit well on your hips.

1237
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:37,400
Otherwise you could simply couldn't carry 100 pounds on your shoulders for very long. Yeah.

1238
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:43,400
When I was in the Arctic and we were packing out caribou, we were heavy. I mean, over a hundred

1239
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:52,040
pounds, you know, maybe 110, who knows 20. It was nice to have the hip belt because I would sort of

1240
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:56,120
spend most of my time with the weight on the hips, but eventually that just starts to burn and you

1241
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:00,920
need to wash that out. So you pop it your shoulders for a while and you can just kind of go back and

1242
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:07,160
forth. I love that back and forth on, off, on, off. Yeah. Yeah. Just trying to find something that

1243
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:13,720
isn't absolutely awful for a moment. It's good burn though. It's funny when my wife started rucking

1244
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:21,240
with me and my wife is like, I think she's a super tough chick. She has, I think she's a very

1245
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:25,640
high pain tolerance. The first time she ever did a dead hang, she went three minutes and eight

1246
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:33,560
seconds. Oh, wow. Which is like insane. Yeah. And she's gone longer since, but the first couple

1247
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:40,120
times she did it, she was like, does this ever stop hurting? And I was like, no, I wouldn't say

1248
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:44,600
it ever really stops hurting. I mean, you can lighten the load, but you know, I was like, no,

1249
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:48,680
it's, it's, it's, it's uncomfortable. Like I'm not going to lie to you. This is not something that

1250
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,120
ever, if you're doing it the way we're doing it, which is, you know, we're, we're about a third of

1251
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:58,520
our body weight and we're walking as quickly as we can while walking. No, this is just uncomfortable.

1252
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:03,160
There's no two ways about it. It will be uncomfortable. And, but the upside is, is that,

1253
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:08,520
you know, I'll even take rucking meetings where I'll toss in 20 pounds or something and I'll just

1254
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:13,240
walk around while on this. I know I'm going to have to be on this phone call. I could sit in my

1255
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:19,080
desk and office in the dark, or I could go outside and have a light load and get it all

1256
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,280
taken care of there and sneak in a bunch of steps with some weight on my back. I mean,

1257
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:26,360
it's very easy to flow into life. And it's like, if you were, if you know, you're already going to

1258
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:30,920
be walking the dogs, we'll just toss on a pack. And all of a sudden that becomes a lot more

1259
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:36,520
effective. I've got so many friends, uh, uh, and I don't get any kickbacks. I don't know,

1260
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:41,800
I don't know anybody at go ruck. So I, but I, I've sent so many people there. Um, I think we will,

1261
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:47,800
at some point, hopefully do a subscriber discount with, with them because I, you know, I just would

1262
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,680
love to get more and more people doing this. Yeah. They, I've tried a handful of packs for

1263
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:56,760
rucking specifically, and they definitely are my favorite sweater in the book and they've thought

1264
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,480
about it deeply. Yeah. They've got some great content as well. Some great videos and stuff we'll

1265
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:09,800
link to. So, I mean, look, I think this has been such an interesting journey. I, um, as, as I said

1266
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:16,040
too many times before, I think this is just on some level, it's such an obvious thing, right? Like

1267
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:23,160
it's one of those books where you read it and you're like, yeah, of course. But if, if you're,

1268
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:29,880
if it's not pointed out to you, it's really easy to miss how this has happened. Comfort has become

1269
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:35,160
so ubiquitous that I don't think we're aware of it anymore. It's kind of like the David Foster

1270
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:41,880
Wallace, this is water thing that the ubiquity of the water of course creates the irony of the

1271
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:47,720
fish not knowing what water is. And I kind of feel like that's what comfort has become for at least

1272
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:52,200
those of us in the developed world. Yeah, I think so. And I, I also think that sometimes

1273
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:58,200
even if you're pressing against it in one way, there's probably a lot of other ways that you're

1274
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:05,640
not pressing it against it. I have friends that can run 25 miles now if you, if I asked them to,

1275
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:11,720
but if I said, Hey, why don't you sit in silence for 10 minutes? It's like, what? I couldn't handle

1276
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:16,440
that. So there's all these things that we've removed from our lives over time that I think

1277
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:20,200
have a benefit and it is figuring out, well, what are those things, which is why I'm trying to

1278
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:24,440
present in the book. And then how do I intelligently leave them in my life? Because we talked about

1279
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:28,440
earlier, I'm not trying to suggest in any way that we go back to living as hunter gatherers,

1280
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:36,520
like no way. Life today is amazing, but it's how can we use some of those things from the past to

1281
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:42,040
build a better future? Yep, I agree. And it's part of its hunger. You know, I used to do a lot of

1282
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:50,280
fasting. I don't fast as much anymore. But one of the things I loved about fasting was how much I

1283
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:57,960
learned what I could do when I was hungry. You know, I would do sort of seven up to 10 day water

1284
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:04,040
only fasts. Wow. But I'd keep working out hard throughout. And the first couple of times it almost

1285
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:10,840
killed me. I mean, the first, I remember the first time I tried to put myself through serious workouts

1286
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:16,040
during a seven day fast. I mean, I thought I was going to die. Wow. And it's not to suggest that

1287
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:23,160
during those fasts, I was as strong or, you know, my performance was what it was normally. It wasn't,

1288
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:29,080
it never was. But, you know, I just kept, I just couldn't imagine and other things like I remember

1289
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:35,720
going to bed so hungry sometimes thinking I'll never be able to sleep. But yet I did. And you

1290
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:41,400
realize like, of course you did this. There's no way our species would be here if we couldn't figure

1291
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:48,520
out how to do these things when we're hungry, you know, be it sleep or go out and hunt or do

1292
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:54,040
something like that. So, yeah, when you think of all of these forms of discomfort, it can be hunger,

1293
02:02:54,040 --> 02:03:03,400
it can be boredom, it can be a physical challenge. Time in nature. Yeah. It's, to me, that's the

1294
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:09,240
take home is we have we have this incredible privilege and it just comes with a little

1295
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:15,720
responsibility, which is just make sure on a daily basis you are inserting brief windows of

1296
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:21,640
discomfort so that you're never too far from realizing that you're in the water. Yeah.

1297
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:26,040
You said it. In other words, if you're the fish, just make sure you jump out of the water a few

1298
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:32,200
times a day so that you never lose sight of the water you're in. Amen. Yes, sir. Well, you know

1299
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:38,120
what we get to do now? Are we going to go rock? We sure are. Yes. Michael, thanks very much for

1300
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:42,440
coming. I've enjoyed talking about this a lot and I hope everybody picks up the book because

1301
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:46,040
it's fantastic. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Peter. I really enjoyed the conversation and now we get a rock

1302
02:03:46,040 --> 02:04:00,440
and suffer a little bit. And for dinner, elk and access to your awesome. Perfect day.
