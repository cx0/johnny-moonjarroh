00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,720
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,560
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,680
Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of The Drive and Happy New Year to everyone.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,560
We took a week off as you probably noticed, so hopefully everybody's ready to jump back

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,440
into this fun stuff. My guest this week is near Barzillai. And if you're at all into

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,800
the space of longevity, he'll be no stranger to you. Near is the founding director of the

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,520
Institute for Aging Research, the Nathan Schock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology at Albert

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,760
Einstein. He's completed two fellowships, one in metabolism at Yale, the other in endocrinology

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,440
and molecular biology at Cornell. He directs the Longevity Genes Project. And in my estimate,

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,240
Near is probably the most knowledgeable person ever on the genetics of longevity. And we

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,960
talk a ton about that during this episode. He also is leading the effort to test metformin

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,520
in a prospective clinical trial for non diabetics with respect to aging. And this is referred

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,920
to as the TAME trial. We get into that obviously in detail here and also we'll use a lot of

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,720
the data for that in the show notes. This is in many ways, I think Near is probably

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,120
one of the most insightful people when it comes to understanding the clinical benefits

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,480
of metformin. And we talk about that a ton. We also talk about insulin resistance. I can't

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,480
resist the urge, no pun intended, I guess, to get into sort of a detailed discussion on what IR is

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,760
with sort of people who are really deep in this space. We talk a lot about IGF and growth hormone.

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,720
And I got to tell you, this is a topic that you've probably heard me waffle on a little bit because

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm still really kind of on the fence about this relationship of IGF, GH. I think the centenarian

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,360
data point in one direction. I think the epidemiology outside of centenarians point in a different

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,760
direction. And of course, none of this really speaks to the question I get asked constantly,

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,240
which is, do you think administration of growth hormone is beneficial from a lifespan or

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,960
health span perspective? Or do you think it's harmful? And truthfully, I've always leaned

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,240
towards the harmful side, but we get into this in detail and NIR offers some great insights.

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,800
Certainly for me, I was really helped by this process. We do go back and talk about the

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
centenarians. And because I'm in the midst, as some of you know, of writing this book,

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm knee deep on all that literature. And so it was really great to kind of clarify a few things

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
that I think even if you're not steeped in this stuff, you'll find very interesting. And of course,

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
we talk about all of my other favorite topics like autophagy, colorwork restriction. We even get

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,560
into a little bit of the stuff around NAD and nicotinamide riboside and things like that. So

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
overall, I think this is a bit of a technical episode, but not that technical. We've certainly

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,040
done more technical stuff. The show notes will be valuable as always, especially for a show of this

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,320
nature. So with nothing else to add, please welcome to the show NIR Barzilay.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,320
Hey NIR, how are you? I'm terrific. How are you? I'm good. I can't believe not only did you make

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,600
it down here on time, but you made it down here ahead of me at my own place. Nice to stay young.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, this is, I don't know, these days, this weather is so unpleasant, but yeah, you beat me

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,000
here. I was a bit of a bear. It's unpleasant for you because you're in California most of the time.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah, yeah, I think that's part of it, but you're from Israel, so this has to be unpleasant for you

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,640
too. Israel was too warm for me. I'm okay. Got it. Well, speaking of which, so you were born in Israel,

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,400
you spent how long there? Did you serve military time there? Yes, I served military time. I was

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,960
a nurse and a medical student. I went to the Technion Medical School. I went then to Hadassah

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:28,480
Hospital for residency, which I finished. And only then I came to the United States. I was

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,160
at Yale with Ralph DeFranzo doing metabolism. Actually, I was looking at the mechanism of

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,600
action of metformin in 1987 before it was approved for use in the United States. There's a

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
serendipitous connection to that later. And then I went to Cornell for an endocrine fellowship,

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,560
and then I was recruited to Einstein. And so my first part of my life was metabolism, but then

53
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,240
I started doing what I really was interested in, and this is aging and the biology of aging.

54
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,080
And I remember reading a quote once from you that said, maybe paraphrasing, but metformin is

55
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,480
the reason I came to the United States. Well, in a way it was, but this is life in retrospect,

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,120
right? I wasn't really expecting. I was done with metformin in 1988. I was done with metformin

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,360
until it started again about three, four years ago. Well, I can't wait to talk about metformin

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,520
because they're probably, I'm trying to think, if I think of four or five exogenous molecules,

59
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,880
which is just the terminology I use to describe anything that you ingest or take that comes from

60
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,200
outside the body. So I would include drugs, supplements, hormones, anything in there. But

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,000
when you lump all of these things together, if I were to say what are the three or four of these

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,400
that I am asked about the most frequently from patients, or frankly anybody, if I'm at a party

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,760
and I let it slide what I do for a living, the first question is, should I be taking metformin?

64
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,880
And there's usually a handful of others that they want to know about. Should I be taking

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,480
nicotinamide riboside? Although they usually don't say that. They usually say, should I be

66
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,280
taking NAD or something to that effect? So it's wonderful that we will be able to speak today

67
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,480
because few people can speak about metformin the way you can. And so I'm really looking forward

68
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,320
to that. But before we go down that path, I do still want to kind of understand a little bit

69
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,320
more about your journey and your interest in endocrinology. Did you know from day one,

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,400
when you entered the field of medicine, that this was the area that you wanted to study?

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,680
Yes. I was interested in aging from the time I was pretty much 13 and spent

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:46,000
weekends with my grandfather who was telling me his life story. And his life story wasn't easy.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,080
And he did lots of physical things and he dried the swamp and he did this and that.

74
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:01,600
And I'm looking at the man who was then 68 years old that walks slowly, his obese white hair,

75
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,160
and he just didn't look like somebody who did everything he told me to do. And they say that

76
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,600
children have imagination, but most kids don't see their grandparents as what they will be.

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,600
They see them as, I don't know how they got there. And this really stuck with me. And I started to be

78
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,360
interested in the biology of aging. For example, when I did my residency, I always was interested

79
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,720
in how, not what's the age of the patient, but does he look older or younger than his age? I

80
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,280
kind of realized intuitively that there's a chronological age and a biological age. And

81
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,280
what is this differences between the biological and chronological age? And of course, as a physician,

82
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,440
it looked like endocrine is a good place to start because you knew that there's a lot of

83
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,280
endocrinology in aging and you assumed that hormones are going down or some are going up,

84
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,000
but if you could fix that, maybe you could fix a lot of aging. Now, everything that happened in

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
my life was fascinating from the biology of aging. Replacing the hormones wasn't really

86
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,960
part of it, but we'll get to it. Going back to the hormone thread, the most obvious example of

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,280
changes in hormones with aging, of course, occur in women where they have this very abrupt change

88
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,800
in one of their endocrine systems, this androgen system. Did you think about it even more broadly

89
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
than that? For example, what was happening in thyroid hormone and what was happening in

90
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,160
fuel partitioning hormones and other things like that? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. But I'll tell

91
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,040
you to the point when there was a discussion whether to do the women health initiative,

92
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,680
many people thought this is a waste of time. We know that estrogen is good for women.

93
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,160
There's lots of studies like that. Of course, it's major in aging. I didn't look at this simply

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,640
for maybe two reasons. One is men are also aging and in several ways similar to women.

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,560
That's not an estrogen story. The testosterone decrease wasn't really as dramatic as the

96
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,640
estrogen decrease. I thought that there's a lot of aging that's done without estrogen. Let's

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,080
start with that. Also, you're replacing just one hormone with lots of hormones are changing. It

98
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,760
didn't look like a good study to me. Well, especially at the time, and I try to temper

99
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
my criticism for that study by trying to have some empathy for the fact that the investigators were

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,400
dealing with what the treatment protocols were at the time, but to use oral estrogen that's

101
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,040
conjugated equine to use synthetic progestin and not even actual progesterone. You could come up

102
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,600
with a list of 18 things that in retrospect are so obvious why that study was a failure.

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,520
Absolutely true. But the other part of that is that the way to show effect of estrogen in animal

104
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:15,680
models was to take their ovaries out and give them estrogen. Then you could do lots of provocation.

105
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,880
It was good. So estrogen is a good hormone on a young body. But then there were studies that were

106
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,200
hardly published, but I was aware of them, of taking old animal. So you could take the young

107
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
animals in just one center in Houston. They did it. You took the young animal. You took their ovaries

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,280
out. You gave them estrogen and you employed a stroke model. And when you gave estrogen,

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,880
the stroke was smaller and everything. When you did the same in older animals,

110
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,960
the stroke became worse. Okay. And they couldn't publish it for a while because they said, well,

111
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,320
it's old animals. So they have other diseases or other things, but every experiment that had

112
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,280
estrogen in old model was the opposite. Not only that it didn't affect, it was the opposite,

113
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,800
which what happened to the WHI in a certain ways. Yeah. Although I still think that it was probably

114
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,920
the breast cancer that garnered the most headline in the WHI. And actually that's an interesting

115
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,200
topic, which I'll be going into in great depth on another episode. There's a great book that just

116
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,320
came out that tackles this, that goes through the history of the WHI. At what point, well,

117
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,840
let's go back to the metformin thing actually. So it's 1987 and you're thinking like, okay,

118
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,760
metformin is the next line of agent we will use to treat type two diabetes. So metformin was

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,560
already in clinical practice in Europe. Is that correct? Oh, correct. For many years. How many

120
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,960
years? Like 20 or 30 years? So metformin few years ago was 60 years. So we're talking about

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,720
1950 or something, 1950, 1960. When I was in Israel, I prescribed metformin. That was the first line

122
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
for type two diabetes. What took so long for it to come to the US?

123
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,960
That's a terrible story that still continues. The FDA said, we don't know, we don't know that

124
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,240
metformin is going to be effective in the population in the United States. So you have to do the studies.

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,080
And it was Bristol Meyer really that got to do the studies. And basically they had to do a phase three

126
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:35,760
study again to show that metformin is effective as sulfonylurea as an indication for type two diabetes.

127
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:47,440
And if even then the idea was that it will be good only in obese people, which happened not to matter

128
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,920
much because all the type two diabetes in the United States were obese, but it was really

129
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:01,280
a matter of regulation. And part of having regulation was that the FDA asked more

130
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,600
studies to understand the mechanism of aging and metformin. And in a certain way, maybe they are

131
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,360
right because metformin mechanism of action is really complicated. And I'm not sure that today,

132
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,000
as a new drug, it would be approved. Interesting. Where do you think it would fail in safety or

133
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,240
efficacy? No, it's not in mechanism. In the inability to elucidate the mechanism. Right.

134
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,840
When you come to the FDA and you say, you know, we've done that and we've done this in animal and

135
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,080
we've done this in cells, and you're trying to show what is the major mechanism of action,

136
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,240
you would have failed. So what I showed in humans is that metformin targets,

137
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,760
a patiglucose production or the insulin sensitivity of the liver. And that's the major mechanism of

138
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,000
action. Unlike, for example, sulfonylurea that increase insulin secretion, right? Or TZDs that

139
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,320
increase the insulin sensitivity in the muscle more than in the liver. So this was a mechanism

140
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,520
that you could pack to the FDA, but it's really not the intracellular mechanism of metformin.

141
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,880
So at the time, was it understood what metformin's activity was on complex one of the mitochondria?

142
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:28,560
No, not really. This came later. I don't know what year, but it came later. It came when the

143
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,360
seahorses essays were developed to show really which mitochondria in which pathway of

144
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,200
mitochondria you have changes. Maybe for the listener, explain what a seahorse assay is.

145
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,280
A seahorse assay is an assay to look at mitochondrial action, whether you extract

146
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:55,200
mitochondria or even tissues. It really shows some relationship between oxygen consumption

147
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:04,560
in relationship to polarity. And it's very sensitive to look at some of the effects of

148
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,920
drugs that are interfering with mitochondria action or decreased mitochondrial activity.

149
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
It's almost like the indirect calorimetry of the mitochondria.

150
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,120
Right, right. Indirect because it's a provocative test for me. So yes.

151
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,040
Metformin was discovered from a plant as well, correct?

152
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
Right. It's a French lily.

153
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,640
And it was first lily, obviously. And this was discovered in the 40s or 50s?

154
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,720
Correct. The first thing that happened, there was a drug by the name of Fenformin,

155
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
a cousin of metformin.

156
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Which apparently is much more potent.

157
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,920
It's much more potent because unlike metformin, it doesn't need a transporter to get into the

158
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:52,960
cells. On the other hand, it was associated with a lot of lactic acidosis. And it was considered

159
00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:02,000
unsafe eventually. And then metformin was a safer part with much less of a lactic acidosis side

160
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
effects.

161
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,400
What is the mechanism by which metformin cause lactic acidosis? Because

162
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,360
in all the use I've seen of metformin clinically, I've never seen a case of it,

163
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,960
which is not to say it doesn't happen. I'm sure it does. And you could stack risks by

164
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,000
taking someone with renal insufficiency, giving them contrast and tons of metformin.

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,560
But in medical school, this was like the board question you got asked every single test.

166
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,320
What do you have to worry about with lactic acidosis? What's the putative mechanism by

167
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
which that happens?

168
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,440
So first of all, I would tell you that in my study in the 80s,

169
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,200
every patient that we gave metformin had an increase in lactic acid.

170
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,120
From what to what in millimolar?

171
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,720
Within the normal range. So if it's two was the...

172
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Yeah, the cutoff.

173
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:56,800
The cutoff. So it was between went from 1.5 towards the two and sometimes even went over the two.

174
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,040
But it wasn't really anything associated with that acidosis.

175
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,640
And there was no change in pH?

176
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,680
No. No. No onion gap, not anything like that. And it probably has to do, I don't know that I can

177
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,680
tell you for sure, but it has to do with what happens when complex one, part of the metabolic

178
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,880
effect when complex one is inhibited. But there's lots of speculation and I don't really care

179
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:32,320
to comment on that. But I think what became clear, we call it endocrinology, it's called

180
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,080
it MALLA. It's metformin-associated lactic acidosis. In other words, we moved away

181
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,040
from metformin causing lactic acidosis to the association because it's, if anywhere,

182
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,880
it described more in people that have kidney failures or have heart attacks or something

183
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,200
and had lactic acidosis and were on metformin too. And that was kind of the association, but

184
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,960
it's not clear to me that there are truly people who develop lactic acidosis from metformin

185
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,640
that is just because of metformin and not associated with something else.

186
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm glad to hear you say that. That's sort of generally been my bias, but I'm happy to be

187
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,560
corrected if that bias is incorrect. But yeah, I've always thought that frankly, so many of the

188
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,560
drugs that we're really interested in now as we look back from an aging perspective, whether it

189
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,480
be metformin or rapamycin, so many of the negative side effects that people typically associate with

190
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
those drugs are very difficult to isolate from the patients in whom those drugs have historically

191
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,360
been given. And so it's nice to hear that MALLA is now being generally recognized as an alternative

192
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,400
viewpoint to that. You know, metformin is to me an interesting drug from a diabetic standpoint,

193
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,360
because, and I don't know that this was appreciated in the 80s. In fact, I would suspect it was not,

194
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,200
because there's really two macro strategies for improving type 2 diabetes. You can, obviously,

195
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,880
the highest goal is to control glucose levels, so to regulate the degree of glucose in the blood.

196
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,040
But you can do that through, at the highest level, two ways. You could increase insulin,

197
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,120
either exogenously or through increased insulin production pharmacologically,

198
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,960
or you could reduce glucose. And of course, metformin falls into the latter category of that,

199
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,680
or increasing muscle insulin sensitivity to enhance glucose disposal. Today, it's generally

200
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,120
regarded that while both strategies will have an equal benefit on the microvascular, the glucose

201
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,200
lowering by insulin lowering, so the less glucose production strategy, has a superior effect on the

202
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,840
macrovascular. And therefore, metformin would be a better alternative to, for example, a drug

203
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,400
that's going to increase insulin production out of the pancreas. Was it appreciated at the time,

204
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,120
meaning when you were doing this in the late 80s, how potentially beneficial this drug was?

205
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,640
Well, at that time in the United States, it was all about insulin resistance. You know,

206
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,760
people like Jerry Reven, Ralph DeFranzo, the people at the NIH, Ron Kahn, were all, you know,

207
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,040
discovering the insulin receptor, discovering insulin resistance, discovering the association

208
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,760
of insulin resistance with the metabolic syndrome. So it was all, we all had the bias that the major

209
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,160
problem with type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. And you know, we know now that it's a total

210
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,560
collaboration. Yeah, you increase insulin resistance and the pancreas have to secrete more

211
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,080
insulin. And we humans, at least in the condition of our environment, obesity, everything,

212
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,160
many of us, I would say 40% cannot deal with that. And we become diabetic. There is this

213
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,000
startling curve of the pancreas, you know, like for the heart, that you increase insulin

214
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,560
secretion and at some point you cannot increase insulin secretion, you become diabetic and then

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,120
insulin secretion decrease. And so insulin resistance was a major way and that's why

216
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:19,280
metformin was a good place to come with, you know, at least it affects mainly the hepatic glucose

217
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,360
production rather than the muscle. Although I have to tell you in vitro on muscle specimen,

218
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,640
it's an insulin sensitizer in the muscle too. Let's talk about this idea of insulin resistance.

219
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
I think there are a few terms that leave me scratching my head more than that one. So this

220
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,880
is an example of something where maybe five years ago I thought I really knew what insulin resistance

221
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,080
was. And I think today I'm pretty sure I don't know what it is in the sense that when you take

222
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,720
the typical phenotype of someone who's insulin resistant, what do they look like biochemically

223
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,240
and anthropomorphologically, right? So they're hyperinsulinemic, they have elevated levels of

224
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,240
glucose, they probably have some degree of obesity or adiposity. So what does that mean?

225
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Because clearly their fat cell is quite sensitive to insulin. If the fat cell ever became resistant

226
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:16,240
to insulin, you could not reesterify fatty acids and you would have an endless stream of lipolysis

227
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,800
exiting fatty acids from the fat cell. So you'd actually be quite lean. There's something going

228
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,200
on in the muscle that clearly is resistant to the effect of insulin, but of course there are both

229
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,320
insulin dependent and insulin independent means by which we can dispose of glucose. And this is

230
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,560
where, coming back to what you said a moment ago, I actually wanted to ask you that question,

231
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:43,200
which is, we'll park it, but the question was, does metformin participate in the AMPK driven insulin

232
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,760
independent modality of glucose disposal? You're nodding, so I think that's a yes and we'll come

233
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,880
back to it. And then there's the liver. And this is the one to me that is the most complicated and

234
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,320
the one I'd like to begin with. So before I ask you to elaborate on the specifically what is

235
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,760
meant by insulin resistance in the liver, am I a complete moron for not understanding this?

236
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,600
No, but can I make it a little bit more interesting even because I need to bring it to aging. Yes.

237
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,920
I would love to talk about diabetes, but let me just put up front. I'm not sure that the diabetes

238
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,880
property of metformin are really the aging properties of metformin. Okay. This is my

239
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:33,120
provocation. But let me go back to insulin resistant because in 1997, a science paper appeared

240
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:41,600
that made it the best day of my life and the worst day of my life. Okay. What was the paper? The

241
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:50,800
paper was taking a nematode, okay, so a primitive model, decreasing the insulin sensitivity.

242
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,920
This is known as the DAF2 model. And when you do that, the nematode accumulates fat

243
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,360
in their intestinal cells. So they are becoming visceral obese and they live several times longer.

244
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,800
So why is it the best day in my life? Because you could with one genetic manipulation

245
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:21,280
extends lifespan significantly. That meant going from hope, actually from nothing from-

246
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,320
Was this Cynthia's paper?

247
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,720
No, that's Gary Rufkin. But at the same time, Cynthia had their DAF16. Tom Johnson had the

248
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,160
age one model. There are several papers that came and all of them said, hey, we can change

249
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,360
lifespan. And the example was always insulin sensitive.

250
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,160
And this mutation, to be clear, because between DAF2, DAF16, and the dietary manipulations,

251
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,600
there are several permutations of that C. elegans model. But just to make sure I know which paper

252
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,960
we're talking about, this was only attenuation of DAF2, nothing to DAF16 and nothing to dietary

253
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,240
change. Right, right. Can you just, for the listener, define what is the analog of DAF2,

254
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:12,480
DAF16 in us? DAF2 is the insulin receptor and DAF16 is the Foxo transcription factor.

255
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,400
But the point is, at that time- Yeah, you took a worm that normally lives two weeks and you

256
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,720
turned down its insulin receptor slightly, not off, correct? Right, right. But you made

257
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,520
it insulin resistant and it was accumulating fat. And what was I bringing in to the field?

258
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,040
I was saying the major reason for aging is this insulin resistance syndrome. And the main part

259
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:48,960
of the insulin resistance is accumulation of visceral fat. And so the premise was good.

260
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,640
The example was disaster to me. I had the JCI paper at that time in press, really showing with

261
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,160
MRI pictures how caloric restriction decreases the visceral fat. I was talking about the

262
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,760
biology of those fat and stuff. And it was a major paradox for us in the field and how we continue

263
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,800
if we're saying insulin resistance is good for longevity and everybody in diabetes knew that

264
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:22,960
this is a disaster. Why am I telling you that? Because I learned later, I was thinking later on

265
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,520
experiments that I've done. Oh, so first of all, the experiment that I've done that was very

266
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,920
conclusive was I took a bunch of rats, 150 actually, and all of them underwent surgery

267
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:44,080
after puberty. In some of them, I removed their visceral fat depots by surgery. And in the other,

268
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,200
it was a sham procedure. So I just moved it but didn't remove it. And we had three groups in the

269
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,560
experiment. One was ad libidum feeding. The second was caloric restriction. This is the control.

270
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:05,040
They would leave 40% better. And the third group was ad libidum feeding of the rats that their

271
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,360
visceral fat was removed. And I said, without the visceral fat, even with nutrients, they live

272
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,360
longer. And they actually lived significantly longer than ad libidum by 20%, but not as much

273
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,560
as the caloric restriction. So just to make sure I understand, you had a two to one ratio of your

274
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,640
animals because you had- No, I had three groups. Three groups, but one of them was all ad lib feeding

275
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,160
of the visceral fat removed. That was- Right. And then of the ones that had sham surgery,

276
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,880
they were randomized to ad lib versus CR. Correct. It really showed that visceral fat,

277
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,360
the removal of visceral fat had major effect. And when the animals who had the visceral fat removed

278
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,520
were autopsied or whatever the word is for rat autopsies, had they figured out a way to

279
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,040
reaccumulate visceral fat or where had they accumulated fat? No. In fact, when you do this

280
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,240
procedure after puberty, if you do it before puberty, they accumulate visceral fat. Otherwise,

281
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,960
they don't accumulate much visceral fat. Did they have changes in subcutaneous fat?

282
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,000
That's a good question. Mice have it when you do it and rats do not. What did they ultimately

283
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,520
succumb to? They all die from the same thing only at different times. Which is what, cancer? Yeah.

284
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,040
It was sprig doling. So kidney disease and cancers were the leading cause of death.

285
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,960
So you basically got half the benefit of CR by doing this operation.

286
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,160
By eating ad libidum, but without visceral fat. Yeah.

287
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,400
So you understand it's very- Sorry, one other question here. Was there any change in their

288
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,120
health span or their spryness? Yes. There was a health span. In fact, what happened to the ad libidum,

289
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:51,040
ad libidum starts losing weight at the end of their life. And the ad libidum with visceral fat

290
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,200
have still gained weight after the others. It was a significant change in weight. And then there's

291
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,240
a whole health span, their insulin levels and other things that we've done in parlors. So they

292
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,120
were healthy and they were healthier for longer, which is kind of the experiments that we do

293
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,360
with animal models. Is it possible to take one of those rats

294
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,560
and either through caloric restriction or other dietary restriction, get it to puberty to the

295
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,840
point at where you did the surgery, but without any visceral fat. And then ask the question,

296
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,880
if they've gone through that period of development without developing visceral fat, do they have

297
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,840
somehow protection from the diseases that come even if you feed them ad libidum thereafter?

298
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:42,160
So we did this experiment in Zuker fat animal, Zuker diabetes animal, and we took their visceral

299
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,760
fat. Tell people what the Zuker rat looks like. So the Zuker rats are rats that are really,

300
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,480
really, really obese, hungry all the time. So they have hyperphasia. They can't stop eating. Right.

301
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,400
Because they don't have the leptin receptor. So they are hungry all the time. And they're

302
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,920
nasty because you try to come close to them. They think your finger is food. So they're eating

303
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,600
all the time. And we did surgery on them before puberty because they became obese really much

304
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:20,800
before puberty. And what happened is by six months, they all become diabetics. Our animals up to four

305
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,080
months did not become diabetic. And then between four and six, they became diabetic, although we

306
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,040
took their visceral fat. But what we found out that 80% of the visceral fat grew back. So we

307
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,840
actually had the perfect experiment. As long as they didn't have visceral fat, they didn't develop

308
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,880
diabetes. Once they got the visceral fat, they developed diabetes. But I want to make. And sorry,

309
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,800
one other thing. If you took that group and who already developed diabetes with visceral fat,

310
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,320
and you just removed the visceral fat, can you reverse the diabetes? No, I we've never done

311
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,120
this experiment. Don't know. Because we're interested in aging. But I'm telling you all

312
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,880
that to make one point because so far, the paradox just got worse, right? The nematodes with insulin

313
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,320
resistant visceral fat leaves longer. And we showed that mammalian's live longer if you take

314
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,200
this visceral fat and make them insulin sensitive. Whenever we take visceral fat, we make them more

315
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:27,600
insulin sensitive. Okay. Until I realized one thing, it takes me a few hours to make red insulin

316
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,080
resistant. I give them glucose, I give them free fatty acid, I give them some other things, I can

317
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,520
make them insulin resistance very rapidly. So at first, I used it as you see, we can do the chronic

318
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,960
insulin resistant in a few hours. Okay, you just load them with nutrients, you become insulin

319
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,280
resistant. But then I thought of the aging part. When you get glucose to the muscle, the glucose

320
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,600
goes into the muscle. If you're not moving the muscle, it's not going to turn more glucose to

321
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,920
energy, it will switch from free fatty acid to glucose, but there's no more glucose burning.

322
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,000
So it goes to glycogen, right? And it goes to glycogen, but you keep on putting glucose in the

323
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,720
muscle. And there's just so much glycogen that the muscle can store. So the muscle has to become

324
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,640
insulin resistance. Okay, it's a protective mechanism. There's no evidence that the muscle

325
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,600
can in any way, shape or form undergo de novo lipogenesis and create any of the fatty acid,

326
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,040
is there? To create any of the fatty, let's say, no, not there any evidence that muscle can carry

327
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,840
out the novo lipogenesis. I don't think so. I don't think so. I'll have to think because I

328
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:49,120
have a different, I have to think about it. But the point is, okay, I understand your point. I

329
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
don't think if anything, there's no much. The glucose, the muscle tells the glucose, you go

330
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,920
somewhere else, you go to fat. Okay. So the only organ that can take in completely excess amount

331
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,040
of glucose in the end has to be the liver because it at least has the capacity to turn excess glucose

332
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,760
into fat. Whereas all of the other organs are going to be saturated. That's true. And that's

333
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,760
part of, I think where the glucose is going. Okay. To fat and to liver. Okay. So what am I telling you?

334
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,880
I'm saying that insulin resistance is a protective mechanism. It's a modulator. It's a stress response.

335
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,960
It's something. So now I understand why a stress response mechanism in one animal caused them to

336
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:40,000
live longer. And in another animal, it's a pain in the butt. So I went and I wrote this review with

337
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,920
Luigi Ferrucci. I wrote this review where we took all the animals that had problems with their

338
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:55,360
insulin sensitivity, the animals that are insulin resistance and live longer and the animals with

339
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,760
insulin sensitivity that live shorter. And there's a huge list of it. Rapamycin is an example, right?

340
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Rapamycin causes insulin resistance and the animals is the best intervention in rodents.

341
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,120
There's a PTP1, a transgenic animals. It's very insulin sensitivity and it has half the lifespan

342
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,880
the lifespan of a wild type animal. When you say insulin resistant or insulin sensitive, are you

343
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,840
always referring to muscle? Are you referring to liver? How are you defining them? Well, in this

344
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:33,760
sense, it was everything. It was IRS, for example, IRS one, IRS two knockout, some of them only in

345
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,680
the brain. So it was really insulin resistance everywhere. Is IRS one found in the muscle and

346
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,600
not the liver? No, IRS one and IRS two are everywhere, but IRS two is more in liver.

347
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, they sort of have selective expressions. Right. Right. Yeah. So I'll just translate

348
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,080
IRS one insulin receptor substrate. So let's talk about exactly how the muscle takes in glucose.

349
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,280
So we are walking around. If I bolus you with glucose right now and your blood glucose rises

350
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,880
from wherever it is right now, 90 to 200, let's say I give you an enormous bolus of glucose,

351
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,600
I double it. So you're up to 180 milligrams per deciliter. This is a very high screaming high

352
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,080
level, which by the way, only amounts to an extra few grams of glucose. But nevertheless,

353
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,600
what is the chain of events that leads to insulin being secreted and the muscle ultimately disposing

354
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,600
of that glucose both actively or passively? Well, there'll be obviously a secretion to insulin

355
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,560
that's relative to your glucose level. So the beta cell is the sensor and outcomes insulin. And now

356
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,760
what is insulin doing to the muscle? And insulin through the insulin receptor will get translocation

357
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,080
of the glute for those are the glucose transporters that are the major glucose transporters in muscle.

358
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,040
It will go from an intracellular pool into the plasma membrane, integrated and starts getting

359
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,840
glucose like crazy into the cell. And that happens quite passively, meaning once the glute for

360
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,120
transporter is translocated across the cell membrane, glucose can passively rush in. Correct.

361
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,080
It doesn't require ATP to bring it in against a gradient of any sort. Correct. And in fact,

362
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,920
it has its own intrinsic activity that's not the energy dependent. So it can go faster or slower by

363
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,120
different ways. Now, is there another method by which without insulin, we can get glucose into

364
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:40,000
a cell that somehow relies on AMP kinase? Not on AMP kinase, but there's non-insulin mediated

365
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,440
glucose uptake. In other words, there's a way for glucose to get up without the insulin. And we know

366
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,840
that from hyperglycemic clamp and from other things that when we can move the insulin or keep

367
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,680
insulin level at basal and still there's a substantial glucose uptake that's happening.

368
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,560
So yeah, we know that. What's the mechanism of that? I'm not sure I know. It also seems to be

369
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,760
enhanced by exercise. That's true. That's true. This ninja is the non-insulin mediated glucose uptake

370
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,040
is something that is exercise dependent too. And it seems to. That's why now I understand your

371
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,520
question. Is AMP kinase part of the day? And I don't know that. Yeah. I only have one patient

372
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:29,520
in my practice who has type one diabetes, but he is such an interesting patient because of his

373
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,680
incredibly strict dietary control and his unbelievable appetite for exercise. And

374
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,280
I've never seen a higher level of adiponectin in a human. I've never seen a higher level of sex,

375
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,800
hormone binding globulin in a human, which are basically and we know how much insulin he has

376
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,400
because he injects it and he injects so little insulin into himself and yet can seem to, you

377
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,680
know, he has a hemoglobin A1C below six using six to eight units of insulin a day. And so what got

378
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,560
me, that's what got me very interested in this non-insulin dependent glucose uptake. Yeah. I'm

379
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,120
not doing this research anymore. I used to be in front of that. I glucose itself can modulate

380
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,520
glucokinase activity in the liver. There's a lot of things that happening. And of course, there's

381
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,680
coordination between the fat and the liver. And then I started being interested because we can

382
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,640
do things to the hypothalamus and take over this insulin and muscle and fat and liver. We can do

383
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,480
it all from the brain. Isn't that amazing? Well, just because I'm so fascinated by this, and I

384
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,320
think it will help the listener to understand the complexity of what you just said. If I took an

385
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,720
animal and put a lesion into the ventral part of the hypothalamus, a normal animal, what could that

386
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,720
do? What would that change about its metabolism? Well, that would increase basically food intake

387
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,120
and change a lot of the peripheral physiology, but we do basically the opposite. We give

388
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:15,040
insulin to the hypothalamus or glucose or IGF or leptin. Okay. And then we see what happens to the

389
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,160
peripheral. During the periphery, those hormone levels are not increasing at all. And not only

390
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,720
that, the liver is a good target to follow because what you can do with the liver, you can do

391
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,960
selective hepatic vagotomy. And everything that you did through the brain doesn't work anymore

392
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,840
because it needs the nerves. Right. So I'll explain to the listener what that means. So the vagus

393
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,840
nerve connects the body through this parasympathetic system. And of course, if a patient has a liver

394
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,760
transplant, or if you do an operation where you sever the vagus nerve, you sever that connection

395
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,800
between the central nervous system and the periphery. Correct. And so we can do it experimentally

396
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,960
and it will help us see if it really- How much of it is vaguely mediated versus not? Or yeah,

397
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,360
or more nerve only. It's the nerves because we do, it's not only vagotomy, we do a little bit

398
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,200
adrenergic too, but it's through the nerves and not through a chemical reaction on the liver.

399
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:21,040
You see, this is the problem with metabolism near. The more I go into it, the less I know. It drives

400
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,320
me nuts. My absolute knowledge increases incrementally and my relative knowledge falls

401
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,000
precipitously. Well, I think I realized that you know what to ask. So you're undermining your own

402
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,760
abilities, but it's really the integrative metabolism is really very confusing to explain.

403
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,480
So we will define insulin resistance at the muscle, whether it be from an aged phenotype

404
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,880
or a diabetic phenotype as a scenario under which a fixed amount of insulin hitting the insulin

405
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,320
receptor produces fewer Glut4 transporters. Is that a fair definition? Well, the definition of

406
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:10,080
insulin resistance is really different and very simple. It's all about the glucose uptake in the

407
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:18,960
muscle really. It's all about the ability of insulin to clear glucose. That's the only way

408
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,120
we define clinically insulin resistance, although that totally misses the point because those

409
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,880
insulin levels have different effects on different tissue. But for us, the insulin

410
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,960
sensitivity is totally related to the glucose uptake. So let me give you an example. So when I

411
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,760
use an oral glucose tolerance test with my patients, I'm a bit of a stickler. So if they take their 75

412
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,920
grams of Glucola, I measure their glucose and insulin at baseline, administer the Glucola 30

413
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,560
minutes later, 60 minutes later, 90 minutes later, and if I'm feeling aggressive, 120 minutes later,

414
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,440
we re-measure the glucose, the insulin and the FFA, and maybe even the C-peptide. But for

415
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,640
simplifying it, just the glucose and insulin. So let's assume you have two patients who start

416
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,720
out with a fasting glucose of 90 milligrams per deciliter and insulin I use of six.

417
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,560
They both get their 75 of Glucola. And let's again, simplify this by just looking at one

418
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,600
hour. What happens? Both of them at one hour have a rise of glucose from 90 to 130 milligrams per

419
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,720
deciliter. One of them did so with a rise of insulin from six to 20. The other did it with

420
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,720
a rise of insulin from six to 90. They've both disposed of glucose with equal magnitude.

421
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,200
Would you describe them both as equally insulin sensitive? It's a little bit complicated. You know,

422
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:56,000
first of all, so let me just say for aging, 120 is not enough. In elderly, the glucose tolerance

423
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,440
goes. So the rise in insulin is changing throughout normal physiology and throughout individuals.

424
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,800
And you might have missed some of the insulin peaks earlier on or later on.

425
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah. Looking at 30 versus 90 is a big insight. And you're right. I mean, Joseph Kraft, who is a

426
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,360
pathologist, who has done a lot of work on this, he samples to five hours. Now, again, clinically,

427
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,800
that's challenging in the regular day to day practice, but in the laboratory, that's feasible.

428
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,160
And you're right. You can see so much happening beyond that. But I tried to pick an example that

429
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,040
was as egregious enough in its difference that what I'm trying to get is the difference in

430
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,280
hyperinsulinemia and whether that factors into how we think about insulin resistance.

431
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,800
Right. No, I don't think the clinical world is thinking like that. So I'm actually an active

432
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,240
endocrinologist. I still see on Thursdays if I'm in town teaching fellows in diabetes clinic in

433
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,840
one of your hospital. So I am involved very much in this field. And I'll tell you

434
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,200
that we rarely measure insulin in any of our patients, but that's not really your patients.

435
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,360
Okay. I'm talking about what's the use of measuring insulin in type 2 diabetic patients.

436
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,280
So it's a different issue. But yeah, this sounds like there's a different insulin response

437
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,960
to lower the glucose to the same extent.

438
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Because the hypothesis would be that the patient with hyperinsulinemia

439
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,920
is now demonstrating. I mean, that's basically a harbinger of the first one who's going to

440
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,280
struggle with glucose disposal. That would be my hypothesis is the one who needed 90 units of

441
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,680
insulin to dispose of glucose with the same efficacy as the person who needed 30 is sooner

442
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
rather than later going to have a harder time disposing of glucose.

443
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:00,080
Well, you know, there is another possibility that those are the people who get other diseases for

444
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,280
a slayer like heart attacks or stroke. In other words, their insulin resistance

445
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:14,160
will affect a lot the way they do the aterosclerotic plaque and, you know, this hyperinsulinemia on

446
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,880
organs that might not be insulin resistant even, right? On cells that not coming in.

447
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,200
So I would say that they could either the one who become diabetic or the one who are going to get

448
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,360
microvascular disease much faster.

449
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,280
Which brings it right back to our observation of glucose versus insulin,

450
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,960
micro versus macular vasculature. That's a very good point. So how does insulin

451
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,840
signaling work to get glucose into the liver?

452
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:46,160
The liver has a different glucose transporters, the GLUT2, that is not translocated.

453
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,960
And that is the major way by glucose gets into the liver.

454
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,800
So it's a little bit different, but it's not stimulated the same.

455
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,920
So it's constitutively expressed across the membrane.

456
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,160
It's not stimulated really by insulin as much.

457
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,800
So it's more gradient driven to get the glucose from the circulation into the liver.

458
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,240
Yes. And that's where the portal blood is. So there it's very sensitive to the

459
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,360
increasing glucose concentrations.

460
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,320
Well, that's very interesting because it's certainly, I mean, there's lots of evolutionary

461
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,560
reasons why that would be a fail safe, right? Given the importance of, you would never,

462
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:31,520
ever want the liver to be denied glucose, given that if you ever shut down the liver's ability

463
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,440
to make glucose, by my calculation, you could live about six minutes.

464
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,480
Yeah. Look, I was an intern of Sheila Sherlok. She's named Sheila Sherlok in England and a

465
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,760
Royal Free Hospital, very non hepatologist. And she asked a group of us, what's the main

466
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,080
role of the liver? And I raised my hand and I said, it's to produce glucose.

467
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,360
That would be my answer by the way.

468
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,200
And everybody laughed at me and she threw chalks at them and stuff. And she said,

469
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,200
just a minute. Why are you saying that? I said, because if you take the liver out and clamp

470
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,880
the vessels, the guy will die from hypoglycemia, which is absolutely true.

471
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,120
Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, maybe it's just because I'm in the midst of writing this chapter

472
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:17,280
for my book about the liver. But I literally yesterday I sat here in my room and penned out

473
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,480
the calculation of 180 pound person with blood glucose of 180 milligrams per deciliter,

474
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,080
clamp the liver, how many minutes until they die? It's about four under those, under those

475
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,720
conditions. Can you imagine that? Think about like what this beautiful organ has to do.

476
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:42,240
But you know, another thing to consider in your example, right? So for example, elderly

477
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,920
have enough insulin to suppress glucose production. Glucose production is easier to suppress

478
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,480
than it's suppressing lower level of insulin than stimulating glucose,

479
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,960
uptaking the muscle. The liver is more sensitive than the muscle. And so elderly have the ability

480
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,400
to suppress a particular glucose production because they have enough of insulin to do that.

481
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,880
But when you start giving them food during the day, they fail and they become glucose

482
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,440
intolerance and diabetic. They might have diabetes, although their basal level are well,

483
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,080
just because of this enough insulin to suppress glucose production and not enough

484
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,080
to increase glucose uptake. So the sensitivity of the tissues to insulin is really part

485
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,000
of what you're describing. If you look at the basal, it's very different when you look at stinging.

486
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,680
Yes, the challenge. That's such a great point. And I won't go down that rabbit hole anymore

487
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,000
because I would love to, but there's so many other things I want to talk about near. Let's

488
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:58,720
go back to metformin and let's do it now through the context of an anti-aging drug. So there's

489
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,080
going to be some people listening to this who already know everything about you. If for no

490
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,960
other reason than the efforts you've put into tame, obviously I want to have plenty of time

491
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,560
to talk about that, but let's back up for a moment. Tell me when you first realized,

492
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,320
Hey, this metformin drug that I worked on 30 years ago, it's not just a great drug for people with

493
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,600
diabetes. This could actually be a drug that helps someone without diabetes live longer.

494
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,600
What was that epiphany for you? So first of all, there were studies on the biology of aging

495
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,040
in rodents and the first guy, which I'll be embarrassed now to forget, he's a guy from

496
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:46,080
Leningrad that was the first to say, I've done a rodent studies and animals with metformin

497
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,240
Anatoly. I'll remember it maybe later. And he showed that a life extension

498
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,280
increases in variety of animals to which he gave metformin. That led to some studies.

499
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,520
What was his hypothesis? Do you remember? What drove him to do that?

500
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:12,480
There was never any high hypothesis. It's even wasn't related to glucose metabolism necessarily.

501
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,200
He thought that maybe there's an anti cancer effect and he looked at that, but then he got

502
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,200
models that were hypertensive and they also live longer. So he thought those are different effect.

503
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,320
And then he considered to aging. But at that time, this was in the eighties when he started that.

504
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,720
And bothers me that I don't remember his name. I should take more metformin.

505
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,160
And he was pushing, he was showing up in meeting and showing. And so people have tried to do it

506
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,120
in the United States and they showed that there is a significant effect on insulin. By the way,

507
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:59,360
the effect of insulin in animals is 10%, not like rapamycin is 24%. So there's a milder

508
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,240
effects, but in every study, they showed that health span is improved, you know, by 50%.

509
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,320
So the effect on longevity was less than the effect of health. By the way, that's perfect

510
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:18,000
for what I'm trying to say. I'm not for longevity. I'm just for health span, right? So if we can

511
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,120
leave healthy, healthy, healthy, die, that's fine with me. Yeah. The so-called squaring of the

512
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:29,040
long-term. Right. Square of the longevity. So he started Asimov, his name is Asimov.

513
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,560
So that's what Asimov showed. People have started looking at that. There are several studies,

514
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,080
three studies that gave it also to nematodes. They also lived longer. And there's several

515
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:51,600
effects on health span in the biology of aging. Now, the reason, there's a lot of needle threading

516
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:59,440
here in my story here. Okay. But I want to tell you the moment that I knew we have to do this

517
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:07,760
study was a publication, not in a very high impact journal, but it was an amazing study

518
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:15,360
that could be done only in the UK, because in the UK, you can go into pharmacies

519
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:27,840
and look at prescription that they gave. And you could follow the mortality of those patients.

520
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:35,200
Because the NHS system allows you to centralize everything from prescription to usage to mortality.

521
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:43,840
Exactly. And they're probably, they don't need to be de-identified after mortality. When you're dead,

522
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,920
you're not private anymore. Okay. So they did this study. So what they've done,

523
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:58,480
they're forearms to this study. They came and took patients who are on sulfonylurea, 12,000 patients.

524
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:07,600
Okay. And they matched them to 12,000 people without diabetes. Okay. Same pharmacies, same doctors,

525
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,480
controlling for some other things. And of course, the people on sulfonylurea had higher mortality

526
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,120
than their control. You know, double. Right. Because of course, they had a reason to be taking

527
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:26,720
the sulfonylurea. Right. They had diabetes. So that's okay. Then they took 78,000 people on

528
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:35,600
metformin and 78,000 people who were non-diabetic, again, matching them. And the 78,000 on metformin

529
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,000
was metformin monotherapy. Monotherapy. First line. Right. And they watched their mortality.

530
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,360
So just to underline again, the people on metformin had diabetes, their control didn't have.

531
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:57,120
They were more obese than the control. They also have more diseases than the control,

532
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:06,320
but they had significant less mortality, 17% less mortality in the metformin group.

533
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:17,040
And, you know, the sulfonylurea group was okay. So if you get less mortality with metformin

534
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:26,880
when the setup is diabetes, that really shows that metformin has a very important effect in

535
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:33,520
humans as far as aging. What was the median dose of metformin in those populations? They were over

536
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,360
a thousand milligrams. That's it. Just a thousand milligrams. Well, they intended more, but the

537
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,960
average was about 50 milligrams. You know, I don't. The average was 1500. Yeah. No, a thousand

538
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:55,360
milligrams. I'm sorry. They, this is a discussion there. I don't think they really could validate

539
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:02,960
the dose. Because an elegant thing to do if you have 78,000 in your database is now stratified by

540
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:10,160
dose. Absolutely. They who's taking 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000. They couldn't do that. And I really

541
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,920
cannot answer you if you can get back to the data or not. I really don't know. The dose, the dose

542
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,880
we chose came from other studies, but, you know, that's not the only thing we know about metformin.

543
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,960
What was the time course of that, by the way? Do you know how many? Five years. Five years more

544
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,880
time. So five years exposure to metformin or five years of prospective mortality following?

545
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,120
No, it's fine. Well, it's all, it was all a prospective study. Okay. It was all a prospective

546
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:47,280
study when they started. Okay. They went back, they looked at everybody on metformin. Oh, I guess

547
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,000
what I'm asking is, do we know how long they needed to be on metformin to achieve the benefit? No, no,

548
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,080
we don't know. Okay. So we followed them for five years of mortality in a prospective cohort, but

549
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,760
they could have been on metformin for five years or 25 years. We don't know. No, no, it's newly,

550
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,080
it's newly prescribed metformin. They were not more than five years. Oh, so we have normalized

551
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:13,120
by duration as well. Absolutely. Absolutely. No, they haven't been on metformin before. Those are

552
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:20,880
newly diagnosed type two diabetes. So, so near, that's a pretty, to be blunt, goddamn staggering

553
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:28,880
result. So my metformin moment, nowhere near as dramatic as yours, basically came out of

554
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:37,680
a research project I did with two analysts in 2013. And I don't even remember what prompted

555
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,720
the question, but there was a question we had internally about what was the benefit of metformin.

556
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,840
Oh, no, no, now I remember the question. The question was, was there a relationship between

557
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,280
hyperinsulinemia and breast cancer? This was the question we wanted to ask. And as we dug and dug

558
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,400
and dug and dug and dug, something kept hitting us over the head over and over and over and over

559
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:07,520
again, which was with or without diabetes, with or without obesity, with or without hyperinsulinemia,

560
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,200
any way you sliced and diced the data of people with type two diabetes with and without metformin,

561
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,680
they got much less breast cancer, which then dug us down a rabbit hole if they seemed to get much

562
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:26,160
less cancer, which was, you know, that was a big aha moment. Right. And there are hundreds of

563
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,720
studies that show the association between metformin and less cancers and not only that,

564
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,320
less all cancers, except prostate, by the way, prosthetists hanging there, maybe a little bit.

565
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:44,160
And when we went, and I'll tell you later, but when we went to the NCI to make them partners

566
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,560
in this TAME study, it was really interesting. Can you tell people what TAME stands for?

567
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,720
TAME stands for Taming or Targeting Aging with Metformin. And it's a study that's designed to

568
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:02,720
prove the concept that aging can be targeted, but also or mainly for me is for the FDA to give an

569
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,520
approval to an indication that's like aging. The first time I heard about TAME was actually

570
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,800
here in this city. I was having dinner with Steve Osthead. It must have been in 2015,

571
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,520
maybe 14, 15. Steve is a gem of a human being. I consider him certainly one of the most important

572
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:26,240
mentors in my exploration of this field of aging. We're partners in many ways. He's a great guy.

573
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,160
He is. He is one of these guys that has his knowledge is out of control. You can't ask him

574
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,600
a question that he doesn't know where to go for the answer. I have the highest respect for Steve.

575
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,680
I can't wait to interview him here as well. But I remember him telling me about this.

576
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,760
And my first thought was, Steve, that's a crazy idea. The drug is free. Who the hell is going to

577
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,120
pay for this study? NIH can't pay for it because they don't consider aging a disease. Pharma can't

578
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,760
pay for it because there's no way to make money on it. I mean, I might pay like 10 cents a year for

579
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,360
my supply of Metformin. It's a free drug. I said, you're doing the wrong study, man. You got to do

580
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,920
this with rapamycin. So talk to me about the challenges of this. This is you're proposing

581
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,240
something that has really never been done before. Can I just ask you, are we going back to

582
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,280
Metformin? Because you asked me about diabetes, but not Metformin action. Will you ask me later?

583
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,400
Absolutely. I cannot wait to dive into Metformin. Yeah, we're not going to get off this topic for a

584
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:31,600
while. Yeah. So, so look, if I'm answering now, why Metformin and not rapamycin? Oh, you don't

585
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,840
need to answer that question. I was just sort of teasing Steve that day. Well, there are people

586
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,760
who are asking, and of course, Metformin, we have preliminary data. We have the cancer. We have

587
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,800
clinical studies, you know, clinical studies of Metformin, the diabetes prevention program,

588
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:54,240
it prevents diabetes. The UKPDS, it prevents cardiovascular disease. The Alzheimer literature,

589
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:01,440
there are two clinical studies to suggest that in mild cognitive impairment, it improves some domain,

590
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:10,720
by the way, like name recalling, Asimov. We'll up your dose after dinner. So there's lots of, and

591
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,520
safety, look, if we're going to have a new indication, we don't want to kill anybody on

592
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:22,720
the road. With rapamycin, we won't be sure. And it causes diabetes and it causes testicular atrophy

593
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:28,720
and cataracts in animals. Okay. So we have to play it safe. So- I would only add one caveat in

594
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:35,040
defense of rapamycin, which is with constitutive dosing. Right. And you're aware of the studies from

595
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:42,080
John Manick, right? Yes, of course. The last ones. Yes. Okay. So my view on rapamycin is it should

596
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,840
not be dosed every day. Exactly. It should be selectively dosed to target mTOR complex one,

597
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,720
leave complex two alone. Exactly. And I'll, we'll get back to that because I'll tell you what we've

598
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,960
done with metformin for the biology of aging part. So that's why the fact, you know, look,

599
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,160
we are a bunch of professors, including Steve Austin. We go to the FDA, by the way, a beautiful

600
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,520
movie by Ron Howard. He went with us to the FDA, to the Senate. Wait, has it been released yet? This

601
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:16,480
documentary? A year and a half ago. It's called the age of aging. It's national geographic. It's

602
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:23,040
the best movie that was done ever on aging. It's really quite incredible. Ron Howard is narrating

603
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,720
it. I remember, I'll tell you what, I was having dinner with Steve at some point during, he was in

604
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,800
New York for that being filmed. Yeah. So, you know, so we're a bunch of professors that are coming to

605
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,960
the FDA and kind of telling them, you know, you know that aging has biology, but this biology also

606
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:48,000
can be targeted. And they said, so what? We said, well, if you slow aging, then you prevent a bunch

607
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,200
of age-related diseases altogether. And I said, well, we're interested to hear. And we went through

608
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,800
this discussion with the FDA. I would say that the most interesting part and you'll appreciate it

609
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:07,120
because you're diabetes centric. I see you're. I'm actually not. I'm purely age centric.

610
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,560
You're metabolic.

611
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:14,960
But I'm diabetes. I think of diabetes as a great example of what happens when you don't fix things

612
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,200
earlier. So we told them, basically we came and we said, we'll do a study and what we're going to

613
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,320
see is cardiovascular disease and cancer and Alzheimer and mortality and diabetes. And I said,

614
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,440
not diabetes. He said, what do you mean not diabetes? He said, no, diabetes. Look, you diagnose

615
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,440
diabetes. First of all, you diagnosis on a chemical, on a chemical test, you know, you decide.

616
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,720
And only 40% of them, 10 years later will get complication. We're really not interested in

617
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,480
diabetes. Wait, wait. Did the FDA actually say this? Absolutely. Absolutely said that. And,

618
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,560
and by the way, I should add that there's another bunch of people who came to tell the FDA that they

619
01:02:54,560 --> 01:03:01,040
should allow metformin for pre-diabetes because the DPP said, yes, forming prevents diabetes by

620
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:08,400
30%. And the FDA said, well, if you think that's important, why don't you make the diagnosis of

621
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:15,360
diabetes in 5.8 and probably been in one C, you know, it's not up to us to, to do that. And they

622
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:23,040
wouldn't give them an indication for pre-diabetes. That's a very counterintuitive point of view.

623
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,440
When you consider the long-term, not short-term, the short-term cost burden of diabetes is

624
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,560
relatively trivial, but it's that long-term cost burden that becomes quite elaborate.

625
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,760
You know, it's very boring with you because we have the same views. You're right.

626
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,840
So yeah. So, okay. But, so we had to adjust our study. We had to take diabetes as one of the

627
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,880
outcomes and put in and, you know, just increase the number and take diabetes out. It's not that

628
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,080
we're not going to follow diabetes, but the FDA is not interested in diabetes. So the, really,

629
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:04,560
the challenge was how do we define aging in a clinical study? Because one view is, well,

630
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:11,280
let's. Because you can't use survival overall mortality. Well, there's no, there's no biomarkers

631
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:18,000
to aging. All the diseases are, are there major risk factor is aging, you know? So how do you

632
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,840
define it? And we basically did a lot of work and published a lot of work and showed that,

633
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:30,800
okay, let's, let's take somebody who has survived cancer and he's 65 to 80 years old.

634
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:39,200
What's his chances of getting cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, mortality, right?

635
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:46,800
The other things. And let's say it was 10. Okay. And okay. Now let's switch it around. Let's take

636
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,520
somebody who had cardiovascular disease. What's his chance of getting cancer and all the others?

637
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,360
10. Okay. Let's take somebody with Alzheimer. What's his chances? It really with aging,

638
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:05,280
it doesn't matter. The disease you get first depends on, you know, your genetics and environment.

639
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,960
If you have a mother who's diabetic and you're obese, you'll get diabetes first. Okay. But really,

640
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,960
because, because we age biologically, you know, in different way, whatever it is, the next disease,

641
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,320
you're going to get the next disease and we don't know what's the next disease,

642
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,680
but that's what we're going to prevent. That's sort of, it's a really interesting

643
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:31,120
idea you propose because it's in lending, you would call that asset value correlation. So you'd say,

644
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:38,320
well, let's say near comes to my bank and he has a credit card and he has a car loan and he has a

645
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:43,280
student loan and he has a mortgage and he has a personal business loan. Which one is going to

646
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,240
default first? Eh, I don't know. I mean, I could sort of tell you typically people are going to

647
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,560
stop paying their credit card before they stop paying their car and their mortgage. But boy,

648
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,640
once you default on one, those dominoes start to fall very quickly. And so that would have what we

649
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,200
would call a very high asset value correlation of default. Yeah. So it's sort of like, this is the

650
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,640
same for disease. Yeah. I think you're right. I'm saying it a little bit different. I'm saying I'm

651
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,360
agnostic to the disease. To which the first one is, yeah, it's just. I'm agnostic. It doesn't matter

652
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:18,720
what you come and what you're going to have, I'm going to prevent whatever it is. That's why we

653
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:25,280
have a composite. Okay. A composite. And people get very prickly about composite outcomes. Very.

654
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,000
And I got it. I'm going to get on my soapbox for a minute here. Cause this pisses me off to no end

655
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,040
when people get all bent out of shape about how you can't have a composite outcome.

656
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:41,760
And this is the bias against aging, really. Because in the end, what matters is how long

657
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:48,320
are you alive and how long is your health span optimized? So I'm sorry for, I made that rant as

658
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,960
short as I normally could. Normally that would be a 10 minute rant. Well, that would be a 10 minute

659
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:59,840
rant for me too. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. And this is where we get into trouble. I'll tell you what

660
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,920
the other pieces, but we had our grant reviewed at the NIH and unfortunately.

661
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,400
And is this inside any of the groups except NIA? Like is NCI weighing in on this?

662
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,240
Yes. Yes. I'll tell you what we've done. I'll tell you what we've done in a second. Let me

663
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:25,520
just make sure that I say that. So our reviewers were not GRS up because we, everybody's involved

664
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,800
and we have 14 centers. Okay. So everybody's involved. So the reviewers are from other

665
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:37,840
place and they just, they just, just a minute. You're saying that aging can be targeted and

666
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:44,080
one drug can do it. You're crazy. Okay. There's no such thing. Why don't you do three studies?

667
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,680
One study is metformin cardiovascular one study is metformin cancer one study. And we're saying,

668
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,800
no, because what are we doing? We're trying to give aging an indication. Suppose we do.

669
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,680
It's just such an anthem to the way they think. And I, I'm not saying that to be critical of them,

670
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,800
right? But they're in a silo. I know. Which is if you come to NCI, how can you care about anything

671
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:14,000
but cancer? Right. I know the silos are really, are really killers, but for us, so you could say,

672
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,280
well, let's do all those studies, but for us, we're calculating the power.

673
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,640
I was just about to say the power analysis on that study is going to quadruple your budget.

674
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:33,280
Well, for what they do, for us, it's not only, it's not only the budget. We don't want to stop

675
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,560
this study. Let's say that we show in two years that we, we delay cardiovascular disease. It's

676
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,800
significant. They'll stop the study. And they said, no, everybody now has to be on metformin,

677
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:51,040
but we wouldn't be able to show the FDA that we are, that we're aging. For us, aging is stop

678
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,680
telling us diseases. We are going to have a cluster and we're just going to delay the aging.

679
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,240
So we'll get, we'll get the health span extended by two, three years. That's what we're trying to

680
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:05,840
show you. And the significance is the, for the cluster, not for the individual disease. And if

681
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:10,960
you tell me to do individual disease, I need triple the, the budgets and I'm not going to get

682
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,480
to the FDA with the indication for aging. So it seems to me that the biggest challenge here

683
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:23,120
is not the funding. It's not the study design. It's the conceptual leap. It's, it's a completely

684
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:29,840
different paradigm of how we think about delaying death. Correct. Correct. Where do you stand today?

685
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:37,920
So I'll tell you a few things. First of all, we conceived it. I got my friends to what I call a

686
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,920
prison, a French prison in Spain somewhere. We were in a para door in the middle of nowhere in

687
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,960
Spain for several days saying, what do we have to do in order to open the field for aging to allow

688
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,440
us to get to treatments? And we decided several things, but one of them is to go, to go ahead with

689
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,520
things. By the way, I'm saying French prison because the food was good, but it was in Spain.

690
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,320
And we started, and I started getting those people, those clinical people together. And we

691
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,320
started really thinking through for what it takes for what it takes. And we had this whole academic

692
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,400
and wrote papers in order to say how we're thinking, how we're thinking of cluster of diseases,

693
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:26,160
how we're doing power calculations for targets, aging and stuff like that. We really spend a lot

694
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:32,560
of time with the best people. Now our friends came to us and said, just a minute, your study is

695
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,840
$70 million. If the National Institute of Aging is going to spend $70 million, that means this,

696
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,800
the National Institute of Aging is very small. It's just 3% of the budget, although we are 80%

697
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:51,280
of the diseases, right? Then we won't have money for the grants. And I said, well, what I'm going

698
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,120
to do is two things. First of all, half of the money is going to come from somewhere else. That's

699
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:02,800
my association with AFR where Steve and I are the scientific directors. And for AFR,

700
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,480
I got the other half. So the 45 million is already raised and that's mostly philanthropic.

701
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:15,520
Right. And then we went among the institutes and. So NCI should chip in a bit.

702
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:23,120
NHLBI, NIDDK. They didn't commit because first they have to see the review, okay? Or they have

703
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,320
to have the decision that the NIA wants. I would tell you though, that the NCI director who's a good

704
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,920
friend of mine is waiting for Taim to come. He's like, where's Taim?

705
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,680
So the NCI has committed. It's basically a bunch of contingent commitments.

706
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:43,360
Yeah. I just want to say committed is the wrong word because they didn't have a budget yet and

707
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,000
the grant didn't come to them. But I know that they will give them money because their head

708
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,880
will do it. Yeah. So that's good to hear. So

709
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,840
realistically, when is the soonest you would begin enrolling for Taim?

710
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,720
You know, I'm waiting for something to know next week. And if next week goes well, so I just want

711
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:11,440
to let you know that we have an alternative. The alternative is not for profits. That the reason

712
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:18,960
they haven't joined us is that their charter is not to fund anything that the NIH funds. They

713
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,480
want something riskier. Of course. So if the NIH is not funding because they feel it's risky,

714
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:34,000
those will fund. So we can start anywhere. And the answer is early 2019. Okay. We're basically

715
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,400
all our centers are ready to go. How many centers?

716
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,280
14. How many subjects? 3000.

717
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:48,800
Age? 65 to 80. Any limitation on comorbidities? No, in fact, well, there are a lot of limitations,

718
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:55,280
but we're very inclusive. But no existing diagnosis of cancer? No, unless they're cured.

719
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:00,080
Okay. So you could be in remission, but you can't have active cancer. Is it secondary

720
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:07,040
prevention or primary? You could have cardiovascular disease in the past if you're okay now. You could

721
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:14,640
have mild cognitive impairment and low speed walk will be a criteria. So in other words,

722
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,360
we don't want the people like in my study who will become centenarians because we're wasting

723
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,080
time on them. We want people who we know are kind of in the midst of aging. And we know that it's

724
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:35,920
never too late to target aging. And that's where. So 65 years and up, five years studied, and you're

725
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,200
going to randomize one to one or two to one, one to one and the placebo versus what dose of

726
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:47,120
metformin two grams? 1500. So, you know, the, so first of all, I should tell you that Merck

727
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,400
company from Germany is giving us the placebo metformin. Right. So the drug is free. So when,

728
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,760
when you say nobody's interested, it's true. It's generic, but actually Merck has the worldwide

729
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:04,160
license for metformin. And they're actually giving supply to lots of studies because they

730
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,200
kind of realize that this is good. And do you think there's a difference between generic

731
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,000
metformin and branded in terms of efficacy? Is there any reason? No, so they're really,

732
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,440
this is kind of a, this isn't necessarily a creative to them because one can buy metformin

733
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,800
generically anywhere. They're not going to make more money from giving us this. Well,

734
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:31,280
you know, I should say even now a lot of the metformin suppliers have higher sales

735
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:39,040
and a lot of them are non-theabetic. Yeah. So this thing, which is, which is bad for me,

736
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,360
because I don't want too many people to know that, right? I want to do this study. I don't want,

737
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,160
and I don't, I want people. Well, you'll have, you know, I don't think, hopefully it won't

738
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:51,200
impair your, your recruiting and the power analysis. I mean, it's funny, honestly, near,

739
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:56,080
I would have guessed, but this is, this speaks to the non-linearity and complexity of estimating

740
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,960
power. You can't do it without the tables. I would have guessed you needed a bigger end than 1500

741
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,600
in each group. You are using 80 or 90% power. 90% power. But I should tell you, look, for every

742
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:17,120
disease, we have almost a 30% effect and we chose 22% effect. Okay. For every disease, we have

743
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,560
preliminary data for the same. Got it. So you lowered your threshold to call it 20% from 30%.

744
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:29,280
And at a 90% power, you've hopefully powered this. Right. You've got buffer both on your power and

745
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,520
effect size. Right. And, and again, we don't want to stop the study early either for one effect.

746
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:44,480
So we carefully thought about it. We asked for a grant for six years because we don't want to

747
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:54,160
overdo it. Okay. So it might finish in four or in six, but we have the flexibility to look at that.

748
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:01,440
Any non-US centers or are they all US? No, we decided to do only in the US because of

749
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:08,800
communication. And because, look, outside of the US, people came and said, you know, we'll fund

750
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,800
TANE. But how, you know, if they say after two years, we won't fund them, you know, it's very

751
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,080
different because, because if it's a center, they need to be part of the part of the power and we

752
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,160
cannot afford to lose them. So we, you know, those and other considerations, we decided to stick with

753
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:33,120
the United States. So let's go back to what we really glossed over, but now I want to dive into.

754
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:40,640
Why do you believe at the cellular mechanistic level, metformin is an anti-aging drug?

755
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,000
So let me take you through that in a, I don't want to say schematic way because we don't have the

756
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,280
scheme here, but in a way that maybe I think will be easy to think. So I want to start by saying

757
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:00,560
that studies have shown that some of the effects of metformin are through AMP kindness and some of

758
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:10,720
them are independent of AMP kindness. Okay. Is it important not for metformin, but I don't know

759
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,640
which are the ones who are relevant more for aging. Okay. And it's hard to know and it'll get

760
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:24,960
complicated in a second more. So metformin gets into the cell through a transporter that's called

761
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:34,640
OCT1. Okay. This transporter is not equally equal in every cell. So unlike FENforming that goes

762
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:41,680
without a transporters and affect everything metformin is peculiar in this way, but we have

763
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:49,280
the preliminary data and it binds to complex one in the mitochondria. Does it do so preferentially?

764
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:55,280
Does it gain entry preferentially into the liver in humans? Only in the sense that there's a nice

765
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:02,560
concentration of OCT1 in the liver, but not, not, but it's not, I don't think it's the top other

766
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:09,120
organs have. So basically it's more about OCT distribution and expression, maybe than tissue

767
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:17,920
specificity. It's more that I want, I want metformin everywhere. Okay. I want metformin everywhere. And

768
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:24,960
I'll tell you how I kind of proved that. So now metformin binds to complex one in the mitochondria.

769
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,520
I'll tell you that metformin has some action, epigenetic action that are independent of the

770
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,600
mitochondria. You can do it with what's called row zero cells. You can, you can deplete mitochondria

771
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,800
and see and measure things and you can measure things even without mitochondria. Okay. Again,

772
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,840
do I need the mitochondria? What type of epigenetic changes do you see in the row cell?

773
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:55,280
In histone deacetylation. Okay. So I cannot argue that this can be important. It's not important if

774
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:01,440
we use metformin, but it's important if you want to ask me are the mechanism of metformin AMP

775
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:08,640
dependent, mitochondria dependent. So there's an HDAC property that we may not have even thought of

776
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,760
before. Right. Okay. So it gets to the mitochondria and in the mitochondria, it basically changes ADP,

777
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:26,320
ratio. And that's a lot of it is important in the liver, but not only to the extent that there is an

778
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:35,040
activation of AMP kinase. And Nier, is there a demonstrable reduction in NAD to NADH in that cell

779
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:41,600
when complex one is inhibited? Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Those studies have been, have been done.

780
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:48,240
So there's a lot that's going through AMP kinase. And I would tell you that downstream of AMP kinase,

781
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:55,200
there is mTOR. Okay. And it depletes, it decrease mTOR activity and increase autophagy. And there's

782
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:01,520
a whole pathway that will go to the pillars of aging. You know, I asked David Sabatini this

783
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,640
question a month ago and we're, he doesn't know the answer, but I'm hopeful that maybe one of the

784
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:13,360
postdocs in his lab will start to figure this out. I'm very curious about what the dose equivalent is

785
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:22,640
between in terms of purely looking at the readout of mTOR inhibition. What is the dose to dose

786
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:29,280
equivalence of metformin via AMPK versus RAPA directly? And I haven't, I mean, David didn't

787
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,560
know the answer, which tells me nobody probably knows the answer. Right. Look, it's, it's really

788
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:40,640
difficult. First of all, for example, lots of the non-AMP kinase activities are on much higher doses

789
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:46,640
of metformin. Well, that's my point is can you clinically match them and, and. No, because you,

790
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:53,440
you really don't know at the end how much metformin is in the cell. What we're doing now, we're doing

791
01:20:53,440 --> 01:21:00,080
isolated cells. In other words, we treated animals with metformin and we're taking isolated cells

792
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:06,400
to just see the variability of, of metformin in individual cells.

793
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,640
Even amongst homogeneous tissues. Yeah. Like we take hepatocytes and look at the.

794
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:19,680
The variability of expression. Yeah. Right. So it's all kind of a important question, but,

795
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,120
but the story is still, I'll tell you the story because at the end I'm going to answer you what

796
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:30,080
is that doing for aging. Okay. And I don't want to rush this story because this is a great story.

797
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,680
You take your sweet time. So think about it in a scheme. You have the metformin in the middle,

798
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,880
getting through the plasma membrane, getting to the mitochondria. And on the left side,

799
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:47,280
let's say there is the MP kinase. Okay. Now in the right side. Oh, sorry. Just for the listener,

800
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:53,600
explain what a MP kinase does at the high level. It's, it's a hormone of what it's a hormone of

801
01:21:53,600 --> 01:22:00,400
nutrient deprivation. And therefore it tells the body to do what like when you don't eat for a day,

802
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:09,360
AMPK goes up. Why? Well, but it's also an exercise mimetic pathway. Yes. That's what happens with,

803
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:15,360
with exercise. Really. That was the, the hope of what the MP kinase is doing, but it's a nutrient

804
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:21,440
sensing that is in part upstream of mTOR. Okay. But the other side of metformin

805
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:29,280
is what happens to the mitochondria because in a way, and I hope I won't regret saying it here,

806
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:37,520
but metformin is a weak cyanide. Okay. Look, what cyanide acted at complex for.

807
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:45,520
Right. But right. Oh, you just mean more broadly speaking. Right. It inhibits. So there is less

808
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,480
R O S production. Okay. And then there is less inflammation and there is other things that's

809
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:58,400
going just because the mitochondria is less oxidative pathway going down.

810
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,080
So this is a great example of why binary thinking doesn't very,

811
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,920
it doesn't do very well in biology, right? It can't be all or none.

812
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:14,800
Well, so now I can go on and on and connect all those, please do to eventually the pillar

813
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:21,280
of aging. But I want to insert another thing because other things are happening. For example,

814
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:26,800
insulin levels goes down, right? Why is it just due to the reduction of hepatic glucose output?

815
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:32,560
I'll tell you why I think. And then also inflammatory factors are going down.

816
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:41,920
And there is a whole NF kappa B action of metformin that might be part of the R O S and part could be

817
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:50,240
independent even without mitochondria. Okay. It's that confusing, but this is the point I want to

818
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:56,640
make. I don't know which one of those is important for aging, but parts of what you're measuring is

819
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:04,160
the following. You fix the aging on a cellular level. Okay. So the younger, the cells are younger.

820
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:11,600
A lot of things are correcting themselves. So I think at the end, the lower insulin levels,

821
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:17,760
the low inflammatory are not necessarily a direct effect. And that's why we're, we're fighting all

822
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,480
the time about what metformin is doing, because you can measure lots of things, but the things

823
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:27,760
you're measuring are because aging was fixed. And once aging is fixed, then there's whole

824
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:36,080
hemodynamic readjustant or whatever you want to call it. And then you're measuring that everything.

825
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:42,560
And this is not only typical to metformin. This is with rapamycin with resveratrol. You also can see

826
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:50,160
that there's a lot of things that are improving themselves. And I think we have to get used to

827
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:56,160
the fact that when you have a drug that we argue what it's doing, because everybody is measuring

828
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:03,040
something, some of it is true, but it's like secondary. It's you fixed it. How did you fix

829
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:08,160
it? True and unrelated. And it's funny, you mentioned those three, which again, I think speaks to an

830
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:16,320
advantage you have with tame. So when you look at rapamycin, resveratrol, and metformin, the big

831
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:25,120
advantage of metformin is you already know the dose and the frequency. With rapamycin over dinner

832
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,680
tonight, I'm going to give you my philosophy on the dose and the frequency, and we can discuss it,

833
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:34,640
but I can't demonstrate it to you with anywhere near the validity that you could do the same with

834
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:40,800
metformin. I had a wonderful discussion with David Sinclair and bioavailability came up on resveratrol.

835
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,680
Right? So maybe all the trials that say resveratrol is meaningless are simply not looking at what

836
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:52,640
happens if you get enough resveratrol in the right place. And again, it's amazing to me how many times

837
01:25:52,640 --> 01:26:00,880
in biology we can make mistakes of the first order because of a third or fourth order omission.

838
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:09,600
And this, I guess I don't think I realized that until you just gave that explanation, the value

839
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:17,520
of effectively millions of patient years worth of data on metformin, not just from a safety standpoint.

840
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,000
By the way, billions. It's billions years. Is it billions? Yeah. So billions of patient

841
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:28,000
year data on metformin. I know that from an FDA standpoint, the highest priority is safety. That's

842
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,520
a low bar to cross. The more interesting one from the standpoint of this study is actual efficacy.

843
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,920
And it seems like if I'm hearing you correctly, metformin is an amazing B student. Let's not be

844
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,880
insulted by that. What do I mean? Are there better ways to inhibit Ross if you want to hammer the

845
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:50,480
Ross chain? Probably. There's clearly better ways to inhibit mTOR if that's all you want to do.

846
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:56,880
Are there better ways to modulate HDAC? Yes, I'm sure there are. But it might be that maybe part

847
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:04,320
of metformin's beauty is it does so many things at a B plus level. Never it's an A student, but it's

848
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,040
not a D student. And it's never, I mean, I'm sort of thinking about this sort of in a tongue in cheek

849
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:16,000
way, but it seems to do so many things reasonably well. Well, I call metformin a tool from my

850
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:23,600
perspective. It's just a tool to show that we can target aging because I think that there'll be much

851
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:30,080
better drugs and combination drugs and other in the future. Human lifespan is 115 years. We argue.

852
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,440
Maximum lifespan. Yeah, maximum lifespan. We argue because there's somebody 122, but there's a

853
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:42,080
statistic thing. So, okay. We die before the age of 80. So there are 35 years that as a species

854
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:49,040
without, not that we cannot change more, but just now without thinking too much futuristic,

855
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:56,880
low hanging fruit that we can do. And metformin is the perfect tool to start showing the proof of

856
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:03,680
principle here, but the future is much better. It's just, you have to pave the road here.

857
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,240
This is a beautiful pivot to something else I want to discuss with you because unfortunately I could

858
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,720
talk about metformin for three hours, but there's so many other things I want to discuss with you

859
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:18,400
near based on your work. And you just alluded to one, which is the work that you and your

860
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:24,880
colleagues have done on centenarians has been very influential in my thinking. So as I think about

861
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:32,400
aging clinically, I ask the question, start with the existence principle. What does it mean to live

862
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:39,680
a long life? Is there proof of this having existed? And there is, we have centenarians,

863
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:46,480
they exist. My hypothesis when I first started reading your literature, which was only about

864
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:53,680
five years ago, my hope, I should say not my hypothesis, my hope was that whatever genetic

865
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:59,680
benefit they had, which it became very clear to me very quickly that this wasn't about what they

866
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,360
did. In fact, they seem to have almost near immunity to the worst behaviors imaginable.

867
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:10,880
My fear when I read your first paper, which was a review paper, I can still see it. And I still

868
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:20,800
remember where I was sitting in a Sheridan hotel reading it. My fear was whatever blessing they had,

869
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,160
it was not, it had nothing to do with chronic disease and it had to do with something nebulous

870
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,480
and they had complete immunity from chronic disease and they just died in car accidents.

871
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,640
Like they eventually just died because something else tripped them up. And what I took away from

872
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:40,960
your work was no, their genetic gift was a phase shift. And when they got chronic diseases,

873
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,720
they still died of heart disease, they still died of cancer, they still died of Alzheimer's disease.

874
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:51,040
They simply got a 20 year bonus, if not more, maybe 29 on average, you could calculate,

875
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,840
call it a close to 30 year bonus. Well, of health span. You know?

876
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,320
Yes. Because completely functional life. Because they had compression of morbidity. So it's not

877
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:08,080
only that they lived longer and they lived healthier, but they died quicker at the end of that.

878
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:13,440
And you know, it's interesting, the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, have looked at the

879
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:19,520
last two years cost of life of people with different stuff. So they looked at people who

880
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:28,000
die at 70 and after a hundred and the cost of dying after a hundred was third of that of dying

881
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:37,040
in 70. So it's not only in our study, there's actually evidence to suggest that the medical,

882
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:42,640
and by the way, those when they were 70, they didn't go to the doctor. Okay. So, and this is

883
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:48,240
the base of this concept that's called the longevity dividend. Okay. What will happen

884
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:53,040
to society if we'll actually be healthier for two and a half years and the benefits

885
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,160
are immense. You think only of, you know, so we pay social security more and stuff, but

886
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:03,040
there are seven trillions dollars just in saving of medical costs. If you could just

887
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:08,000
leave healthier. So I know you don't spend an enormous amount of time anymore thinking about

888
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,400
the centenarians, you know, your literature followed very closely. You, you definitely are

889
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,840
spending much more time talking about and writing about the things that we just discussed. But

890
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,680
if you could go back in time a little bit for me, by the way, that's not true.

891
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,760
Maybe it's just selectively where I'm reading. Well, no, I think that's what's interesting to

892
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,160
people now. And I'm very happy about that, but I just got the, you know, the longevity,

893
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:34,560
the Epson longevity price. And my talk was actually about centenarians with a little bit

894
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:41,200
of my hypothesis stuff that was related to something, but the centenarians are, and we

895
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,760
have lots of grants on the centenarians because, you know, there's that talk, by the way,

896
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,600
is it something that people can watch? No, no, it wasn't recorded. Oh, it's a shame.

897
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,480
It's a real, I thought about, about this talk. It was fun for me to give because it was reflective

898
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:01,760
a little bit to, you know, one of the things that's always funny for me is people say, oh,

899
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:07,360
you know, I have, I can measure this thing. I'm sure that centenarians, they have, they have high

900
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:13,120
level because high levels are good. And I had to put into rest the fact that the genetics of

901
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:20,880
centenarians is really great for me. But the phenotype is not because you have a hundred

902
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:28,000
years old and you can measure something that can reflect what brought you here or the fact that

903
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,080
30% of them are going to die in the next year. So it could be a marker of, of death and not of

904
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:40,400
longevity. The other phenotype makes, doesn't interest to me. That's why I have their offspring

905
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,480
because their offspring will have the phenotype or half of their offspring will have the phenotype.

906
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:48,800
But those things were something that was nice because so many people are saying, you know,

907
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,040
we should measure in centenarians. No, we are, we're doing a longitudinal study on their offspring

908
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:58,960
and their offspring are equal everywhere to our control group. They just have half of the diseases.

909
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,160
Although you, by the way, that's a really interesting point near. I never once thought

910
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:09,840
of that. I never, what you just said that if I have a hundred year old centenarian in my study and

911
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:17,440
he or she has a CTEP mutation or an APOC3 mutation and I look at the predictable phenotype,

912
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:22,800
because I know what you should have if you have that mutation, hypo functioning APOC3 should have

913
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:28,560
low triglyceride. But technically without a little more longitudinal legwork, I don't actually know

914
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:35,520
what I'm measuring as a result of that. But that said, there must still be some benefit in,

915
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:41,600
you know what, now that I'm saying it, I realize you can't do it. The dream state would be to have

916
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,000
health records and phenotypes for centenarians that go 30 years back. In other words, it would

917
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,360
be beautiful to follow a centenarian from 70 to a hundred with phenotypic data.

918
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:57,120
So that's why we have the longevity study. It's a longitudinal study of offspring of centenarians

919
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,160
and people without longevity. And we're going forward. We're already 10 years into the study

920
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:09,440
and we're starting to see the differences between those guys. It's different population. They are

921
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:16,000
aging slower. Okay. The children of centenarians. So we have some of these things in mind.

922
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,960
What are the most important genetic differences between those either centenarians or offsprings

923
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,720
of centenarians and the rest of us? So it's very interesting. And so this is a part that you

924
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:38,480
haven't heard so from, but it's actually the growth hormone IGF axis. We have probably 60%

925
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:45,520
of our centenarians have genomic reasons. So let's explain the normal path of that. So the

926
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:51,760
pituitary gland makes GH. It tells the liver primarily to make IGF. Right. It binds to a

927
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:57,760
receptor, right? And the liver and IGF. And so some of the effects of the growth hormone system

928
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:05,520
are through growth hormone itself. And some of it is through IGF-1 level. Both of them are decreasing

929
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:16,080
with aging. So in this system, more than 60% and I think I'm underestimating. Okay. It's more,

930
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:22,240
it's probably more, but I didn't really calculate who has several mutations. You know, I can calculate

931
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,440
how many mutations there are, but not the overlap of the mutation. So I'm saying 60%, but it's the

932
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:35,120
most common genomic alteration in our centenarians. And I have to tell you. And where is it specifically?

933
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:40,640
I'll tell you in a second. And I want to just to tell you, I never, I wrote grants on that

934
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:48,080
because I thought, because there's preliminary data in nature, right? The small dogs live longer

935
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:54,240
and the ponies live longer. And when you mutate growth hormone or they're born dwarf, they live

936
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:59,040
longer. And when you give more growth hormone, they live shorter. So there is a lot in nature,

937
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:04,240
but the human data was really confusing. Some diseases, you know, when you have a high IGF,

938
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:08,640
you have more cancers, but you have less Alzheimer's disease, less cancer, I mean, sorry,

939
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:12,880
less heart disease and less diabetes, but more cancer, right? And mortality,

940
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,760
immortality, it's like in the middle, you know, a little bit tending to more from, you know,

941
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:24,160
from cancer. By our analysis, which I think pulls all of your data, we found that there was in

942
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:30,720
a U-shaped mortality curve with the nadir being between 60th and 80th percentile of all cause

943
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:38,800
mortality. So I want to tell you the problem with this association. On one hand, an individual that

944
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:51,280
age quickly, okay, their growth hormone IGF goes down quickly. Okay. So you would measure falsely

945
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:57,520
low IGF one level. If you catch them on the wrong side of their aging curve. Right. That wouldn't

946
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:05,520
fit our theory that low IGF is good because that's their accelerated aging. So this is a

947
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:15,040
problem with an association study like that. We discovered first of all, that when we take

948
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:20,080
our centenarians, so they're in our study because they've been healthy at age 95,

949
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:26,800
living independently. We take them at any age, but that's what they have to do. And we just look at

950
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,720
those with the highest IGF and the lowest IGF one level. Those with the lowest IGF one level

951
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:39,520
live twice as long. Those are already the centenarians, but only women, men do not. And

952
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:46,800
every example that I gave you, there's a sex difference. The growth hormone IGF is very sensitive

953
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:53,040
for women or for females. So let me ask you another question. It's very difficult clinically to measure

954
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:58,480
GH because it's pulsatile. Right. So whenever you're saying growth hormone, are you really

955
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:05,280
saying IGF, which is easier to measure? No, because I'm going to talk sooner, but not what I'm

956
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:10,880
measuring, but where the mutations are. Okay. But to repeat what you just said, the difference

957
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:17,440
between men and women, was that based on IGF level or GH level? IGF levels. Okay. But we discovered

958
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:24,800
in aging, we did a huge faux pas, okay, that we are now correcting. We studied in our labs

959
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:32,320
males only. We had excuses why females are menstruating. We don't know their effects.

960
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,720
And we're all discovering, look, even rapamycin that really works everywhere is better in females

961
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:47,120
than males. But acerbos is in males, right? They're examples where we totally miss the sex

962
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:53,040
effect. And growth hormone IGF is a perfect example, except those mice that are the snail

963
01:38:53,040 --> 01:39:02,320
mice or the Ames miles, they have a pituitary problem, which makes them, I think, sex confused.

964
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:08,960
So they have so many other alterations, but sex difference is important. We also showed that those

965
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:15,840
women with the lowest IGF one level has much less cognitive problems. A third of the cognitive

966
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:21,360
deficiencies of those with the highest IGF. All right. Okay. So we had to grab our second

967
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,280
round of Topo Chico there, which by the way, I didn't even ask you upfront. This is your first

968
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:30,720
time having Topo Chico, right? Yeah. I'm in love. I mean, this is, there are a few things that bring

969
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:38,640
me as much joy as introducing people to this bottled water. The perrier is much milder. I like

970
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:45,760
to feel the bubbles. Well, I would, I think one thing we should consider for tame is if we can

971
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:51,760
have an arm that also includes Topo Chico. So there's a placebo, there's a metformin,

972
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,320
and then there's a metformin plus Topo Chico. And the question, the hypothesis will be,

973
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:01,600
does that somehow enhance lifespan? Because even if it does not, I predict it will enhance happiness.

974
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,520
Well, I have to tell you, I'm an advisor to the prime minister of Singapore.

975
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:13,120
Singapore is a place that can, you know, plan the future. And before going, I said, why don't you

976
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:19,920
ask me questions? And one of the questions, shall we put metformin in the water or in sodas?

977
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:26,160
Now, good to ask, you know, the answer is no, obviously, but it's good that you're thinking

978
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:32,640
that way. So metformin. And should you change your mind, I think you now know which soda it

979
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:39,520
should go into. Can you get it in Singapore? Oh, I'm sure we can. Yeah. So back to sort of

980
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:44,480
what you were saying, this IGF male-female disconnect, let's keep going down that rabbit

981
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:50,080
hole. So I was saying that one of the worries about low growth hormone and IGF is the effect

982
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:55,840
on the muscle because people think that growth hormone affects muscle function, muscle size.

983
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:04,800
And we found that in females and males, the IGF-1 level is not associated with better or worse

984
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,480
lots of muscle function, including grip and getting out of chair and, you know, other things.

985
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:19,120
So maybe the effect of low IGF and aging are just as good as having a higher effect of IGF on muscle.

986
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:26,640
Just weighs itself out. Okay. But then our study is genetics. Okay. That's what we try to do. And

987
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:37,120
just several years ago, almost I guess a decade ago, we found clusters of mutations in the IGF

988
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,080
receptor. Those were new mutations that haven't been found before, but we found them in nine of

989
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:50,800
our assentinarians, which was 2% of our assentinarians. And that was kind of a proof of concept

990
01:41:50,800 --> 01:42:00,560
for us that clusters of mutations that are functional is what we really need to look for

991
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:07,120
rather than like everybody's doing, doing GWAS and find, you know, something infra-genomic somewhere.

992
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:13,120
And this was also the first proof of concept that the growth hormone IGF could be relevant to human

993
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:21,760
human aging. People that those 2% of our, those nine people had higher IGF-1 level because they

994
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,640
were resistant, right? It's the IGF receptors, they were resistant to IGF. So their level was

995
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:33,840
a little bit higher, but they were significantly shorter than others. Which is a great explanation

996
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:39,920
of how that phenotype would play out. You would say, well, how can they be short-statured with

997
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:46,400
high IGF? And the answer is if the IGF isn't as effective at the receptor. Right. But remember

998
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,760
that most of our people with low IGF are doing better. By the way, we take the people with the

999
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:58,320
IGF- Men also or just women? Two men in those nine people. And by the way, then there are dwarves,

1000
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:07,040
human dwarves that called La Ronde dwarves that live in Ecuador and Haseco and Volto Longo and

1001
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:12,480
some of the people in Ecuador were looking, basically were trying to find if they live longer,

1002
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:20,560
too few of them to really know. But they have less cancer and less diabetes, you know, significantly

1003
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:28,080
less. So there's other evidence from humans came after ours that there is at least less age-related

1004
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,800
diseases in those people. They certainly didn't live a better life in any way that we could assess,

1005
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:41,360
correct? I mean, we always joked that they weren't happy with the fact that they're short,

1006
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,640
so they drank a lot and that's the alcoholism. And then when they crossed the road,

1007
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:56,000
nobody saw them. So they died of more trauma. But I think it's really not true. So I met some of

1008
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,800
them. We were in a Vatican conference. Everybody asked to bring his patients and Longo brought

1009
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:08,640
somebody from Ecuador and I brought a centenarian from Rome. And the guy that he brought told a

1010
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:14,400
different story. He wasn't unhappy. He was also happily married with a big woman and had children.

1011
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:22,400
So I don't know. And is the defect in them at the growth hormone receptor in the liver?

1012
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,720
In the liver. So they make normal amount of growth hormone. Their liver doesn't acknowledge it. High

1013
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,120
amount of growth hormone because it doesn't work. Yeah. So they have lots of growth hormone,

1014
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,680
but it's not being expressed through the liver into IGF. And so they have no IGF.

1015
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:42,240
So we published last year a paper that took us 10 years to write. And basically,

1016
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:50,240
we were looking at a relatively common mutation. I'm saying common because it's like three,

1017
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:56,720
four percent in the population where they have a complete deletion of exome three in the growth

1018
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:03,520
hormone receptor. Okay. So one of the exomes, one of the things that are important for the

1019
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:11,760
integrity of this hormone, right, is deleted. And of course, you would think that that means

1020
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:18,960
that the growth hormone is less effective. And Gilatzmon, who was fellow with me,

1021
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:26,480
brought me this data to suggest that while it's three, four percent in our control population,

1022
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:33,200
it's 12 percent in our centenarians. So I asked, so what's the IGF-1 level? And he showed it's

1023
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:37,440
lower. And I said, and what's the height of the people? He said, well, that's the problem. They're

1024
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:45,120
much taller. So I said, I cannot do anything with this study. It just makes no sense. I don't know

1025
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:51,360
how to write. So the people with lower IGF, but the mutation was in the exome of the growth hormone

1026
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:59,200
receptor. So they had lower IGF. So it was a dysfunction of the receptor in theory. So less IGF.

1027
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:03,840
And we know that it was fully penetrant all their life. In other words, there's no chance that it

1028
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,960
didn't start showing up until they were an adult. Well, we'll come back to that. But the mutation

1029
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,200
didn't change. And by the way, just give me some numbers here. How low were their IGFs?

1030
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,040
I don't remember.

1031
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,680
Directionally. Are we talking about less than 100?

1032
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,280
No, less than 200.

1033
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:28,960
Yeah, 100 is about the median level of IGF for somebody over 65.

1034
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:35,120
Yeah, I think in the studies that I told you, the average or the mean or whatever was 94,

1035
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:41,680
something like that. I don't remember to answer about those people. Okay, now? Okay. So he said

1036
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:46,560
what to do. I said, well, first of all, what you do with genetics, you do replication study,

1037
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,760
you know, you go to other populations and you see what's going on there.

1038
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,120
And second, you do a functional study. Let's see if it's really a functional mutation.

1039
01:46:55,120 --> 01:47:00,880
So it took almost 10 years, right? And in 10 years, we replicated the data in three other

1040
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:10,960
populations in Amish, French, centenarians in the CHS here in the United States. And in all studies,

1041
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:17,360
the people that live the longest had much more of those homozygosities in the growth hormone

1042
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:25,840
receptor. So that was a great validation. Second, the functional. So Hassey Cohen, my partner in

1043
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:33,040
USC, we send him the lymphoblasts of our patients, the affected and not affected. And he

1044
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:40,720
is a growth hormone IGF expert. So he incubated them serum-free, so without stimulation.

1045
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:47,280
And with growth hormone and looked both at activation and proliferation by growth hormone.

1046
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:54,560
So in serum-free without stimulation, they had less activation and less proliferation, half

1047
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:01,600
of normal, suggesting, yeah, that's the mutation. That's the function. When he incubated them with

1048
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:08,160
growth hormone, it totally switched. I'm sorry, but going back, you talked about proliferation,

1049
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:13,760
but was there a functional difference in the lymphocyte in addition to its increasing number?

1050
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:21,760
No, there's, yeah, the first was activation by phosphor and some of the, okay, some of the-

1051
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,200
But non-specific activation.

1052
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:28,880
No, no, no, specific to what growth hormone is doing, but the proliferation, it's a cell data.

1053
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,840
Yeah, that's an easy one. Yeah.

1054
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,960
When he incubated it with growth hormone, it was the opposite.

1055
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:40,800
Rather than this low proliferation, low activation, it was high activation, high proliferation.

1056
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:47,600
So what's going on? Well, what's going on? When do we have high growth hormones for puberty?

1057
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:54,800
So with high growth hormone, something has changed in the activation from low activation,

1058
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:01,440
you jump to high activation for reason with the molecular, the real mechanism we don't know,

1059
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:07,120
really, but that's what happened when you have high growth hormone. So they all were taller.

1060
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,480
And then when growth hormone got down for the rest of their life, they shut off.

1061
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:22,160
Okay. So, okay. So this is 12% of our people. Then Yuxing Sun, who's a geneticist that's working

1062
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:28,640
on this, she was interested in microRNA. That's another epigenetic thing that comes. We haven't

1063
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:34,480
been thinking about it, but those are RNA that comes from certain region of the gene and they

1064
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:42,960
bind specifically to active region of the gene and they modulate it. Well, 30% of our centenarians

1065
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:51,760
have clusters of microRNA that are overexpressed by a lot, by 40 times, you know, just immensely

1066
01:49:51,760 --> 01:50:00,240
activated. One of them, for example, microRNA, microRNA 142, that's increased by 35 fold.

1067
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:08,080
When you incubate it with cells, it prevents the phosphorylation of the IGF receptor,

1068
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:14,080
decreases some other signaling, foxal signaling, and some other stuff

1069
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:22,320
dramatically. So there's a microRNA targeting of the growth hormone IGF receptor in about 30% of

1070
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:30,400
our centenarians. Then 22% of our centenarians have mutation in FOXO3A. That's a common mutation in

1071
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:36,960
centenarians. So you start 2% and 12%. Yeah. Tell people what FOXO3A does.

1072
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:49,360
FOXO3A is another, how would I say, just housekeeper that lets in good stuff and change

1073
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:57,360
things and put things in stop. It's too complicated to go more, but it is part of the insulin IGF.

1074
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:02,160
It's very important, the transcription factor at regulating homeostasis, cellular homeostasis.

1075
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:02,400
Right. Right.

1076
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:11,200
That's not a great explanation, but isn't FOXO the most prevalent genetic difference? If you were to

1077
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:18,800
just isolate them by genotype, if you look at CTEP and C3 and FOXO and GH and IGF, I mean,

1078
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,160
my recollection is that FOXO might be the single most prevalent of the-

1079
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:31,280
Well, FOXO, I'm not sure that it's true, but FOXO3A is common in all centenarians population

1080
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:39,760
around the world. Not every population has the same mutations. In fact, what we're doing now,

1081
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:45,280
when we have the exome sequencing of all our subjects, almost 3000 exome sequencing,

1082
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,200
the important thing to do is to assign them to pathways because we're doing something really

1083
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:58,480
silly with genetics. When we had this GWAS, we said we have million SNPs around the genome,

1084
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:03,760
we'll find the diseases, every disease in the world. One of the stupidest thing we did, we took

1085
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:09,840
one SNP at a time. Okay. Let's see if this SNP is significant, but we're not billed of one SNP of

1086
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:16,560
a time. In certain population, there's down this pathway, there'll be another SNP that will change

1087
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:23,440
the function. Our analysis now is totally different than how we started.

1088
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:30,000
I agree with you completely, but I don't think most of the world is listening near. If I had a

1089
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:39,120
dollar for every time one of my patients came with their complete sequence and they want me to

1090
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:45,840
interpret them, I have the same discussion so many times. Okay, you have 20,000 genes. To my last

1091
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:52,240
counting, maybe 78 of them have a deterministic relationship with a disease. You have none of them,

1092
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:56,400
and we know you have none of them because if you had any of them, we would know by now.

1093
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:01,840
There's no chance you got here with Huntington's disease and we missed it, or there's no chance

1094
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,640
you have some inborn error of metabolism that somehow got missed. Then we get into this whole

1095
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:18,960
GWAS morass. It's hard to explain to people how multifactorial these issues are. I find myself,

1096
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:25,200
maybe you do as well, somewhat frustrated by these discussions and the overemphasis on this

1097
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,560
genetic ... It's a little bit of the drunken the streetlight problem, right? When the guy is

1098
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,640
standing below the streetlight and you say, what are you doing here? He says, I'm looking for my

1099
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:38,240
keys and you say, did you drop them here? He says, no, but this is where the light is.

1100
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:45,520
Let me not increase the complexity, but give you another ammunition. We did,

1101
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:53,760
now several years ago because of funding, we did our 44 best first centenarians,

1102
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,000
their whole genome sequencing. Think about it. We have a study without control. We just have

1103
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,560
44 centenarians and we do the whole genome sequencing. Our question was, do centenarians

1104
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:12,400
have this perfect genome? Maybe one out of 10,000, they just don't have all this crap

1105
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:17,760
from the GWAS, those SNPs for heart and Alzheimer's and stuff. They're just great.

1106
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:27,360
We went to this dataset that's called ClinVar. ClinVar then had the 15,000 pathogenic mutation

1107
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:34,800
that most probably will cause a disease. Now they have about 30,000. Our hypothesis is that

1108
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:43,200
our centenarians don't have any of those. We'll support the perfect genome. 44 centenarians

1109
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:52,160
had more than 230 mutations between them, another five to six mutations that should have caused

1110
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:59,360
them diseases. None of them had this disease in 100 years of life. Some of those mutations,

1111
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,880
I'll give you the best example. They're for Parkinson and cancer and everything, but

1112
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:12,080
ApoE4. We have two ApoE4 100 years old people that the textbook would say they're

1113
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:18,000
demented at 70 and dead at 80 and they're not demented and not dead at 100.

1114
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:25,120
Do you think this at all explains the LPA uptick we see? Because one of my favorite topics is

1115
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:31,680
lipidology and of course, LPLiL-A is a very virulent lipoprotein and yet centenarians seem

1116
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:39,360
to have more of it than the general population. Exactly. We actually showed in a paper because

1117
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:54,720
we found a way. Obviously, we can have mutations that are protected because they have slow aging

1118
01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:03,600
or longevity genes that protect them. How do you prove that? We noticed that when you look

1119
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:10,640
cross-sectionally, I hope I can make it very simply, when we put any genotype cross-sectionally,

1120
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:19,120
in other words, we have all the ages from 50 to 112 is our oldest. We see patterns.

1121
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:26,560
If we see pattern that the genotype is declining with age, we know it's killing people.

1122
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:32,080
If we see that it's monotonically increased with age, like with the…

1123
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,120
Yeah, it's concentrating.

1124
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:39,040
Yeah, then means the people who are surviving are surviving with this mutation. That's why we have

1125
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:45,280
it more in 100. Like the example of rotomon receptor going for 3 to 12 in a monotonic way.

1126
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,000
We looked at LPLA, exactly.

1127
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:00,160
This is the most confusing of them all because I don't see any compelling evidence that LPLA

1128
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:07,680
is anything other than atherogenic. It begs the question, why would it concentrate in centenarians

1129
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,880
as opposed to just rise commensurate with the population?

1130
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:17,920
Exactly. This is the answer. First of all, we show cross-sectionally that LPA drops

1131
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,720
until the age of 80 by half. In other words, it kills half of the people.

1132
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,360
It's killing you like crazy until it's not.

1133
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,800
And then you look at that and you kind of try to understand, just a minute,

1134
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,360
now this thing that killed, now all of a sudden centenarians have even more.

1135
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,440
Right. It should stay flat after 80.

1136
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:46,080
It should be flat. Why is it increasing? Well, because it's a protected aging gene. In other

1137
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:54,400
words, it was obviously during evolutionary times. Are you saying that the thing that LPLA did for us

1138
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:00,160
500,000 years ago that is no longer beneficial in this lousy environment,

1139
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:03,760
the centenarians have managed to tap into its properties of?

1140
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:11,120
No. So what we did, and it's all published in computational biology journals,

1141
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:19,840
we took every one of the longevity gene that we have and we did gene to gene interaction.

1142
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:25,120
In other words, we tried to see if there is interaction between the bad genotype

1143
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,640
and the good genotype, the good longevity genotype. And we did it to a variety of those

1144
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:36,800
U shape. I'm telling you, there's a U shape. It goes down with aging and then it's good in

1145
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:47,600
centenarians. And we really found statistically significant that LPLA is protected by people who

1146
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:53,600
are homozygous to a CTP mutation that is a longevity mutation that we found before.

1147
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,960
That's the VV mutation.

1148
01:58:54,960 --> 01:59:02,400
The VV mutation. In other words, most of the people with the LPLA that are centenarians were also CTP

1149
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:04,800
mutation.

1150
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,320
So can we tell people what that phenotype is? So I've talked on this podcast a lot about CTEP

1151
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:16,160
and its role in reverse cholesterol transport, et cetera. Talk to me about what does the lipid

1152
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:21,600
panel look like for someone who is CTEP VV plus or minus LPLA?

1153
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:31,280
So those with CTP VV, they have higher HDL levels. They have larger lipoprotein particle size,

1154
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:39,680
and they have lower CTP levels. That's their phenotype. And this CTP has been protective

1155
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:43,920
against several age related disease. The most dramatic is cognitive decline.

1156
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:49,840
And by the way, the two APO E4 are also CTP VV carriers.

1157
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:57,680
So really the question is, it sounds to me like if you are CTEP VV, that's a very protective

1158
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:03,520
phenotype. And the difference, if I remember the data going from 70 to 80 was basically flat.

1159
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:09,680
If you're CTEP VV, it really goes up when you turn 80, meaning the concentration of

1160
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,360
CTEP VV.

1161
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,400
The genotype.

1162
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,840
Yes, the genotype goes up significantly once you hit 80.

1163
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:24,560
It goes in 55, it's 8% of the population and at 100, it's 20% of the population.

1164
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:31,680
So it's also important to know that not, first of all, the 8% that have VV, I don't know how many

1165
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:38,640
of them will be centenarians, right? And also not all centenarians are VV, but it's really,

1166
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,200
it's still very impressive.

1167
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:45,760
Because the problem with HDL cholesterol is it's just such a dumb ass metric. It's so useless.

1168
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:51,120
It's so far downstream that it doesn't tell us much. But the hypothesis here would have to be

1169
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:57,360
that these people have far more functional HDL particles. Because, I mean, we don't have to

1170
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:03,040
rehash this, but anytime you pharmacologically increase HDL cholesterol by inhibiting CTEP,

1171
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,880
nothing good seems to happen.

1172
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:10,560
Right. Because you're actually impairing the reverse cholesterol transport.

1173
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:11,040
Right.

1174
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,200
So it has to be with effect, right? That's why it's so-

1175
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,800
It has to be a functional-

1176
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,680
A functional thing of the HDL probably, or the lipoprotein particle side, or something else.

1177
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:23,360
So I understand all of that. Here's the part I still don't understand here.

1178
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:32,160
Why wouldn't the LPa phenotype or the LPA gene flatline after 80? In other words,

1179
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:38,720
I understand why CTEP VV is protective. I don't understand why LPa should concentrate.

1180
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:45,520
I think because the CTP is common and is very protective and that's why you do it. Look,

1181
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,440
it's a cross sectional. By the way, it's a good question. That's what we ask, why it's not flat.

1182
02:01:52,080 --> 02:02:02,960
But for a person who's born and is going to be a centenarian, for them, it's really not so,

1183
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,360
so they don't die when everybody dies.

1184
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:09,680
I need to do the math. We could do this over dinner. We'll sketch this out on a napkin. You

1185
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:14,240
take a hundred people who are going to be centenarians, a hundred people who are not,

1186
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:21,680
8% of each of them, call it 10% of each of them have LPA. We should do the math on if it's-

1187
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:25,760
Are we being fooled by the age? Because I do have one alternative hypothesis, by the way.

1188
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:30,800
Oh, I'll show you. I'll show you dinner. I'll show you the actual calculation.

1189
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,600
The computation. Okay, so this will be good. This will answer my question because the other hypothesis

1190
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,360
I've often wondered is, depending on- I'll start with my question and then I'll go to my hypothesis.

1191
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:48,880
How much phenotyping have you done on the LPA? Do you know how much heterogeneity is with their

1192
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,960
karingal repeats, for example?

1193
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:58,560
No. I don't have their LPA level. I have just their LPA genotype. So the things that we've done

1194
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:06,160
are though we can do- Actually, we've done a little bit on the CTP levels or we've done, but

1195
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:13,200
those calculation are on gene to gene interaction. Okay. Taking out the people without genotype and

1196
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:19,360
without genotype and seeing who are the people, who are the centenarians that stayed with the

1197
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:23,520
bed LPA genotype. They were only the ones who are CTP also.

1198
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,520
I see it. Do you have serum stored on these subjects?

1199
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:35,120
Yeah, but I have proteomics done and maybe we can have some measurement. I'm not sure.

1200
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:42,080
I wonder if there's a clue to a very vexing question, which is why is it that some people

1201
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:49,840
with high LPa do not go on to get premature heart disease? Many do. Most do. A significant number

1202
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:57,040
do not. And it appears completely uncoupled from the level of their LPa, which makes me wonder,

1203
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:04,560
are there virulent and non-virulent phenotypes that at the level of expression by number or

1204
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:11,600
molecular weight aren't captured? And my question then becomes, is the non-virulent one the one

1205
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:17,040
that is concentrating in the centenarians and are they the population in which we should understand

1206
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:23,040
that phenotype so we can better risk stratify the rest of us schleps walking around today,

1207
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:27,440
10% of whom have elevated LPa, but we don't know how aggressively to treat them.

1208
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:32,880
Yeah, I didn't know that there's virulent or non-virulent LPa. My explanation is totally

1209
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:39,120
gene to gene interaction. In other words, you do another phenotype. I guess the answer is

1210
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:47,280
different. What's the LPa? What's their CTP level? What's their HDL? What's their HDL particle size?

1211
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:55,440
And maybe you can see that generalize that if you inhibit CTP, the LPa is less interactive.

1212
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,920
I mean, I think the problem we, I agree with what you're saying. The challenge is we do not have an

1213
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,360
HDL functional assay. So right now we can measure HDL cholesterol, we can measure HDL particle number,

1214
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:10,800
and we can measure HDL size, but none of those come close to telling us how functional the particle is.

1215
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,680
Well, I have a collaboration with Dan Rader.

1216
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:13,920
Yep.

1217
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,720
Who's doing HDL efflux and stuff like that.

1218
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,800
Yeah. I mean, Dan is a God in this field.

1219
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:27,680
Yeah. So maybe, but that's not my, this is a past life for me. I moved on. So I don't really know

1220
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,720
to answer you. I didn't realize.

1221
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:35,440
Let's go back to the IGFGH thing because this one still creates tremendous,

1222
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:39,520
let's bring it back to clinical stuff. So I'm often asked by patients, hey,

1223
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:45,760
should I be on growth hormone? And my answer is I don't think so. But if I'm going to be brutally

1224
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:50,720
honest, I really don't know. I really have no insight into whether growth hormone is exogenous,

1225
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:56,400
administered growth hormone is harmful, helpful, neutral, or what, because the clinical data

1226
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:01,040
certainly don't give us the answer. Right. So the epidemiology, if you're in sort of, you know,

1227
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:05,920
Vaulter's camp is, that would be the worst thing you could ever do. Growth hormone is bad because IGF

1228
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:11,840
is bad. But again, the epidemiology tell a different story, tell a much more nuanced story that has to

1229
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:18,160
do with how high is too high at what age and for what gender and with respect to what disease.

1230
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:23,440
So of course, how can you manipulate IGF? Well, you can manipulate it. The two easiest ways to

1231
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:27,760
manipulate IGF, the three easiest ways to manipulate IGF or to manipulate growth hormone

1232
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:34,160
exogenously, manipulate IGF, diaterally, predominantly through amino acids and

1233
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:40,240
manipulate insulin to indirectly impair or enhance IGF binding proteins.

1234
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:45,600
Well, let me tell you, we just published a paper in Nature a month ago, a study that we're going

1235
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:53,120
also for a while. And what we did is we got from Amgen. Amgen, as much as other pharmaceuticals,

1236
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:59,120
tried to develop antibodies against IGF receptor because IGF receptor is expressed in many cancers.

1237
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:04,400
Yeah, this was the disaster drug that they tested against metastatic pancreatic cancer.

1238
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:12,000
It failed. But if I recall, there was a very special little gift, which is no CNS penetration.

1239
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:19,600
Am I thinking of the right one? Yeah, right. So it failed. But we're interested for aging.

1240
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:26,960
Yes. And not only we're interested for aging, our hypothesis was that IGF, you know, that you need to

1241
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:33,040
decrease IGF action in the periphery, but increase it in the brain because of the data.

1242
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:40,080
So we asked them to morenize their antibodies. Morenize means to make it available for a mouse.

1243
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:46,560
Right. And we got it and we did a longevity study that we started at 22 months.

1244
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:52,160
By the way, remind me in the human study, how much did it lower IGF in the periphery?

1245
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:52,960
It increased.

1246
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:57,120
I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry. How much did it lower IGF activity in the periphery? Was it a

1247
02:07:57,120 --> 02:08:00,000
reduction by what fold? Like, was it a two fold reduction?

1248
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,680
It's very hard to measure. You don't measure it like that. You measure it in, you know, in vitro.

1249
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:07,680
It's very hard to measure how much.

1250
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,560
Got it. Okay.

1251
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:13,040
And they rebounded a little bit with IGF, which is not the case with aging, because with aging,

1252
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:20,800
you don't have the growth hormone secretion. So we gave it to 22 months old animals that are 70,

1253
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:26,880
75 years of age equivalent. We increased their health spend dramatically and we increased their

1254
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:33,040
life spend by 10 percent at an older age. Okay. So this is a drug that's already was.

1255
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:36,640
And you were able to demonstrate. I'm sorry, I missed this paper. It came out a month ago.

1256
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:43,360
So I'll be inhaling it this time tomorrow. You basically showed that you didn't change IGF

1257
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,480
levels in the brain or you actually increased IGF levels in the brain.

1258
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:53,200
We really don't know. There is a little increase in IGF-1 level in the periphery. And we're assuming

1259
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,600
that we didn't make it a big, I'm telling you what we thought we didn't make it such a big deal. But

1260
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:07,520
obviously the antibodies do not cross the blood brain barrier. But the IGF wasn't lower if

1261
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:12,240
anything was high. Right. So if anything, IGF went up in the periphery because it was being blocked.

1262
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:16,880
And therefore a little bit more into it. So you could have had more CNS activity,

1263
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:22,000
less peripheral activity of IGF. Now, again, those were aging. By the way, it was in females. In

1264
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:29,600
males, we started to do the studies in males. And since we didn't see any major effects and we had

1265
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:36,000
relatively little, you know, those are months of studies in many mice. So we eventually did the

1266
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,400
longevity only in females. We don't have data on males, but the extent of health span, and you'll

1267
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:48,640
see the paper. It's really, it's a great paper with lots of studies. And it's impressive how much

1268
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:53,840
they did better the females with that. So there you have an example. We have all the

1269
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:59,680
paths where you ask, what do we do? Here is, it's been in humans. Okay. The IGF receptor

1270
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:06,960
antibodies there. The only problem for us is aging could be an indication what what's before aging.

1271
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:12,080
Like we need another indication in order to start selling it before. But what's your hypothesis in

1272
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:18,320
those mice, in the female mice that they, you said they live 10% longer and watch healthier.

1273
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:22,160
And much healthier. So they had compressed morbidity as well. They had a cardio, you know,

1274
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:27,920
they had the cardiovascular protection. They have cognitive advantage, functional

1275
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:34,640
advantage. There's a whole thing. The interesting thing between male and female, the difference

1276
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:41,840
is the mice, the female mice that were treated with IGF receptor antibody had a lot of

1277
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:49,440
of inflammatory markers, right? When we started, they were 22 months and those inflammatory

1278
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:56,640
markers were really decreased with aging in males. We had a little bit more inflammatory markers,

1279
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:05,440
but they increased with the IGF treatment. So maybe the fact. And both the males and the females

1280
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:10,320
had an increase in peripheral IGF, presumably the antibody was working in both of them. Right.

1281
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:16,560
But somehow the inflammatory response in males was different. So it's all driven. So I'm answering

1282
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:20,880
you two things. First of all, what do you do? Here's a good example of a drug that was in

1283
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:28,640
females. And we have preclinical proof of concept that it's good. But the second is in males,

1284
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:34,800
all those have not been shown. And in fact, you know, the functional that I told you,

1285
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:43,360
functional in women, it looks like the function was better for men with a higher IGF and not with

1286
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:49,360
lower, not statistically significant, but you could see that it might happen. So I'm telling you from

1287
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:56,480
human studies, from genetic studies, I'm telling you growth hormone treatment is not beneficial.

1288
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:04,000
It should be dangerous for elderly people, for elderly women with men. I'm ready to say that I'm

1289
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,960
not sure, you know, I'm not sure. It's not that I've shown that low IGF or growth hormone is better

1290
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:19,600
in males, not in my rodent studies and not in my human studies. But it's hard to say that giving

1291
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:26,240
growth hormone is bad when, you know, by the way, the growth hormone receptor story is a lot of them

1292
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:32,720
are males. That this is so interesting. I mean, this is such a layer of sophistication to this

1293
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:40,160
question, which I've largely sort of decided that I can't come up with a compelling reason for

1294
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:45,360
exogenous growth hormone. But I also can't see much evidence clinically that it's killing people.

1295
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:50,640
But of course, I think disproportionately the data are in men. What do you think explains this sex

1296
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:55,840
difference between men and women? I think I'm really if you look at this inflammatory panel,

1297
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:03,840
lots of cytokines and lots of animals, I'm not sure we don't have the intellectual link

1298
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,880
to say what happens. But this is something we want to actually go on and examine.

1299
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:17,280
Because if for some paradoxical way that is sex dependent, low IGF, increased inflammation,

1300
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:23,600
we want to do we want to know why and we want to know how we can affect it.

1301
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:29,840
It would be great if you could repeat the study with younger mice, both male and female again,

1302
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:35,680
because I mean, the most obvious example is the biggest difference between the men and the women

1303
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:42,800
of the sex hormones. And the older they get, that difference is still there. I mean, women will,

1304
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,600
you know, the female mice would go from having some testosterone to zero testosterone.

1305
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:56,560
But gosh, the men would probably still have more estrogen than the males have more estrogen than

1306
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:01,200
the females post menopause. Right. Which makes me wonder if the estrogen that projects on the

1307
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:08,240
testosterone are somehow predict a protective of the inflammatory effects. So there's a, you know,

1308
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:16,080
we're working on a grant because the sex issue is so interesting. We started working on there.

1309
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:22,800
Lots of models where you can change X and Y chromosomes and stuff like that. And, you know,

1310
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:27,760
we're looking at the way to look at the, because it's, I don't think it's usually as simple

1311
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:34,800
as the sex hormones. You know, I think we're missing a whole biology, a whole biology and

1312
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:40,400
whatever is the sex hormones, I don't understand the inflammation in that either. But by the way,

1313
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:48,160
your idea of doing it in young is good. Amgen sold this IGF receptor and we cannot get more

1314
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:54,160
samples, but we're interested to maybe do our own. Wait, wait. Amgen sold the rights to the human

1315
02:14:54,160 --> 02:15:00,320
antibody. Right. Their whole section, actually. Their whole section. To who? Which company owns

1316
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:06,640
it now? To like a private company that we're unable to get people to. Though I have to say,

1317
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:11,680
it's not our major priority now, but, and we have some consultants that are trying

1318
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:17,120
to get it together with those people. So, you know, it's still an issue, but I'll tell you

1319
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:26,080
if I had to develop a treatment, I would rather use the micro RNA 142 because the IGF receptor

1320
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:32,880
antibody didn't work in cancer, but maybe the micro RNA penetrates better in another way. And

1321
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:40,480
maybe that's the way to decrease IGF receptor in, you know, in cancers. So anyhow, but I really

1322
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:45,040
answered you is that, yeah, there are things that we could do to affect the pathway. I mean, what do

1323
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:49,520
you think about sort of all the, to me, the most obvious way to manipulate IGF is through fasting.

1324
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:56,000
So about once a quarter, I fast for a week with just water only. And it has a profound impact on

1325
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:03,600
my IGF level. So for my age, I think I should know these numbers off by heart, but plus or minus

1326
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:14,640
two standard deviations of IGF at my age is about 90 to 250. And if I take my, if I measure my IGF

1327
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:24,960
level before a fast right before a fast, it might be 180 to 200. And right after the fast, it's

1328
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:35,200
80 or 90. And six weeks later, it's maybe one 4150. So it sort of falls precipitously during the fast

1329
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:40,720
and then slowly rises and then falls precipit and slowly rises. And there's part of me that just

1330
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:47,360
wonders if a cyclic approach to IGF is a healthier approach than say, constitutively being calorically

1331
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:52,560
restricted and just, you know, cause you could starve yourself of methionine and eat no protein

1332
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:59,280
and live at a lower IGF level of maybe 110 forever. But I wonder if the real game is sort

1333
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,960
of figuring out this sort of cycle and periods of just, just as we think of autophagy, if you're

1334
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:09,520
always in the state of autophagy, that's a bad thing. If you never have autophagy, that's a bad

1335
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:16,240
thing. So, you know, about the calorie or the caloric restriction that the NIA funded in three

1336
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:22,080
centers. Yeah. Eric Ravison at Pennington was one of the main PIs. One of the things is that IGF

1337
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:28,880
level wasn't decreased in those people. Right. And we think IGF decrease is really important part of

1338
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:34,880
longevity, but we, we've, we learned something else and maybe I'm digressing because I'm sure you

1339
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:41,440
talked about it more that what we're doing in rats wasn't really caloric restriction. We're doing

1340
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:46,960
intermittent fasting because in our rodents, we would bring the food in the morning. They were

1341
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:54,400
hungry. Right. They would eat all the food, you know, the 60% whatever we gave to at Libidum,

1342
02:17:54,400 --> 02:18:04,640
and they were fasting for 23 hours and they had low IGF one level. But in Eric Ravison's studies,

1343
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:08,720
they didn't have low IGF because it wasn't caloric restriction like that. They gave them just less

1344
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:14,560
food throughout the day. Okay. And I think that was a big mistake that we realized we were doing.

1345
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:20,160
And it doesn't answer this. They're circulating. I think what we're trying to do at Einstein is

1346
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:28,240
we're doing a study. We know that autophagy is improved quite fast in fasting rodents.

1347
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:36,720
We don't know the timeline for humans. Okay. So we're trying to figure it out. And by the way,

1348
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:42,800
we can do with Anna Maria Cuervo, we can take T. lymphocytes and look at the autophagy on a

1349
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:48,000
time course in humans. And they actually reflect also autophagy in the brain. There's a lot of

1350
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,280
advantage in doing that. What are you looking at specifically in the assay? Well, there are several

1351
02:18:53,280 --> 02:19:00,000
things because there are several autophages, right? So macro autophagy or or chaperone mediated

1352
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:06,080
autophagy. So there are several things. Can you measure my topology also? Yeah, we can do, we do

1353
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:14,240
that. Yeah. How sensitive is it to meal timing? You know, like, for example, if a rodent is fasting

1354
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:20,640
for 24 hours, especially a mouse, I mean, that's, gosh, that's probably the equivalent of a human

1355
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:26,720
fasting for a week. Presumably autophagy is highly, highly, highly upregulated. If you give the mouse

1356
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:34,000
a little bit of chow and then measure that assay, does it obfuscate? Does it erase the fact that

1357
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:39,040
does it create the illusion, I guess I should say, that it's erased that they've had this

1358
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:43,760
high period of autophagy? Did you transiently truncate it? You know, Ana Marec Cuervo did,

1359
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:49,760
and I don't know the answer. I don't know the time course. But the important thing is to find

1360
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:56,480
the time course in humans so that we can really say, for example, what I'm doing basically is I'm

1361
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:03,760
trying not to eat after dinner until like lunchtime the next day. But do you really, I mean,

1362
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:07,200
so first of all, how hard is it to get an IRB at Einstein to study this in healthy

1363
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:10,960
concierge? No, we have IRB. We just wrote a grant. We need money for that.

1364
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,240
Yeah, I guess, you know, I have a whole framework around nutrition, which I'm happy to kind of walk

1365
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:21,600
through as we inhale our dinner tonight. Have you decided, by the way, if you are an Indian,

1366
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:28,160
Turkish, Persian, Greek, all of the above? Yeah, that sounds good. You know, because it's

1367
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:33,120
raining out. So I guess one of the things we could do to the closest. We'll figure it out.

1368
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:38,320
So my concern with time restricted feeding, which I practice quite liberally,

1369
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:44,560
is I'm worried it is not a significant enough deprivation of nutrients in humans. In other

1370
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:51,120
words, I think Sachin's data is so impressive in mice, you know, but I think that for a mouse to

1371
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:57,120
go 16 hours without eating is an enormous task. It might be the equivalent of us not eating for

1372
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:03,440
three days. And now that said, I'm struggling to see a downside of time restricted feeding. And I

1373
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:07,680
know that, you know, Walter and others have said time restricted feeding is somehow bad.

1374
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:12,080
I don't accept those arguments. I don't, I'm not convinced by those data. But this is a very

1375
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:16,080
interesting question you're asking. I would argue it's the most interesting question of all,

1376
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:23,120
because if we understand the time course of that, all of a sudden we can program nutrient exposure.

1377
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:29,360
And have you looked at that assay in the presence of rapamycin or metformin?

1378
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:35,840
I didn't, but metformin, Ana Maria Quervo is using metformin as the control for autophagy.

1379
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:42,640
Okay. It activates autophagy really well. Okay. So let's say I'm talking about in vitro assays.

1380
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:50,080
Okay. But we haven't measured it in, in patients. The, the one thing I should say,

1381
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:55,040
I just don't want to forget anything. Can I, can I absolutely, and it's, it's back to the

1382
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:02,080
metformin just reminded me it's back to metformin studies. So our reviewers were saying, you know,

1383
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:08,800
okay, all the data on the biology that you showed was from rodents. And we don't know

1384
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:15,280
that the biology is relevant to humans. Okay. Although of course the preliminary data in humans

1385
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:21,440
are much better than in rodents, right? The association with diseases. So we had a clinical

1386
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:29,680
study, a small clinical study, which we took 15 people that are 75 years old. And we gave some

1387
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:37,040
of them metformin for six weeks and other placebos, and then we crossed over and it was blinded. And

1388
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:43,040
we took it at the end of each period, we took biopsy from their muscle and biopsy from their

1389
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:51,680
adipose tissue. Okay. So not liver. And we looked at the transcript and the metabolomics, but mainly

1390
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:59,040
the transcripts in the tissues to see effects on metformin. And there are three interesting things.

1391
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:06,720
First of all, when they brought me their clinical results, you know, insulin, HOMA, glucose and all,

1392
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:12,400
there were significant effects in many of them, statistically significant effects, but I was

1393
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:18,720
expecting more. I started to try and break it down. And then we found out that the people who

1394
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:24,720
were last on metformin, although it was half of the people had much more significant results

1395
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:32,000
than the whole 15 people. Wait, explain that again. The people in the crossover who started,

1396
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:39,920
who went placebo to metformin had better effects on metabolic parameters relative to themselves

1397
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:47,120
or to their peers. Relatively to themselves. Because this was a person to person. This was a

1398
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:55,760
paired T test. And the reason is that probably the two weeks wash over is not enough when you

1399
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:03,120
fix the assaging, it lasts for a while. Okay. So if you got metformin and then placebo, you didn't

1400
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:09,680
really, you went halfway back. Also by the way, because metformin is associated with weight loss

1401
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:15,440
and they lost a little weight that on itself really made them on the second. Yeah. Yeah.

1402
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:18,720
And what, it's funny you bring that up. I'm glad you were mentioned that. What do you think

1403
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:26,320
explains the weight loss phenotype of metformin? So when I started taking metformin, which was 2010,

1404
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:32,000
I didn't mess around. I just went straight to 2.5 grams a day. I didn't even mix it up. I don't

1405
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,640
think I took it BID. I mean, I took two, 2,500 milligrams first thing every morning. And after

1406
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:44,320
a month, I lost quite a bit of weight, but I was also nauseous 24 seven. I mean, the thought of

1407
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:49,600
eating was repulsive to me. I still ate, you know, I was exercising a lot and doing all my usual

1408
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:55,360
shenanigans, but I clearly ate less just because of that low grade feeling of nausea. Today, when I

1409
02:24:55,360 --> 02:25:02,080
prescribe metformin to patients, I have them start at 500 QHS, then 500 BID, then 50, you know,

1410
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:08,560
500 in the morning, 1500 before bed, then one gram BID is sort of standard dose. And I

1411
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:14,720
see far less of that nausea and I see far less weight loss. What other mechanisms do you think

1412
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:20,480
it could explain the weight loss? So could it be lactic acid going up, you know, just like ketones,

1413
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:26,240
you get a substrate, an additional substrate? Yeah, I don't know. But look, I started metformin

1414
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:32,800
several years ago because I was pre-diabetic. My doctor did it. So it's before, I'm glad that he

1415
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:40,560
did, but it was before I thought much about it. And I was just surprised after three months to

1416
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:46,160
realize that I lost, you know, seven or eight pounds. I was surprised because I couldn't,

1417
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:54,000
I was nauseated. I wasn't anything. I must have eaten less. I was less hungry. I reacted better.

1418
02:25:55,360 --> 02:26:01,840
I reacted better to my body, right? To my leptin. Maybe I reacted better and I probably didn't eat

1419
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:09,440
as much, not totally not noticing it. It was a surprise. Yeah. It's funny. I tell patients not

1420
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:13,360
to expect that because I don't, I don't like the idea of patients thinking of this as like a weight

1421
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:18,160
loss drug. To me, that sort of is not the right way to think about it, but I've never had a great

1422
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:23,120
explanation. And by the same token, I have had, I should be clear. I've had also some patients who

1423
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:27,280
they've come back and they've lost 10 pounds. And these are patients who were not overweight. This

1424
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:32,480
is not, you know, this is someone that by everybody's standard would be completely normal weight,

1425
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:38,560
BMI is 24, body composition is reasonable and comes back in, you know, in three months and

1426
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:42,880
they've lost 10 pounds. But I guess for, in my, at least in my practice, that seems to be the

1427
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:48,240
exception and not the rule, but very, very interesting to hear. You know, I guess, of course,

1428
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:52,880
you wish that was more than a two by two, two week. You wish that was a 12 week by 12 week.

1429
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:57,760
We're doing the same thing with Acrobos now. And we're doing longer study with longer washing

1430
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:02,560
period because we want to get away from that. But back to metformin, I said that's one thing

1431
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:09,680
is this metformin last issue. The second thing that we showed that most of the transcripts changes

1432
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:15,120
were relative to this, to the tissue. You know, in fat, it was more free fatty acid metabolism and

1433
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:19,840
the muscle was more pyruvate metabolism. So it was appropriate. In other words, there wasn't

1434
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:27,200
the metformin, you know, the metformin part, but in both tissues, there were genes that are not

1435
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:35,200
metabolic genes, you know, like BRCA1 or myofibril genes and other things that are related to aging,

1436
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,240
but they are not metabolic. They change by metformin. In other words, the concept that

1437
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,520
metformin is not only metabolic, it's aging. Okay.

1438
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,600
Like BRCA1 changed?

1439
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:53,440
Yeah. You know, some other gene, genes that are associated with DNA repair changed significantly.

1440
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,680
The second-

1441
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:00,560
Did you see in the muscle, by the way, if you still have biopsies, I'd be very curious to know

1442
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:09,200
if the lactate transporter out of the muscle, I'm blanking on it, it's MCT2. In other words,

1443
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:12,960
as people make more and more lactate in the muscle, do they get more and more efficient at

1444
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:18,240
shuttling it back to the liver? And if so, you would expect MCT2 transport-

1445
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,640
The gene expression changes by that.

1446
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,280
Yeah.

1447
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:25,840
You know, we have the raw data. It didn't come up, I'll tell you, it didn't come up as a winner,

1448
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,320
but that doesn't mean it's not changed.

1449
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:32,800
And you looked at genome or you looked at messenger as well? You looked at mRNA?

1450
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:34,480
Only message. It's transcript.

1451
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:35,760
It's all mRNA.

1452
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:36,080
Right.

1453
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,240
It's all mRNA. Okay. So you should have seen it if it happened.

1454
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:42,560
Well, if it was highly, I mean, there are hundreds of changes, okay? So-

1455
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:46,080
Yeah, maybe this was underpowered to see that difference.

1456
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:51,600
Significant changes. So I can still answer you, I can still answer you specifically.

1457
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:58,480
And it's RNA6, so it's really good. It will be good. You know, if I take that and see that it can

1458
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:02,960
be without taking into account that there are 400 other changes, it can be significant.

1459
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:09,200
The other thing though, what you do with transcript, you look at upper regulators

1460
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:14,480
of the system and there's a way to do that. That's what everybody does now.

1461
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:20,400
So if you look at the upper regulators, you get back to the same things that are affecting aging,

1462
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:26,560
AMP, kinase, mTOR, all those pathways were affected by metformin, except that

1463
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:33,600
what you measured below is the tissue specific effects, but it was all related back straight to aging.

1464
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:36,480
You know, it breaks my heart.

1465
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:43,600
And so we really connected not only the clinical data, but the biological data in humans

1466
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:44,880
to the tame study.

1467
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:51,280
Yeah, it's wonderful. You know, a few years ago when my father was diagnosed with cancer,

1468
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:57,760
I immediately put him on metformin. And, you know, in his infinite wisdom, his primary care doctor

1469
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:04,400
took him off it, because, you know, why would you put him on metformin? And in the end, my father

1470
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:09,440
decided his primary care doctor knows much more than I do and so remains off metformin. But

1471
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:14,160
certainly this discussion, because I, you know, I probably know more about metformin than the

1472
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:18,160
average person, but this discussion has been completely illuminating. There's one other thing

1473
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:23,040
I want to ask you about, which is all of the discussion around NAD. I mean, you know quite

1474
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:28,480
a bit about this. What is your take right now based on the state of the science that we have,

1475
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:34,880
which admittedly, I think we're just scratching the surface of as far as first and foremost,

1476
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:40,400
just at the mechanistic level. What is your belief that orally administered nicotinamide

1477
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:45,280
riboside can actually make it into a cell? I don't know if you've seen it, but Joshua Benowitz's

1478
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:51,360
paper over the summer would suggest, no, most of this is going to deliver. So wouldn't this sort

1479
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:58,480
of call into question the companies, there's two of them right now, Chromadex and Elysium, that sell

1480
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:05,280
basically nicotinamide riboside plus or minus teristilbene. What do you think explains the

1481
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:11,280
reported efficacy of those agents in light of Rabinowitz's NAD Tracer study? First of all,

1482
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:19,840
the Rabinowitz study was also criticized, okay? Time course and other things, which,

1483
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:27,360
okay, I'm just saying that. But I think really the biggest issue here, I want just to use this

1484
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:35,680
opportunity to say that a lot of what we're doing is not based on clinical studies, okay?

1485
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:44,880
And it really just underlines the fact that unless you do a clinical study, you can remain guessing.

1486
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:52,800
Now I'll tell you, I'm taking a good preparation of NMN, okay? Tell the listener the difference

1487
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:58,640
between NR and NMN because they're both precursors to NAD, but there's a subtle difference.

1488
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:05,680
Yeah, and I don't know to explain that really well. I don't care that much about that.

1489
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:08,160
Okay, but in theory, one is slightly more stable than the other.

1490
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:13,520
Right. It's a stability issue, availability issue, but they'll fight and we don't know which

1491
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:21,120
is the better and we don't know which gets to the tissue, right? Yeah. But what I wanted to say

1492
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:29,200
is the following. So the answer is it could all be water, okay? It could all be this.

1493
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,680
You say that as you hold up the bottle of Topo Chico.

1494
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:37,680
Right, sorry. You didn't see that in the microphone? Okay. But what I'm doing now is

1495
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:44,800
I'm opening my Fitbit, okay? And one of the things that the Fitbit has is sleep, okay?

1496
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:46,640
Do you use Fitbit?

1497
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:49,600
No, I use something called Aura, which works much better.

1498
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:50,000
Okay.

1499
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:51,760
Yeah, this really measures sleep well.

1500
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:59,440
Do you get also the deep sleep and the REM and all that? Okay. Since I started taking NMN,

1501
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:06,960
and it might be a coincidence, so I have to stop it and start again, but my sleep has been much

1502
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:12,720
better. That means I have in the beginning of the night, I have much more deep sleep and at the end

1503
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:19,760
of the night, I have much more REM. And I thought if there's anything I can say about it, is that

1504
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:25,760
just because of this association, okay? But I don't believe it, right? Because it's not a,

1505
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,440
it's a smile, it's me and-

1506
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:28,320
It's empirical and anecdotal.

1507
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:32,880
Many things could have looked, I was in vacation. I don't know. Many things could have happened.

1508
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:36,960
Do you take the NMN by itself or do you also pair it with Terrestil Bean or-

1509
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:37,280
No, just-

1510
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,720
Another Surtuin activator.

1511
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:44,960
No, just NMN. But it's a good suggestion maybe. Okay, but then I run into

1512
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:52,560
Imai. Do you know who's Shin Imai? He is from St. Louis and he has his own

1513
02:33:53,600 --> 02:34:02,400
patents and studies in Japan on NMN. And he tells me unprovoked. He says, I have 200 subjects and

1514
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:07,920
one of the interesting thing is their sleep patterns improve. They get more deep sleep in

1515
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:13,440
the beginning of the night and more REM at the end of the night. In other words, he tells me

1516
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:22,640
what I've noticed and it makes me just think and maybe believe and maybe hope that something is

1517
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:30,640
getting into the cells and that there's a real effect, at least on sleep. He didn't tell me any

1518
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:38,400
other things. But really my answer is we don't really know enough. It's very hard to measure

1519
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:46,400
effect because this NAD goes and goes away and what system can you do? It's very hard to measure

1520
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:56,080
that. And without clinical studies that are really well controlled, I think it's going to be hard

1521
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:02,720
to just support that. And that's me as a conservative scientist and one who says

1522
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:08,320
that even metformin that everybody says, you have enough data. No, we have to do the clinical

1523
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:15,360
study to prove that. And that's where I really stand. And it seems to me that intravenous

1524
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:22,160
administration of NAD is also not particularly helpful, though it seems quite popular in the

1525
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:28,560
sense that I haven't seen compelling evidence that giving NAD intravenously makes its way into

1526
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:34,560
the cell either. So I think the development, the interesting development will be to develop

1527
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:42,640
a drug and the drug will be a precursor that will get into the blood outside of the liver.

1528
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:49,120
Outside of the liver. Yeah, exactly. So if you could give NR or NMN sublingually or intravenously,

1529
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:57,520
that strikes me as very interesting. Saying that there's a lot of data in rodents where also you

1530
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:03,040
look, you give it in different ways. You give it some in water, but some are gavage and maybe

1531
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:08,000
that's different because one of the problems, maybe if you go deep enough, you can bypass

1532
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:14,880
the portal circulation. Right. You can bypass something. But the in vivo studies are good

1533
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:20,640
studies. You just don't know what it means to humans. Well, Nir, I'll do a time check here.

1534
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:25,440
We've been going at this for a little while. There's a lot more I want to pick your brain on,

1535
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:31,040
but we could also just sit down and do this again sometime. I want to make sure you've said at least

1536
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,320
as much as you want to say about metformin because I think that to me is, you know, you're at this

1537
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:41,440
point, arguably one of the world's experts on a drug that just to put this in perspective,

1538
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:46,720
I think Lou Cantley, who is obviously a close mutual friend of ours and James Watson, who I

1539
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:54,000
don't know personally, have both said quite publicly that metformin may have already saved

1540
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:59,600
more patients lives from cancer than all other cancer drugs combined or something to that effect.

1541
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:05,600
This is a drug that I think with each passing day, more and more people are beginning to learn

1542
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:11,440
about beginning to ask questions about. And my hope is that if nothing else, this podcast is a

1543
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:17,040
place that people can listen to this episode if they can't go and read 16 of your papers and they

1544
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:22,480
don't necessarily want to get, you know, that far down the rabbit hole. But to hear it from you and

1545
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:27,200
not from me or some other schmuck who doesn't know much, I want to make sure that if there's

1546
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:31,520
anything else you want to say about metformin that you say so. And so is there anything else

1547
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:37,600
that you want to add? Well, let me do one practical thing and one a little bit more philosophical.

1548
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:45,280
Okay. The practical thing that really surprised me, I was giving a talk somewhere for lay people.

1549
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:51,040
So it was organized by a university and they invited people and to their surprise, there

1550
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:58,640
are 300 people in the audience. And by the way, my talk wasn't about metformin. My talk,

1551
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:05,680
the titles of my talk is usually How to Die Young in a Very Old Age. That's what my title is. Usually

1552
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:12,480
if I can get away with it, that's a good title. So people are coming and as they're entering,

1553
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:17,840
some of them come to me and say, so how much metformin should I take? Okay. So I started talking

1554
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:26,400
and all of a sudden I said, let me ask you something. Who here in the audience is non-diabetic

1555
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:33,360
and is on metformin? And please, you don't have to just if you choose to. So how many?

1556
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:39,360
Half of the people. Where was this talk? What university? I don't want to. Okay. What city?

1557
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:45,520
Can you say what city? Was it in the United States? No. Okay. Fair enough. So you know,

1558
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:53,040
in other words, the prophecy is out, which makes me a little bit worried about the study.

1559
02:38:53,680 --> 02:39:01,040
When we first, Wall Street Journal is the first that picked on Tame, wrote an article the next

1560
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:08,960
week, we had 3000 phone calls and emails of people volunteering to the study, which is what we need

1561
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:13,760
to do the study. And I thought it was just cut your work. You trim that budget from 70 million

1562
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,640
down to 65. You cut all the recruiting costs out. Exactly. Except that then you realize. Yeah,

1563
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:23,120
it's a bias sample. Then you realize just a minute. Those people, first of all, we didn't advertise.

1564
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:30,480
They had to find my phone number and email. And second, they'll do, they're doing other things.

1565
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:34,560
You know, it's like with the estrogen bias, they're probably exercising and stuff like that.

1566
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:40,800
And then when I started getting emails, like I'm volunteering to the study, as long as I'm not on

1567
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:47,680
the placebo, I thought, you know, if people care so much, if they'll figure out they're not on

1568
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:56,160
mid-forming, they'll just get mid-forming. So from recruiting the 3000, we, we outlawed those. Those

1569
02:39:56,160 --> 02:40:04,400
are not in my study, right? So I want to say that still we haven't done the study. Okay. We haven't

1570
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:11,040
done this study. So you're between 65 and 80. Okay. Just know we haven't done the study. We don't

1571
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:19,920
know if it's safe as it is in young people. And so we don't have really a clinical study with evidence

1572
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:26,400
that this is good. And I'm, I'm just worried now that part of the reason to do this study is because

1573
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:32,480
if it's not good, people should know also, right? And not take another drug. Okay. Not that I believe

1574
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:39,680
but it is possible. The second thing that is more philosophical. So I said before that I was

1575
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:45,680
invited to the Vatican. I actually was invited twice the second time. And I'm very close to

1576
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:53,120
Cardinal Ravasi, who's a number four in the pontiffs. He's in charge of science and

1577
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:59,120
on arts that is including science. And it's interesting because the Vatican basically says,

1578
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:05,520
we don't want to be in a Galileo Galilei situation again. We don't want to be in a situation where

1579
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:11,200
the science is so right and we're so wrong that we don't know what to do with it. Okay. And so they

1580
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:16,000
called me and they said, you know, we have a meeting in the Vatican. We'd like you to talk about

1581
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:22,000
aging. Could you come and say, I said, sure, sure. I'll come. And then I'm going on and saying, am I

1582
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:30,640
the keynote speaker? They said, the keynote speakers are the Pope and Joe Biden, who was vice

1583
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:38,080
president. I said, okay, sorry, sorry, I'm still coming. So that's how it goes. Joe Biden goes up

1584
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:44,720
and explains his cancer initiative and how difficult it is because when you have cancer,

1585
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:50,880
you have in the cancer, maybe five other genomes and they're also different than every other cancer

1586
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:59,760
like that in the world. It's really a mess. Then comes the Pope and says, you know, I still hope

1587
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:07,200
that there'll be one little peel cheap for everyone in the world that will cure whatever cancer they

1588
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:15,840
wear. Appropriate. I hope so too. But then I go up and I say, well, there is actually a cheap

1589
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:23,360
peel like that. And I don't know if it cures any cancer in the world, but it can prevent a lot of

1590
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:28,720
the cancers in the world. And actually it has a side effect that it also can prevent a lot of

1591
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:38,560
other diseases in the world. So it was like, you know, going back to aging and the risk of aging

1592
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:47,520
for age related diseases and how impactful and cheap it could be compared to treating cancer

1593
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:55,600
or something like that. So I think the prevention of aging is really a good place to be. And I

1594
02:42:55,600 --> 02:43:00,880
think because we went from hope to promise and we have to realize the promise, the thing in life is

1595
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:06,720
going to be very different in the last next decade with our advance. Last question, and not to end

1596
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:12,560
on a downer, but let's try to figure out where a blind spot could be. What could, where could we

1597
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:19,360
be wrong? Obviously you and I share more in common in terms of philosophy and points of view than I

1598
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:26,720
even realized before we spoke, but where could we be wrong? So, you know, I'll tell you what's my

1599
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:34,640
optimism. You know, we have the European have nine pillars of aging and we have seven pillars of

1600
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:42,400
aging and they're all inter connected. And when I say interconnected, I just spent the time with

1601
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:53,360
Anna Maria Quervo this morning when she fixed autophagy, she fixes also metabolism. Okay. There,

1602
02:43:53,360 --> 02:44:01,120
when, when you start doing things in any one of those pillars, you start improving the others.

1603
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:08,400
Now where we could, could be wrong is we don't know what is the impact of each of those

1604
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:18,400
pathway in humans. Okay. Most of our data is kind of animal data, but I think our fallback is that

1605
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:29,360
we all age. The advantage of in aging is that aging is universal. Every, every animal

1606
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:39,280
has the skin, the hair, the skeletal, the frailty. It's very universal. And those treatments are

1607
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:47,040
mid-form in Rapamycin. You give it to any animal, it almost delays the aging there. So I don't think

1608
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:54,160
we're going to be wrong. I think that maybe some pathways will not be so effective. Some of them

1609
02:44:54,160 --> 02:45:00,960
will be harder to treat maybe, but I think we have to effect three, four, and we're right on our

1610
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:06,880
way to do better. And that's just the beginning. And in the tame study, will it be one to one,

1611
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:12,560
male to female? Yes. So we'll also avoid that other, and have you powered it such that men and

1612
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:18,000
women are different animals? Well, no, because all our data on mid-forminin, we looked carefully to

1613
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:24,160
the DPP and other, they didn't see any gender effects on any of the outcomes. So we're assuming

1614
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:27,440
that- So you're powered as though the genders don't have a significant- That there are different,

1615
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:33,760
right? Like we would do maybe Rapamycin, you know? Yeah. Well, Nir, this has been fantastic.

1616
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:38,560
I was sick the last two days. My voice is gone. I feel like crap. I was like,

1617
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:43,680
ah, maybe we should postpone it. But then when I woke up this morning, I was like, there is no way

1618
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:48,480
we are postponing this discussion because I cannot wait to have this discussion. So

1619
02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:55,200
thank you so much for coming over. It was great. It was great because you asked really great

1620
02:45:55,200 --> 02:46:00,880
questions. And also I'm now quite hungry and I'll be happy to have dinner with you now.

1621
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:07,520
We are going to put together a seminar on how not to calorically restrict-

1622
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:10,560
Tonight, only tonight. All right. Thank you, Nir.
