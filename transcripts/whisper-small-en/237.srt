Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,940
Bill, thanks so much for coming by. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,000
I have too. I'm really honored to be on your podcast.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,800
So, I don't know, a little while ago I made a video on Instagram where I talked about

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,600
sort of three books I've read in the last 12 months that I didn't expect to sort of,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,000
A, have such an impact on how I thought about things, but also B, even though they're completely

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,760
different books, they strike me as having kind of a unifying theme in this sort of thing

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,520
about quality of life. So, the three books are, one of them was From Strength to Strength,

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,580
one of them is 4000 Weeks, and the other one is Die with Zero. Now, what's interesting

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,820
is I know exactly who suggested I read 4000 Weeks, and I'm really good friends with the

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,720
author of From Strength to Strength, so that's why I just read that knowing it was coming

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,800
out. I still don't remember who recommended Die with Zero to me, but I remember just thinking,

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,200
okay, well, cool, sounds interesting, ordered it, and then kind of just couldn't put it

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,880
down. And as I think I mentioned in the video, immediately made my wife read it, and then

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,240
immediately just went out and bought many copies of it, along with many copies of the

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,720
other two books. So, I basically started handing them out as like a triplet copy. Like if someone

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,120
was over and they hadn't read them, boom, they were leaving with all three copies of

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,640
the book. So, that speaks to kind of why I wanted to sit down with you, and I guess I

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,720
just ... Let's give people a sense of who you are. So, you grew up in Jersey, right?

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah, I grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey. You're an engineer, we have that in common,

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,560
right? Yeah, except I don't want people to be impressive as an engineer. We had a saying

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,600
on the football team, Ds get degrees until later I found out, wait, you can't graduate

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,800
with a D in engineering, you have to at least get a C. So, I barely graduated. I was just

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,400
super slacker. So, I don't want to be like, I'm an engineer. What position did you play?

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,440
The bench. I played the bench, but I was a defensive back, a cornerback at the University

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,720
of Iowa. But did it pay for school? No, no, I was actually a walk-on. I was trying to

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,960
get a scholarship, I had a partial scholarship, which means they just give you some food.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:33,720
I basically broke my leg at the growth plate, was pretty much has been before I ever was.

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,160
But when you love football, you love the sport, you never want to let go, right? You're not

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
like, oh, I'll just dive into my studies and pick up this hobby. You're kind of like

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,760
football is life at that age. So, what took you straight? So, you graduated college with

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
the degree in engineering, maybe you're not first in your class. You decide though, you're

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
going to go and instead of going to grad school or something like that, you're like, I'm going

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,960
to go to New York. Is that your first job? Yeah, I mean, I love that. Not first in my

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,160
class, the understatement of the year. I was kind of like lost, didn't know what I

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,840
wasn't do, really was pretty much a slacker, underachiever at the time. And my Godfather

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
calls me with one of those, like, what are you going to do with your life at the point?

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
And I knew I didn't want to go into engineering. It was kind of this cookie cutter life. You

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
don't really have any kind of entrepreneurial spirit in it. You work on like a subsection

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,480
of a chip, here's your career path, etc. It was all kind of laid out for you. And that

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,640
was unattractive to me. It kind of seemed like death to me. And at the time I saw this

42
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,560
movie Wall Street. And I was like, Oh, that's what I want. I want to be rich. I want to

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,240
go work in stocks. So, when my Godfather called me, I go, I want to be a stockbroker or a

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,520
stock trader. And he goes, I don't know anything about equities, but there's this firm. And

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,320
mind you, I didn't know what a commodity was that's looking for screen clerks. Go check it out.

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,040
And so, I got an introduction. Came with my resume.

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,040
This is what you're like, late 80s, early 90s?

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Like 91. And takes my resume, tears it up, shows me, walks me around the floor. People are yelling

49
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,600
and screaming. And, you know, they're kind of casual wear. And it's like trading places. And

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm like all this energy. And I'm like, Wow, that that guy can be rich. So can I. And so,

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
they didn't want to hire me, actually. They were looking to give the job to someone else,

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,160
another friend of the firm. So, I like kind of hung out downstairs waiting every day calling like,

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
can I come up? Can I get this job as a peon? Can I get, can I become a peon here? Can I become a

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,560
peon? And finally, after three days, they let me become a peon.

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
So, what did that job entail?

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,760
It's checking trades and sneaking sandwiches on the floor for traders. It's like literally the

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,960
version, the worst version of the mail room. Right. But the system, the old days where guys

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,000
would yell and scream across the pit and write their trades on a pick card and also in their

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,600
trade book. They throw the pick cards into the center. There's a guy with glasses and a giant

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,040
net. And all these cards will go to him. They would catch him, put him in the, down the chute,

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,920
and they would be entered into a computer system. Okay. My job was to check the traders log versus

62
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,760
the computer's log. Right. Your name becomes your trader. So, if your trader was why not or SMM,

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,920
S&M, that was your name. So, clerks are running around the floor going, why not? S&M, why not?

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,240
And then, you know, if you're, if you're why not, you're like, why not here? I got a, I got an

65
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,720
error here. I know selling five lots at 5480, not three lots at 5480. What do you know? And if you

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,200
know the same trade, then it's a simple process to correct it in the system. Right. And if you don't,

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,680
you're like, no, no, I definitely know only three lots. Right. Then you go to the traders immediately

68
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,320
and they kind of reconcile it. And that was a system like running around all day, you know,

69
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,720
checking trades. So, this is, this job is down on Wall Street. This firm's on Wall Street. Yeah.

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,120
So, back when the World Trade Center was there, this was in for World Trade Center.

71
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,320
And how much were you learning the business? Because I imagine one could take a job like that

72
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,400
and not actually learn what's happening, like what the machine is doing. Yeah.

73
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,360
That's when I decided to turn it on. You know, I always tell people like, hey,

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,480
I was pretty much a, can I say fuck up? Yeah. I was pretty much the fuck up of fuck ups, right?

75
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,200
For given what I had before college. But then I decided to turn it on. And like that poverty,

76
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,520
that like being a peon and not, and that desire to make it forced me to be like, I'm going to

77
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,480
learn every single thing there is about this business. I was reading books at night about trading,

78
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,520
about the oil business, about options, about whatever. I was a sponge. And I really turned

79
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,800
it on and said, I'm going to be diligent. I'm not going to mess around. And as much as I possibly

80
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,040
can as a 20 year old, right? And really, really trying to make myself invaluable no matter where

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,880
I was. So, where were you living at the time? What part of the city? Did you actually live in

82
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,320
Manhattan? No, no. I mean, when I first got there, I had to live at home with my mom, which was

83
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,280
completely cramping my style. And so I was like, I started driving a limo at night, the company

84
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,040
limo at night to make ends meet. What were you getting paid in that first job? Oh, geez. I think

85
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,760
it was sub $16,000 a year. I have to have to go look. Sub 16. Yeah. I think it was like 16,000,

86
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,360
but I was getting raises very quickly because I made myself valuable and I would work at night

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,680
and I would make more money driving the limo on a daily basis because traders would like take me

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,120
here and be drunk and they tip you. And you weren't there necessarily for your current

89
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,760
income. You were there for your future income. And so I had another clerk named Jason Rufo,

90
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:20,720
who had a studio on the Upper West Side. And what he did was he put up a wall by the kitchen and

91
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,760
kind of made this small room in the studio. And I eventually got an apartment with him on the

92
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,320
West Upper West Side living in like a pizza oven type of space. But it was great because I was in

93
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,560
New York City. I was out of my mom's house. I could have girls over, you know what I mean? And that

94
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,440
pride that goes, well, I live on the Upper West Side. Everybody wants to say they live in New York

95
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,200
City. And so as I was getting raises and kind of moving up, you know, I gradually got into that

96
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
life of, you know, what I call a Buppy, black urban professional, you know, Buppies and Yuppies.

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
And that was kind of the beginning of my journey.

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
Tell me, was your dad in the picture at this time?

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:18,560
So my dad is now older in poor health in Jersey City. So during this time, he'd had multiple strokes.

100
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,760
My dad is kind of like me, which is he's fairly stubborn, but he was stubborn to the extreme.

101
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,040
You know, doctor says, don't do this. All the things you would tell him not to do and you

102
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,440
need to be doing. He's like, ah, the hell with that. You know what I mean? I guess. And so

103
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
he's in the picture. My parents are divorced. He's in Jersey City.

104
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
And had your parents gone to college?

105
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,520
My dad did. So my dad got a scholarship to the University of Iowa. Like he was a real bad ass.

106
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,000
He had no intentions of going to school. He walked by a football field when he was a kid

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
in high school. He's like, I want to do that. And coaches like you don't know anything about

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
football. And he says, it seems like it's about hitting people. I know how to hit people. So they

109
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,520
give him some raggedy uniforms. And next, you know, he comes out for a practice. And in the

110
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,720
next practice, he has a brand new uniform. He winds up, you know, he's all everything gets

111
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,120
recruited to go to University of Iowa to go to college. And so there he is in college in 1959,

112
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,240
the University of Iowa, you know, all bad ass from Jersey City. So he had gone to college.

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,680
And then my mom went to college, finished college while I think it was like young teen early

114
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,040
preteen or late teens. But so they I had the benefit of two college educated parents.

115
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,680
And how much were they understanding your call it hunger, your drive, your aspirations in this

116
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,960
new role? I mean, because presumably they had seen you in high school and college,

117
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,080
not achieving at your potential. And now all of a sudden, you're hustling, you're working two jobs,

118
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
you're reading, you're learning, you're doing everything. Were they were they, you know,

119
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,200
purview to that sort of metamorphosis in you? They saw it later. You know, I'm the kid that

120
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
like didn't take out the garbage, right? Like it's I always say don't tell your parents your

121
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,160
dreams because they'll just piss on them, right? Because they've seen you at your worst, at your

122
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,360
failures as you're growing, right? It's like they they they have this kind of image of you

123
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,040
when you were the caterpillar, not the butterfly. And so, you know, you weren't necessarily like

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,440
advertising to them. No, no, no, it started it started, you know, they started seeing it,

125
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,000
right? Like, I remember the time when I finally made more than I got a raise and I was like,

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,200
did the calculation, just like, Holy shit, I make more money than my mom. Like, I've made it. Like,

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,080
it was one of the happiest days of my life. I'm like, I'm real. I'm legit. I'm a puppy. You know,

128
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,120
me with my badge, you know, used to wear around as a badge of honor. Like, I get onto the New York

129
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,880
Mercantile Exchange, etc. But, you know, they'd see like, I'm going out or I'm flying here or I'm

130
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,120
doing whatever. And it's like, oh, the kid, kid must be doing okay. You know, it wasn't until I

131
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,880
got recruited to go to Houston, you know, started buying the assets that adults start buying.

132
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,960
And and I paid my mom back for something that I did when I was a teenager that she didn't

133
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:27,360
know that they're like, okay, what was that? So when I was younger, I, I, I had a stick Toyota that

134
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:36,000
my mom had. It was her car. I was driving it. And my friend Pete Theibel, it's like, I want to drive

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
the car. I want to teach him how to drive the car. I'm gonna drive the car. I'm not supposed to really

136
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,120
drive the car. So anyway, long story short, he hits the gas instead of the clutch, spins the car out,

137
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,480
the back of it spins around hits a telephone pole. Trump pops up and has this big giant dent. I'm like,

138
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:59,280
holy shit, what am I gonna do? You know, so I tell my mom the story that, you know, we went to go get

139
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,080
pizza and parked it and then, you know, truck must have hit it on the side or bumped it and went on.

140
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,600
And that was my lie to my mom about this car that I felt guilty about. I said, one day I'm gonna

141
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:18,160
pay for this car in spades that that happened to my mom. And so one day I, you know, I get my mom

142
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,600
$40,000 and I said, Mom, you know, that time the car had that brown mark on it and we told you it

143
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,520
was a truck. Well, this is what really happened. So how did she react to that? She started laughing.

144
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,320
She was laughing. She says, I knew something was strange about that. You know, it, it, it,

145
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,040
the story fit, right? But, but there was something strange about that. You know, she just kind of

146
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,360
laughed and was, was thankful that, you know, one, you know, it was a great investment, you know,

147
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,600
having that car beat up, but, but she's kind of laughed and we just reminisced about it.

148
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,080
So let's go back to when you're on the Upper West Side, because you, you, you write about this in

149
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:04,800
the book, which was you and your roommate kind of had a slightly different, I don't know, call it a

150
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,880
point of view on future earnings and what that allowed you to do with your time. You told a story

151
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,200
about something you did that seemed kind of bold. Oh, that he did. That was kind of bold. You're

152
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,320
talking about when Jason took the, the trip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, sorry. Sorry. Yeah.

153
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,600
So, so Jason, you know, I don't know if our views were very thought out or just wired in,

154
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,280
right? But like I was head down, like I gotta make it, I gotta become a trader. I gotta have

155
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,600
my head down. I'm, I'm, I'm saving money. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really at this point in my life,

156
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,880
like super diligent, like, you know, trying to convince my boss to get the, uh, on the bus

157
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,720
program to save money, you know, not, you know, writing down every single nickel that I bought,

158
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,200
et cetera. I'm really focused on my, my career trajectory. And Jason is like,

159
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,800
does Jason work in the same firm? Uh, he works at another firm right in a, if you look at the

160
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
old pictures, all the phone booths are right next to you. He's like right next to me, even though

161
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,560
he's not at the same firm, we're all crowded into one area. Uh, and Jason's like, I'm going to go

162
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,640
backpacking for your, for a couple of months. I'm like, wait, what? And I'm like, wait, how,

163
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,440
how are you going to do that? Well, I'm going to borrow money from, from this guy who was a loan

164
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:31,360
shark. And I'm like, wait, wait, what? You're going to borrow money from the sky and you're going

165
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,960
to go, and you're going to go backpacking in Europe. I'm like, this is insane. I'm like,

166
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,920
this is insanity. My head is about to explode. I'm like, you're going to miss out. And what if

167
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,600
they hire another screen clerk and your job's not there when you come back and how are you going to

168
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,360
pay this guy back? If you don't pay him back, this is not like, Oh, penalties and interest. This is

169
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,320
like, you know, knees and ankles, right? Uh, uh, and so I, I just didn't get it. Like, I just didn't

170
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,080
get it. Like that experience and that, you know, I wasn't thinking about like die with zero and

171
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,560
certain experiences belong in a certain period of life, et cetera. I was just like, ultimately

172
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,360
on this autopilot of trying to be successful and make money, right? At that time in my age,

173
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,520
that time of my life. And Jason was like, I'm going backpacking. So he went, I stayed,

174
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,760
he came back, had a screen clerking job, you know, different firm or same, same firm, same firm.

175
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Wasn't that much noticeable, different. Like I moved up a little bit, but it wasn't that

176
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,360
most noticeable, different, but he came back richer. But he came back with stories and experiences

177
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,120
and romance and lifelong friends. And I was like, you know, in the beginning, I was kind of, Oh, wow.

178
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,040
Maybe I missed out. Maybe I could have jumped in for a week, you know, that type of thing. And as

179
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,960
time went on, I really, really regretted not joining him on that trip. I was like,

180
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,360
that when I, that when it finally came time where like, I'm going to go Europe, right? I'm going to

181
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,120
go, I'm going to have this backpacking experience. I was too bougie. I had money. I wasn't going to

182
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,560
go stay at youth hostels. I wasn't going to capture these trains. I was going to have

183
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,880
an experience, but a different experience. The type of experience he had was for that time in

184
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,480
your life and a type of experience, even though it was wonderful, it was not as rich as his

185
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:31,520
experience. Right. Because the time had passed me by and it's one of my, it's one of my big,

186
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,400
big, big regrets in life. So how did you start to formulate this understanding about these

187
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,360
different types of resources, be it time, be it money, which is the resource. I think a lot of

188
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,440
people think about experiences themselves as, you know, for lack of a better word, an asset or a

189
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,000
thing, the actual experience, the people you're meeting, all of these different things. When did

190
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,560
you start to coalesce around some of the ideas that, that ultimately, of course, would go on to

191
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,040
become the thesis of this book? It was slowly over time. You know, even when, you know, I got to

192
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,200
the exchange, I was like in this hurry to get rich. Right. And the reason why I was in a hurry,

193
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
because I had this bias, I just believe I was like, yeah, there's rich guys here, but they're old.

194
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,240
Like, what can he possibly do with the money? Right. Like I'm young, I'm 21. Like, I'm ages,

195
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,080
I can't imagine, you know, the use of a million dollars when you're 40. Right. Like, what are you

196
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
gonna do by a nicer car to drive your kids around? Like, you know, it just seems like loss on them.

197
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Right. Like, they don't get to do fun things. Now, I was wrong about that, but I was right about

198
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,320
the utility of money over time. Right. And I was also read this book at this time called Your Money

199
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,880
or Your Life. It kind of transformed my understanding of what money is. Right. It's a very

200
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:58,160
detailed book that has these exercises that has you look at how you spend your hours

201
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,600
from going to work, getting ready for work, the things you spend on work and really figuring out

202
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,200
what your true hourly wage is. Right. Like after tax, this is what an hour of your time,

203
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:17,120
of your life is worth. And then it has you not think of everything in money, but in time.

204
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,560
So instead of going to the movies and say it costs me $10 is like that cost me one hour and 15

205
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,520
minutes of my time to go to this movie to buy this shirt. It cost me three hours of my time.

206
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,960
And so you get this idea that I'm exchanging my life for certain things. Right. The experience of

207
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,800
buying a shirt, going to the movie, going on a trip. And that hit me hard. And where were you

208
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,840
at this point? This is before you went to Houston. This is where I went to Houston. Before I did

209
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,000
Houston. That hit me hard. And that's what really turned me into like, I'm going to save. Right.

210
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,680
The two things I got out of it is I want a lot of money and I'm going to like become this very

211
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,480
frugal person. You know, there's this movement called fire, which that book is kind of like

212
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,120
the Bible, the precursor to the fire movement, which is financial independence, retire early.

213
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,240
And that was kind of like an early fire guy. Like I'm going to save my way to riches. Right.

214
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:17,520
I'm going to save and then retire early. And I had. And sorry, did you know what you wanted to do

215
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,080
when you retired? I just went on. I went on to another autopilot. I went on another version of

216
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,800
autopilot. I read a book. I got these concepts out of it. Right. And I was like, this is what I'm

217
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,280
going to do. Right. I didn't think about the big picture of everything, but some certain concepts

218
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,800
are coming to me. Right. Like I exchange hours in my life for money. And then that money is used for

219
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,040
the things I want. Let's take the abstract of money out of it and look at what I'm what hours

220
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,320
of my life are being exchanged for. Right. That was a great concept for the sink in very viscerally.

221
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,120
The idea that it's also just to double click on that bill. It's also visceral when you start to

222
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:04,320
think of the difference between using money for activities or trips versus things. So, you know,

223
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,640
I buy a shirt and this shirt basically works out to three hours of what I make per hour. So,

224
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,480
this is a three dollar shirt. I mean, a three hour shirt. Right. Conversely, like I take my daughter

225
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,600
out overnight. We do like a daddy daughter date night, go out to dinner, stay at a nice hotel,

226
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,400
have a fancy breakfast the next day. That's, you know, that's five hours of my time in terms of

227
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,800
work. Right. But do you see those sort of differently at the time that one of those is

228
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,160
like an experience and one of them is not in a way that you're properly analyzing it, but in more of

229
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,880
an intuitive way, my value because when you start to think about things in time, it's like, wait a

230
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,920
minute, three hours for a shirt versus, you know, our, you know, going here and having a sandwich

231
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,080
and hanging out with my friends or whatever it is, your values start to you really get in touch with

232
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,320
your values. Right. Because it's not an abstract plan. It's like when you're in a casino and they

233
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,640
give you chips, it's one of the greatest things to do is give you chips, not money, tip in $25,

234
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
you're thrown, let it all ride because it's so abstracted from money. So it's an abstraction on

235
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,880
an abstraction. Right. By removing that abstraction, right. You get closer to your values. Right.

236
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,280
Right. Imagine that you have $25 chips, you figure out your hourly after tax all in wage is 25 an

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,320
hour. Every time you flick a chip, it's like I gave an hour of my life. Right. Boom, boom, boom.

238
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,240
So when you start thinking about things in terms of hours of your life and you have finite hours,

239
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,960
you start to really get closer to your values. You can still be on autopilot, but you're closer.

240
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,080
And so things like this were happening. And, and, you know, at that time at the exchange,

241
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,080
like most people had like, what is it all for? Like, what do I want? You know, I'm here to get rich,

242
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,880
but, but why are you having that discussion with other either people who are your peers,

243
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,440
who are presumably on the same treadmill or the people who are already rich, but still presumably

244
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,360
killing themselves, trading their health for wealth? No, I'm generally having it with myself

245
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,520
and reading books. Right. And I'm just, but I'm still asking myself, but why? Like, what do I,

246
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
what do I want? You know, and I'm remembering conversations that maybe I've had throughout my

247
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,280
life where people like there was a college football player named Dwight Sistro and I was like

248
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,720
trying to do engineering and we were debating something. It's like, look, listen, you might

249
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,560
want to picket fence and a wife and something like that. And that life, I don't want that life.

250
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,880
I don't want that cookie cutter life. That's fine for you, but that's not my path. Right.

251
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,920
I thought about it and I was like, do I really want that? Right. And then, you know, certain

252
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,280
things that he said that he didn't want that I was actually working for, you know, thinking that

253
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,560
this was my path. I actually realized, no, I don't want that. Right. And so, you know, I'm pretty

254
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,960
hard headed. It takes a while for these things to seep in. Right. And so, you know, I saw, I

255
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,200
would argue a little different, Bill, I would argue that at this point, you're 22, 23, 24.

256
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,760
I think that's remarkably early to be having that thought, don't you? Yeah. I guess it took a while

257
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,160
for it to finally percolate into some sort of action plan, right? To like, kind of like, actually,

258
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm thinking about these things, but they're not resulting in the proper behavior changes yet.

259
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,840
Right. So I'm still, I'm still formulating it. Yeah. Right. So, you know, everyone says, I want

260
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,680
to be rich before I'm 30 or I'm rich before 40. No one's out there saying I want to be rich before

261
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm 86. Right. So intuitively in there, there's something about the utility of money. Right. That

262
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,480
it's not as valuable to you later on in life. Right. Yeah. It's one of the games I often play

263
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:47,040
with my patients. And I always, I sort of, or you'd see, it's anybody. I could play this game with

264
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,600
anybody, which is, listen, if right now, and you always do this with someone who's younger,

265
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,920
obviously, I say, like right now, would you trade places with Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger?

266
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
And they're like, everybody says, of course not. And I was like, what do you mean, of course not,

267
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,920
like Warren Buffett's worth a hundred billion dollars. I mean, how would you not trade places

268
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,120
with him? And they're like, I mean, he's 90 years old or whatever. And I say, okay, so would you

269
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,360
rather have not a penny to your name and be 20 or have a hundred billion dollars and be 90? No other

270
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,520
difference. Right. Like I'm not going to stipulate anything else. I've never met a person who wouldn't

271
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:29,120
take being a completely broke 20 year old. Right. And that, I think, speaks less to health because,

272
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,560
look, ostensibly Warren still appears somewhat healthy. Right. He's cognitively intact. He

273
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
doesn't, you know, it's not like he's like a frail 90 year old or whatever he is,

274
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,160
but it's about runway. It's about, yeah, but maybe Warren might have 10 years of life left,

275
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,840
that 20 year old could have 80 years of life left. And so when you face it in such stark terms,

276
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,960
only then I think does the average person start to realize how precious time is.

277
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,840
And I think they also see that, you know, Warren can't sprint, dunk a basketball, you know,

278
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
go wakeboarding. Like there's a lot of other things that they enjoy. And that's what I thought

279
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,720
about. And, you know, I thought to myself, if, you know, after reading this book, like I'm

280
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,000
spending hours in my life to acquire these experiences and I mean, experiences in the

281
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,240
broadest sense, whether it's like, you know, going on a walk or being able to choose to go on a walk

282
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,400
or go get a sandwich or buy a shirt or whatever. If I'm exchanging hours in my life and I don't

283
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,000
go acquire these experiences, I pretty much wasted hours in my life. Right? So that thought

284
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,080
hits and it's like, okay, you don't want to leave anything on the table, right? In the game of life,

285
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,320
when I die, you don't want to leave chips on the table, right? Like you want to use all your

286
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,160
resources before you die, right? And that, you know, inherent in that is like your choices,

287
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,920
your experiences, those experiences are what make you you. Those are the things that fulfill you

288
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,040
and everybody's going to be different. And so, consequently, having more of it

289
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,120
and enjoying more of it will lead to a more fulfilling life. So that if I'm solving

290
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,800
for fulfillment, right? This is, I don't care about the money, I care about the things I want,

291
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,520
the experiences I want to have. If I'm trying to solve for that, one of the things you come quickly

292
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,480
to is that you need to use all your resources up before you die. Okay? The second thing you come

293
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,320
through with the fact that your resources, particularly money, are less valuable to you

294
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,320
when you're older, then you start to think, well, there must be a curve,

295
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,080
right? Because if you're going to end at zero, is it, you know, this kind of rectangle shape

296
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,600
that just goes down? Is it a 45 degree angle of sleep? Or is there some sort of curve? And so,

297
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,400
what I like to do to understand certain things, it doesn't always work, is think of zero and think

298
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,360
of infinity, right? So when you're like, all right, let's run it all the way back to one,

299
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,960
you know, one years old, how useful is money? Not that useful to you, right? Let's run it all the

300
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,400
way forward to 96 on your deathbed. How useful is money to you? Not that useful, right? So clearly,

301
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,760
there's like some sort of ramp up of utility and then a decline of utility, right? And I became

302
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,080
obsessed with finding what that curve was. Because I was like, this is it. If you're making

303
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,120
more money for delayed gratification later in life, you approach infinity, you're actually

304
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,040
wasting your time, you should be spending down your assets at a certain point. There's an

305
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,440
inflection point where not a number, but a date where your wealth should be going down in order

306
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,640
to get the most fulfillment. Now, let's pause for a second, Bill. Is that standard thinking slash

307
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,720
teaching within the wealth management community? No, no, but it is a standard problem. If you look

308
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,600
at kind of JP Morgan or other wealth managers, one of the biggest problems they have is the

309
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,280
accumulation, getting people to spend down their assets, right? They've been saving, they got their

310
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,640
money, they've hit retirement, and it's like that net worth is going up in their 70s, you know? And

311
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,000
we're like, when's the party? That's what I always ask. You just tell me when the party is. Like,

312
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,640
you know, I have conversations with older people or other people. It's like, listen, it's okay that

313
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,440
you're saving. What are you saving for? And when's the party? I just want to know when you're going

314
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,400
to use up all your resources, right? Now, let's also pivot and talk about, because I remember one

315
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,080
of the stats that always stuck with me was during 2008. So a really good friend of my name, Jim

316
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,760
Lambright, who was at the time the president of the ex-in bank, when the TARP program kicked on

317
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,640
because he was close with Hank Paulson and had already spent so much time in China and had

318
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
government clearance. Basically, Hank brought Jim Lambright and Neil Koshkari, who was with him

319
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,480
already at the Treasury, I believe, to run TARP. So basically, Jim and Neil are doing all the deals

320
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,960
for TARP. And Jim is getting steeped in how bad is this going to be, right? Like, what is this going

321
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,760
to mean for the average person? And I remember one day he called me with a stat that I couldn't

322
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,200
believe. And I forget the stats, so this is only directionally it, but it was what fraction of

323
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,920
people in the United States could not produce $1,000 with three days notice, meaning they didn't have

324
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,000
that excess liquidity of $1,000. Again, I don't remember the number, but it was in the ballpark

325
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,760
of like 30%. It was a high number. And so I don't know what those stats are today. I've tried to

326
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,480
look some of them up and they're not maybe quite as dire as that, but they're not that much better.

327
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
No, they're not great. It's not great.

328
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:53,920
What's the natural history of that person who's 40 years old, whose total net worth is $50,000,

329
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,560
and their available liquidity is $1,000. And they're thinking, I'm going to work till I'm 65

330
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,480
or 70 or whatever, and then I'm going to collect my social security. Does this thinking still apply

331
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,920
there? Yeah, it applies in different ways. So what I've come up with this book is there's three

332
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,880
variables, your wealth, your health, and your time. And we're taking those three variables and we're

333
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,400
solving for net fulfillment, right? So we're not solving for maximum wealth. We're not solving even

334
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,760
for maximum health. We're solving for net fulfillment, right? I'm saying that's your

335
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,640
purpose. If you're with me, we're solving for net fulfillment. And so one of the things we look at

336
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
that the total arc of your life, given the resources you have, how do we allocate them?

337
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,760
We definitely want to focus on the money, right? Everybody wants to talk about the money and the

338
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,280
resources, but there's decisions that you make even without money. Whether you go on a walk with

339
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,840
your daughters, you play cards with your friends late at night. Do you tuck them in at night or

340
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,240
are you going to hang out with the boys, right? And so in the book, we talk about the seasons of

341
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,480
your life. Certain activities transfer nicely to the next season in your life from 20 to 30 to 30

342
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,600
to 40. And some of them don't transfer well. They're less enjoyable. And some of them don't

343
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,640
transfer at all. It's impossible. So one of the things, when the 40 year old who has $50,000,

344
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,000
one of the things I would say is, what's your survival number? Have you calculated that at

345
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,560
retirement? Are you surviving retirement? Are you in serious negative dire straits? And once we've

346
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,560
calculated that, okay, I need to work and save this much and plus social security, I've had my

347
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,440
survival number. Now the rest is for experiences, things I want to do, an allocation of my time.

348
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,240
How do I allocate it? Right? Is it the cruise at 70? Or is it the ski trip right now? Right. And

349
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
that's going to be different for every single person, right? Or is it a shirt or whatever

350
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,240
fulfills them or to go play in this chess tournament and pay the entry fee. And for people with zero

351
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,520
money, you still have an allocation game to play, right? You still have your health and your time,

352
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:26,720
right? You can still decide, hey, I'm going to sit down and watch Friends, you know, or I'm going to

353
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,480
go hang out at my mom's house and make a meal and spend time with them because I'm only going to see

354
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,160
them 20 times before they're gone. Right? So this type of thinking about allocating your resources

355
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,720
at the proper place, getting off autopilot holds at all wealth levels. It doesn't hold at all health

356
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
levels because if you have zero health, you have zero, you're done. It's over, but it holds at all

357
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,360
wealth levels. So that type of thinking to maximize fulfillment and knowing that you have seasons of

358
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,920
your life, that your body decays, your attitudes change and they pass that type of thinking and

359
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,000
that I need to get things in the right order and use my resources properly, that's going to help

360
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,880
you have a more fulfilling life, whether you have zero money or a hundred million dollars. Right?

361
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,280
There are many people with zero who are having a way more fulfilling life than Warren Buffett,

362
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,200
I would say. Yeah. I think one of the things about the way you framed it, Bill, that I really like

363
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,560
is the, it's a very nonlinear problem, right? So let's look at those three variables.

364
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,480
At the surface, one might suggest, well, wait a minute. It is a min max game with one of them.

365
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,000
You always want max health, but technically even that's not true because if I told you,

366
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Bill, I have the secret for you to have max health, I can preserve your health span and lifespan

367
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,000
indefinitely, but here's what it's going to cost you. Every minute of the day, you have to be

368
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,520
working on your health. So from the moment you wake up from sleep, you have to do a two hour

369
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,480
meditation. We then have to go and do this yoga. We then have to go and do this workout. When you're

370
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,800
done that workout, you have to go and do this, and then you have to go to bed. You'd be like,

371
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,320
well, Peter, that sucks because yeah, I'm going to live for a hundred more years and I don't get to

372
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,320
spend any of that time doing anything other than improving my health. Correct. It's a glib example,

373
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,640
but it factors, I think it illustrates the point. It gets the point across. I usually say, you know,

374
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,480
there's no amount of money you can pay me to do 10 years in Sing Sing.

375
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,360
Not at this age. There's no amount of money. I say that to certain people who are just always

376
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,400
delaying gratification. I'm like, you're kind of in a jail. You're basically doing a version of

377
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm doing time, and maybe you shouldn't be doing time at this point in your life.

378
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,200
Right. And so these are kind of just ways, you know, people absorb information in different ways.

379
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
You can say it in all kinds of different ways, and then they finally go, aha, I got it. That really

380
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,880
spoke to me the way you said it. And so I try and hit people with different versions of this. You

381
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,160
know, one of the things I like to say to people is life is like Tetris. You got to get the order

382
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
right in order to get the high score of net fulfillment. So let's say you're in heaven.

383
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,680
By the way, Tetris is the only video game I enjoy. Okay, gotcha. I go through periods

384
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,960
like where I won't play it for a year. And then I go through periods where I'll waste 30 minutes

385
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,600
a day, which is a lot of time for me. For me, 30 minutes in a day is an inordinate amount of time.

386
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,520
And when I'm sometimes in those phases of playing it a lot, I dream in Tetris. I literally dream

387
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,760
that everything I'm seeing in the world, I'm trying to optimize the shape and interaction of.

388
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,280
We got to think about getting your life in. So in the book, I talk about this thing about time

389
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,960
buckets, basically that you take your life in segments, in any kind of segment you want,

390
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,840
20 to 25, 30 to 40, 50 to 60. And then you think about, you know, leisure, job, career,

391
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,680
what experience you want to have in each of those periods, right? And as you're doing that,

392
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,400
you realize that, wait a minute, they're going to the clubs and strip clubs and hanging out

393
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
probably should be before I get married, not after, right? They're reading books to my kids

394
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,040
when they're children, right? That must be in this book. This must be in this bucket.

395
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,360
And so I give them kind of this- Right. Because they're not going to want me reading to them in

396
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,960
college. Exactly. Or even when they're 13, 14, they didn't even want to know you, right? And,

397
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
you know, that's one of the errors I made. Like, you know, you always do it wrong as a parent,

398
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,240
right? Like you don't want to spend too much time with them, et cetera. It's like, wait a minute,

399
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,880
maybe I should have been doing this activity instead of that activity, right? Kind of the

400
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,360
die with zero thinking, right? Optimize your life. And so the way, you know, the thought experiment,

401
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,560
I says, listen, you're up in heaven. You have the bucket of experiences. These are all the choices

402
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,040
you can have. And God says, take as much as you want. You're thrown in here, you're like,

403
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
I want to have sex 30,000 times and I want to climb, come out, kill them in Joro. And I want

404
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,240
to play hockey. I want to be in a high school team and I want to do, you know, and you're just

405
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,800
throwing them in, right? Everything. I want to meditate and yoga, right? And then God goes,

406
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,880
great, I'm going to let you have all those experiences, but there's one trick. You got

407
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,320
to get the order right. And what's it saying is, is if you don't get the order right, like if you

408
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,280
save certain experiences to the 80 to 86 bucket, you don't get it, right? If you, if you, if you're

409
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,520
not climbing Kilimanjaro. Yeah. If you're like in like nightclub and road trips with your buddies

410
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,000
before you're married and you have two kids or whatever, you don't get that. If you don't go

411
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,560
back pack it with your friend and youth hostels, et cetera. When you're 21, when you get the shot,

412
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,880
he don't get that experience, right? Or it's, or it's a bastardize, you know,

413
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,560
not as fulfilling experience. So you don't get the net fulfillment points.

414
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,880
And so it's kind of tied with zero. It's like, what do you want out of your life?

415
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,840
Get off autopilot. What do you want on a life? Where does it, what resources do you have?

416
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,000
And how do we optimize? How do we get the most out of it?

417
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,080
So how do you think about your own risk tolerance? Now, again, this is, I guess there's a,

418
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,200
maybe a caveat the listener needs to understand at this point, which is what you do for a living

419
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,800
today. Yeah. So you are an energy trader among other things, you know, you do many things, but,

420
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,840
but is it safe to say that the majority of the wealth you've created came through your ability to

421
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,080
understand how natural gas moves and trade on that?

422
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,520
Yeah. The majority of my wealth came from predicting the future. And that's generally

423
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:35,200
the future of natural gas prices. John Arnold, who is, you know, one of your closest colleagues,

424
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,240
someone who I've had on the podcast, nicknamed the king of gas, the greatest gas trader of all time.

425
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,360
Do you look at a guy like John and say he has a high risk tolerance? Do you look at someone

426
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,520
like yourself and say you have a high risk tolerance, or do you not feel that way at all

427
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,480
and feel like, nope, I'm completely in control of calculated risks. And that's why they net out to

428
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,600
be positive. In other words, I'm less swayed by short term volatility because my methodology,

429
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,160
you know, doesn't feel like I'm gambling. I think the best traders I've seen have been

430
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,000
pretty stoic about, about things. They think about very robotically about expected outcome,

431
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,880
and they don't seem to be disturbed about negative outcomes as much as-

432
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,560
Tell folks what expected outcomes mean because they want to understand the

433
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,120
probabilities and how these work. Right. So if you place a bet and the payout is one and four,

434
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,120
but the odds are 50-50, right, you're going to get half the time you're going to get four times

435
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,040
your money and half the time you're just going to lose one times your money. So that's positive

436
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,200
expected outcome, right? You're going to make money. This is a great trade. But remember,

437
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,840
70% of the time you're going to lose. Or in this scenario, no, the payout, half the time

438
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,280
you're going to lose. Half the time you're going to lose the payouts one and four. So half the

439
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,320
time you're pissed. You're upset, right? And a lot of people can't deal with that. They need

440
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,920
four or five or seven positive events emotionally, psychologically,

441
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,040
forever, every negative event. In trading, that just doesn't exist.

442
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah. In trading, if someone is right half the time-

443
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,400
They're pretty good, right? If their right's 55%, 60% of the time they're right. Think about the

444
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,120
casino's edge in Blackjack. It's like- It's going to be 51-

445
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:32,560
Yeah, yeah, 0.07 or 0.09 in Blackjack. In craps, it's like 0.03, right? They're wrong a lot of the

446
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,760
time, right? But ultimately, the law of large numbers, they make a bunch of money. But if your

447
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,880
emotional calculus is different, where such that you need a greater being right ratio,

448
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,520
then you're not going to make it because stress clouds your thinking and your judgment, right?

449
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,640
So with that said, if someone says to you, Bill, you just have a really high tolerance for risk.

450
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:06,240
I don't. I'm very risk averse. I don't like to take big risk. I never want to have the chance

451
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,440
of losing something. Loss aversion is a greater motivator for me than gain. How do you talk to

452
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,320
that person and how do you help them think through the difference between fear and risk tolerance?

453
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,240
Well, the first thing I do is just try and break down what are they actually afraid of? A lot of

454
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,800
times when people say the bad thing is not as bad as they imagine it in their head. And a lot of

455
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,360
times, quite frankly, it's really the fear of judgment more than the actual thing, right? They

456
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,640
find out that they can survive the potential negative financial hit. What they can't survive is,

457
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,560
oh, my friends, my colleagues, my spouse, my mom, my dad, the shame, the I got it wrong,

458
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,600
the I told you so, etc. There's a lot of that fear baked into disguised as I can't risk these

459
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,600
dollars. I'm like, yeah, you can, you know, you make more, you know, that type of thing.

460
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,640
Then the other thing is, I trying to think is get them the focus. They always focus on the monetary

461
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,680
costs of losing. But what about the cost of inaction and the opportunity costs? Right. And

462
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,960
by talking about the opportunity costs, I get them to see the asymmetry of the risk, right? So I don't

463
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,800
think I'm maybe I have a greater tolerance for risk. But what I do is, is that I fear, you know,

464
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,320
my fear is reversed. I fear missing out on the opportunity costs. I fear not getting the max,

465
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:34,880
you know, a lot of people fear running out of money. I fear wasting my life, right? I am more

466
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:43,520
worried about looking back and being like, shit, I wasted my only ride that I had, then running out

467
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:52,480
of money. Right. One of my patients said something to me once. He was about to do something that I

468
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,120
just thought was really risky. Now, it was a very unique opportunity. And he said, you know, Peter,

469
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm going to go and do this thing. And I said, I think there's a, I think there's a significant

470
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,840
risk to you in doing that. It wasn't a financial risk, it would have been a health risk, a physical

471
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:16,080
risk. And he said, I you're right, Peter, I acknowledge that risk that that that is the risk.

472
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:25,920
But I'm optimizing in a risk, pardon me, a regret minimizing framework, not a risk minimizing

473
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:33,040
framework. Yeah, that and that's pretty much for me, it's risk reward, right? If I really love

474
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,800
cigarettes, like love them. I'd smoke cigarettes. You know what I mean? If I really love skydiving

475
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,280
all the time, I went twice, but it was diminishing returns. I go skydiving, right? It's what fulfills

476
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,800
you. Right. And so I'm, I'm a risk reward guy. Is the reward commensurate with the risk? Some people

477
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,440
like to ride motorcycles. I don't get my, for me, it's not worth the risk. Like I have a physical

478
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,840
risk tolerance around one in 10,000. Right? Like if it's more dangerous than one in 10,000, I,

479
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,760
the reward really has to be worth it for me to do it. And so, you know, I think that's the way I

480
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,200
think. Right. And then that, that helps me in this kind of like counterfactual regret minimization

481
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,000
algorithm. Right. Because, so the algorithm of the book, right, the mental models in the book,

482
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,360
right? You know, when a chess computer plays you, it has a regret minimization algorithm. And what

483
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:33,520
it wants to do is a solving to win. Right. AlphaGo is solving to win the game. And the game of life,

484
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,880
what I'm solving for the regret minimization I'm solving for is net fulfillment. I want the highest

485
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,520
score in net fulfillment. I don't want the highest money. I don't even want the highest health.

486
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,960
Right. I'm like, I don't want to run three hours a day to be in the top 0.5%. Top 3% is great

487
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,760
enough. I'll give up the tail end of my life. You know what I mean? Or, and, and time, like how do I

488
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,520
optimize my time? Right. And so everything for me is like what I'm solving for in life,

489
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,120
what this book is solving for for you is net fulfillment. It is relentless about net fulfillment.

490
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,280
And so if that entails take for you in your makeup, like taking nerves risks, going hella skiing,

491
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,400
skydiving, riding motorcycles, then so be it. Like, as long as you're off autopilot and you've

492
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:28,240
thought it through, then that's fine. How variable do you think people are in their

493
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,920
kind of stratification of what encompasses net fulfillment? And maybe a better question is,

494
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,760
do you think people are even understanding about and deliberate about what that means?

495
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,200
Like that's that doesn't strike me as something that the average person could articulate very

496
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,000
clearly what it is that will be their fulfillment maximizing function in terms of experiences. And

497
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,400
also, I think I want to reiterate a point you made, which is it's not just the experience,

498
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,520
it's when they occur. Correct. Right. So, so the combination of which experiences and when they

499
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,480
occur and who they occur with, do you get the sense that the average person can actually

500
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,920
articulate that? I think they, they, they had the ability earlier in life and then they get

501
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,840
habituated out of it. So we all go into autopilot, right? Like we have this default

502
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,960
mode network. It helps us survive. It helps us drive without thinking, oh, I gotta return, you

503
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,240
know, when you first learned to drive, like it's, everything's happening fast. You have to deliberately

504
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,520
think about everything you're doing. And then all of a sudden it goes into default mode network. And

505
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,120
it's easy. That happens with work. Right. And you're like, I need to work to survive. And I need to do

506
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,840
this. And you're panicking, whatever. And next thing you're in the groove and you're just constantly

507
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,360
working, right? Constantly working. And it's some long along the way, somewhere along the way with

508
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,080
the abstraction of, you know, going to work to make money, to survive and get the things we want.

509
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,080
We forget about the things we want. We just go to work to work, to just make more money,

510
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,560
to go to work, to make more money. And the things we want either get pushed for our head or forgotten

511
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,600
about because we're on autopilot. Right. It was a good thing because it makes us good at our jobs.

512
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,720
It's like, I can do this job with my eyes closed. I'm going to do this and I'm getting promoted and

513
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,640
you're getting rewarded. You know, certain things about the jobs that you like, but you're forgetting

514
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,200
why you did this thing in the first place. Right. People aren't like, I really wanted to be a plastic

515
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,640
salesperson. I really love selling plastics, more and more plastics and piling up numbers in a bank

516
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,120
account. Those numbers in a bank account were really meant for, I want to hang out with my buddies

517
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,800
and I want to go skiing and I want to get married and I want to donate to this charity. And I want

518
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,600
to do X, Y and Z. Right. But we kind of forget that. Right. And since we forgot about it, we're

519
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,240
not even thinking about when the best time it is to happen. Right. It's just completely like, oh,

520
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,960
I'll eventually do it or when I get more. So we're completely out of touch of what we want,

521
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,160
what's enough, the concept of enough, what that means for us and the concept of when.

522
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,240
Now I had a discussion with a patient just yesterday. So runs a hedge fund and not

523
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,320
surprisingly given the economic climate we're in, hedge funds aren't doing particularly well,

524
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:12,400
especially long hedge funds. And this guy doesn't need to be working. Even though he's

525
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,640
now having a down year, he could certainly return all the capital to his investors and

526
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,320
manage his own capital indefinitely or do nothing, literally do nothing. Right.

527
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,680
But he said, what would I do? I mean, what would I do? I'd sit around for three months and it would

528
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,240
feel really nice to have no stress for three months and then I'd be bored out of my mind.

529
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,400
So he's like, no, I got to keep going. Yeah. I've had this, you know, amongst my friends,

530
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,240
you know, it's one of the things like people ask the question, why do people do this? And

531
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,080
I've had direct conversations with my friends and, you know, with a friend and I'm very,

532
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:51,840
very aggressive with them attacking their walls they put up. And what I tell them is, is that

533
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:01,920
you have made your work your God. It's who you meet people. You eat around where work is. You've

534
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,080
learned, you've given up learning how to socialize and meet your neighbors, all the people you know,

535
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,400
or some kind of work or work related. You haven't exercised those muscles for years, 10, 20, 30

536
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,920
years. Right. Sometimes that people have their whole life revolves around work and all the other

537
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,520
muscles. And I mean, I'm using muscles as an example, have atropied, like, how do you socialize

538
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,800
without a job? How do you meet people without a job? Where do I go eat without my job? Like I eat,

539
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,280
obviously somewhere within five miles of this place and people recommend all the things I get

540
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,320
recommended, the camaraderie, everything that, you know, they, when people list what they like about

541
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:47,360
work that used to happen without work. Right. And they've atrophied those muscles. So when you take

542
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,440
that away, they're like, they don't know what to do. They don't know what they want. And their

543
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,080
dreams have left them. Right. The ski trip, they haven't thought about that or hang out with their

544
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,320
buddies or whatever, all that stuff has left them and they haven't worked those muscles out. And I

545
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,920
say, listen, just let's start working on those muscles and building them up. And you'll have

546
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:13,040
plenty to do. Right. You have plenty to do. You've let autopilot and habit put you in poor health

547
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,200
in these other activities. Right. You're in poor health on how to meet people and socialize

548
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,040
outside of work. You're in poor health on where to go eat lunch, you know, except for the places near

549
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,600
work or wherever you go. Right. You're in poor health on trips that are not business trips.

550
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,040
Right. You're in poor health about thinking about what fulfill you and discovery, just plain old

551
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,280
discovery. Because you don't know what you want. You discover what you want. Nobody comes out of the

552
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,840
womb like I don't like onions and I love chocolate and I want to go to Japan and I love

553
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:51,360
F1. Like you get exposed to it and you discover what you want. So a lot of life is discovery.

554
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,480
I think my kids did come out of the womb. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

555
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
Well, they didn't have a choice, but you didn't have a choice.

556
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:04,000
But but these people are out of discovery. They're in the familiar habituated routine.

557
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,240
They are a rat in a wheel that doesn't even need cheese anymore. It just runs in the wheel.

558
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,960
Now, how do we differentiate that from people who and I would put myself in this category

559
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:23,600
truthfully, where, you know, a big part of their work is their fulfillment and they do feel a sense

560
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:30,400
of purpose in what they do beyond just the making money part of it. Correct. And I suspect that,

561
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,400
like, again, just to make caricatures of things, right. So maybe the person who works in the widget

562
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,800
factory that makes the widget that they don't even know what the widget plugs into, but they

563
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,720
need a job like and if if they, you know, inherited a big lump sum of money tomorrow, they would

564
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,000
happily quit the widget job. Right. But maybe they'd get bored and they'd want to go back

565
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,680
and start volunteering and doing something where they don't actually get paid, but they're really

566
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,200
enjoying what they're doing. And then, of course, you have the group of people whose job is doing

567
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,600
two things. It's providing money for all the things that you need, both in approximate sense

568
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,800
and distally. But also it is a sense of purpose and therefore it fits into their fulfillment.

569
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,200
But there's but but these things can be very slippery. And I would certainly put myself

570
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,680
squarely in that category, right, which is I still work harder than I should. Right. And I

571
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,880
absolutely know that I'm failing in the equation, even though I'm fulfilled by this and I wouldn't

572
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,560
want to not do this, but I'm doing too much of it as an example. Yeah, I really push back hard on

573
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,840
my friends on this. And in the part like I can't know only they can know, right? Like the heroin

574
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,080
addict is happy. I'm happy on heroin. You have you have a problem with my hair and I don't have a

575
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,680
problem. Right. And that's kind of the argument I push towards them. And I say, listen, really

576
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:57,600
think about what in your job fulfills you. And is that outside in the world? Right. And the purpose

577
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,480
of that. And do you have balance? Are you balanced according to what you want to life in this time

578
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,960
period in your life and the future time period in life? Now, I can't tell somebody what their

579
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,920
balance is. Right. That's a very personal thing. But what I really want them to do is be honest,

580
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,760
off autopilot, really like unplug for a moment and think about it like, OK, I got one life.

581
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,880
I only and I have only this period once. Right. I only get to be 50 between 50 and 55. I only get

582
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,080
this level of health at this time. Is are these the experiences? Is this really how I want to

583
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,800
allocate my time at this period? Is this really the maximum? Is this the optimal thing for me to do?

584
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,080
And if they do that and they come up with the same answer like, hey, no, I want to work at the widget

585
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,600
factory or I want to work at this fulfilling. I can't argue that. Like how am I going to tell you

586
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,960
how to live your life? What I'm here to tell you is how to optimize your life. What thought process

587
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,040
and what steps you should go through things you should be considering in order to get the most

588
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,960
fulfillment of your life. And then if you come to the conclusion that, hey, I'm at the perfect

589
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,080
balance of work. Right. And the money is piling up, but I'm going to use it later and I'm going

590
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,120
to go on, you know, a senior's cruise and that's what it's for. Then that's your life. But maybe

591
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,200
you might go, you know, I can dial it back and you know, my daughter's are only going to be or my

592
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,560
kids are only going to be this age at this time. Maybe I should, you know, take a family trip and

593
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:22,400
unplug and go on safari with them. Right. And enjoy my success because that's going to give me

594
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,360
a lifetime of memory dividends and discussion points and connections, et cetera. Maybe,

595
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,040
maybe, you know, I'd rather have that time with them now and not have them in a hospital with me

596
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,040
when I'm old and stinking can barely, you know, and see me this way. I want, I want the memories

597
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,320
and the time they spend with me doing this and not at the tail end of life. Who knows? Right. Like,

598
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,760
I just want people thinking about it. And if you just get off autopilot just a bit and you start

599
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,600
thinking about it, you're already optimizing your life. You're already going to have a more

600
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:01,040
fulfilling life. Right. Well, I think that that's probably the part of the book that most

601
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:10,880
kind of resonates with someone like me, which is especially when it comes to kids, right? It's

602
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,000
that you have, and I have, I guess the, maybe it's an advantage, maybe it's a disadvantage, but

603
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,200
my kids are sort of separated in age by a bit of a gap, right? So my daughter's 14 and then the

604
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,440
boys are five and eight. So in other words, I now know what it's like to have a teenager. I now

605
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,600
understand all the things that you kind of give up when your kid's a teenager and our daughter's an

606
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,240
amazing kid, but the reality of it is like, she doesn't really want to be around me. No, they

607
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,880
don't want to know you when they become teenagers. I didn't want to know my parents when I was

608
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:48,160
teenager. Yeah. Whereas conversely, the boys can't leave us alone. And it's tempting to sort of say,

609
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:54,080
I wish they would just leave us alone. But now knowing that, oh, actually in like six years,

610
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,840
you'll kill to be back in this situation. Correct. Makes it infinitely more easy to appreciate.

611
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:07,200
So that's kind of one thing that I think is helpful for people to understand the seasons

612
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:15,440
and this idea of seasonality. Like you, I probably think back to things I didn't do for

613
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,440
different reasons. So when I was in college, I mean, I couldn't have worked harder. I mean,

614
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:32,000
I was out of my mind how hard I worked. My night off, there was one night, which was Friday,

615
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:42,000
when I only worked till 9 p.m. It was my break. And from 9 p.m. till 11, I would go and do laundry

616
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,560
after 9 p.m. on a Friday. That was my way to just take a little time off. But other than that,

617
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:53,440
it was six hours a day of work outside of class. And I think of all the things I didn't do in

618
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,960
college. So first of all, my only memories of college are pure misery. I hated every minute of

619
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:05,200
college. I didn't have many. I didn't have this experience. Yeah. Yeah. Now, you know, I could

620
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,200
say, well, a lot of good came out of that because I did really well and did well. That set me up for

621
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,160
the next thing and the next thing and the next thing. But like I could have traveled. Right.

622
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,400
I didn't, having a college experience didn't mean I had to get drunk every night. No. It meant that

623
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,160
I could have saved all that money I was making by tutoring and done something different. This

624
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,200
reminds me of, you know, the college paper had this kind of like my senior year opened up and

625
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,120
had the 50 things you need to do before you graduate. And I just had the biggest regret when

626
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,320
I read that list. I was like, and you read it at what age? Like how much I was like just about on

627
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,960
my way out. Like on my way out. Like my life. I was like, never going to be able to do this. I'm

628
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,080
not going to do this. You know, it's like in some of them were simple, like write an angry letter to

629
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,040
the newspaper, you know, go skinny dipping at Lake, whatever. I actually actually did that after

630
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,880
I read that, you know, you know, there were, there were a lot of things. Do this college prank,

631
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,000
do whatever, like things that would be fun than necessarily costing money or whatever,

632
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,840
but like things to do to have a college experience, not necessarily do them all. And I was like,

633
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,080
maybe I did three or four. And I was like, why was I so on autopilot in my way? You know,

634
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,720
I didn't think about like, okay, you got four years here. You should get, you know, good,

635
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,960
good grades, good study. But like, you know, you want to get this out of it. You want to do this

636
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,080
out of it. You want to have this college experience, et cetera, right? We just kind of like,

637
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,080
don't really think about things going autopilot so much that we don't think about periods in our

638
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,760
life. Even, you know, this year, what experiences do I want to have this year with this person,

639
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,560
with myself, with my, with my spirituality, with my health, with my, my travel, my leisure, my job,

640
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,960
you know, how am I going to optimize? And how does that fit into the jigsaw, the Tetris game of my

641
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,800
entire life? Right? Am I doing it right? Maybe this experience that I'm saying goes here,

642
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,680
actually goes further out in my life. Right? When I was trying to get the book published,

643
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,400
one of the publishers said, I do exactly what you're talking about in the book. I really like

644
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:07,120
hiking. I have an, she did, she explains she had an injury and she likes running, but now she does

645
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:12,960
like hiking. And she really likes concert and music. And she goes on a vacation with a friend

646
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,800
every year. They pick what they're going to go do. And she, there's this very expensive opera

647
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:23,120
that she wants to go see and et cetera. And she said, what I and our friend decided is that the

648
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,160
hiking trips and you know, this mountain, et cetera, we're going to pull these forward. And the sitting

649
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,440
in operas and these types of trips, the set in a church, we're going to push forward.

650
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,360
Push, push to the future.

651
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Push, push it in the future to, you know, maximize. It was like, if they get that order, right? If they

652
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,960
get that order wrong, right? They go all the opera and then they turn around like, holy shit,

653
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,320
I can't hike this mountain. Right. And so this, this fits in every aspect of your life, right?

654
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:58,240
College, you know, first job, pre-married, married, before kids, kids that are toddlers, not kidlers,

655
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,120
not toddlers. That type of thinking is really helpful. And you've been lucky. Experience has

656
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:09,600
taught you about the seasons with your kids. And I learned the hard way too. I was like, you know,

657
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,560
people tell you like, oh, your kids don't want to be with you when you're 13. And you're like,

658
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,760
you kind of forget when you were 13, right? Like you forget like, oh yeah, I didn't want to be

659
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,280
your own parents. And then, you know, it really hits you when you're just like, dad,

660
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,000
nobody hangs out with their dad that much. Come on. You know what I mean? Like, yeah.

661
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
One of the other things that you talk about and you've mentioned it already today, a couple of

662
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,880
times is philanthropy. So there's a story in the book about a woman who dies and leaves a large

663
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:45,600
gift. Tell that story again. Yeah. So there's a woman, she, it's one of those, you know, secret

664
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,920
millionaire stories, right? They're all out there. Like there's a secretary and then when she died,

665
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:56,480
you know, she had, you know, $10 million at Tootsie Roll Stock or whatever, right? And so

666
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,960
this woman was, I believe, a, a worked at a law firm, you know, saved her money, lived a,

667
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:10,560
by all, by all accounts, a very frugal life. And then when she died, she gave a, a multimillion

668
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:18,880
dollar gift to education. It was a charitable education. And, you know, everybody was like,

669
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:27,280
you know, that's so charitable and that's, that's, that's such a great thing. And, you know,

670
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,800
I had a different perspective, right? Like, you know, my perspective was when you're dead,

671
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:41,600
the money isn't yours, right? And so, and also that the, the target for her, you know, her bequeath

672
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:48,000
after her death would have been much better off receiving the money much earlier, a lower sum,

673
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,400
much earlier, and that the return on her charitable investment will be greater than any

674
01:02:52,400 --> 01:03:00,960
of her investment returns, right? And so, you know, I can't really get into her head to determine if

675
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,800
it's charitable, like, like, like I'm knowingly thinking I'm doing the right thing. I'm going to,

676
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,280
to save all this money and it's going to grow to a bigger pile and I'm going to give,

677
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:19,200
give it to a charity. But to me, it appears to be a tip on the way out, right? The money's got to go

678
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,880
somewhere. It was going to go either to the IRS who, you know, the government or redistribute,

679
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,600
redistribute the money the way they see fit, usually into wars and stuff. But I'll, I'll,

680
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,800
I'm all going to that subject, right? Or, or, or, or, or, or hairs or et cetera. But it's,

681
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:42,560
it's going somewhere. It's not yours, right? It's, it's gone. So the fact that it just wound up

682
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:49,600
into this educational charity, you know, I didn't see it as charitable as much and it is impactful

683
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:54,880
as just giving the money earlier. Like life is urgent. Life is now. And I argue that the return

684
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,720
on investment in your charitable endeavors is greater than any return in the market you can get.

685
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,280
Well, and this is sort of interesting because, you know, think about what our mutual friend,

686
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,920
John Arnold did 10 years ago, which was before he even hits the age of 40.

687
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,640
It's great.

688
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:19,040
He decides I'm no longer going to do this full-time. My full-time job is now giving this money away.

689
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,520
Right. It was, it's, it's, it's great. John's great. And we've had a lot of conversations about this,

690
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:29,600
about like, you know, making sure the money actually gets distributed, gets, gets, gets into

691
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:35,920
the purpose, you know, the helping causes. But John decided that I've been solving the problem

692
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:44,720
natural gas long enough. I have more money than I'll ever spend or need. And I really want to

693
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,560
dedicate my neurons to solving other problems. Right. So he takes an analytical approach,

694
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,040
a database driven approach to solving some of society's ills and solving some problems and

695
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,000
trying to get ahead of some of these intractable problems, which is, which is awesome. And, and

696
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,720
the fact that he's doing so young, I even argue with John, like he did it too late. He's still

697
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,040
late. You know what I mean? Because he was on autopilot too, in my opinion, trading, right?

698
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:14,880
Like, it's like, what are you working for? You know, like, you know, like, you know,

699
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,960
have this conversation to John's like, what's the money for? What can't you buy? You know,

700
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,240
and to a certain extent, the money became a detriment, you know, based, based on your value

701
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,600
system, right? Like, if you're like, Hey, and I mentioned this book, it's like, yeah, I can have

702
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,480
Maroon 5 play in my backyard every day, etc. But you don't want to ruin your kids by spending the

703
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,360
money and consuming it that way. And I'm using the Maroon 5 as an exact, as like an exaggerated

704
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,400
example. But like, there's all kinds of consumption that you don't want to have, because you don't

705
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,280
want your kids to have that, then the money became a negative, right? Like you really work too low for,

706
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,760
because you're working for money that you cannot spend, you cannot consume,

707
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:02,240
right? And you could start giving away and having an impact on the other things you want to do now.

708
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:10,080
And I think one of the things that John exemplifies is how to give money away thoughtfully.

709
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,400
Correct.

710
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,920
And what you realize when you spend any length of time within which you've spent more than I have,

711
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,000
it is really hard to give money away strategically and thoughtfully, which is why I suspect John and

712
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,520
Laura set themselves up with 50 years of a runway to give. Yeah. And I don't know, there's a pretty

713
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,360
good chance they still won't be able to give it all away, right?

714
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,120
Well, I think, I think what they're doing is like, effectively giving away, right? Like, they want to

715
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,120
solve problems, database decisions, like there's, there's-

716
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,640
But it takes time. I mean, that's the other point.

717
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,480
It definitely takes time.

718
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:52,320
You have to invest the time to try something out, see if it works, if it does double down,

719
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:57,520
if it doesn't learn why it doesn't pivot. And, you know, you can't do that if you say,

720
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,760
look, at the end of my life, I'm going to give away a billion dollars.

721
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,480
No.

722
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,440
Like, it won't be effective. So there's a double issue here. There's the issue you already said,

723
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,320
which is the compounding issue. No. If you give a billion dollars away in 50 years

724
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:16,560
versus giving away half a billion dollars or, you know, a hundred million dollars 30 years sooner,

725
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,240
that money will do more good. But there's another layer to that, which is you have a chance to learn

726
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,880
from what that money did and make corrections that themselves allow for more thoughtful giving.

727
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,320
Yeah. They're immediately jumping into the problem and let the experiments run the course

728
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,560
and they have the time to do it. So, and they're doing it, you know, I can't say enough about the

729
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,160
Lauren John Arnold Foundation about the way they're going in and helping people and solving problems.

730
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,960
But the other thing that you talked about in the book that really, probably, this is probably the

731
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:57,680
reason I had my wife read it right away was the idea of, you know, we sometimes think that there

732
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,080
are people in our lives that we want to give money to at some point, you know, and you sort

733
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,640
of think like, God, this, you know, that's a person that was, you know, really important in my life

734
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,760
or in our lives. And, you know, maybe we leave them X amount of dollars at some point. Right.

735
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,800
And then you sort of realize, well, why don't you finish why that's maybe not necessarily the right

736
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:23,920
strategy. So the same laws of physics that govern my body and the utility of money over time for me

737
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,440
applies to my kids. Right. Maybe they have a little bit longer lifespan or health, man,

738
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:35,280
or relatives or anybody else relatives or anybody, anybody, right. Like the utility of money to them

739
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,640
falls a curve, right, depending on how healthy they are, et cetera. You can just kind of draw it.

740
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,800
Right. Like, you know better than I muscle decay rates for people in shape, not in shape, working

741
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:53,280
out, you know, et cetera. So this curve applies to them. So, you know, a lot of people like, oh,

742
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,920
when I die, I'm going to give, you know, I used to have people on my will that are like close to my

743
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:03,600
age. Right. Like I'm going to give money to them when I die. And I'm like, wait a minute, I'm going

744
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,520
to give my money to a 72 year old. Like, wouldn't it be better if I gave them less money now, like

745
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,240
let them spend it and apply it because the utility of money for them is drastic. Right.

746
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:23,920
Like the day before you die, I cannot pay you anything. I cannot get you to delay gratification.

747
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,520
Right. That's what savings is, right. You're delaying gratification. Right. And so like,

748
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,880
there is no gratification the next day. Right. And so like, if you take it from the day before you

749
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:41,040
die, two days before you die to right now, right, there's this curve, right. This compensation you

750
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:48,640
need for delayed gratification. And it makes no sense for me to be leaving money to 65 year olds

751
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:55,360
and 62 year olds. It's give it to them where the money has the most impact. Right. Where they'll

752
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,600
have the most utility of that money. And so when you're off autopilot and think, yeah, that's what

753
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,520
everybody does. They break down a well and when they die, et cetera. Now the will has a purpose.

754
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,920
If you die early, you've got to distribute the money. But really before you die, if you live a

755
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,160
normal, a normal life, there should be nothing left to give. You should have already given it away.

756
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,360
Again, when I read your book and you articulate it that way, it's such,

757
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:31,280
I mean, it's such a gut punch of this realization. And one example is kids, right. But I, you know,

758
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,880
I think like my wife and I have people in our lives that we're not related to that we

759
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:42,000
value so much. And we've always said like, yeah, you know, like we want to give them X number of

760
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,840
dollars at this point in time. I've had that. I had a good year and you know, there was people that

761
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,880
I would, you know, give money to if I had a good year or I'm not going to wait till I'm dead.

762
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,240
Are there people in my will? And I just went down and listened, you know, the

763
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,840
maximum tax free gift you can give per year per person is $15,000. And I had a, I think a

764
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:09,200
30 to 50 person list of $15,000 to, to, to give to people. Right. Because I was like, I need to

765
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,600
apply and this was me reading my own book. Right. Like, so a lot of people like, why'd you write

766
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,480
the book? I wrote it to save my own life. Right. I didn't want one waste my life. I wanted to get

767
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,040
the most net fulfillment. And after I wrote the book and I, you know, mainly I talk about children,

768
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:29,200
but I thought about that applies to everybody. Right. If I'm going to do something nice and

769
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,920
give something or leave something to somebody, it's like, it's now. Yeah. Absolutely. It's right

770
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,960
now. Well, especially when you think about exactly what you said, which is that person will do much

771
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:47,200
more with that in applying it to their fulfillment curve. Correct. In real time. Right. Because when

772
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,280
you, when you, when you're really giving somebody money, right, you're giving them life energy,

773
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,320
you're giving the ability to make choices, right? Like you're, you're giving them fulfillment,

774
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:03,360
right? So, you know, waiting till they're 96 on a deathbed, right? They can't really convert that

775
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,160
into fulfillment. You really didn't give them what you wanted to give them. Right. So when you look

776
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:13,280
at their, their curve of their life, right? Like, wait, Oh wow, here's the maximum insertion point.

777
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:21,040
And as a matter of fact, wow, $5,000 right now at let's say 33 is like 150,000. And

778
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,920
like 86, you know, it's actually more and more impactful, right? There's more going in life,

779
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,640
more choices, things going on. And then the cumulative effect, the fact that when they have

780
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,440
that experience, not only do they enjoy that experience at that point, whatever that experience

781
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:41,040
is, they get dividends from that experience, right? They talk about with their friends,

782
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,800
they become more interesting. They recall that and they get enjoyment out of it. It's like,

783
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,720
Oh, remember that ski trip we went on, we had a great time with the kids. Yeah, that was great.

784
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,280
They get fulfilled from that. So they get memory dividends associated from that experience.

785
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,280
Whereas if you give it to a 96, they do it once they consume it, if they can even do it,

786
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:06,720
and then they die. Right. How do you help a person do the math? Because we've talked about this

787
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:13,040
quite a bit, and you've alluded to it, there is really a curve. And, you know, this is where

788
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,960
both your background primarily as an engineer and a trader come into solving what becomes a

789
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,480
mathematical set of equations, where you have certain variables you need to understand, right?

790
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:33,440
So let's say we're solving this for me or for you, or an arbitrary person who's sitting here,

791
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,800
who's 50 years old. Okay. So 50 year old person is listening to this or 30 year old person,

792
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,000
I mean, we should do it, maybe we do a few different scenarios. So let's start with the

793
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:49,920
kind of 50 year old who is firmly planted on the treadmill of autopilot. Okay. So their kids are in,

794
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,680
you know, middle school and high school. They're, I mean, they realize how much money they need for

795
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:02,800
college for their kids. They've got a mortgage payment, they've got a good job. And they have

796
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:09,520
a fuzzy notion that they're going to work another 15 to 20 years. And they come to you and they say,

797
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,920
Bill, I read the book, I buy the thesis, I don't know how to implement it for my numbers

798
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,040
and for my fulfillment curve. How do you help them think about it?

799
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,360
The main thing is, it's very individual, right? It's like, what do you want? Like,

800
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,440
if you're sitting there, like, I just like working and going in and that's all I do.

801
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,360
No. Okay. So I'll be the guy. So I'm going to say.

802
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,720
You'd be the guy.

803
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:35,840
Yeah. So, Bill, no, I do have interests, but I got to be honest with you, man, I've backed away

804
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,440
from them. You know, I've kind of let them go. I've let myself go a little bit. So I before my

805
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:47,360
wife and I had kids, we loved traveling. And before our kids were born, we hiked the entire rim of the

806
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,760
Grand Canyon. We went down to the Colorado River back up for the greatest thing we ever did. And

807
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,320
then once the kids came, we were kind of head down and work. And I just want to make sure that my kids

808
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,360
don't have debt when they go to college. So what I what I do is like, okay, will your kids have

809
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,320
went in debt? I get what's reality and what's what's what's, you know, just fear, fear based

810
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,200
thinking. Okay. So we try and get on that. And one of the things I'd look for is like, why don't you

811
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,480
go traveling with the kids? And you're like, well, it's a pain in the ass. Whatever. I was like,

812
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,880
well, no, it's also so expensive, Bill. I mean, do you understand what it costs now? I mean,

813
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,560
right now, if we wanted to take, I mean, you know, one of my kids has a friend who did this African

814
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,360
Safari a year ago. They said it was amazing. But I, you know, to price that trip bill today,

815
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,000
$30,000 to go do that African Safari now with the airlines with the Safari. I mean, it's,

816
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,040
that's a lot of money. So what I say is, is when you die, we like, will you have $30,000? Are you

817
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:48,160
in track to die with $30,000? $50,000? Yeah, I hope so. Okay. So then would you rather

818
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:54,960
consume that $30,000 now? Or and and have this experience with your kids, etc? Or would you rather

819
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,320
have $30,000 left over when you die? And then I just want to be safe. I mean, how do I know?

820
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,560
Then, you know, we can sit down and go down the hard numbers is like,

821
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,360
do you have insurance if you lose your job? What is safe? What do you need? What do you envision

822
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:20,320
yourself doing in retirement that you can't afford? Right? What bad thing that will happen

823
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,800
that we can't buy an insurance policy for? Is it long term care insurance? You know, if you get

824
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,600
that while you're young, it's actually pretty cheap. It's very cheap. Right. You know, I look

825
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,920
at what risks they're, they're having and I look at ways to mitigate them. Right. So a lot of people

826
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,160
who are conservative, like, Oh, I'm worried about something happening. I'm like, what's the something

827
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:44,720
happening that you're worried about? Right. When you do that with people, Bill, how often are they

828
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:51,600
able to articulate clearly what they're afraid of versus it being kind of just a fuzzy notion of

829
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:57,680
a lot of its fuzzy notion. And we just keep pushing and pulling it out. What if this happens? What if

830
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:03,040
I get sick? What if, or whatever, right? Like we go over like medical insurance, like then it's worth

831
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,760
basically what happens is people try to act as their own insurance agent with a client of one.

832
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,080
Right. That's very difficult to underwrite.

833
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:17,600
So, so, so they have a client of one. They really don't understand the odds of the bad things

834
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,560
happening. Right. And so what they tend to do is put it in this big, giant fear bucket of insurance

835
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,760
premium. And they just work and save and save and save to think that they have the notional to cover

836
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,240
all these bad things happening. And a lot of times I'll point out two things. I go, one, some of these

837
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:41,680
bad things that you're saving for, you'll never get the notional. Right. You get some, you know,

838
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,520
maybe you will or whatever, but most of the people I talk to, I was like, do you know, it was like

839
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:51,360
$25,000 a night for my dad in the hospital. Like if insurance didn't cover that,

840
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,120
console, doesn't matter. Right. Like I'm not, you know what I mean? He's only got x days, right?

841
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,600
Like you're not, you're not saving. Some of these things are like, you shouldn't be the insurer,

842
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,680
right? If you're actually afraid of that, and that's important to you, you need to buy the

843
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:11,360
insurance policy where they have the lower large numbers and their edge is 6% or 8%. You are going

844
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,400
to be woefully inefficient. And on top of that, you don't even know the odds. Like some of these

845
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,800
things are like, you know, robot alien space insurance. Like, wait, you're worried about this.

846
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Like, and then I also like to do a, you know, a comparison. Like, okay, here's the risk of the

847
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,720
scenario happen and this bad thing happen and it's bad. Right. Well, accept it. And here's the risk

848
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:41,280
of you not doing the thing that you want to do now. Right. Here's the risk of you not doing the

849
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,880
trip. Like, what does that look like on your deathbed when you know you couldn't have gone

850
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,320
on the safari and had this wonderful time with your kids and, and connected with them and something to

851
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:58,720
talk about forever and expanded your worldview. Was it worth the $30,000? Was it worth the insurance

852
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,960
policy that you're trying to, was it worth you trying to play insurance agent? And so a lot of

853
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,600
these are thematic conversations and not like hard number conversations, but you have a model. Yeah.

854
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,920
Yeah. We have a model, but the problem with the model is it's an abstraction, right? The variables

855
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:18,880
we're talking about are infinite. Yep. Right. And we have to have track them, extract them, extract.

856
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:24,480
So what the model does, it really tells you the direction and it's very good on the direction,

857
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,120
but the magnitude, it may be off. Right. And so for you as a person, it's like, what's your survival

858
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,360
number? We have that model, like really think about like, okay, just survival, not I'm hanging

859
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:41,600
out. Yeah. Not thriving, but surviving. What do you need? Then after that, right? It's all your

860
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,960
choices, right? And depending on who you are, right? Cause there's infinite choices and what those

861
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,360
choices will cost and the experiences you want to have in your life, plus the discovery, the, you

862
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:58,720
know, 20 to 30% discovery, you know, maybe all your experiences go into 50 bucket, right? You didn't

863
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:03,200
realize it and you're actually inadvertently pushing them in the 70 bucket and you're not going

864
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:10,160
to have them. And so that's kind of what I try and get people to do is like, are you going to

865
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:17,760
have $30,000 trips in your lifetime? And they'll go, yes. When is the optimal time for you to have

866
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:25,520
$30,000 trips and with whom, right? If you're ever, if you're never going to have a $30,000 trip,

867
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,040
I'm like, okay, let's think of a different type of activity that you can do that doesn't come,

868
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,120
that will get you the same fulfillment or close to it. That's not a $30,000 trip. Right. I mean,

869
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,760
to me, that's the interesting distinction, right? It's like maybe somebody listening to this says,

870
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,760
are you freaking crazy? Like I'll never take a $30,000 trip ever, ever in my life. Yeah. The

871
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:48,400
bigger point is, is there a trip that you think you will take near the end of your life and you're

872
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:55,600
holding back on taking it now? I mean, to me, that is one of the big aha insights from this philosophy.

873
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,800
And if you're, you're, you're in that thing, well, I'm, I'm saving because of just in case,

874
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,640
it's like, guy, you're not the best insurance agent. You're actually the worst insurance agent.

875
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:08,400
You don't know the odds. You can never have the notional and the, the, the edge, the premium that

876
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,160
you're extracting from yourself. And that edge is your own life, right? Like you have to give up

877
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:17,440
hours of your life to have this insurance premium is way, way more than just paying the insurance

878
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:21,600
company. Right. So people worry about running out of money. I'm like, get an annuity. You're worried

879
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,080
about long-term care health, long-term health. And what if I'm sick and I can't move and I need

880
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,000
nurses, get long-term care insurance. It's really cheap when you start early. It's really, it's

881
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,480
surprisingly cheap. You know, what about this? Like there's an insurance product for a lot of

882
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,960
things people are like, quote unquote saving or worried for, et cetera. And I'm like,

883
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,440
let's mitigate the risks with the professionals. Let's get you living your life.

884
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:50,960
So how do you get through to somebody when you confront perhaps an even more illogical problem?

885
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,360
Because the problem that we just discussed is actually quite logical. Like it's easy to

886
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:01,440
understand why a person would think I have to save for a rainy day. That's been pretty ingrained

887
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:08,160
into a responsible person. To me, there's a far less logical reason that people forego

888
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,800
doing things when they're young. And by young, I mean kind of like middle age, like in their

889
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,480
work. Or right now. Young is right now. Yeah. And it's because they're so busy making money.

890
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,800
Yeah. So this is probably the one. That's the rat in the wheel with no cheese, right? Like,

891
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,440
you know, they got habituated. That's right. They got a habituated, like you take a rat, you,

892
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,560
you know, get them to run the wheel, you give them the cheese, you give them the run wheel,

893
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,440
they do the cheese. And pretty soon you don't even have to give them the cheese. They see the wheel,

894
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:42,480
they just start running. Right. And, and, and the reward is no longer the goal. It's just to do the

895
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:47,280
thing, right? To do the thing. And so how do you help somebody break that? That is that, that is

896
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:55,280
the hardest one to break because they've been brainwashed into thinking that this is what I

897
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:00,560
want to do. And it's one of the hardest things to extract somebody from. And so I have to explain

898
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,520
to them, like, where do you socialize? You know, we just go through it. Like, where do you eat?

899
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,960
Where do you eat lunch? Well, I like the people at work and like hanging out, you know, I get,

900
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,080
I get this. Like, I don't want to quit work. I like hanging out with the people. I'm like,

901
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,000
you can quit work and take the people on a trip with you. You can vacation with them. You can

902
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,640
still visit them at night and play bingo games. Like the people don't go away just because you

903
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,440
don't show up at work. You can still spend time and you can actually spend more quality time with

904
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,720
the people at work if you exercise that muscle, but they don't know how to invite people over

905
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:34,480
their house or, Hey, we're going to go see the Chris Rock show tonight, which I'm going to go do.

906
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,960
It's Chris Rock in town tonight or is in Houston. No, here in Austin tonight.

907
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,360
I didn't even know. See, there you go. A new experience you might have, but anyway, like

908
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,840
they don't know how to do that. Right. And so I try and like, it's a very long conversation. Like

909
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,400
you can do this, you can do that. You can actually, everything that you're getting out of work,

910
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,960
that social benefit, all these little excuses, the mental stimulation. I'm like,

911
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,920
you know, John was like, these real life problems are more mentally stimulating than,

912
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,840
than the natural gas puzzle. I still like the natural gas puzzle, but these are more mentally

913
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:13,280
stimulating, more purposeful, more fulfilling to me. Right. And so I have to break down brick by

914
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,680
brick, right? How and show them how they got habituated and how they haven't exercised these

915
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:26,400
other muscles and how they can replace it. You realize it's not work is not the unique thing

916
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,960
to get the things you're getting out of work. Right. It's actually a bastardization of it.

917
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,200
It's minimizing those experience. You're not actually getting the most quality time

918
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,000
with your coworkers in the working environment. You're actually not getting the most mental

919
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:48,960
exercise. That's not necessarily the best mental exercise for you in the work environment. Right.

920
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,600
It's just, you know, nothing else. Cause you've been stuck in this lab, running on this type of

921
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:03,520
wheel, you know, and it's really hard because people will be extremely, extremely resistant.

922
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,760
Right. Like change is painful. Right. If you, if you, if you, if you get somebody who hasn't

923
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,040
worked out forever and you're like, Hey, let's go into the gym. We're going to work out. It's like,

924
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,240
Oh God, why am I here? I don't like this. You know what I mean? Like just to develop the muscle

925
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,400
to do the thing, to play the tennis, the fulfilling thing. It's, it's a process. Right. And, and, you

926
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:29,600
know, you have to show them the reward that life is rich. It's fat. It's wonderful. It's, it is one

927
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,280
of the biggest cliches ever, which is the person on their death bed who says, I wish I didn't work

928
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,360
so hard. And yet we all know this cliche and yet many of us still work too hard. Habits are powerful.

929
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,120
Like one of the things I took away from like, you know, the habit books like Tiny Habits by B.J.

930
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:51,120
Fogg is a great book is that they're powerful. They're extremely powerful. And so we have,

931
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,760
we get habituated in many different ways, right? For good or bad, right? Like if you,

932
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,840
if you have the snacks in your house and you eat 200 calories a day, you know, and, you know,

933
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,640
two years, you're like 40 pounds heavier, right? 200 extra calories, right? Like how did that happen?

934
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,520
Right. You know, how did I forget, you know, how did my life pass me by? How did I not go on these

935
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,360
trips? How did I not have these experiences? How did I not call my mother? How did I not say I love

936
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:19,440
you to these people even pick up the phone because my habits took over, right? They took over towards

937
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:28,320
this purpose and it just absorbed my life. And so, you know, I, you know, outside the book with my

938
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,600
friends, you know, I really talk about, you know, the good of habits, right? You can form good habits

939
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,760
that keep you healthy. But some of the habits, you know, the consequences of some of our habits

940
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:44,640
to be successful and how it takes away from other things. Right. And so. So how has that been a

941
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:50,720
struggle for you? Oh, I wrote that book for me. I wrote it to save my life. People think I didn't,

942
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:56,000
you know, the first life I wanted to save was my own. Put your life mask on first. You know, I am

943
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,560
just as guilty as the next person is being on autopilot. I constantly have to remind myself

944
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:08,400
that I'm going to die, that life isn't forever. This period ends. These seasons, what my daughters

945
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:13,280
end these seasons, what my startups and all these things. And I have to think about like, what do I

946
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,000
want? How do I balance them? What's optimized? Right. And I don't get it exactly right. But I do

947
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,400
it better than if I was just completely on autopilot. And then sometimes I was like, Oh, shit,

948
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,360
I was on autopilot. Why didn't I think about this? You know, and what do you use to help jar you out

949
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:33,760
of autopilot on these things? I mean, the first macro thing is, is the death clock. Or right now

950
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:41,120
I have this, this, this calendar up and it's, it's, it's a 4,000 weeks and you mark off each week

951
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:49,920
and it's a very visceral representation about like life is finite. You know, this period,

952
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:57,200
not only will you die somewhere around here, but this period is going to end. Right. And, and

953
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,000
a lot of times when people go on vacation, right, knowing that the vacation ends on Friday,

954
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,760
snaps you up. You're like, Oh, shit, I'm going to go here and do this and I'm going to stay out. And,

955
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,400
you know, we only have a couple of days. So let's do the cafe and let's, you know, do X, Y, and Z.

956
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:15,200
And you actually get more out of the trip knowing it's going to end as opposed to living obliviously,

957
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,040
you know, and all of a sudden time to go, wait, it's time to go. I forgot to do this or go see the

958
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,440
Eiffel Tower or go whatever it is on your trip. And so same thing with life. When, when, when you

959
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:31,760
know life is going to end, it becomes more urgent, right? And even, even the segment in your life,

960
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,000
when you know, you know, your early fifties are going to end, you're like, it becomes more urgent.

961
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:41,840
You become more deliberate. You get off autopilot. So that's the first layer of, of, of, of,

962
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,640
so each week you do check off a box on the calendar.

963
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:48,240
I've been in Austin and traveling, but when I come back, I see it, I see it's in my closet. So I

964
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,960
walk by it every day. It's a constant reminder, right? Where'd you get this calendar? By the way,

965
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,200
online, there was like some sort of stoic reflections out there. A memento, Maury,

966
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,320
remember death, you know, and so I saw it and I used to have it on my phone and you just count

967
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:09,120
down backwards to my estimated death date. That app no longer works, but the, the, the,

968
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:14,480
the seeing it every time, you know, is, is, is great. You know, if they get, if I get another widget

969
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,720
that counts down, we'll have both of them. Right. And I used to do it for other things like till

970
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:24,640
Christmas to your daughter's 14 till, till, till the job, the 15 year anniversary, right? It's like,

971
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:30,080
wow, my daughter's going to be, you know, 16, she's going to be driving. What, how am I going to

972
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,600
pry experiences out of my daughter? Cause your daughters don't want to know you right

973
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,720
before she's really gone, right? She gets a car and she's Sia deuces, you know,

974
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:46,000
that type of thing. So that really helps me, you know, it gives me kind of an alarm that wakes me

975
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,400
up out of autopilot. Right. And, and, and, and that's the thing I personally use.

976
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,280
How do you help somebody think about when their net worth should peak? Because a clear,

977
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:04,880
uh, implication of everything we're talking about is net worth probably needs to peak a lot sooner

978
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:11,360
than it currently does. As you said, I think the default for most working people is that net worth

979
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:16,320
peaks sometime after retirement or certainly around the time of retirement, even if they're

980
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,920
thinking about drawing down. But again, for most people, given the age of retirement, there's a,

981
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:27,440
a mismatch between when they're hitting peak net worth and when they're hitting peak capacity

982
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:32,000
to utilize net worth. There's a massive, it's a massive mismatch mismatch. You know, uh, you know,

983
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,480
one of the things I wanted to do, and I wish I knew you back then because you can, uh, you could

984
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,240
have helped me as I was like, I want to know about all these frailty curves, like bone,

985
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:47,520
density, lung capacity, what activities become less enjoyable first and then unable to do. Right.

986
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:54,000
Because that determines a lot when your net worth should peak. So I estimated it somewhere in your

987
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:02,160
fifties. Wow. Right. Like, like, and the data kind of shows that like when I, when I went to

988
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:08,160
St. Petersburg and climbed the 200 and I'll think it was 11 steps to walk around the Bannister,

989
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:13,760
all these tour buses coming, St. Petersburg, Asian, whatever, not one person over those tour buses

990
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:19,600
that was elderly climbed the 211 steps. So St. Petersburg was a different St. Petersburg for them.

991
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,160
They didn't have the same experience. I got more out of St. Petersburg for them. Now I'm not saying

992
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:28,640
it wasn't a wonderful trip and a nice trip for them, but they probably pushed St. Petersburg too

993
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:36,960
late in life. Yep. And so, you know, there's so much hidden data and data out there and reports.

994
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,440
If you read it where, you know, we talked about it earlier, like trying to get people to spend

995
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,720
their money down. Right. And one of the things, answers I give, you know, they say, well, why do

996
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:53,280
you think people are still, their net worth is still going up into 72? And, you know, part of it

997
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:58,560
is, you know, asset appreciation and going faster than they can spend it. But the real answer is

998
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:07,840
they can't. Yeah. They cannot spend it down. Life has passed them by. They no longer have the attitude

999
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:15,680
or aptitude, you know, to do this. Like they can't do it. You'd be surprised how many people die on

1000
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:22,000
those cruise ships trying to swim when they get to St. Thomas. It's, you know, I'm going to do this

1001
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,720
and, you know, they think their life's going to be like a carnival commercial. And I'm like, that

1002
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,680
carnival commercial will kill most Americans. Right. They're having heart attacks going down those

1003
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:38,160
slides. Right. Yeah. And so. And that, of course, just speaks to the imbalance between the three

1004
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,360
variables. It's like if you spent a little bit more of your time on your health, you would buy

1005
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:48,480
yourself a bigger runway to utilize your wealth on the experiences. Right. So particularly for

1006
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:54,080
Americans like this book, my book is most successful in Japan, which is which is strange. Yeah. Say why?

1007
01:32:54,480 --> 01:33:01,040
I think one, you know, you I believe you'll get value out of this book in the way of thinking,

1008
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:08,400
even if you have zero wealth. But Japan has a savings problem. Like, you know, Japan saves,

1009
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,600
saves, saves, then they die and they give the money to the next generation. They save, save,

1010
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:16,240
save. And I'm just like, well, what generation actually has fun? Right. So I'm really counters

1011
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,240
to the culture there. Right. We hear, you know, one of the criticisms of the book will be like,

1012
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,320
well, there's so many people that have zero and trying to make ends meet. I'm like, I get it. They

1013
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:29,120
can still get value out of this about getting the Tetris of their life. Right. But maybe, you know,

1014
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,240
a wealth building book or like how to make dollars book might be, you know, more useful to them at

1015
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:40,400
this time in their life. Right. And Japan is the opposite. And also Japan, Japanese, they're

1016
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:46,000
healthier. Like when I walk around, they're healthier longer. Yes. If you walk around Japan,

1017
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,240
like the old people around, you know, it's an older country, but they're around, they're moving,

1018
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,000
they're doing things or having activities, etc. They're doing, they're enjoying their life. For

1019
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:02,880
Americans, looking at, you know, the obesity epidemic and the lifestyle of Americans, that

1020
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:11,360
their ability to consume experiences way deteriorates way, way faster and way earlier than say the

1021
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:19,280
Japanese. Let's go back to risk again. You, we were talking before about how, what's the mantra

1022
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:24,640
of the energy trader or the gas trader? Yeah. Yeah. The name of the game is the standard game.

1023
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,720
Right. Like sort of like Simon Sinek's book, The Infinite Game, right? It's not about winning. It's

1024
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:34,160
about being able to keep playing over and over and over again. So inherent in that is never making

1025
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:40,320
a bet or a trade that can completely wipe you out and take you out of the game. I mean, by the nature

1026
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:46,160
of the business, even the smallest position can take you out of the game. It's really about taking

1027
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:52,240
prudent risk reward and then stopping out when you can. Right. Life is risk, right? You can get hit by

1028
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,480
a bus, a meteor can hit you, you know, you can get some sort of crazy infectious disease. Like you can

1029
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,400
get a bum deal, right? Just going out, but you're not going to live in a bubble. You're going to

1030
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:07,280
take calculated risks. So in trading, we're optimizing for profits, right? You're going

1031
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:13,040
to take risks that in a tail scenario can blow you out. The key is taking prudent risk reward

1032
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:18,160
decisions, right? Like, you know, I don't smoke. It's not a, it's not, it's not the rewards not

1033
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:23,520
great enough. I did go skydiving the first time the reward was great. The second time it was

1034
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:28,480
half as great. I didn't do it the third time because the risk was the same and the reward wasn't.

1035
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,320
Right. The reward was going down and the risk was still the same. And so this is the same thing in

1036
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,160
trading, right? Like we look at everything on a risk reward basis and the likelihood of dying,

1037
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:43,200
right? And if things go awry, can we get out, right? Have I sized my position? Can I get out?

1038
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,600
Is the liquidity there? And all these things are going on all the time, right? You have to.

1039
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,680
How do you think about that in a person's life? I mean, I like the example of skydiving.

1040
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:57,120
How do you think about this now in terms of the seasons of the person's life? Where are there,

1041
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:02,880
are there certain seasons where certain risks make sense? Be it financial risks or.

1042
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,680
I'll give you, I'll give you a great example of physical risk. Yeah. Okay. So I have a, a

1043
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,000
cartilage disappearing in L3, L4, right? Bones are hitting each other. So I'm, they, I'm,

1044
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,960
I'm wise against doing impact things. And I was 50 years old in the islands and guys were going

1045
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,040
to go wakeboarding. And I was like, I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I'm going to hang out

1046
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:30,400
in the beach. I'm going to love. And I thought about it for a second. I said, I don't have many

1047
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:37,440
wakeboarding times left. Like I'm not going wakeboarding at 60, right? I have, I have this

1048
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:43,520
to journal back thing, you know, Carlos, you know, it's going to be more dangerous for me, et cetera.

1049
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,680
If I am to wakeboard, it has to be that it is now it is in this time period. And then I thought,

1050
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:55,120
okay, it's in this time period. I'm like, okay, how many times am I going to be in warm water

1051
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:01,520
with my buddies where there's a wakeboarding boat ready to go in the next two years?

1052
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,480
I don't know. This is it. I don't foresee it happening, you know, like I could make a special

1053
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,480
effort for it, but like, it's just there in my lap and I don't have something else to do,

1054
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,320
et cetera. And I was like, I'm going to go wakeboarding. This is probably the last time

1055
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,880
I got on a wakeboarding. That was the last time I went wakeboarding.

1056
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,720
How much did it hurt? It didn't hurt. It didn't hurt. I actually jumped the weight too. I made

1057
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:28,720
a nice jump of the wake. I said, I'm going to send it. I sent it, you know, it didn't hurt that much.

1058
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,560
It wasn't like that. But afterwards, like there was a little tension in my back, et cetera.

1059
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:38,320
And, you know, stretching and trying to like, you know, but like I was very conscious, like, okay,

1060
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,960
I got to be, you know, careful, right? Coming across it. And now I wake, sir. Right? Like I

1061
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,320
do the low impact version of the sport, which I absolutely love until, you know, there's some

1062
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:53,600
technique to like put cartilage in my back and restrengthen my back. I, you know, I'm waiting

1063
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,240
for the technology to catch up. So maybe I'll get my backpack. But right now, it's the last time I

1064
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:03,360
went wakeboarding, you know, that was the risk was worth the reward. There was no other time that

1065
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:09,280
I'm, you know, now as I get older, wakeboarding is much more dangerous. Right. And so I've gone

1066
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:14,480
to a sport where the speed of the sport, you know, a lot of people think, you know, well, you know,

1067
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:19,840
if you're going 10 miles per hour versus 12 miles per hour, it's only two miles per hour difference,

1068
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:25,680
but it's a 44% difference in force, right? Because force equals MV squared. And so, you know,

1069
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,800
people don't realize that, well, I'm acutely aware of it. And I'm like, okay, I want to be in this

1070
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:37,840
something I can get fulfilled where the risk is not as great. Right. And so I have

1071
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:44,240
a 44% reduction in, you know, force, which is great, you know, great for me when I fall.

1072
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,560
So what year was it that you had that incredible birthday?

1073
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:56,880
Gosh, I'm pretty sure it's 45. Right. But I've had an incredible birthday since then. But like

1074
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,920
the one in the book is 45. And I'm pretty sure it's 45. I think it's, I think it, well, how about this?

1075
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:07,520
Uh, it was 2008, right around 2008.

1076
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:09,680
Okay.

1077
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:14,160
No, no, no, there was a second one. I had two birthday parties. It was 45, 45. Let's say 45.

1078
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:21,680
All right. So at the time you spend a lot of money, was it for you enough money that you were like,

1079
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,480
am I crazy doing this? Like, did you have second thoughts about it?

1080
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:28,160
I had second thoughts, like, you know, the events and the things I was planning.

1081
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,480
Remind me what was the, it was down in the Caribbean.

1082
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:38,960
Oh, so, so, so I, I, I, I, I went to St. Bart's. I love St. Bart's. It's, it's where I had my honeymoon.

1083
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,600
It's a great island. I think it's one of the best islands in the Caribbean.

1084
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:49,360
I, I obviously not everybody can go to St. Bart's and, you know, I tell people that become successful.

1085
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:59,120
Um, you either get new friends or you scholarship your friends. Right. Because you want to do

1086
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:03,120
experiences. A lot of times a lot of people want to do shared experiences, right? They want their

1087
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:08,240
friends to come. They can't afford to just pop up and spend thousands of dollars to go to St. Bart's

1088
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:12,640
or do X, Y, and Z when you're, you know, and it happens in various levels of success, right?

1089
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:17,600
Whether it's on a trip to Chicago, you know, super, like I can't do that, you know, like some people

1090
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:23,200
can and can't. And so as you become successful, you know, one of the experiences you want to have is to

1091
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,760
be around your friends and have shared experience with your friends. And so I, I, I coach people,

1092
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:34,480
I say, you have to lose this attachment that they have to pay, right? Or they need to pay or whatever.

1093
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:39,040
Like you have to think what's most important to you. Get off autopilot. It's to have shared

1094
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:44,240
experiences. And is it worth it for you to have them around? For me, I've had good friends throughout

1095
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:50,320
the years. It's, it's, it's unequivocal. Yes. Right. Friends and family. So, but it gets expensive.

1096
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:55,680
Right. And you have this, you know, you got to run out the hotel rooms, et cetera, and entertainment

1097
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:03,200
and plan this thing. But I was like, some of these people, you know, they have their own lives

1098
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,880
and own complications and conflicts. You won't get the time to do with it. Some of these people

1099
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:16,240
won't be alive. Right. May or may not be alive. You may drift apart. This is, this is the time.

1100
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:22,320
Right. I want to do this. And so as I was, you know, adding these people in and having my mother

1101
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,400
down and all this stuff, I had to just like a heavenly experience, you know, like walking on

1102
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:33,040
the beach, my mom's coming out of her beach house. My friends are hanging on the balcony, looking down.

1103
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,760
It's beautiful. The birds are out, et cetera. And hi, all the people I love. And we're going to do

1104
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,760
this fun activity. And we're going to listen to music, et cetera. You know, I imagine that that's

1105
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,720
what heavens is like, right? Like you're just, just having this experience. And what I did was I

1106
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:52,560
convert, you know, I realized that that's what I was working for. I was working to create these

1107
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:58,960
experiences. These are the things that fulfill me. Right. When I was planning it, it's like, oh,

1108
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,640
shit, there's a lot of goddamn money. You know what I mean? Like, what am I going to do? Is am I doing

1109
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:06,480
the right allocation? Right? Like, you never know if you get it exactly right. Right. Nobody gets it

1110
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:14,080
perfectly balanced, but this was the right direction. Right. You know, it reminds me of something. So

1111
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:26,640
when my wife and I got married in 2004, it was, I remember looking, so, you know, we got married at

1112
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,800
a golf club, you know, we didn't have two nickels to rub together, right? So it was like, I think

1113
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,200
the wedding, the ceremony, the reception, we're all at the same place. The whole thing costs less

1114
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:42,240
than $20,000, but it was obscene amount of money for us at the time. Right. And, and it was amazing

1115
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:46,800
because everybody we actually cared about in our lives was there. We were really fortunate that,

1116
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,840
hey, almost everybody could make it who we invited. Right. And, you know, there were almost 200 people

1117
01:42:51,840 --> 01:43:00,000
there. So at one point I grabbed my wife and we kind of walked out onto a balcony and could see

1118
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:08,480
everybody. And I said, do you realize that this is one of only two times in our life that we will be

1119
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:14,640
surrounded by everyone who's meaningful to us, who's alive. And the only other time it's going to

1120
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,400
occur, we're going to be dead. We'll be in the casket and be at our funeral. Correct. So we got

1121
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:25,120
to really take this in. Yeah. And I realize now there was a, there was a huge error in my logic,

1122
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,520
which was that was totally untrue. That didn't have to be true at all. You can create it. You

1123
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:37,120
can create that any time you want. Right. You can decide for no reason, I want to bring everybody in

1124
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:41,680
my life who matters. So a birthday party to a, to a, it could be a birthday party. It could be just

1125
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:48,000
a party. Correct. And most of my life is, is finding excuses to throw parties. You know, we,

1126
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,360
we autopilot waiting for certain events like weddings or funerals or, or, or special anniversaries

1127
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:59,280
or things like that. We autopilot like, Oh, that's when we get together. Right. So we, we,

1128
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,800
we allow autopilot to dictate when we do these things, instead of thinking, Hey,

1129
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,200
I really want to hang out with so-and-so, so-and-so-and-so-and-so let me design a trip or let me

1130
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,920
have a bowling alley or something. It could be low cost. It'd be like, let me have a picnic

1131
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,840
with a ball game talking shit. You know, one of the things that I want to do,

1132
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,400
which I guess the startup costs will be, will be something expensive. But like,

1133
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:25,760
I'm getting some laser tag guns and I put it in my group. I have this group called cool Austin

1134
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,720
people. I'll put you in it if you want to be in it. And I'm like, it's on. I'm going to get laser

1135
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,720
tag out best ass laser tag things. And we're going to, there's going to be some senior for

1136
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:38,800
and everybody's like, yes. You know what I mean? Like I'm creating this experience. Like, yeah,

1137
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,280
I'm going to kick some ass on laser tag, right. And shit talk, but I'm also going to connect and

1138
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:47,200
have a good time with people. Right. And I can do that. Once I put the initial costs, we could do

1139
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:51,760
that all the time. Right. We can have a league. We can have do all kinds of things. And it's like,

1140
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:55,840
you know, it doesn't have to be laser tag. It could be with a ball at the park. You can have a

1141
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:01,520
with Paulie low, low, low costs, you know, dollar store, pick up a pick up a whiff of all that.

1142
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,040
And then you're, you know, you're creating memories and somebody brings sandwiches and

1143
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:09,360
you can do that. Right. And that's getting off autopilot. So I'm sorry to interrupt you about

1144
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,440
but you really hit the nail on the head about that. It's like

1145
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,960
design your life. Think about what you want out of it and make it happen.

1146
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,600
Now, let me ask you a question at that birthday party when you're 45, how many people were there?

1147
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:33,040
We took out the Taiwan hotel and some of the other one 80, 180, 100 or something.

1148
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,840
And how much time did you get to spend with each person?

1149
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:39,920
We were there for a week. So I got to spend time. Whoever wanted to spend time with me,

1150
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:46,240
they got to spend time with me. Um, some people, you know, I have this thing. This is just me.

1151
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:51,680
I don't, I don't know if this isn't like some people I want their presence, but not saying

1152
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:57,600
anything. Just, I know you're okay. I get to see you being happy. Maybe I don't talk to you as

1153
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:02,560
much, but I get to enjoy you enjoying yourself. That's one of my favorite things at a party.

1154
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,520
When I throw a party, they're like, are you having a good time? It's crazy. Whatever. I'm like,

1155
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:11,440
I'm having the best. I'm watching the best fucking movie of my life right now. I am in an immersive

1156
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,880
theater of people. I love doing the thing they want to do now. I'm kind of antisocial. Like I

1157
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,160
don't like to talk that much when people like I get awkward sometimes. You know what I mean?

1158
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,160
Sometimes I grab my wife and I'm like, talk for me, talk for me. We'll go to a party and I'll be

1159
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:29,360
like, you got to talk for me, babe. I can't take it. I can talk to a million people. No problems.

1160
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:34,080
The stadium or whatever. But sometimes I get awkward. But what I really, really do enjoy and

1161
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:38,640
what really fulfills me is watching people I love have a good time. Yeah. So, so that's funny.

1162
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,760
That's, you know, I think after my wife read the book, that was one of her first thoughts,

1163
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,400
which is I've never had a birthday party. Uh, so last birthday party I had was, I was seven years

1164
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:54,720
old. And after that, I just decided I never wanted to have a party and I never have. And she's like,

1165
01:46:54,720 --> 01:47:02,160
like, I really want, you know, I know how much you are obsessed with your friends and how much

1166
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,840
you share with them individually, but wouldn't it be great for everybody to be under one roof for,

1167
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,680
you know, your birthday. And I'm resisting it to, to know, and she's, she'd never throw a surprise

1168
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:17,680
party for me. She knows that would just kill me. So she won't do that, but she's really negotiating

1169
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:24,720
with me to sort of have a party. And my view is like, it won't be enjoyable for me because I'll

1170
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:30,640
be the center of attention and I'll feel an obligation to give everybody the same amount

1171
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:39,280
of attention. Whereas like having dinner with five friends is infinitely more enjoyable. Right.

1172
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:45,920
So I'm trying to balance her. It's just a different experience. Like, yeah, yeah. But I guess what

1173
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,360
bums me out is like, I feel like I wouldn't even know how to appreciate a party.

1174
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:54,800
Yeah. I mean, I get that. Like I walk around and I just really enjoy people meeting and socializing

1175
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,720
and connecting like at my wedding, people like, you know, they're friends that didn't know each

1176
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,320
other and they're like, they're great. Like, you know, great people. And like, of course I do. Like,

1177
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:06,000
you find somebody who's great. Love you keep them close by. I don't care if you dated them or

1178
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,360
whatever. Like you, you, you keep them close, man. Like the people that vibe with you is very

1179
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:16,000
important to me. And me seeing them succeed. I'm a person that roots for people to hit the long

1180
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,920
ball. Like I'm not a hater. I'm a natural. Like I hope you crush it. I hope you become a trillionaire.

1181
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:28,000
I hope you whatever it is. Right. And so seeing people at a party and like, you know, I like that

1182
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,560
there were parties and make people have fun and create environments for them. Loosen up, enjoy

1183
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,520
each other, have a good time and watching that success and watching them interact is enjoyable

1184
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,160
for me, even though I might be just sitting there smiling, right? Like not really talking.

1185
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:48,320
So you can enjoy a party as much if you're the host or it's your birthday as if you're at somebody's

1186
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:53,280
party. You know, it depends. It's not always the same because, you know, you got to solve problems.

1187
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:57,600
Someone can't get in the ice maker's broken, whatever. Like there's that type of things.

1188
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:04,320
But yeah, I, I'd rather watch that movie than go to the movies. I'd rather be in that immersive

1189
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:10,480
theater than, you know, McKittrick Hotel and Sleep No More in New York, which is an immersive

1190
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:16,880
theater. That's the best theater. Right. And even so what? I only got to have a small conversation,

1191
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:21,280
whatever. Like the feedback there was like, I met this person. We had a great time. It was awesome.

1192
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,800
Like very fulfilling to me. Very fulfilling. What year did you finish writing Die with Zero?

1193
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:34,800
Ah, let's see. It had to be, it's supposed to come out in 2020. So it's probably 2019.

1194
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:42,880
2019. So 2019. In the, in the three years ish since you've written the book. Yeah.

1195
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:49,600
Has your thinking changed in anything? Have you evolved? Are you more nuanced in anything that

1196
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:55,840
you wrote about? I'm more, I'm, you know, it's kind of like when you write a formula, you know,

1197
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:00,560
and it's not like I like came up with this formula, this life cycle hypothesis thing,

1198
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,280
which is basically the book, right? This counterfactual rep minimization algorithm,

1199
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:11,120
and I'm solving for net fulfillment. It's not as if these ideas weren't out there. Right. Like I

1200
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,640
always say, like anybody could have like just thought about it and wrote this book. It's,

1201
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:21,520
it's, it's how I present it so that it hits the widest audience and so that it hits them viscerally.

1202
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:29,280
So they actually apply it. Right. And so I think about it deeper and deeper layers of it. Right.

1203
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,320
And sometimes I go deep into the subcatter because I use these variables, wealth, health, and time.

1204
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:39,120
And I'm like, what's the maximum level of health I should be? There's tons of health books out

1205
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:43,280
there, right? Tons of health. Like I'm not writing a health book, but I'm like, how can I optimize

1206
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:47,840
this? Right? How these two interplay the time and health, how much time do I really want to spend on

1207
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,720
the palaton? How much time do I really want to like regimented eating all the time and being a

1208
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:57,200
pain in the ass? You know, how, or, and how much time, how many chocolate chip cookies don't want

1209
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:02,000
to eat before I die. Right. And just suffer. Like, you know, I have to think about that. Like,

1210
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:09,040
if dying one year early means, uh, you know, living one more year, but I don't get any chocolate chip

1211
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,320
cookies, I'll take the chocolate chip cookies. I want a fulfilling life. Like thinking deeply about

1212
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:18,160
these things, you know, that's kind of a cartoon version of it, but you know, and I hear other

1213
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:23,600
people think about like, I wrote the basic macro formula, but there's like, you know, it's very

1214
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:27,520
fulfilling to see other people. Like they've set up spreadsheets. Like this is how you doubt. This

1215
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,680
is the optimal way would die with zero. They've done it better than me. Right. These, these

1216
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:35,920
financial planners and they built these spreadsheets and your returns and these are the things you

1217
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:41,280
like to do, et cetera. It's, you know, I'm like, this is great. You know, so they've taken the

1218
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,040
ball and run with it and I've taken the ball a little bit and run with it a little bit myself.

1219
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:53,680
And the way I'm applying it mainly is, um, more socially, more, more of these things like,

1220
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:00,000
you know, at my wedding, I said to somebody, I said, probably no one in this room will see

1221
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,440
each other more than 50 times. And most of us will probably only see us 20 times in the

1222
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:10,880
times of our lives. Right. You know, how many people were, this is the recent wedding. 117.

1223
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:20,000
117. 117. Um, and so, you know, that's, that's, you know, kind of hit people. They're like,

1224
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,920
yeah, you're kind of right. Like I put the over under at the max at like 50 for any,

1225
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:29,680
any pair that's not, you know, married and, and, and, and probably 20. And so then that,

1226
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:33,840
that made me think like, I don't, that made me think I don't want 20. I'm gonna throw parties.

1227
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,480
Like my whole, I've taken throwing parties and social things very seriously because

1228
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:45,440
I thought about what fulfills me. So the last party I had, which you were invited,

1229
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,760
but you didn't come. I was throwing a party that night.

1230
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:56,000
You were throwing a party that night at F1. Um, I went all out. I'm like, this is, this is, this is,

1231
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,720
this is what, this is what I'm going to work for to have these types of experiences. Like there's

1232
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:05,760
other things, right? But this is in the category, in the top of the category, socializing, seeing my

1233
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:11,120
friends, happy, having a good time, et cetera. Travel is a big one. Charity is another big one.

1234
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:14,800
You know, my kids' money is their money. It's not my money. It's in a trust. It's already

1235
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:20,400
taken care of. They'll get their money turned over when somewhere between 25, 26 and 33.

1236
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:26,640
Right? Because that's the optimal time for them, right? When they're mentally mature

1237
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:30,080
and at physical maturity, pat, you know, not in decline.

1238
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:38,880
And how much will you talk with them about, you know, what you think or don't think they

1239
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,080
should do with that money? Is that one of those things where you feel it is your responsibility

1240
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,200
to say absolutely nothing and let them figure it out on their own?

1241
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:49,280
No, no. I feel like you, I want to give them a roadmap, you know, I want to teach them that

1242
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,960
it's a tool, right? A lot of people, one of the biggest mistakes they, they make is,

1243
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,600
is assigning some sort of good or bad to money or what it is, et cetera. It's, it's not money

1244
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:02,640
that's good or bad in the Bible. It's the love of money that is good or bad. Right? And, you know,

1245
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:07,200
I, I use this analogy. I used to say like money is a tool that much like a hammer and saw

1246
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,960
and nails and rail guns, right? Do hammers and saws build houses? No. You need to know how to

1247
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:19,600
use those tools. People build those houses, right? So do, does, does, uh, money make you happy? No.

1248
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:25,040
But if you know how to use the tool of money, it can make you happy, right? Or it can make you

1249
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,040
miserable. So some people who give hammers and saws, they build a house and build canoes. This

1250
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:32,160
was wonderful things. You're like, how the hell did you build this? Right? Some people give ham and

1251
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:37,680
saws and they're just sitting there to cut their arm off. Right? And so what I'm trying to do is

1252
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:45,680
not tell my kids what they should do, but teach them how to use the tools. Now, once they know

1253
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,520
how to use the tools, if they decide to build houses or canoes or cut their arms off, that's up

1254
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:55,040
to them. Right? But I want to make sure that I gave them the instruction manual and, and got them a

1255
01:54:55,040 --> 01:55:00,240
little bit proficient on how to use the tools. And that's it. Then, then, then my job is done. Right?

1256
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:06,720
Like I have so many friends that try and control people from the grave that use the money as a

1257
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:13,600
control mechanism. And, you know, I'm very big on like, that's my dream. My dreams are my dreams.

1258
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:17,760
You're my dad always tried to get me to be an attorney. Get the hell out of here. I'm never

1259
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:23,680
doing that. Right? But, but, you know, you try and push your dreams onto your kids and, you know,

1260
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:27,520
I want you to be a doctor. I want you to be this. I want you to be that, whatever. And that's not

1261
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,680
necessarily what they want to do. They have their own life and it's their adventure. And what I want

1262
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:37,280
to do is set them up to, with the tools to choose their own adventure. Now, I might not agree with

1263
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,840
that adventure. I probably won't because I come from a different era and a different culture and

1264
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:48,480
all kinds of things. Right. But I will be rest assured and happy that if they're fulfilled, great.

1265
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:56,080
Well, Bill, I want to thank you very much for writing this book because as I said at the outset,

1266
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:04,880
it really is one of a handful of books that has caused me to rethink a lot of what I've been doing,

1267
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:10,720
how I've been thinking about the problem of optimizing these variables. And I'm,

1268
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:15,760
I'm really confident that people are going to pick this book up and, and, and find similar value,

1269
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:20,240
at least in magnitude. They might find different things that speak to them more or less than me,

1270
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:25,200
but I believe that from a, from a, from a valence and magnitude perspective, people will across the

1271
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:29,040
board find this valuable. So thanks so much for writing it and also for coming today. Thanks.

1272
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,160
That's great feedback. I mean, you don't, you don't write books to get rich, right? You write

1273
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:37,920
books to get your point across. And for me, you know, I see it as saving lives, right? And a lot

1274
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,440
of people like, you know, I've said this before, they're like, what do you mean saving lives,

1275
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,200
Perkins? You're fucking crazy. Like, what do you mean saving lives? You're not saving lives. And

1276
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:50,080
I'm like, well, listen, when, when, when somebody's drowning in the river, right? Or Lake, Lake Austin,

1277
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:55,200
you pull them out and you mouth the mouth and you save their lives, guess what? They're still

1278
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:00,880
going to fucking die. Just not that day. Right? So what did you do when you saved their life by

1279
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:07,520
pulling them out of the river? You've given them more choices, more experience, more life. Right?

1280
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:13,040
So when you read my book and you get off autopilot and you get more choices, more experience,

1281
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:18,480
more life, isn't it the same? At least in my mind it is. And that's the way, that's what motivates

1282
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,520
me. And so when you say it had an impact in you and you're going to, you know, have a more fulfilling

1283
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,720
life, I, I'm, it's like, I fucking did it. You know what I mean? I feel very happy. So I appreciate it.

1284
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:35,200
I, I, I think the, the example you gave there is a great one. And I would agree with you completely

1285
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:41,280
because I too fall in the camp, despite my profession, of believing we are all absolutely

1286
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:48,480
going to die and in relatively short order. And therefore, anything that changes our experiential

1287
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:55,360
existence for the better is part of living. Yeah. So thank you. Thanks for having me. It's been great.

1288
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:05,440
Bye.
