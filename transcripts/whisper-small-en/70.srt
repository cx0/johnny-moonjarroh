00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,080
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,440
including other things that we plan to build upon. These are useful beyond just the podcast,

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,840
especially given the technical nature of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,480
listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,400
directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly,

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,040
and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,760
on the products that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead,

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,080
what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,280
already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself,

42
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,320
and two, the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,040
for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,720
value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly

45
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,680
subscription. My guest this week is Professor David Sinclair. Now that name may sound familiar

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,560
to some of you because I've already interviewed David. In fact, his first interview appeared

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,200
podcast back in November, I believe, of 2018. I wanted to bring David back on the podcast for

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,880
several reasons. First of all, he's always interesting to speak with, and we spend a lot

49
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,920
of time speaking off podcasts, and I want to be able to share those discussions with people.

50
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Second, he has a new book that is coming out. In fact, we have time, the release of this podcast,

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,400
to coincide with the release of that book, which is tomorrow, September 10th. And third, we wanted

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,120
to revisit some of the ideas around NAD, NR, naked hinomide riboside, that is, and longevity.

53
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,800
These are still to this day among some of the questions I get asked most about. And even though

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,240
truthfully, I don't believe this is even at the top three level most interesting questions in

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,560
longevity, for whatever reason, people want to know all about it, and therefore, I wanted to provide

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,880
a little bit more insight into that. So as a bit of a refresher, David's a professor in the Department

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,880
of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. He's the co-director for the Biological Mechanism of Aging

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,080
Program, or it's a center, actually. He's best known for his work in understanding why we age,

59
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,520
how to slow its effects. We talk in the very first podcast about his role in the discovery of

60
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,200
sirtuins and the treatment thereof. Let's see, I think, you know, you can go back and listen to his

61
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,760
bio from that. Let's talk about what we talked about here. We talk about this idea of the information

62
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,440
theory of aging, and this is really a big part of what David's book is all about. And I knew that

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,440
David was going to be interviewed by a lot of people for the book. So I felt that it was probably

64
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,960
going to be most helpful to listeners if I interviewed him on some of the more technical

65
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,280
details of that book, which deals with, again, this information theory of aging. Basically,

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,760
what is the clock that determines our aging? What does it look like? And perhaps most importantly,

67
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,840
can it be manipulated? There are lots of other topics that are covered in his book, such as the

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,120
ethics of delaying death to significant degrees. You know, what would it mean to humanity if we

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,800
could live for, you know, hundreds of years? Those are very important questions. I don't touch on any

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,760
of them in this interview, and I suspect you'll hear a lot about that in some of the other

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,160
interviews. So if this topic is of interest to you, one, I recommend you buy the book. I really

72
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,640
enjoyed it, and I learned a lot. And that's saying something because I don't really learn a lot

73
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,600
reading books about aging, unfortunately, anymore. The books are written at such a low level, but

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,080
that's not the case here. This is really good. Secondly, I think the discussion we have around

75
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,080
NAD, NR features some really up-to-date stuff, including a couple of papers that were published

76
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,880
in the weeks leading up to our talk. And so again, I don't think this is the final word on

77
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,960
the subject, but I do think that you'll come away from this with an even more nuanced appreciation

78
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,120
for the potential benefits, if there are any, of supplemental agents that pose a promise of

79
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,280
increasing NAD. So without further delay, please enjoy my second conversation with David Sinclair.

80
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,640
Hey David, thanks for swinging by. Thanks for having me back.

81
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,720
Congratulations, first of all, on the almost released book.

82
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Well, thank you. That's an interesting time. Just waiting for the thing to drop September 10th.

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,640
Yeah. Yeah. Well, by the time people hear this, it will be dropping. So I kind of want to just

84
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,360
start with the book because I think I said this to you last time when we were together, maybe a

85
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,800
couple of months ago, but once you start recording a podcast, you end up listening to podcasts a little

86
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,960
bit differently because now you're sort of thinking about it through the lens of the interviewer

87
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,400
as well. And similarly, once I think you're trying to write a book, all of a sudden you have much more

88
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,960
interest in other people writing books, not just for the content, but the actual process and things

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,520
like that. So I remember we connected on this about a year ago and I won't lie. I'm kind of

90
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,600
secretly jealous and envious that you're done. Yeah. Well, the scary thing is, as soon as you're

91
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,640
done, your agent says, what's your next book? Oh, well, that's not even what I was thinking.

92
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,720
I was thinking the bigger issue is the moment you're done, you think, oh wait, there's just one

93
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,440
more thing I want to say. There is that at some point the editor said, no more changes, David,

94
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,720
you're done, but it's a heck of a lot of work. Anybody who's written a book,

95
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,200
real respect for those people and you're in the throes of yours right now, right?

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Yeah. So you had sent me your proposal like a year ago, maybe longer actually,

97
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,960
definitely longer than a year ago. And it's probably a great example of how proposals and

98
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,960
books often differ quite a bit. Generally the book, I think ends up being so much better,

99
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,280
so much richer because there were things in the book that weren't necessarily in the proposal that

100
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,040
kind of caught me off guard, especially the first part of the book, which is kind of what I want to

101
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,720
talk about today. I think the second part of the book where you talk about the societal implications

102
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,840
for a longer lived population are interesting, but I'm going to let somebody else talk about

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,800
that with you. I want to talk about sort of the biology of this, but this idea of, I mean,

104
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,640
you introduce a very important mathematician who wrote a paper that I remember seeing in my

105
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,920
engineering studies paper from the 1940s. So let's just start with that. Why is Shannon relevant to

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,280
the story of aging? Because I certainly didn't learn anything about him as an anti-aging researcher

107
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,920
25 years ago. Well, Shannon's one of the most respected guys in math. What he did in the

108
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,080
1940s was essentially figured out how to mathematically encode information and make

109
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,320
sure that information gets to the receiver. It's called the information theory of communication.

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,840
What it led to is what the world we have around us, the internet, TCP, IP protocols, what that has

111
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,520
to do with aging. I wrote down in the book, it began really when I was just a postdoc in Lenny

112
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,800
Gorenti's lab at MIT. Interesting Claude Chanam was at MIT too. We discovered to our surprise that

113
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,880
what was controlling aging and yeast in part were these sirtuin genes. Now, sirtuin's in science,

114
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,280
in aging, are pretty famous. But what a lot of people don't know is that the word sirtuin stands

115
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,920
for a gene called sirtu, which in yeast we found responds to dietary restriction, heat, starvation,

116
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,520
and it allows yeast to live about 30% longer if you up-regulate it or put just another copy of

117
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,040
that gene in the yeast cells. And mate Kabilan, who's now a famous professor, he was a graduate

118
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,120
student who did that experiment to put extra sirtu gene into yeast and they lived longer.

119
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,840
So that was a massive breakthrough, but what SIR stands for is really telling.

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,440
It's actually been forgotten over the last 25 years, but SIR is an acronym for silent information

121
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,760
regulator. Silent information regulator. What does that mean? This is a gene that controls other

122
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,320
genes. It switches them on and off. Its main job is to keep genes silent and that allows cells to

123
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,320
be dividing, be healthy, but what they do that is not appreciated is when the cells are stressed,

124
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,160
too much temperature, a broken chromosome, the protein that this gene makes, this SIR gene,

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,120
it leaves the silent regions and it goes to repair the problem or fix the problem.

126
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,880
So in the case of DNA breaks, what we did was we broke the chromosome of the yeast.

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,600
The SIR enzyme protein leaves where it should be, goes to repair the DNA, and when it's all fixed,

128
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
it comes back again to shut those silent genes down. And you might say that's a weird thing to

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,680
do as an organism. Well, this is a highly conserved process. It's found in yeast cells.

130
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,600
Just make sure the listener know what you're saying. You have a gene that's being silenced

131
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,880
that then gets broken. The thing that is silencing it leaves it silencing post to go and repair that

132
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,480
which is broken only to come back and silence it. So from an expression standpoint, the world outside

133
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,880
hasn't changed. That's right. And the reason that I think it's set up that way is that these genes

134
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,800
that get turned on by the absence of the SIR protein help with the problem. They turn on DNA

135
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,000
repair. They hunker down. These are survival program that's in every cell on the planet, I believe.

136
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,320
And the SIR enzyme that we're talking about is a master regulator of that survival circuit.

137
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,680
So why does that have anything to do with information theory? Well, what I think is going

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,880
on is that this program that's set down in our cells and when a yeast cell is young,

139
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,680
or which gene should stay on and which genes should be off, gets messed up. It gets lost in

140
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,600
the noise. And what's the noise? It's this constant having to go and repair DNA or respond to too much

141
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,040
heat or some other imminent threat. Yeah. Doing it once doesn't matter. One cut to a chromosome,

142
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,720
a broken chromosome is not going to kill a yeast cell if it's repaired. But what it does over time

143
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,240
is that cells lose their which gene should be on and off. The genes that should be kept off in the

144
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,440
yeast cell come on. One way to think about this, a very simple analogy is Hurricane Katrina.

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay. So the SIR protein are the first responders. They rush down to fix the problem. They do their

146
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,320
job. But what happens is most of them come back home, mow the lawn, pay the bills, and everything's

147
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,480
good. But some of them get stuck down there. They marry someone or maybe they get lost on the way

148
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,560
home. They can't afford a ticket home on the airplane. And you do that a hundred times,

149
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,840
or in our case, in our lives, every cell is getting a broken chromosome every day.

150
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,440
So you're doing this. How many days do we live? 30,000 days. This is a problem. I think over time,

151
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,400
you actually end up losing that program and our cells lose their identity. And the hallmark of

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,400
aging in yeast is the loss of cellular identity. They become sterile. They don't make dysfunctional.

153
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,000
So Claude Shannon figured out how to preserve information. You keep a repository of the original

154
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,000
data, a hard disk drive backup. And he said, if the receiver of that information, which in his

155
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,560
idea was the radio receiver of the signal in World War II and after, in our world, it might be our

156
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,080
email. In aging, it's ourselves in the future. And we lose that program about keeping ourselves

157
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,840
young, cells and cells. And what Shannon said is that there may be a repository of that information.

158
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,440
If our cells are right, if they're doing a good job, there should be a way to reset the system

159
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,280
to get that complete email back again. And I think there is one. We have some early evidence

160
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,920
from mice that we can actually find that hard disk drive and reinstall the software so that it's

161
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,640
pristine again. And we find that we can actually improve the health quite dramatically of parts of

162
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,480
our mouse's body. Now, to really get into this the way you do in the book, I think we have to take a

163
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,760
few steps back and assume for a moment that a listener doesn't know much about DNA beyond

164
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,440
sort of the high level stuff, but maybe doesn't understand what an epigenetic modification is,

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,800
what things like methylation mean and how that occurs. So let's go back and go through a little

166
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,200
bit of that stuff, because I think to get a firm understanding of this will enable the other things

167
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,960
you're going to talk about to make more sense. So we could use a mouse, we could use a person. It

168
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,760
doesn't really matter for the purpose of this discussion, but let's use a person because I

169
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,440
think it resonates with a listener more. So you and I have lots of DNA. We've got somewhere between

170
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,800
20 and 30,000 genes. These genes are made up of lots of this coding stuff, and there's coding and

171
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,080
non-coding segments of these DNA, but basically it's a whole bunch of strung together nucleotides.

172
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,120
Now, some of them are not working at that point in time, right? They're sitting there, but they're

173
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,680
not actually getting turned into RNA to be turned into proteins, correct? Yeah, absolutely. We don't

174
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,880
want to turn all our genes on because then we wouldn't have any different cell types.

175
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,560
We'd all just be a giant blob of cells, a giant tumor probably. So when you take a piece of my

176
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,160
skin and you take a piece of my liver or you take a piece of my eye, nerve in the back of my eye,

177
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,080
they all have the same DNA, right? Yeah, except for your sperm or your egg and some immune cells.

178
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,720
I don't have any eggs, by the way, just for the record. Yeah. Okay. I can believe that.

179
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,280
But your point is some of them are getting turned on. So the DNA that are sitting in the epithelial

180
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,200
cells of my skin are being instructed to express proteins in a certain way, and that's what ends up

181
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,320
producing skin versus the nerve in the back of my eye versus my liver, et cetera. And what's

182
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,200
interesting is the skin and the nerve at one point were the same cell types when you were an embryo,

183
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,720
but the pattern, we say pattern of gene expression, the way the cells turn on different genes

184
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,680
allow nerves to become nerves and hopefully stay nerves for most of your life. But I think towards

185
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,680
the end of your life, that's the problem. It's losing your identity and reverting back to

186
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,840
something that was more primordial, more like a skin cell. And the way the cells do that is

187
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,240
really interesting so that your DNA, if you stretch it out of a cell about six meters long,

188
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,760
and there are little proteins that wrap that length of DNA up inside a microscopic cell.

189
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,080
And it's essentially like spooling a hose in your garden and then you spool those spools on top of

190
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,080
each other. So it's a way of packaging something very long, but very, very thin and tiny. But if

191
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,400
it's packed up in a spool, it won't be read by the cell. And that's what these seroproteins do. The

192
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,000
seroproteins actually maintain that structure of that spool. But if a cell needs to read the gene,

193
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,320
they remove the seroproteins and now that bundle can open up and the gene can be read. And there

194
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,800
are different layers of the epigenome. There's the superficial layer where the seroproteins are,

195
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,600
and there are other proteins going around turning genes on and off. But there's a really deep layer.

196
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
The deepest layer is what's called DNA methylation. And cells can permanently, for decades,

197
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,600
mark a gene to be silent by putting these chemical groups called methyls next to or in a gene. And

198
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,880
that tells the cell spool it up as tight as you can and never, unless I tell you to, reveal it again.

199
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,440
And that's the reason our brain doesn't turn into a liver one morning when we wake up.

200
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,080
Now let's define methylation only because it's such a buzz term right now. I think everybody

201
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,440
and their brother is reading about, oh my God, am I a bad methylator? Am I a good methylator? Do I

202
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,480
have an MTHFR mutation? But let's sort of demystify all this stuff. A methyl group is a carbon group

203
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,920
with three hydrogens on it. So we're talking a very basic molecule in the broader architecture

204
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,880
of organic chemistry. And you're saying that when you put one of those methyl groups, when you attach

205
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,040
one of the carbons on that methyl to literally a carbon on one of the ends of DNA, you have the

206
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,800
ability to program it to not carry out the function of expressing itself. Is that a safe way to say

207
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,200
that? It is. This is the underlying code that tells the cell what type it is. And there's a

208
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,000
guy called Conrad Worrington from the 1950s who didn't know that there were these methyl groups.

209
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,760
So what he imagined was the embryo of the fertilized cell is at the top of a hill and

210
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,520
it rolls down the hill. And if it lands in one valley, it's a nerve cell and it stays in the valley.

211
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,480
But if it rolled into another valley, it's a skin cell and stays a skin cell. And that's a great

212
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,040
metaphor for how an embryo and then eventually a baby is formed out of 27 billion cells that a baby

213
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,440
is made of. Worrington didn't think about as much, if at all, was what happens after that baby's

214
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,640
born? What happens 80 years later to his Worrington landscape? What happens to those valleys

215
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,040
and those hills? And what I think is happening is that we're having not just erosion of those hills

216
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,520
so that the cells don't stay where they should, but they're getting jostled by these DNA breaks

217
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,520
and this reorganization of the SIR proteins and others so that cells start to migrate up over the

218
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,080
valley into other new valleys. And now your neurons in your brain, your nerve cells, are starting to

219
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,560
behave a little bit like skin cells or liver cells. And I think that's what's underlying many,

220
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,360
if not all, of the aspects of aging that we eventually will succumb to. And what role does

221
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,240
entropy play in this? Because when you think about these hills and valleys, there's a place where

222
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,720
things want to settle out. There should be a place where things settle and stay put. But the figure

223
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,800
you have in one of your talks, which shows this projection right into the future, it starts to get

224
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,560
blurry at the end. In other words, it starts to look like there's more chaos in the system. Is

225
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,560
that just the natural drive of entropy within our systems? Is that the way it's expressed, I guess,

226
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,800
is what I'm asking? Right. So mathematically, it appears very much like a loss of information and

227
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:32,120
introduction of noise, because these methyl groups that are laid down in a pristine, precise fashion

228
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,840
when we're young, there are other methyls that accumulate over time in different places,

229
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,800
what appears to be randomly. So it's a loss of the original pattern. And that's why we talk about

230
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,280
entropy. Now, anyone who's familiar with the second law of thermodynamics says, okay, we're screwed.

231
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,680
We're never going to be young again, because you've lost information similar to falling into

232
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,560
a black hole, you're never coming out. Or even let's think of more obvious examples. Like you

233
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:04,200
can't unfry an egg. Once proteins become denatured, once the clear part of the egg becomes white, you

234
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,720
don't get to make it clear again. Yeah. Or even worse, if your genome is a compact disc or DVD,

235
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,200
you scratch that up and you can't read it again. Or even worse, you break a piece off, that

236
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,040
information is lost. You throw it in the trash. But what I think exists in cells and you have some

237
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,560
evidence is that, like Shannon suggested for the internet or information, is that if you have a

238
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,520
backup copy and now going back to the genome, there seems to be something in cells that tells

239
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,120
them these methyl groups, the program that was laid down when you were a baby is still there.

240
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,600
And cells can access that somehow, to say all these other things that have happened since you

241
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,720
were born or since you were a teenager. That's just noise. That's crap. Ignore that. In fact,

242
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,920
when I tell you, and in my lab, we can reprogram cells to go young again, to read the right

243
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,960
pattern, there's a process that we're just beginning to understand that says this stuff is noise.

244
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,080
Get rid of that. Ignore that. Get rid of it. But these other methyl signals, these little

245
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,560
flags on the genome that have been there since we were babies, that's the good stuff. Keep that.

246
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,640
And in that way, these spools of the hose, the DNA loops that have become untangled and messed up as

247
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,560
we've got an older reset back to being young again. So let me make sure I understand that. If you could

248
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,640
take the version of David Sinclair that was born and you could look at every single piece of

249
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,040
methylation across every single strand of DNA on every single gene in every single chromosome,

250
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,160
and you had a picture of that and you knew what that always looked like. Fast forward 50 years.

251
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,800
Some of those methyl groups are gone. You've lost methylation in some places. And presumably in

252
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,720
many more places, there are now methyl groups added that were not present. So you've had both

253
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,080
an addition and subtraction of methyl groups. And that now looks like a different picture.

254
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,560
Are you suggesting that at least to the first order, if you restored the methylation status

255
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,680
to what it looked like when you were born, you'd have a younger phenotype? That's exactly what I'm

256
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
saying. That wasn't like a canned question. I wasn't even asking that rhetorically because

257
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,760
on one level that seems really complicated, but on one level it actually seems kind of simple.

258
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,040
You know what I mean? That's sort of what's weird about it. What's amazing about it is that we

259
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,600
don't even understand how it fully works yet. We just know that there is this backup copy that we

260
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,320
can access. At least we have early evidence of it. So we have this manuscript that says that if we

261
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,520
turn on a few key genes in the body of a mouse or in a cell, it will quite literally not just act

262
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,880
younger and turn on young patterns of genes. When you measure its age by counting these methyl groups

263
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,840
where they are, it is young again. And so this backup copy exists. But what warps my mind,

264
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,520
it blows my mind, is that there is something in the cell that we've had all along in our lives

265
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,840
that allows the cell to reset. Can I ask a question? Tell me if this is the right time to answer this

266
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,040
question. A lot of what you're saying sounds like, hey, isn't that quote unquote a stem cell? It's

267
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,440
very much like that because what we've done in the field is we've taken the knowledge from

268
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,760
the reprogramming field, which is using what are called yamanaka genes. And they're used in the

269
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,040
field right now by scientists, by companies to take an adult cell. I could take your skin cell,

270
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,000
for example, grow it in my lab, and I could make a stem cell out of that. How does that work? It

271
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,760
strips pretty much all of the methyl groups off the DNA. And that's a reset, not back to being

272
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,600
young, but by being primordial, by being pre embryonic. In other words, methylation, by

273
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,160
definition implies an aging in some level of a cell. So technically, your most primordial cell

274
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,280
had no methyl groups on its DNA. Right, right. Very few. And as we get older, and it's not so what

275
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,520
we've discovered as a field is what, again, a few years ago, I wouldn't have believed it, but it is

276
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,640
true, is that this clock starts aging from conception. So even as we're growing in the womb,

277
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,840
our DNA is accumulating these chemical changes, these methyls, and that extends throughout life

278
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:12,680
forever. And if you gave me a sample of an embryo, or a baby, or a teenage girl, or an 80 year old,

279
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,920
I and some other labs in the world can read that DNA. And by the pattern, I could tell you exactly

280
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,520
the age of that cell or that tissue. It's almost like you're describing carbon dating of a cell,

281
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,280
for lack of a better word. No, that's perfect. That's the best way I've heard it described yet.

282
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,680
And I didn't realize that the fidelity was as great as you've just described it. I understood

283
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,000
that you could look at methylation and tell the difference between a baby and a 50 year old. But

284
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,640
if I heard you correctly, you're saying that if you took a fetus at one month of development versus

285
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,240
a newborn, a full eight months later, you would actually be able to distinguish those on the basis

286
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,560
of methylation. I mean, obviously phenotype and many things would give that away. We would. And

287
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,480
in fact, the pace of change is very rapid in embryo. What is the fidelity of this when you look at one,

288
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,600
two, three, four, five year olds? Is it literally that precise that it can measure the age of DNA to

289
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,000
within a year? Oh, I don't know what the latest statistics are for a human blood sample.

290
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,640
It was 95% accurate for chronological age. But what we've realized is that the clock actually

291
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,400
changes depending on how you live your life. Well, I was just about to say, this is not that

292
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,800
interesting. If there's nothing you can do about it, it's just one more reminder of your birth

293
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,000
certificate. It's only relevant if either things speed it up, which we'd like to know what those

294
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,720
things are to avoid them or things can slow it down or even as you said, reverse it. Although

295
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,480
that seems too good to be true, right? Well, it's even more important than your birth certificate.

296
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,040
Your birth certificate just tells you when you're born. This clock tells you how fast you're aging.

297
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,000
And a few labs, Steve Horvath is one of the inventors of the clock. We actually call it the

298
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Horvath clock. He is able to estimate not just how old you are, but predict when you're going

299
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,480
to die with high accuracy. And that's really scary that we are predestined based on our

300
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,920
lifestyle up to that point, how long we're going to live. And there are some things that slow it

301
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,800
down. Exercise is one good thing. Calorie restriction, smoking does the opposite.

302
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,080
So right now at this moment, having not eaten in a couple of days, I am slowing my clock.

303
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,280
You are. So there are probably mechanisms. Actually, we know of mechanisms that are turning on

304
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,880
Sirtuins. So your NAD levels go up when you're fasting and Sirtuins do a better job of both

305
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,560
repairing the DNA and keeping these. Right. They have more substrate now to do their job.

306
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,120
Right. And just like in yeast, our cells need to do both at the same time, repair DNA and keep the

307
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,600
genes silent. That should be silent. But if we're lazy and we eat a lot of food and we don't exercise,

308
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,520
those programs that are designed to keep the clock from accelerating, don't aren't as active.

309
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,320
So that's what we think is going on. And that's why if you have smoked a lot of your life or you

310
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,040
don't exercise, your clock will on average and for most people that are tested will be older than

311
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,240
your actual age. And so the only thing that you can do is either slow that down. Right now we don't

312
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,040
know how to reverse it in humans. But in mice, we're getting glimpses of how to actually literally

313
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:10,360
make a cell half its age that it once was. And how does this clock work in its prediction

314
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,960
relative to other things that get a lot of attention, such as the length of the telomeres

315
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,120
of a cell and maybe define for the listener what telomeres are since some people might not be

316
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,640
familiar. Our chromosomes, all 46 of them are linear DNA molecules. So they have ends, two ends,

317
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,320
each chromosome. And those ends need to be protected. And those ends are called telomeres.

318
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,320
And good analogy. It's like the hard piece of a shoestring. Exactly. That's what an agloid is.

319
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,480
But as we get older, they get chewed back and eventually they become so afraid that the cell

320
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,640
recognizes the end of a chromosome as though it would be a broken piece of DNA. And they shut

321
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,040
the cell down, trying to repair it and try to stick it together with another piece. And you

322
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,400
end up with a whole bunch of genetic chaos. One thing that cells do to prevent from becoming a

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,040
tumor is they shut themselves down and they become senescent. And that's a whole other problem for

324
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,960
the body once you've got a zombie cell that's not dividing and is in panic mode. But telomeres do

325
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,920
erode as we get older. So they've served as a pretty good clock. But what happens is that cells

326
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,640
can divide faster in different tissues. Some tissues don't even divide. So it's not like a

327
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,520
universal clock, like the one that I just described that Horvath and others discovered.

328
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,320
There was a paper that came out maybe six months ago in Science after, remember that you had the

329
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,240
twin astronauts, one astronaut was at the space station for a year. The other, his twin brother,

330
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,560
was on earth for the same period of time, of course. And the paper was interesting in that,

331
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,920
and there were two actually, I'm trying to remember, there was one of the two papers I read. So it's

332
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,840
possible I'm going to misrepresent this because I don't have all of the data. But what I read

333
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,480
remember struck me as interesting enough that I was surprised nobody else was talking about it,

334
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,720
or if they were, I was somehow missing it, was they made a big deal about the fact that a lot

335
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,000
of changes occurred in space. And certainly some of these were very obvious and predictable. You

336
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,920
could imagine bone density going down, muscle mass, things like that. But they talked about how

337
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,840
there was this dramatic difference in the length of the telomeres of these two twins who presumably

338
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,880
would have, I assume they had measured pre and post, so it wasn't. But what was really interesting

339
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,480
was within something like two to three days of being back on earth, the twin that was in space

340
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,600
had a complete reversion to what his brother was when he was back on earth. And maybe I'm just

341
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,680
skeptical, but that made me a little less interested in telomeres as a particularly

342
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:34,280
relevant metric of the age of an individual. Would you interpret that differently?

343
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,840
No, I agree with that. That something that can change within days is less interesting as a clock,

344
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,800
compared to something that seems to be immutable and ticking every day of your life. That's the

345
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,840
Holy Grail, and it looks like we may have found something like that in the field.

346
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,440
And Horowitz is a pretty young guy.

347
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,840
Yeah, he's younger than me, so he's in his 40s, I think.

348
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,120
And he's a mathematician?

349
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,520
He is.

350
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,240
At UCLA?

351
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,560
He needed to be a mathematician because to find the clock, you can't just read all the

352
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,400
methyl groups. You actually need to train a computer that uses machine learning to find out

353
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,480
which are the ones that change with age and those others that just randomly change.

354
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,920
I know I've read a tiny bit about this enough to be dangerous, right? So

355
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,240
Horwath used the data from like Illumina or something like that. There was publicly

356
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,440
available data. He had maybe 8,000 samples to study, and presumably enough of it was longitudinal.

357
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,360
In other words, he must have had some samples of the same people. That would give you one piece

358
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,600
of data. But I guess if he knew the age of the persons, you could train a machine, as you're

359
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,400
saying, I guess, to see how much methylation has occurred. I guess, I apologize if this question

360
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,680
goes beyond your level of expertise on this subject. It sounds like he's someone I should

361
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,920
interview as well. Is he able to or are you able to in your lab look at methyl groups and know

362
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,600
if they've been there for a long period of time, if they're new, if they are additions,

363
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,600
or if they basically they were largely inherited? I mean, do you have that capacity?

364
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,160
We do. That works because we know from building the clock that at age, five years of age, this is

365
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,120
the pattern that was likely there for an average human. And this is the pattern of an 80 year old

366
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,280
and all in between. But that would be true at a macro level. But I'm saying at the level of a

367
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,720
given gene, are you actually able to infer that? Yes. So Horvath's clock is built. There were a

368
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,000
number of clocks. His latest one is built on a few hundred sites on the genome. They're very specific.

369
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,640
And for reasons that he doesn't understand, and I think we are beginning to understand,

370
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,960
those are the ones that are sensitive to age and that tick along. And some tick differently in

371
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,760
different tissues. But he recently published a universal clock. And another group at Harvard

372
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,280
published a universal clock for mice, which means it doesn't matter if I give you a blood sample or

373
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,200
a skin sample or a brain sample, by looking at that precise location on the genome next to gene X,

374
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,320
and you look at 300 of them or so, then you can actually say exactly what age that mouse is

375
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,840
independent of what part of that mouse you're given. That's kind of amazing when you consider

376
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,120
the fact that if you didn't know that a priori, you had to start with all of the genes

377
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,680
and look at all of the potential sites of methylation. I agree. But just be an unbelievable

378
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,160
problem. When Horvath and Adams, the other guy that did this, when those papers came out,

379
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,760
it was really hard to believe because for the last 50 years, we've been dreaming of a clock,

380
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,640
but evolutionary biologists said, nope, it's just organisms wasting away like a car breaks down,

381
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,240
lack of selection for longevity. There's no way there's going to be a clock because aging is not

382
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,600
considered a genetic program. And it isn't. There isn't a program that tells us we must age. No one

383
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,240
I know in their right mind believes that. But there are processes, like I was describing about

384
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,600
the movement of these proteins in yeast and movement in mammals like us, that leads to a

385
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,760
predictable change on our genome that changes the way genes are switched on and off as we age

386
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,440
in very precise locations. But what truly blows my mind is that the cell somehow knows

387
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,880
which are the young ones and which are the old ones. And when we tell it to, it can reset the

388
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,120
cell back to what it was. But you don't want to go too far. Your point about stem cells is well

389
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,760
taken. If you push it too far, and some labs have done that, Juan Carlos Belmonte at the

390
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,200
Salk Institute showed, you turn on this reprogramming, you can actually cause tumors in a mouse,

391
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,000
or actually turn them on really fast, and they'll die within two days. You can push those bowls up

392
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,760
that landscape from the valleys far too quickly. And the cells don't just regain their identity.

393
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,080
They go all the way back to being basically an embryo. And that's that's not going to help

394
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,640
anybody if we kill people after two days. But in my lab, we do what's called partial reprogramming,

395
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,200
we push them a little bit, so that they regain their youth, but they don't lose their identity.

396
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,200
So let me think about this for a second. So when you go back to the analogy of Shannon, which is

397
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,360
you've got receiver operator trying to communicate through a signal through an electrical signal,

398
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:03,320
there's a loss of fidelity in the signal. So the receiver operator pair have to be able to compare

399
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:10,520
this transmitted signal to a master signal. When you bring that analogy down into our DNA,

400
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,320
is it the expectation that within every cell resides a master copy or not necessarily within

401
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,480
every cell? It appears to be within every cell because when we reprogram the animal,

402
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,120
and currently we're choosing to reprogram the retina and restore eyesight in all mice,

403
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,280
the cells that get the reprogramming signal from the three genes we put in,

404
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,520
those cells will survive, will regrow, will restore their function back to being young again.

405
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,680
And if a cell next door doesn't get the reprogramming signal, it doesn't regenerate. So it appears to be

406
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,000
intrinsic for each cell. We can also do that in the dish. We can grow human cells,

407
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,840
grow nerve cells, mini brain in the dish. We can reprogram those to be young again and survive

408
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,720
a stress such as chemotherapy and regrow as though they were young embryonic cells again.

409
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,880
So let's talk about what this reprogramming means. What I mean by reprogramming is that we can

410
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,480
use technology that we use now to generate stem cells, but to partially reprogram them so that

411
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,880
they turn on the youthful pattern of genes that we once had, that we know we lose. There's no question

412
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,000
as we get older, our cells don't turn on the genes that they once did. We know young and genes that

413
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
should be on when you're young get switched off. So we lose that. That's that noise, epigenetic

414
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,400
noise, I call it. Reprogramming somehow resets that pattern in terms of the hose and the spooling of

415
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,840
the DNA. What's actually going on is that genes that were once tightly bundled up by the seroproteins

416
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:45,880
and by methylated DNA are coming undone as we get older. This noise reprogramming somehow tells the

417
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,960
cell that region of the genome, package that up again, get the seroproteins to go back there,

418
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,400
get the methyl back there or remove them and get that gene to switch off again because that gene

419
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,920
has no business being on in the retina. You might need it somewhere else and somehow, somehow a

420
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,120
liver cell knows that that gene shouldn't be silenced. Maybe it should come on, but there's

421
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,720
a repository. So in Shannon parlance, he calls it the observer. His backup disk is called the

422
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,680
observer and the observer keeps a signal, keeps the original signal until it's needed. And if the

423
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,120
receiver of the signal does the checksum, you know what a checksum is? I think, oh, your listeners

424
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:31,240
will know that every time a signal is sent, we know that it is complete because all the math adds up.

425
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,160
If that doesn't add up, that's a signal that says, go back in a transmission error, right? And instead

426
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,240
of going back to the original sender, it goes to the observer who keeps a copy of the original signal

427
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,360
and gets the rest of the data. So if you're sending an, let's say a photo to Instagram,

428
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
often you're in the subway or it doesn't make it half of the picture will make it, but Instagram

429
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,920
computers will say, Hey, I only got half this picture. It didn't add up. The checksum didn't

430
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,280
make any sense. Please resend the rest of that signal. It may be stuck in Denmark. It may be stuck

431
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,720
in Iceland somewhere, but the system set up that way. And that's what I think is going on in every

432
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,640
cell in our body is that information is still there. Our DNA is largely intact. We haven't lost

433
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,920
the genes due to mutations. That was the old idea from the 1950s. That information is there. We just

434
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,120
don't access it because the cells don't know whether to spool up the DNA and hide it or to expose it to

435
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,000
turn on the right genes. And I'm still just kind of blown away by this notion that you can,

436
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,320
you shared only once a story about how the Horbath clock was accurate enough that you could even

437
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,760
predict how much a person had smoked. Yeah. This paper recently came out. They had the records of

438
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,520
packs per day that were accurate based on medical records. And then he also asked these patients,

439
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,080
how much do you think you were smoking over your lifetime? And they made up some number based on

440
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,240
what they remembered. The clock matched what the medical record said and not what the person said.

441
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,920
So I'm sure they weren't lying. No, of course not. Because they would have had to have told

442
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,040
the medical record in the first place, but presumably it's easier over time to tell,

443
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,480
like, if you ask a person every year how much they're smoking, you'll get a more accurate

444
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,320
response of the aggregate smoke versus at the end of. That's exactly right. What it tells us is that

445
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,960
this clock, there's no lying here. Your DNA doesn't lie. Your clock records probably every

446
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,560
good activity and every bad activity that you've had in your life. You talk about the ultimate

447
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,920
wearable. Could you imagine? We love our rings and our CGM's and all of these things, but imagine

448
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,040
you had a little Horbath clock, you could stick into your interstitial fluid. It's coming. If you

449
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,080
gave me your DNA, I could tell you how old you are biologically. I would love to do that. In fact,

450
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:51,080
it would be fun is let's do a longitudinal sample. We'll stress the system a little bit. So we'll

451
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:57,080
do, here's some DNA and then we'll do a fast. I'll go a week without eating or something like that.

452
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,680
Because that's a pretty extreme stress, like a week of fasting should do it. In fact,

453
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,040
we should do this with rapamycin dosing. I'm curious as to whether the pulsatile dosing of

454
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,480
rapamycin that I take, does that have an impact? In other words, you start to wonder, are there

455
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:19,320
final common pathways that so many of these higher level interventions impact? I think level

456
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,760
is the right word. The spooling of the DNA, this epigenome, there are various levels. The superficial

457
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,640
level are these transient proteins. We call them transcription factors that jump across the genes

458
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,640
and tell them to be read. Another level down are these sirtuins that we work on. They actually

459
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,760
chemically modify the spooling proteins. We call them histones. And then the deepest level, the

460
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,760
third level down, is this methylation clock, which is very hard to reverse. As far as I know,

461
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,240
the only way to really do it is using a stem cell technology, this reprogramming factors, Yamanaka.

462
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,400
In other words, your belief is, I'm going to come back to that because I actually like that level

463
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,560
system you just put forward. But the reason you're saying that is the best your evidence suggests in

464
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:05,400
the lab today, outside of using a vector to actually insert new DNA or something is you can

465
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,640
change the rate, but you can't change the direction. Is that sort of what you're seeing?

466
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,120
Yeah, that's the summary of now hundreds of papers on this topic. It's a scary thought. All

467
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,480
of these interventions, Rapamycin, NAD boosters, Metformin, all the data is not in, of course,

468
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,480
we need to do more. But the first studies have said that they have relatively little impact on

469
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,840
this very deep clock and they slow it down. That's fine. They stop the marbles or the balls from

470
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,320
jumping too far across valleys, but they don't get the balls to go back into the valleys that

471
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,280
they were once when we were young, which makes sense. You can't take Rapamycin or NAD boost

472
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,440
or Metformin and restore vision in a mouse like we are with reprogramming factors.

473
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,000
So let's talk about that. That's obviously now we're entering the future. This is,

474
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,080
so talk about that experiment.

475
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,400
Well, so what we did was we took three of the Yamanaka genes that they used to make stem cells

476
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,400
and we packaged them into what's called an AAV, adeno-associated virus. There's a virus,

477
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,280
by the way, is already used by many companies. There are a number of products on the market.

478
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,960
Some are used actually to fix eye diseases, genetic diseases. So this isn't some crazy,

479
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:21,080
super science fiction story. This is medical FDA approved drug development. We take these vectors,

480
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,320
viruses, we package these three genes in, which is not easy because they don't hold much.

481
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,400
So we whittled this down. We gave it an on-off switch, which is important because you don't want

482
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,280
to become a stem cell. You don't want your eye to develop a tumor, if it might. We did another

483
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,760
trick, which is important, which is we left off the fourth Yamanaka factor called MIC.

484
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,240
Now, MIC is a well-known oncogene gene that causes cancer. That didn't take a genius to leave that

485
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:52,760
off. But what was surprisingly rewarding to see was that the MIC gene was superfluous. We didn't

486
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,320
need it to reprogram cells to be partially young again. How did you program the on-off switch?

487
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,480
Oh, that's really interesting too. This is in the field we use a system where we can feed

488
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,800
a cell or a mouse doxycycline and it's just an antibiotic. So my daughter who had Lyme disease

489
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,840
will tell you it's not great for long-term use, but just for a week or a month, it's fine.

490
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,600
We've given it to mice for their whole life. They seem to be okay. We set it up so that what's called

491
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,560
a doxycycline-responsive gene. And so now when we have the virus in a cell...

492
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,280
So you can silence the gene with doxy. Basically, you use something inert that has a trigger.

493
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,560
Yeah, we could have used a bunch of different chemicals, but we use this one because it's...

494
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,640
You understand it well and it's pretty benign.

495
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,960
And the FDA would likely approve it because we know a lot about it. We didn't re-engineer it so

496
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,160
that it was extremely tight. So we don't want any leaky gene if we don't want it. And we also made

497
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,120
its levels very low because we don't want to blow the system out. So we made this new version of the

498
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,960
virus and delivered it.

499
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,720
And adenovirus, for folks who might not know what that term is, these are very common viruses.

500
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,560
Well, many of us have been exposed to these already.

501
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Presumably everybody has. I mean, it'd be hard to not be exposed to an adenovirus at some point,

502
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,840
but unless you live in a bubble. And there's so many different ones. Yeah. And remind me,

503
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,280
is an adenovirus a DNA virus or an RNA virus? I can't even remember.

504
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,240
Yeah, I can't remember either.

505
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,120
I used to know that. Okay. So it's a basically... And how much DNA can you pack into it?

506
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,680
I'm pretty sure it's a DNA virus. So we package DNA in there. You can pack a 5.4

507
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,800
thousand base pairs of DNA.

508
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,320
5.4. Okay. All right. And you go back to these mice and the phenotype of the mouse is what at

509
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,680
this point? It's an old mouse, middle-aged mouse?

510
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,480
Well, we've done three crazy things to a mouse to test. The first thing we did was we crushed

511
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,280
the optic nerve.

512
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,440
So you took a normal mouse and you crushed its optic nerve. So now it can't see.

513
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah. And only very, very young mice will regrow nerves. You break your spine, you're not going to

514
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,640
walk again. And so we thought maybe if we turn the age of those cells back to being extremely

515
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,400
young, they'll grow back. And there's nothing that works to grow all the way back. Healthy

516
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,280
optic nerve. So we did that. I won't reveal the punchline yet. We also... These are all

517
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,160
collaborations. I should credit my collaborators. Xi Gang He at the Children's Hospital in Boston

518
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,880
and Bruce Cassandra's lab did this experiment. I'm going to tell you about glaucoma.

519
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,520
So he puts pressure in the eye. Pressure is one of the largest drivers of glaucoma

520
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:26,280
and disrupts division. And then the third experiment was to take just regular old mice.

521
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,000
They were two years of age and reprogram those. Actually, they were 12 months of age. We didn't

522
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,160
go too far. But by 12 months of age, a mouse has lost a lot of its vision about it.

523
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,280
Interesting. Because that's only about 35 year old human, right?

524
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,800
Yeah. 40. Yeah, it's about 40 year old. But those mice, we thought even that's an old...

525
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,160
So most people can't restore vision in anything. We have now treated much older mice. And we do see

526
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:55,880
some partial effects. Okay. So let me recap that. So you've got the first group are young mice,

527
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,080
but they've had their optic nerve surgically traumatized or traumatized through compression.

528
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,760
You have a second group. I don't recall the age, but you increase intraocular pressure to mimic

529
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,680
glaucoma. And then the third group you just took relatively old mice that had a natural decline in

530
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,160
their vision. Right. And there are two ways that Bruce's lab measures vision in mice. One is you

531
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,640
expose... Well, you show it a TV screen with moving lines and the lines can be thick or thin. And

532
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,640
you've got really good vision. You can see the thin lines and you can watch the mouse turn its head.

533
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,920
And if it's blind or it can't see it, it obviously won't move its head. Now that's partially

534
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,480
subjective. It's not bad, but you want something completely objective. And you can't measure the

535
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,600
electrical signal in the occipital cortex. Okay. So we stick an electrode in the back of the eye

536
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,200
and measure the signals that come like an electrocardiogram for the retina. And that doesn't lie.

537
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,840
You want both to agree with each other, but that one we can measure before and after treatment.

538
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,600
And there we can see what the virus is doing. Now, one thing that I haven't mentioned, which

539
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,160
your listeners may be interested in is when do we turn on the virus? And because we want to treat

540
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,600
patients, we're not just doing this for fun. We turned on these Yamanaka genes in the virus after

541
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,240
the treatment, not before. Because if you've got glaucoma or you've damaged your optic nerve, or

542
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,720
you're old, you need to be able to reverse that, not just prevent the damage. And so we did that.

543
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,800
So these results that we've put out there actually show that in all three experiments,

544
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,280
you regenerate nerves. And in the case of glaucoma and old mice, they get their vision back.

545
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:36,200
So let's go through actually technically how you do this. So the adenovirus vector now contains

546
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,120
the modified stem cell, basically the genes of a modified stem cell. Is that a safe

547
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,920
way to describe it? Well, a better way would be that these are genes that specify us during

548
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,920
embryogenesis. So it tells the cells, but you took it back to, yeah, I was trying to figure out where

549
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:58,440
you, so you basically have the methylated pattern of the gene that mouse would have had during

550
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,320
development. Well, we think so. We've measured the clock in nerve cells after reprogramming,

551
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,960
and they are younger. Steve Horvath helped us with that. But what's also interesting is we can

552
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,800
look at which genes are on and off. And if we look at the young mouse and the old mouse

553
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,200
and look at which genes are on and off, we can see that we've got noise now,

554
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,400
genes that shouldn't be on coming on, such as genes that are involved in stress responses.

555
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,280
And other genes, interestingly, are coming on that shouldn't be in the eye, any young mouse.

556
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,720
And those are very interesting. Some of those are, think about 80 of them, are taste receptors,

557
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,680
meaning proteins that stick out of cells and smell. Actual taste receptors in a mouse or

558
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,160
homologs to other animals? Well, they're predicted to be taste receptors or smell receptors. They're

559
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,160
called olfactory receptors. But what they're doing in the back of the eye and why they change with

560
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,600
aging is so far a complete mystery. I could speculate that they're important for signaling

561
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,280
chemicals that have nothing to do with smell. Has this been identified, for example, in humans?

562
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:02,200
Do we know that humans also have olfactory nerves in their eyes? I don't believe so. I think we were

563
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,440
the first to figure that out. But there are sporadic accounts of it because it's so weird.

564
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,120
Very few people have paid attention to it. But anyway, the end of the story is that when we

565
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,880
reprogrammed the retina, those genes that were coming on during aging get turned off and vice

566
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,680
versa. How many genes are we talking about, David, in this particular process? Just hundreds, hundreds

567
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,840
of genes. In terms of statistical significance, depends where you want to draw the line. So

568
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,280
I think it might be a few hundred that are really significant. But the thing that blows my mind

569
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,880
about this result is that the genes that went down with aging just a little bit, when reprogrammed,

570
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,160
come up a little bit. And those genes that went way down with aging when you reprogram way up.

571
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:48,440
So it's as though the cell knows that this gene should be put back to the way it was. And I have

572
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,400
some ideas, but I have no evidence how that actually happens.

573
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,720
Sorry to interrupt, but does that correlate to how much methylation is on the gene? In other words,

574
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,600
you talked about this gene was down a little bit and it corrected to going up a little bit. This

575
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:11,080
one was down a lot and it corrected to go up a lot. Does the a little versus a lot correspond

576
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,320
closely to the extent of methylation? We don't know that yet. You're right at the cutting edge

577
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:21,640
of the work in my lab. One prediction would be that those chemical changes map to those genes

578
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,840
that we see change, but we haven't overlapped those datasets yet. But it's the next exciting

579
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,720
possibility. One thing that we do see is that if we stress a cell out, let's say we break its

580
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:39,400
chromosome for a day, the cell actually has these hypersensitive regions that will open up and stay

581
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,880
open. And that's evidence for epigenetic noise. And so what I think is going on is that cells in

582
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,600
their daily response to broken DNA and other things like UV damage when we go to the beach,

583
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,160
don't wear sunglasses, that back and forth of, oh, we got to go put out that fire. We got to go

584
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,760
repair that chromosome has led to these regions of the chromosome that are sensitive to opening up.

585
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,320
And once they're open up and the methyl groups have removed or been added in the wrong place,

586
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,080
they stay that way. Unless we reprogram them, somehow the cell knows, oh, that one screwed up.

587
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,360
Let's go back to being young again. So let's play devil's advocate for a moment. In clinical medicine,

588
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,160
we're actually 20 years almost exactly to the first time someone used one of these adenovirus

589
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:28,360
vectors to treat a patient. Wasn't it 20 years ago at Penn, Jesse, where they, I don't remember

590
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,400
his last name now, begins with a G, I believe, blank on this, but basically a patient died,

591
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,960
right? And that sort of really, really changed the trajectory of genetic engineering. And I always

592
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,320
thought that as tragic as that death was, it was a little bit of a distraction from what I always

593
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:53,080
took to be was a much bigger issue, which was how penetrant can you get these vectors? How ubiquitous

594
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:59,800
can you get these vectors? Let's use an example. If somebody had the belief that Apo E4 gene

595
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,080
was predisposing them to Alzheimer's disease, which it is, right? It's a predisposition. It's

596
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,880
not a fait accompli. The likelihood that you could engineer a vector to swap every copy of Apo E4

597
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,480
with a new copy of Apo E2, for example, seems very improbable. If you're doing that once they're an

598
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,880
adult, I mean, if you're going to have a shot at doing that, as there's reports of this in China,

599
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,720
I haven't really followed this, but there's all this talk about these CRISPR babies where they're

600
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:32,520
engineering out LP little a and things like that in embryos. But how technically difficult is this

601
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:40,760
to do in a complex organism like a mouse or ultimately a human where you need to change

602
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,600
enough of the gene to actually put the right program in. And I'm blanking on what the analogy

603
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:53,880
is going back to Shannon's observer, because that looks sort of binary. It's sort of like receiver,

604
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,960
operator, observer. Okay, but here it's like, don't you have to get enough of the corrected

605
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,360
version of the gene in to actually get the optic nerve back? I don't know if my question makes

606
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,760
sense, by the way. It is binary in the sense that if a cell doesn't get the virus, it's not going to

607
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,960
be reprogrammed. So the current limit to technology right now is getting it into the cell. It's how

608
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,800
many of the cells can actually get the virus is really what I mean. Yeah. At the cellular level,

609
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,440
it's binary, but it's sort of analog across all the cells, right? Yeah, it is. And that's the

610
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,680
problem we face. That's why it's going to take a while to reprogram an entire human being.

611
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,880
These viruses like the liver, for example, and you don't want to, you know, give yourself liver

612
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,640
cancer just trying to reprogram your nose or whatever. That wins the Darwin Award, right? If

613
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,120
the person who does that, I cured my wrinkles, but I died of teratoma. I would predict that at some

614
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,160
point people are going to try and use this for cosmetic effects as well. We don't know what we

615
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,280
can rebuild. We know we can restore retina. We can regrow optic nodes. We don't yet know how much

616
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,600
we can reprogram an entire animal, let alone an entire human. But one thing that has held us back

617
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,400
in my lab is that we can't deliver these AAVs, these viruses to every cell in a mouse. Now,

618
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,400
the good news is we may not have to. Maybe we only need to reprogram a quarter of them and we get to

619
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,480
be a lot healthier and younger. We don't know that yet. But in the eye, the reason we chose the eye as

620
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,880
well, besides the fact that we really like a challenge, is that the eye has drugs approved

621
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:26,840
for viral delivery. It's relatively insensitive to the rest of the immune system. So even if you've

622
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,440
got antibodies against, it's protected organ. And then we've got the fact that we can deliver a lot

623
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,800
of virus and in fact, about half of the optic nerves in the back of the eye. Can I get a vote

624
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,280
on the next tissue to work on here? Sure. Prostate. You have a lot of the similar features. You have

625
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:48,440
a very immune privileged location. Every single man will get prostate cancer in his life. What

626
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,920
we can't figure out is which ones are going to die of it. Imagine you could take the prostate

627
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,720
gland of a man who's 50. So a 50 year old has, I don't know, something like a 40% chance of

628
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,320
already having prostate cancer. Again, fortunately, most of those will not go on to kill, but the

629
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,040
prostate causes a lot. There's really no need for your prostate gland once you get beyond a certain

630
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,720
point, but rather than eradicate it, imagine just restoring it back to a young prostate and getting

631
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,160
rid of the cancer and getting rid of some of the hypertrophy and the other things that come along

632
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:25,640
with it. I mean, it just strikes me as a very discreet immune protected organ that you could

633
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,000
go after. I'm sure there's 10 problems I haven't thought of that a urologist is listening to this

634
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,600
sort of. Yeah, I think it makes sense except from a business standpoint where diseases that have much

635
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,440
more need than long term effects. So you're saying that loss of vision is acute enough that there's

636
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,640
there's a reason to do something about it immediately as soon as you're experiencing

637
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,720
visual loss. Exactly. Or you're having heart failure, got no other choice but to try this,

638
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:55,880
or you're going to die. Those are the early low hanging fruit that to help people we need to

639
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,680
figure out is this safe. There's some risk, right? There's no risk free drug except for fish oil,

640
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,880
which we don't know anymore if that's highly effective. So there are risks and with this

641
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,720
technology that we don't yet know what those risks are. We're going for the eye because

642
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,440
it's not likely to cause any problem. We've done long term studies in the mice,

643
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:23,240
many months, no effect on anything negative. If it was perfectly safe, I think the prostate would

644
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,560
make a lot of sense. If we had a drug on the market, a doctor could try that in a clinical

645
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,720
trial off label. But I think the future looks bright if we can get one tissue or one organ

646
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,280
be reprogrammed. So cardiac myocytes, how technically challenging will that be? And

647
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,600
do you have a mouse model for that yet? A heart failure mouse model? We have

648
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,320
hypertrophy. That's the best model we have in my lab. There may be better ones that are

649
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,880
drawn. The problem with hypertrophy is they retain contractility, right? So it's sort of,

650
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,000
you almost want a mouse model where they've lost some of the contractility. That strikes me as a,

651
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,440
I don't know, I can be wrong, but that strikes me as the easiest place to try to figure this out.

652
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,600
Right. Yeah, I need to research this. I wonder if de-Joxon would be one way to go.

653
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:13,080
Interesting. So what steps exist between this proof of concept in mice to

654
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:20,040
an actual human clinical trial, even in phase one? Well, the good news is about an eye study

655
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,880
is that you go straight to phase two. Because you have enough other adenoviral

656
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,440
vectors out there that they give you your safety in phase one? Well, my understanding is that

657
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,560
in the eye, it's a special condition where healthy volunteers don't want their eye injected with

658
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,280
virus. Of course. So you're not going to do a dose escalation. And although sometimes they make

659
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,600
you do dose escalation in a diseased population, for example, with cancer drugs, a lot of times

660
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,920
the phase one is still done in cancer patients. Right. Well, the advice that I've been given

661
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:54,360
is that we could go to a phase two immediately. And so the obstacle is surprisingly not getting

662
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:01,000
the patient doing the trial, actually making enough virus. There's such a gold rush and interest in

663
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,160
gene therapy that making these adenoviruses can take a year. And it's about twice as much as it

664
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,320
cost a couple of years ago. Gene therapy has gone from. Wow. So that's kind of the opposite of what

665
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:17,000
you think of with Moore's law on the sort of transistor side where more interest, more

666
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,120
technology should get cheaper. It will, but we're in that uptick of supply versus demand. And the

667
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:27,880
demand is huge. And it's probably because it's the hottest thing now, being able to edit the genome,

668
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,360
correct genetic diseases, and now reprogram the body. This is a massively interesting area that

669
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,360
holds huge amount of promise. And presumably profit if there's promise. Well, otherwise you're

670
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,840
not going to get people to put their hard earned money behind it unless they're very philanthropic.

671
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,080
The point is that I think you raised this earlier. I know you raised it earlier that the gene therapy

672
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,360
used to be the prior of medical treatments because it was thought to be dangerous, risky,

673
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,480
probably won't work. That's gone at 180. And now if you have a gene therapy company, there have been

674
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,240
a few that have been sold in the billions recently. These are extremely hard. Everything that's new,

675
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,920
breaking new ground, investors are all over it. How did the vectors today differ from the vectors

676
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,560
20 years ago? And I don't even remember the story particularly well of when this boy died.

677
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:18,680
Presumably he died of sepsis or something sort of related to, but not the direct proximate result

678
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,920
of the gene therapy. My understanding is these were different types of viruses that could integrate

679
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,040
into the genome and cause a mutation. And that led to problems, not least with standing up,

680
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,840
but could blood tumors. The viruses today don't cause cancer. They don't integrate and they don't

681
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,400
have any negative side effects other than an immune reaction. How is that possible that this

682
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,520
is not putting, sorry, you're saying the problem used to be that it was putting its DNA in

683
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,400
as well as a packaged DNA that it was carrying with it? Yeah, that's my recollection that they

684
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,880
had a propensity to integrate into the genome. So where is gene therapy today with things like

685
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,240
sickle cell and some of the really obvious, like if you're thinking about what's the poster child

686
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:04,440
for gene therapy, it's sickle cell, it's thalassemia, it's cystic fibrosis, like you can rattle off

687
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,840
20 diseases that are tailor made for this because they're single known gene mutations. Yeah. Well,

688
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,600
people who are interested in this should Google it, clinicaltrials.gov. Clinicaltrials.gov has

689
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,080
a bunch of these. Oh yeah. Many, many. This is a great example of how asleep at the wheel I am.

690
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,640
It's like my day job to pay attention to medicine, but you get siloed into one thing that I'm

691
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:29,160
interested in and my knowledge of gene therapy is 18 years old. It's kind of embarrassing. I'm

692
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,600
embarrassing myself as I, the more I'm talking, the more I'm embarrassing myself. Don't be so hard

693
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,600
on yourself. Even I can't keep up. My head is spinning and this is my day job. I absorb a lot

694
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,880
of this because it threw osmosis on meetings and whatever, but every day I have to read or at least

695
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:49,000
skim 50 papers just to keep up and in my area, let alone someone else's. So there's no way

696
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,520
you are certainly anyone who's not following this for a living can keep up. So you're saying that

697
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,320
right now there are active clinical trials ongoing for people with these really obvious candidate

698
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,960
genes. Sicklecell is a company that looks really promising as clinical trials, I believe in progress.

699
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,960
So yeah, I think it won't be long, maybe just a few years before these diseases are correctable.

700
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,120
Now that cost a lot, and this is probably a topic we shouldn't jump into because it's a complete

701
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:20,520
diversion, but because they're one shots, then to recoup the costs that it costs, these are

702
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:25,480
extremely expensive. The spark therapeutics drug that treats a type of retinal degeneration,

703
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,120
it's one or two injections. I think it's two injections, but it's in the high hundreds of

704
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,760
thousands per treatment. That's a lot of money and some politicians are up in arms about that.

705
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,400
So companies are getting more innovative in how this might play out. And I'm aware of one

706
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,840
biotech that said, if in five years you're not cured, you don't have to pay for the treatment.

707
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:55,000
It's interesting. I've also heard of models, this sounds even more controversial, where the cost of

708
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,200
the treatment is basically taken out as future earnings of an individual whose health is restored.

709
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:09,720
So you're sort of tying it back to a gain in productivity. So if someone who can't see has

710
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:16,440
their vision restored, well, they're going to presumably be able to make more money or do x,

711
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,600
y, and z in a more productive fashion over the remainder of their life. And a portion of that

712
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:26,280
gets paid back to remunerate the cost. I mean, I got to say, I am really glad that that's not the

713
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,160
problem I have to solve because I can really empathize with both sides of these debates.

714
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
It's very difficult for a drug company to sort of find the motivation to do these things

715
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:42,120
without some clarity around how these things can be priced. And at the same time, it seems

716
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,280
criminal to say it's going to cost a couple hundred thousand dollars for someone who's

717
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,160
born with sickle cell anemia to be free of sickle cell anemia. I mean, I'm glad that smarter people

718
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,080
than me get to figure that one out. I want to go back to this thing because I'm still sort of

719
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:01,720
wrapping my mind around this idea of the Horvath clock. So two totally unrelated thoughts. The first

720
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:09,240
is in the short term, can we use this as a way to measure our progress with the interventions we

721
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,800
have at our disposal? So remember a few months ago, you and me and near were sort of hanging

722
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,640
out in Boston. I don't even remember what we were doing. We were just sort of talking about some

723
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:25,160
stuff, but I made this argument that we already have some pretty amazing quote unquote drugs

724
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,840
out there. There's the really obvious ones like rapamycin that are actual drugs, but then there

725
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,440
are other quote unquote drugs like exercise. Exercise is a very potent drug. Fasting is a very

726
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,320
important drug if you want to use that terminology loosely, but we still don't really know how to

727
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,360
dose these drugs that well. And again, with the case of rapamycin, I talked a little bit about my

728
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:52,040
use of it. I reading the literature says pulsatile use of rapamycin, probably the right way to do it.

729
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,240
Constituative use, probably not. But truthfully, should it be pulsed every three days, every five

730
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:03,320
days, every seven days, every 10 days at what dose? Not really sure. Fasting, you and I have talked

731
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,960
about this all day long, could come up with an infinite number of permutations and combinations

732
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:14,360
for how one should fast. And my fear is we won't get really good answers in these because one,

733
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:21,720
the biomarkers we have today are far too crude to really tell you what's going on. Even

734
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:27,480
slapping a continuous glucose monitor on 24 seven doesn't come close to giving you this insight.

735
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,960
Looking at IGF, in my opinion, certainly doesn't give you this insight. We need something deeper,

736
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,920
to your point, right? We need to go deeper, deeper, deeper. And because these interventions are not

737
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,600
essentially profitable, there's really no great incentive for the biomedical community to be

738
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,120
studying them. But yet those are some of the best interventions we have. And for many of us, we'll

739
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:55,800
never have the opportunity to have an adenovirus shove down our retinal cavity to fix our eyes.

740
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:01,720
It's going to be, hey, how do we eat? How do we sleep? How do we exercise? And how do we take

741
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,480
drugs that are currently available? So do you think there's an opportunity to do this, to use

742
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:14,680
these clocks, to look at the extent of methylation and epigenetic change within our DNA to, as you

743
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,440
said, even though none of these things are likely to reverse it, the way the intervention that you

744
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:24,920
described is, if we study rates of change, that could be a great first order proxy. Right. But

745
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,200
it's still not going to tell you within a month of what you've just done is working. If every year

746
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:37,000
a person had a look at their clock and you could say, hey, David, I'm sort of making this up, but

747
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,880
David, since I saw you last year, your genetic clock sped up nine months relative to the 12

748
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,000
months of chronologic aging that you've undergone. Keep up the good work. I can't tie it to what

749
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,120
you've done, but would I be able to at least directionally say whatever you've done in the

750
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:58,440
last year has been directionally correct versus if you showed up after the following year and it

751
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,600
said, oh gosh, David, you've aged two years epigenetically. Something's not good. Now you

752
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,720
might say, yeah, I got a divorce and got fired. Well, okay. No guff. It's not good, but that doesn't

753
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,840
offer much help. But anyway, I'm just sort of thinking about this through purely selfish

754
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,880
reasons. I'm going to be completely transparent. I just want to know what to do. Yeah. I think the

755
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,360
clock gives us the ability to do that. We did it with telomeres, but the field did it with telomeres,

756
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,960
but it wasn't as accurate as this new clock. So you could do that. You could, every year,

757
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:32,280
even every six months, do your DNA methylome, the Horovath clock, and have a look at your rate of

758
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,960
change. If you've got stored blood samples, you could go back and see what that change was back

759
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,920
in time. It'd be interesting. Everybody could save a blood sample and go back in time too.

760
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,440
Are there any companies that are doing this?

761
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,320
They just have sprung up. I can't remember their names off the top of my head, but

762
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,920
you can find them on the internet. They'll tell you your DNA methylation age. Yeah.

763
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,080
Interesting. I was actually just looking at something totally unrelated to this,

764
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,720
but equally outside of my wheelhouse the other day, which was, I was looking at something around

765
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,320
endogenous versus exogenous AGE formation. I was like, how has no one come up with a company

766
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,240
to measure this? Because that's the crux of everything, right? It's not about people get

767
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:17,640
so phosphorylated about how many AGEs they're eating and they don't realize it's the endogenous

768
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:23,080
production of AGEs that are far bigger issue. This is like screaming commercial application.

769
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:27,240
Well, yes. Steve Horvath and I were approached by someone who wanted to start a company

770
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,320
that would measure your age and then tell you what supplements to take.

771
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,840
And he and I didn't believe that the science was rigorous enough yet to say what would correct

772
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,040
the clock, but those experiments that you're talking about could actually do that.

773
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,040
So the second thing I wanted to come back to on this is something I think we may have touched

774
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:49,720
on very briefly in our first podcast is around senescent cells. And this is one of those things

775
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,360
where you see the picture on the front cover of science or nature and it's mind boggling.

776
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:00,280
You've got this old mouse, this old decrepit mouse sitting right next to what looks like a

777
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,880
spry, plump, young, beautiful mouse. And the punchline is guess what? They're the same age,

778
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,520
but in the beautiful young one, we took this subset of cells called senescent cells

779
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:20,200
and we killed them. So maybe explain what that is at a high level and how it overlaps with

780
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,200
or differs from everything you've just described with respect to the methylation clock.

781
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,400
Well, if it just for a second, go back to the jostling of the epigenome and the noise that's

782
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:35,480
introduced. What we've shown in my lab is that creating this noise and the way we do it in my

783
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:42,280
lab, we like to use a broken DNA to distract the proteins. What we see is that the early stages of

784
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,480
aging due to this epigenomic noise leads to the loss of cellular identity. The very end stage of

785
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:53,080
that process is that the cells check out of the cell cycle so they don't divide anymore,

786
01:08:53,800 --> 01:09:01,400
but they don't die. They just sit there and they're stuck in this emergency state. There are other

787
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,320
things that can cause senescence loss of the ends of the chromosomes, the telomeres will also cause

788
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,280
a cell to say, whoa, got a real problem here. Got a broken piece of DNA at the end of my chromosome.

789
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:16,440
Let's shut this down before we become a tumor. And it's thought that these cells, these senescent

790
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,160
cells are really important to prevent cancer from taking off because they shut themselves down and

791
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:28,520
they stay like zombies in our tissues for decades and they don't die. The problem is that they don't

792
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,280
just sit there. They're actually... Yeah, they're sort of poisoning the well. They're in a state of

793
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:37,000
stress and they're saying to these cells around them, oh my God, I'm panicked. You guys should be

794
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,120
panicked too. So they send out chemicals and proteins that stress the other cells. The other

795
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:48,360
cells are now in a panic state and their epigenome, I believe, is getting disrupted and accelerated as

796
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:53,320
well. So if I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying the senescent cells can be part of the

797
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:01,960
cause of the methylation and epigenetic interference with the non-senescent, presumably

798
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,080
dividing cell or active cell. Yeah. And so there's some evidence for that. Like I said, we can disrupt

799
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,480
the epigenome that gets senescent. Those senescent cells you can now put next to normal cells and they

800
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:17,960
will induce senescence or cancer in those cells or make them tumorgenic, we call it. The other

801
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,600
experiment that was beautiful was done by Jim Kirkland at the Mayo Clinic. He took some senescent

802
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,600
cells and he implanted them a little bit in a little dab into the peritoneal cavity, the lining

803
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:35,320
of the gut under the skin. And those mice ended up having signs of premature aging, higher blood

804
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,880
sugar and other things. So a little bit of senescent cells goes a long way. And that's what's scary,

805
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:47,000
because if you take fat from a young and an old mouse or a young and an old human, we can actually

806
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,200
stain them. We can color them whether they're senescent or not. And when they turn senescent,

807
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:57,000
we can stain them blue. There's an enzyme they make called beta-galactosize. If you stain

808
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:04,600
young fat, it actually looks white. But if you look at middle aged, it's pale blue and an older mouse

809
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,360
or an older human, 50 years old my age now, it's dark blue. It's packed with these senescent cells

810
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:15,960
in the fat. And no wonder the rest of the body is in a panic state if these fat cells are now sending

811
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,080
out the emergency screaming signal. What is the phenotypic identification of a senescent cell?

812
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:25,400
Well, that's still debated at conferences, but we all agree that they turn blue,

813
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,320
that beta-galactoside is. There are other genes that come on that signal DNA damage,

814
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,120
one called P16, one called P21. These are genes that cause cells to check out of the cell cycle

815
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,560
and stop cancer. If you lose these genes, actually, it predisposes you to cancer. Makes sense.

816
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,720
There are other issues, which is that some senescent cells don't have that particular signature.

817
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,560
There are other cells that are non-senescent that do have those signatures, presumably, right?

818
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,640
Not so many. Well, there's a mouse that was made by Ned Sharpless, who's now the head of the FDA.

819
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:03,800
He made a mouse that would fluoresce with firefly luciferase, a glowing mouse that was under the

820
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,920
control of the P16 gene. If P16 came on, that cell or that tissue would glow green. We had that mouse.

821
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:16,840
We found that if a cell or a tissue got stressed, let's say a mouse had an infection,

822
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,680
or it got damaged, or it was nibbled on, or for some reason was just stressed out, the P16 gene,

823
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,920
that fluorescent signal came on. You're right. There are other things that can turn this on,

824
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:33,640
so it's not definitive. There is actually no definitive way to tell senescence in a tissue

825
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,760
versus non, besides this blue stain, which seems to be pretty good.

826
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:43,160
Wow. Going back to the third group of mice that you worked on, this was the one that was just

827
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:50,360
older, presumably it had senescent cells. It had senescent optic neuron cells.

828
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,560
They weren't senescent yet.

829
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,800
I see. So you'd stained those. You knew that you didn't have any senescent cells that were

830
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,320
contributing to the visual deficits that were slowly accumulating.

831
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,440
We looked because I was curious as to whether we saw that. I don't believe we saw senescence.

832
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,280
The reason that it's also highly unlikely is that we don't know how to reverse senescence,

833
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,240
even with reprogramming.

834
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,920
Well, so that's exactly the question I was going to ask, which is, if you saw them,

835
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,920
did they change in the presence of the reprogramming or did they still stay there?

836
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,880
That's the next experiment, actually, in my lab. We need to know if that's true.

837
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,080
There's a postdoc listening to this who's cursing right now because I think I rattled

838
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,280
off a couple of next experiments for your lab, right?

839
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,840
Well, there's 30 people in my lab, so we can split the work.

840
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,480
That's good.

841
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,640
But yeah, it's an important question. But what I think is going to turn out is that if you're

842
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:41,240
pre-senescent and you just lost your identity, then that's reversible. We see that in the lab,

843
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:47,880
in the retina. But if you've clicked over into this zombie state, then you're in this state that may be

844
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,960
possibly never reversible. I would never say never, but that's a lot more difficult.

845
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,400
So what does that mean for the future?

846
01:13:55,400 --> 01:14:01,640
How does that fit into your CD analogy? So if you've got a scratched CD and the scratches

847
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:07,080
are being caused by a senescent actor that's out of the replicating pool but is poisoning the well,

848
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,760
you're telling me you can buff out the scratches in the CD, but you can't get rid of the scratcher.

849
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,560
And you're accumulating more and more scratchers over time.

850
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,440
You are. But theoretically, it should be possible to even get a senescent cell to grow again,

851
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,240
because it should have all of its DNA still there. Now there are issues. If it's lost its telomeres,

852
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,480
it won't like being brought out of senescence or it's senesced because it's full of mutations.

853
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,000
That can also cause senescence. So there are reasons why you wouldn't want to get a senescent

854
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,880
cell to start growing again. You might cause cancer, but there are other reason cells check

855
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:43,800
out that isn't due to loss of information. So we've got a pretty badly scratched CD that we can

856
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:50,120
polish with reprogramming. But if you've gouged it so deep that even reprogramming can't work,

857
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,320
then we need something else probably. But I wouldn't say for sure.

858
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,080
So this is now, let's get into sort of a little bit more of the sci-fi speculation.

859
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,920
Where do you think would be the ideal application for this clinically in terms of

860
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:09,720
in humans explicitly for the purpose of longevity and not disease treatment?

861
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,160
So we've already talked about lots of applications on the gene therapy side.

862
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:21,320
Is your belief that that is the only application? That using reprogramming as an anti-aging tool

863
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:28,280
is a precise tool that goes after the specific anti-aging phenotypes. Oh, look, your skin is

864
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,960
more wrinkly and more saggy. Boom. Here's a virus. Ah, your vision is deteriorating. Boom.

865
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:40,200
Here's a virus. Ah, your heart muscle doesn't pump as hard. Boom. Here's a virus versus a global

866
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:48,920
approach that says, no, we're going to go right to the master CD and somehow we can restore your

867
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:54,920
methylation pattern to that of you at your birth. Which of those two paradigms do you think is the

868
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,520
sort of quasi sci-fi, but quasi, if you had to guess, predicted approach?

869
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:05,320
Well, I think within our lifetimes, we'll see the first one. The glaucoma patients are waiting for

870
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,400
this. We're working on starting a clinical trial, hopefully within the next 18 months.

871
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,280
So this isn't as far away as you might think. How long before we can treat other diseases? I think

872
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,560
that it's going to depend on the severity of the disease, the FDA. But I could imagine within this

873
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:24,680
decade, there are multiple diseases, heart, maybe not skin. I don't know about that, but other severe

874
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,160
disease will be tackled either one by one. But we're not just waiting for that. In my lab, we've

875
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:34,040
already dosed mice with the virus intravenously to see what would happen. The good news is that

876
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,200
they're all still alive. They're all still happy. No evidence of cancer. What's the expression pattern?

877
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:42,840
Ah, well, this is the issue. Majority is in the liver, some in the gut.

878
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,960
That's an adeno feature, isn't it? The adeno really loves the liver.

879
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,760
Yeah. If somebody had an adeno that got into every cell evenly, we'd be set. That science fiction

880
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:57,240
future could be within our lifetimes where we get a dose when we're young of adenovirus. We get to

881
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:02,440
age 40 and we're starting to experience the signs of aging. Our eyesight isn't as good as at night.

882
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:06,280
We have to hold the menu a bit far away. I'm there by the way. Yeah, me too.

883
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:13,720
I hit it, man. I hit it at 45 and a half. I can't believe it. It happened overnight

884
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,520
and it's exactly the scenario you described. It's the restaurant, tiny print, dark.

885
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,120
Well, you're losing your vision. If you had been infected with the adenovirus,

886
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,600
your doctor, your doctor, you could have someone prescribe a course of doxycycline for a month.

887
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,040
And if we're right, you'll get your vision back and you'll get who knows what back.

888
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:38,280
That's amazing. It's funny with all of these incredible, as you describe it, this huge reuptake

889
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,280
in the interest around gene therapy, I have to believe some of these companies are looking for

890
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,760
better vectors as well. I mean, if the fact that I remember adeno has a predisposition for the liver,

891
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,560
that tells you it's 200 years ago's news, are there other viruses that appear more promising?

892
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,320
Well, there are dozens in academia now.

893
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,160
They come with greater risk, of course, right?

894
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,560
No, these are slight variations on what's currently using that clinic and different

895
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:04,440
companies are using different vectors. So AV9 is good for muscle. So companies are going for

896
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:10,680
musculogistrophy with AV9, AV11 and two are good for the eye. There's a menu now of dozens.

897
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,280
But they're basically all still adenoviruses.

898
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,640
They are. They're slight tweaks on the proteins that tell the virus where to go in.

899
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,720
But what I hear is that some companies, I forget if it's Roche, but that's my recollection,

900
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:28,280
has made millions of different varieties. And if that's true, we may be able to choose any

901
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,680
tissue we want. In other words, we're not getting away from the tissue specific paradigm.

902
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,840
Well, eventually we will. Why not? I mean, if it's on the market, what's going to stop

903
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,680
somebody from trying this anyway? Because I think it gets to a theoretical question,

904
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:46,120
which comes down to you sort of alluded to it earlier. Why do I need a new car eventually?

905
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:52,120
Can I just keep replacing each individual failing part? Or at some level, do I need a new car?

906
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:58,200
Is there some final thing that it becomes impossible to replace? Like the chassis just,

907
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,600
especially here in Boston, like us Californians, we don't, our chassis never rust. But

908
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:08,520
at some point you could replace the engine and it's not enough. And what are you going to replace?

909
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,640
The axle, place this, you're going to place that. So if you take this organ specific approach,

910
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:21,560
the skin, the eyes, the heart, the lungs, the brain, is there something else that ultimately

911
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:26,520
is going to lead to our demise? Or is that effectively just the accumulation of enough

912
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:33,160
senescent cells that the gouges in the CD becomes so deep that even an organ specific approach

913
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,600
ultimately fails? Where I'm really going with this is, is there even theoretically an argument for

914
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:44,440
cellular immortality? Theoretically, this is as close as we've come to finding a way to actually

915
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,080
live for thousands of years. I don't know about immortality. I think that the problem with

916
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,560
what I'm calling the information theory of aging, which is what I wrote about in my book,

917
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:59,960
is that we do lose information. Every cell does experience mutations. It's not perfect.

918
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,480
Though I know I can take some of your cells and clone you and make a young version of Peter,

919
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:10,440
but it doesn't work for all cells. And so ultimately, if you're a thousand years old,

920
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,920
you may have lost a lot of the genetic information, but epigenetic information,

921
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:21,640
because there's this backup drive, this observer that we have found exists in cells somehow that

922
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,360
you can tap into. As long as the genome, the DNA strands are still largely intact,

923
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:34,920
we can reverse aging, but it's an information loss issue. So the gouging that we get may scratch

924
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,880
some of the foil in the CD or the DVD, and you lose a little bit of the song, which you'll never

925
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:45,320
get back. Now that said, if I was George Church, who's in my apartment, he would say, no big deal.

926
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,120
By the time a thousand years goes by, we can replace anything. And that's probably true.

927
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:55,560
Whole system, regrow bones, why not grow a whole new heart, put it in. That's going to be doable.

928
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,680
So what I think the future holds is the following a lifestyle where you're monitoring yourself

929
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,920
with devices. Devices tell you what to eat, when to eat. If you want to pay attention,

930
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,000
you don't have to listen. But when there's a problem, you're notified. You've got a tumor

931
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,080
somewhere in your body. We've detected it. Go have that killed before it grows. That's going to be

932
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,440
20 years ahead of what we can do now for patients. That'll keep you young and healthy for a lot

933
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:24,600
longer. In the meantime, we'll learn thanks to guys like you and clinical trials, what to do

934
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:29,880
to live longer, whether it's the perfect exercise, the perfect combination of diet.

935
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,440
But is that necessary? I mean, if you really stop to think about it, couldn't you just make the case

936
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:40,280
that all of this nonsense that people like me do and all of this ridiculous effort that goes into

937
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:47,560
fasting and rapamycin and this exercise and sleeping and all of this fun killing activity

938
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:52,600
of my existence, if I could reprogram, why would I do any of this? Well, yeah. I mean, who could

939
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:59,240
argue with that? I mean, like I could literally go and get a biggest, most beautiful pizza burger

940
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:04,120
imaginable right now and not worry about any of this stuff. Right. That's if it comes true.

941
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,600
So far so good. You know, if you can restore vision, I'm sure you can restore a lot of parts

942
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,720
of the body. Let's say reprogramming doesn't work that well. And you say you get senescent cells,

943
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:19,720
your organs eventually lose their information in their genome. Then what? Well, you can delete

944
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:24,440
senescent cells. You can take someone else's organs or grow your own in the dish or have a

945
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:30,840
pig grow your own with all that put down. If that all worked, I would challenge anybody to say that

946
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,320
that wouldn't allow people to live a lot longer. There's still people out there who say we're

947
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,480
never going to make it past on average 80, 85, let alone to 100, let alone to 120.

948
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:48,360
Well, I don't know. I think it's much easier to imagine an upward movement to 100, for example.

949
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:52,280
I mean, look, that's sort of my point of view, right? I think genetically I'm probably engineered

950
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,600
to stick around until I'm in my early to mid 80s. Again, this is just looking at my parents,

951
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:02,680
which once you get over 80, your genes become a far bigger predictor of your longevity than

952
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,240
in your 60s through virtually uncoupled. I feel like I've got a great roadmap on what it means

953
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,400
to get to be 100, which is still stochastic. There's no guarantees, but it's like, how would

954
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,040
you stack the odds in your favor kind of thing? But it's an entirely another animal to imagine

955
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:22,920
a world where you can take individuals and even get them to be 200. That's a really big leap.

956
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,920
And I would have said three years ago, it's impossible.

957
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:32,600
What did you think three years ago would have been the limits of our technology? And that's,

958
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,560
again, three years ago, you were thinking I could give you more NAD, I could give you more things

959
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:45,240
to activate your Sirtuins, I could tweak your mitochondria this way versus that way. Based on

960
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,200
that level of manipulation, what were the limits you thought we were?

961
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,080
So my thinking was having come from the calorie restriction world, that animals that are

962
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:58,520
calorie restricted live at best 30% longer and they're healthy, which is great.

963
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:03,000
And the CR mimetics like Rapa, Mycin and Metformin, they can, depending on how sick

964
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,040
the animal is, but let's say even Rapa in a non-sick mouse can give you 30% more life.

965
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:14,840
Right. So as long as we're like a mouse, we could live 30% lower. So 30% of 80.

966
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,560
It's a big deal.

967
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,160
That gets you to a hundred right there.

968
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,440
Yeah, that's a hundred. That's why I thought someone who does all these things has a better

969
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:27,160
chance of reaching a hundred than ever before. But what I didn't take into account in those

970
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:31,640
numbers, most people don't when they think about this is if we make it to a hundred, okay,

971
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:40,280
so that means I'm still alive in the year 2069. What technologies do they have in 2069?

972
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,160
Is reprogramming a common thing? Probably it will be.

973
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:50,120
Yeah. So in other words, this is the optionality play. It's if you add 20 years of life, extending

974
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:55,800
someone from 80 to a hundred, you have to take into account the probability that things come online

975
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,760
during that period of time that can also impact the very variable that you're trying to manipulate.

976
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,360
Yeah. And already every month that we stay alive, we get an extra week of life. That's

977
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,800
how technology is going currently.

978
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,680
Wait, say that again?

979
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,680
Extra month of existence. You'll be able to live an extra week.

980
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,480
Come on, that seems too good to be true. That's a 25% plus up. That can't be right.

981
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,120
I'll check on it.

982
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,000
Did I hear you right?

983
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,520
I'll tweet that out if it's right, but that's what I recall here.

984
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,400
I'm only questioning it just based on it seems too good to be true.

985
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:29,560
Every additional month of life is offering a week of additional life extension just based on

986
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,720
the technologies associated with it. I mean, because there's no evidence of that to date,

987
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,840
is there? Because we really have seen a compression of life expectancy over the last two years. Haven't

988
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:45,320
we actually seen? So up until I think, again, I'm probably misquoting this, but directionally,

989
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:52,120
I think this is right. Up until about 2015, life expectancy was increasing at about 0.4%

990
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:58,600
per year. That's now crested. I don't believe that in this environment that we live in,

991
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:05,800
in other words, we have figured out a way to eat, stress, and not exercise our way out of

992
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:10,520
all of the technological benefits that have come our way. That's, I think, why you're seeing this

993
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,160
sort of cresting, right? Where we've solved all of the infectious problems that gave us most of

994
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:20,920
our longevity gains way back in the day. We figured out that you shouldn't drink out of your sewer,

995
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,640
and we learned to wash our hands, and we've got great antibiotics. But these chronic diseases

996
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:32,840
that are killing us now, the force that's driving them, which I think is basically food, sleep,

997
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:37,240
lack of exercise, stress, etc., etc., I feel like those things are weighing down on us more

998
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,360
than modern medicine is giving us tools to fight back. And at the very least, they're at a standoff.

999
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,320
Certainly in the US, that's true. It's not true for all countries.

1000
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,680
That one week to a month thing might be a non-US stat then.

1001
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,120
Oh, yeah, it's a global increase in the maximum lifespan.

1002
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,200
So that might take into account, again, I don't follow this research closely enough to say it,

1003
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,960
but it might be that, well, you're getting more vaccines in the hands of people who are

1004
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,800
otherwise unvaccinated and getting fresh water and food into people who otherwise don't have it.

1005
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,360
Do you think-

1006
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,000
It's not. No, I have to correct what I said, because it's very important.

1007
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:14,120
It's a graph of the average lifespan of the longest lived country at the time. So Japan has

1008
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:18,040
been leading that for the last decade or so. So that's important. It means its average lifespan

1009
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:23,800
is increasing at the top end. So if a country uses all the new technology and has good healthcare

1010
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:29,640
and people don't eat themselves to death or take opioids, that continues to march up. What doesn't

1011
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:35,880
seem to change, in fact, if anything is plateaued or reversed is the maximum lifespan of humans,

1012
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,800
which if you believe John Coleman, she was 122, people debate that, but some people have made it

1013
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,760
117, 118, no question about it, but that seems to be our current limit. But did those people

1014
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,640
take care of themselves? Absolutely not. They're the opposite.

1015
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,720
Yeah, NIR has done great work on that topic.

1016
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:57,960
They smoke and drink themselves to an untimely death at 117. But what if they had access to

1017
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,600
the knowledge that we have now, which is lifestyle, some of these medicines that we think can help,

1018
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:08,360
maybe they would help those people to get beyond that. But to really go beyond that, I think you

1019
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:14,840
need something really new. And that's why I'm a lot more optimistic than I was having seen what

1020
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:20,120
reprogramming has in terms of potential to be able to not just slow the clock down, which is

1021
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,840
inexorable, seemingly inexorable, but now actually get cells to go back in time.

1022
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,640
Well, I mean, it's interesting, I could talk about this for a lot longer. I think at this point,

1023
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,960
I mean, I think the readers will, I think, enjoy your book greatly. I've deliberately avoided

1024
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,520
asking you, I think, some of the questions that are also on my mind about what are the implications

1025
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,960
of this. I think I get asked these questions a lot, and I just defer, I just punt. I just say,

1026
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:49,640
look, I'm not even trying to solve a societal issue. I'm interested in the longevity of the

1027
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,960
individual. And that's a hard enough problem. So that's kind of the one that I want to think about

1028
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:59,320
and put all of my energy into. But in your book, you really do actually try to ask the broader

1029
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:03,720
question, which is, what is the implication of a society where people can live to 200?

1030
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:08,360
It would change a lot of things. So I'll let the readers either hear you on other

1031
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:13,320
podcasts to talk about that or do what's even better and just actually read the book themselves.

1032
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,080
But I want to kind of come back to some things that we touched on really briefly in our first

1033
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:22,520
discussion that I've had so many follow up questions on. And so if you still got a little,

1034
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,600
you don't have to go back to Boston tonight, do you? Okay. So let's talk a little bit about

1035
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:33,000
your own personal habits around stuff. So let's start with metformin. We've talked a little bit

1036
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,320
about metformin. There are a couple of papers that have come out kind of recently that have suggested,

1037
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:42,680
hey, maybe metformin in the metabolically healthy person and or the person who's exercising

1038
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,640
is either not effective or potentially blunting the effects of that. How are you reading those

1039
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,800
papers? Well, I thought what you wrote online was excellent. I think about the same way, which is

1040
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:57,240
we've known that one of metformin's main effects is to quote unquote poison mitochondria. It

1041
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:03,160
inhibits a group of proteins that generates energy in mitochondria. And the response of the body,

1042
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:09,640
when it has a bit of inhibition of this is to say, wow, I'm low on energy. Let's build up those

1043
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:14,440
factories. So mitochondria are often called the power packs or the battery packs of the cell.

1044
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:19,000
They generate chemical energy. If you're young or you exercise or you calorie restrict, you'll have

1045
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,200
more greater area or activity of these mitochondria. So more is better in general for humans.

1046
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:29,560
More mitochondria is good. And as we get older, we lose that ability. Metformin slightly inhibits

1047
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:35,640
that activity and the response is to make more of them. Problem is that if you're constantly

1048
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:40,280
inhibiting those mitochondria, that's not going to be seemingly helpful with this new study

1049
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:45,240
for building up mitochondria after exercise. Now, you could argue that maybe you don't

1050
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,880
need to have more mitochondria after exercise, but I think you probably would benefit from more

1051
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:55,640
mitochondria. So what you suggested that I think makes a lot of sense, though we need to prove this,

1052
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:01,400
or at least test it, is that if you're exercising, don't take metformin on the days where you do

1053
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,560
intense exercise, maybe the next day after to let your body recover and build up mitochondria.

1054
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:11,640
This leads to something that I think is a very clear theme in all the work that I've done,

1055
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:17,000
the work that others are doing and what you've been talking about, which is pulse your biological

1056
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,000
stress. Put your body in a state of anxiety or fear, adversity, but you don't want to do it all

1057
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,480
the time. Your body needs a chance to recover. If you want to take a supplement, maybe don't take it

1058
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,560
every day. Same with rapamycin. You don't want that on all the time. In fact, I wouldn't take

1059
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:36,040
rapamycin, certainly if I was exercising, because it's going to tell the cell to hunker down and not

1060
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:42,440
grow. And you may not even heal after exercise as well with rapamycin. So I think that the view that

1061
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,920
the combination of hunker down fast, but then exercise on alternative days, or take the

1062
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,560
supplement, then exercise on an alternative day, they make a lot of sense. Do you think anybody's

1063
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:59,000
going to be able to probe this? I mean, NIR is working on obviously getting TAME funded,

1064
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,720
and that's obviously asking a slightly different question that's really going after

1065
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:09,000
sort of a non-diabetic population. But is it going to be able to look at this? Do you think

1066
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,160
it will be able to tease out this issue that we're talking about, or does the study not going to be

1067
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:17,240
structured to be able to answer this question? I've not heard of anybody who's testing that

1068
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:21,960
directly. Usually there's just one variable. And has this changed the way you take metformin?

1069
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:27,880
It has, but I need to put a caveat is that I don't take metformin regularly anyway. I need to find

1070
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,720
the right time to take it. And before I was taking it, when my stomach felt in good shape,

1071
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,400
and you can tell when your stomach feels out of whack, either you've eaten a big meal the

1072
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:39,560
night before, or you're just not feeling right, a little bit of heartburn, under those cases,

1073
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,480
I don't take metformin because it does a number on my stomach, which is great if you don't want

1074
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:49,400
to eat, but also I'd prefer not to always have a sore stomach. So I was already timing it. So now

1075
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,880
I just take metformin when I'm, I know I'm going on a long trip and I'm not going to exercise,

1076
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,320
you know, I'm on planes and trains, that's a good time to rebuild your body. And then if I'm at

1077
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:03,720
home and I'm exercising a couple of times a week, I'll lay off the metformin. And then what about

1078
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:09,320
rapamycin? Have you ever revisited that? I did take it just as an experiment, but I haven't been

1079
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:14,840
taking it regularly. One of the things I do when I'm fasting is I'm not taking those things,

1080
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:21,560
obviously. So any period of fasting longer than a day, those things get stopped. Again, that's

1081
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,360
sort of an idea that's not sort of supported necessarily by evidence one way or the other.

1082
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,760
When we last spoke, you were taking risveratrol. You noted that you were taking it with sort of

1083
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,800
a fattier meal. Is that still something you're doing? The evidence of risveratrol just continues

1084
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:43,320
to be good. It certainly does no harm. I do take it with my tiny bit of yogurt in the morning,

1085
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,520
which I make myself. I mean, I grow yogurt at home. I miss that. That does no harm. I don't have any

1086
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:54,520
negative effects. My cardiovascular system seems great. So do you think that risveratrol,

1087
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,000
like where do you think it ranks in Sirtuin activators? There's others on the market out there.

1088
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:05,000
There's other supplements even like Terra Stillbean that are sold that you can buy online. You very

1089
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,960
eloquently describe the story. And if people haven't listened to our first podcast, obviously

1090
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,960
this is a great opportunity to hit pause, go back and listen to it. Because you talk about

1091
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,680
sort of the novelty of risveratrol and how it was sort of the first sort of built for purpose

1092
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:23,400
custom. This is what it should look like. Oh, let's go get it. That's been over 10 years,

1093
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:28,600
hasn't it? Wasn't that like 2006, 2007? We first showed that it activated the enzyme Sirt1,

1094
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:34,040
Sirtuin in yeast and extended lifespan. That was 2003. Jeez. Yeah. So do you still think risveratrol

1095
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:38,360
is the best? Because this is something I haven't done yet. I just haven't been able to convince

1096
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:43,080
myself that it's just one more thing I need to add to my already complicated regimen. And if I

1097
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:47,480
wanted to start taking Sirtuin activators, would you recommend risveratrol? If so, at what dose,

1098
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,840
or would you recommend I take something different? And again, you can speak to me and you don't have

1099
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,640
to give advice to anybody else. Well, yeah, I'd never give recommendations, but I continue to

1100
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:00,600
take risveratrol because it's cheap, it's harmless as far as we know. But the evidence keeps stacking

1101
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,560
up that long term is beneficial. I mean, it's not going to cure diabetes. It's not as powerful

1102
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:12,760
in human studies or in mice as Rapamycin, no question. But does it extend the lifespan of

1103
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,240
a mouse that's eating a Western diet? Absolutely it does. That's been done many times. It almost

1104
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,560
seems like it falls potentially into the metformin trap, which is the metformin data in

1105
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:26,760
metabolically unhealthy people. It's pretty hard to argue that metformin is beneficial.

1106
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,880
Paradoxically, the people who are most obsessed with this stuff are already doing so many of the

1107
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:37,000
other quote unquote, good lifestyle things that you wonder, is it possible that you're already

1108
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,800
doing such a good job of all the other things you manage with respect to your health, the risveratrol

1109
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:47,000
is neutral? Or maybe if you're optimized, like you are, I think as good as it can get. But if

1110
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,160
you're elderly, and you're not exercising, you know, wheelchair, what else are you going to do?

1111
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,560
There is some data in my lab that I'll share with you that we haven't published yet. But I think

1112
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:00,360
it's interesting to mention. And I presented it at a meeting in Rotterdam last week for the first

1113
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:05,240
time to a big audience. So let me just tell the audience quickly what risveratrol is. It's a plant

1114
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:10,200
molecule, you get it from red wine in very small quantities, but the amount that we're giving the

1115
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,520
mice and human studies, it's a lot, it's hundreds of times more than that. So you can't drink your

1116
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:19,400
way into enough risveratrol? No, but you know, glass of wine. But that hasn't stopped people from

1117
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,320
trying. Right. The molecule, I take a gram of risveratrol in the morning, it's high dose,

1118
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:28,280
it seems to be fine. What did the ITP study way back in the day as a human equivalent? Or is it

1119
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:33,560
too difficult to make that normalization? So ITP showed that if you have a healthy mouse on a lean

1120
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:38,600
diet, it doesn't extend their lifespan. Sorry, yeah. And then in your lab, you took obese or

1121
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:44,120
unhealthy mouse on crappy diet, extended lifespan. Well, it depends where you start the diet. It was

1122
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:49,800
extensive, it was 20, 30%, depending on how you count it. And the dose roughly was what? We did two

1123
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:55,480
different doses, they both worked. One was 24 migs per gig, the other one was 240 migs per gig.

1124
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,920
It's a big difference. That's a 10x difference. Yeah, right. And the lower dose was just as

1125
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:06,200
effective. What did the log higher dose do that the lower dose didn't? It kept the mice from gaining

1126
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,600
weight. All right, so you're closer to the 24 migs per gig. No, I guess you're, if you're taking a

1127
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:15,240
gram, yeah, you're sort of in between those, right? Yeah, it's on the high end. But the result is the

1128
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:22,040
following. We had a science paper published in 2013, where we went to the effort of making a

1129
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:29,400
finding we searched for a mutation in the SIRT1 gene that we had published is likely the way

1130
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,760
resertral works. And that mutation blocked resveratrol's ability to activate the SIRT2 in

1131
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:41,880
enzyme. And that's been heavily debated and highly controversial. It's one of the big controversies

1132
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,480
in my career. So we were forced, if not encouraged to do better. So we went back, we found this

1133
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,680
mutation that blocked the activation of this enzyme. And if we're right, then resveratrol won't

1134
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:57,480
work if you've got this mutation in a cell. And we found that was true. The drugs that were in

1135
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:02,520
development, the super potent ones also blocked by this one mutation. What the mutation did was it

1136
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:07,560
made an enzyme that couldn't be moved. It had a stiff elbow. And without the bending of the

1137
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,880
protein at the elbow, resveratrol couldn't activate it anymore. And we know this very clearly, it's

1138
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:18,760
been well published and cited. But here's the big experiment. And being 10 years in the making,

1139
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:23,880
you take the mutation, you put it into a mouse, not just a cell, a mouse that takes a couple of

1140
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:29,320
years, took us a couple of years. And now we have a mouse that isn't normal, it's missing one amino

1141
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:35,880
acid in an enzyme that renders it susceptible to resveratrol or worse, recalcitrant. It's immune

1142
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:41,720
to the effects of resveratrol in the test tube. And now we could repeat our 2006 study of the

1143
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:47,560
high fat diet with and without resveratrol and with and without this mutation. And I didn't know

1144
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:52,040
this was going to work. In fact, in the history of pharmacology, I don't know if anyone's ever found

1145
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:57,160
one immuno acid change that blocks a plant molecule in the diet. That's very difficult

1146
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,600
because in a diet, these molecules and plants hitting probably hundreds of proteins.

1147
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,920
But we made this one change. And now we could ask the question definitively,

1148
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:10,360
if you give a mouse resveratrol, which benefits still occur? Yeah, what do you attenuate? But also,

1149
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,920
which are off target, which are working through something else? That's just as interesting. And I

1150
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,880
really don't give a damn anymore about what the answer is. I just want to know. And so we did

1151
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:24,440
the experiment, my student pretty much definitively, I would like to hear anybody who can disagree with

1152
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:31,480
this statement that resveratrol extends last band by activating SIR1. And it begs the question,

1153
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:38,600
can we apply that to ourselves, which is during those periods of time when we are not fully dialed

1154
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:43,400
in, would we benefit from resveratrol? Well, that's the reason I'm taking resveratrol is

1155
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,160
I don't exercise it. You pulse it as well? No, unfortunately, you caught me out. I'd like to

1156
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,680
take it every morning. I found that it's been good to me. Health is great. I'm doing fine. It's one

1157
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:59,000
of the longest experiments I've ever done, probably the longest, but it's ongoing. And because I'm

1158
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,960
changing other things all the time to see what works, what doesn't, I've kept that constant.

1159
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,720
So I would love to chat about it. We've got a little bit more time here, if you're willing,

1160
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:15,400
is I still probably get more questions about nicotinamide riboside than, and NAD specifically,

1161
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:20,920
than almost any other molecule that's sort of out there. We talked about I'm writing a book now,

1162
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,760
and part of that book, there's an appendix in it. And in the appendix, what I'm doing is

1163
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:32,040
writing a short section on sort of the drugs, supplements, and hormones that I think are most

1164
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:38,040
interesting. And so I'm including, of course, something on NAD and NR. I think I've identified

1165
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:43,880
17 or 19 drug supplements hormones that I want to address in this appendix. I would say that I get

1166
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:50,120
more questions about NR and NAD than all other 18 put together, maybe with the exception of

1167
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:56,680
metformin. So this is a topic that just continues to interest people. I would say that my understanding

1168
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,320
of it is sort of at the six out of 10 level, which is enough to be dangerous and enough to be

1169
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,880
frustrated at the fact that it's not nine out of 10 level. And we talked about this again the first

1170
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:11,080
time we spoke, but let's go back for a moment and explain why do people even care about NAD or why

1171
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,560
should one care about their NAD levels? Well, I've talked a lot about SIRT2 ones today. These are the

1172
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:21,640
protectors of the genome and the epigenome. They lose their activity over time. They have two things

1173
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:28,600
they require for activity, for maximum activity. We mentioned resveratrol, which is an activator you can

1174
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:35,640
eat or take in as supplement. That's the accelerator pedal on this enzyme family. The fuel

1175
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:41,400
that they also need, 100% without it, they don't work, is NAD. NAD is a molecule that's in our bodies.

1176
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:46,280
We require it every second of every day to exist. Our bodies use it for chemical reactions.

1177
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:51,880
And without it, everything shuts down. And we're always making more and we're recycling it all the

1178
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:55,880
time. We have many grams of it in our body. It's probably one of the top two molecules that's

1179
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,400
important for life and one of the earliest that have ever evolved on the planet. The other one's

1180
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:05,080
ATP, which is chemical energy. NAD is also used to be the most boring molecule in biology.

1181
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:11,080
You just had to learn by rote how it was used by the body and recycled. And it was just a bunch

1182
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:17,240
of chemical reactions. And it was forgotten about during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. In the 1990s,

1183
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:22,200
especially in the 2000s, it was discovered that it also acts as the body's signaling molecule.

1184
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:27,320
And we think it tells the body when you're exercised, when you're hungry, and is largely

1185
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:33,400
how calorie restriction works. So we think that in organisms like worms, flies, yeast,

1186
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,800
more NAD is better. When you give them more NAD, they live longer. And now the question is,

1187
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:44,120
is that true for humans as well? And the idea is that by either replacing lost NAD or boosting it

1188
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:48,280
to levels that you would only get if you run marathons constantly, you can turn on these

1189
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:54,040
sirtuin defenses and other aspects like DNA repair, proteins that need NAD. So again,

1190
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:59,800
we could almost be back in the paradigm that we potentially are with metformin and with

1191
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:06,520
resveratrol, which is it might be that the less healthy you are, the more you could benefit from

1192
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:11,080
supplementation or restoration, correct? I believe that because in our animal studies and

1193
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:17,880
other studies that people have done, the benefits of NAD and of resveratrol are seen predominantly

1194
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:25,160
in mice and humans that are obese or have a disease. And so they replenish what's lost.

1195
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:30,920
That said, if you boost the levels in a mouse of NAD, we published a few years ago, actually, no,

1196
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,600
it was about a year ago, that raising them above normal levels in an old animal, get you back to

1197
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:41,080
having a young cardiovascular system and they could run just as far as a young mouse. But when

1198
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:47,400
we gave NAD boosters to the young mice, they didn't run further, but they did if we exercised them and

1199
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:53,160
gave them the NAD booster at the same time. So it was the fuel, but not the trigger. I mean,

1200
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:59,000
you still needed to actually, it wasn't enough to get the expression basically of the behavior.

1201
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,600
In a three month old, very young mouse, but in a 50 year old, I would say that at least speaking

1202
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:10,040
for myself, I already have some deficits. I'm not as perfect or as healthy as I used to be.

1203
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:14,680
And so that may actually help more than ever has before. All right. So let's talk about boosting

1204
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:20,360
it. So the first question is, David, can I just go out and buy NAD in a pill and take it? I think

1205
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:28,360
people sell NAD as a pill. Let me reframe that. Is there a biological rationale for taking NAD

1206
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:33,960
orally? Very few people have studied taking NAD orally. What we've studied in humans and in mice

1207
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:39,960
extensively, maybe not as extensively as many would like, is giving precursors to NAD. Because

1208
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,680
most people take NAD intravenously. That's sort of the typical way it's administered in this country

1209
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:51,240
or elsewhere. Right. Right. But there's this adage and there's some evidence that NAD doesn't directly

1210
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:57,880
get into cells. It's a large molecule. There's some evidence that nerve cells take it up. But in

1211
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,280
general, it has to be broken down first before it's taken up into cells and reconstituted inside

1212
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:10,040
the cell. That may work fine. I've heard anecdotes that IV NAD is interesting, interesting results.

1213
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:16,280
Although you could argue that the placebo effect coupled with the actual physiologic responses one

1214
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:22,040
might have to nicotinamide could explain the quote unquote reactions and the feelings that people

1215
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:27,480
have to intravenous NAD. But is it safe to say that the, at this point in time, our scientific

1216
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:32,920
understanding is that intravenous NAD is not sufficiently making it into cells and more

1217
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:37,640
importantly mitochondria. Is that a safe assumption? Well, it gets into mitochondria because there's

1218
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:42,840
at least if you believe that this literature, there's an NAD transporter that pulls it into

1219
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,680
mitochondria. But not from the plasma. Right. That's how that works. We'd have to make it into the cell

1220
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:51,880
first. Yeah. I haven't seen convincing evidence yet. Now I haven't read every paper on the planet,

1221
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:57,240
but I'm unaware of- Wait, you haven't read every paper on the planet? Shame on you. I know. You

1222
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,840
don't come on this show without reading every paper on the planet. Well, I'll sell my kids.

1223
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,880
The IV NAD needs a lot more clinical research. I agree with you. Yeah. I'm a little skeptical on

1224
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,240
that. Okay. So then you said, okay, well, look, we've got this idea where we can orally take

1225
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:16,440
something like nicotinamide riboside, and I can go buy this on Amazon today. Yeah, you can. So

1226
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:22,440
NR for short, we're going to talk a lot about abbreviations. So NR becomes NAD how? Right. So

1227
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:29,480
NR is nicotinamide riboside. It looks actually chemically similar to how DNA is made, interestingly.

1228
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:35,000
It's what the riboside means. Nicotinamide is vitamin B3. So it's partly a vitamin B3,

1229
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,440
partly a piece of DNA. So that is a molecule that cells suck up through a transporter. It's well

1230
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:50,680
understood. They stick on a phosphate. It becomes NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and then the

1231
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:58,520
cells turn that into NAD. So it's two steps. NR into cells to NMN to NAD. And then once it's

1232
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:04,440
into NAD, it's then recycled. It's turned into nicotinamide when a sirtuin reacts with it.

1233
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:10,680
Nicotinamide is abbreviated NAM. Yeah, typically. And that's a version of niacin of vitamin B3.

1234
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,760
But many people ask me, can I just take a high dose of vitamin B3? And there's some interesting

1235
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,520
things. You can raise NAD by just taking vitamin B3, but you're missing out on the other components

1236
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:24,840
that the cell now has to make, which is the riboside, the sugar, DNA part, and the phosphate.

1237
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:31,320
So it's not surprising that other labs have shown that your goal is to raise NAD in the body,

1238
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:39,240
at least in a mouse that's been studied, that niacin isn't as effective as taking NR or NMN.

1239
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:42,840
And there's actually reasons to avoid taking high doses of nicotinamide, unless you're a cancer

1240
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:49,320
patient where it may help. But nicotinamide, we showed back in 2002, is a really effective

1241
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,360
inhibitor of the sirtuins, which are enzymes that you want to keep on. It's the whole point of

1242
01:47:54,360 --> 01:48:01,080
raising NAD. And so we try to avoid nicotinamide while raising NAD. And actually, I hadn't thought

1243
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:05,560
of this, but it would be very useful if the field had a definition, which is the ratio of NAD to

1244
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:11,080
nicotinamide, because that would give us an indication of the boosting, the gas to the engine,

1245
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:17,880
versus the brake. Yeah. So right after you and I spoke last year, there was a paper that came out

1246
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:24,680
from Princeton, Joshua Benewitz's lab that looked at oral nicotinamide riboside. It was a tracer

1247
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:30,680
study that looked at mice where they gave them oral NR. And basically the question was, what is

1248
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:36,200
the fate of this? Where is it going? And what that paper showed was the liver took, because this was

1249
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:41,640
oral, of course, so that stuff gets the NR gets absorbed out of the gut, presumably. And very

1250
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:46,120
quickly, everything in the gut makes its way to the liver first, hence it's called this first pass

1251
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:54,920
effect. And it was in the liver that most of that NR got turned into NAD. But the study didn't find

1252
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:00,360
that much NR made it out of the liver. In fact, what the study, if I recall, and now it's been so

1253
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,880
long since I look at it, but I think that they saw NAM, nicotinamide was up in the blood, but not

1254
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,840
nicotinamide riboside, which you presumably will still wanted some of that leaving the liver to go

1255
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:17,240
to get into other cells, because I'm assuming that you don't just need more NAD in the liver,

1256
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:22,040
correct? Wouldn't you want it also in the muscles or other cells? Well, yeah, you would, but there

1257
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:27,160
was a new study that came out that showed that if you give NR to people in a clinical trial, they

1258
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:32,760
could get NAD levels raised in muscle as well. Which study? This one was the- Just was posted

1259
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,200
on Biowarca. Yeah, yeah. This is the one that hasn't been peer reviewed yet, correct? And it also

1260
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:41,240
showed the very high nicotinamide levels in the blood. Yeah, right. And so I think where the field

1261
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:45,880
is now is it's trying to get the NAD levels high without- Okay, yeah, that's the study that was

1262
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:50,680
using a very high dose of NR, correct? This is a thousand milligrams? Right. Yep. Okay. So that's

1263
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:56,200
taking- On somewhat- Four times the posted dose that's given when you buy the supplements online.

1264
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:01,080
Yeah, it was a good study. Placebo control, they had average BMI was slightly higher. I think it

1265
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:07,640
was in the high 20s. Average age was, I think up in the mid 50s. It was a higher age group where

1266
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:11,720
you'd expect some effects. So they proved at least what we had seen in mice that you can

1267
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:17,000
get NAD to rise beyond the liver. How do you reconcile that? If that study demonstrated that

1268
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:23,000
there was an increase in NAD in the muscle, how did it get there? It couldn't have got there from

1269
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,200
the liver. The liver can't, to my knowledge, can't export NAD to the plasma, to the muscle.

1270
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,840
Does that imply that the dose potentially in the Rabinowitz study was not high enough

1271
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:42,040
for enough excess NR to leave the liver to make its way to the cells? Does it suggest as at least

1272
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:48,440
one author has suggested potentially there was a methodologic error in the Rabinowitz study where

1273
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:55,560
through freezing the samples, some of the NR was not detectable on thawing. Something that,

1274
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:01,000
by the way, I've asked people on both sides of this, and I'm getting conflicting inputs on this,

1275
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,880
by the way, it's very difficult to understand this. Again, I don't think people are bad actors

1276
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:11,640
here. I think it's complicated stuff and the assays don't lend themselves to necessarily

1277
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:17,080
working out every time. But what is your best explanation for how the thousand milligrams of

1278
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:22,840
oral NR in humans made its way into increasing muscle NAD? Well, it's getting past the liver.

1279
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:26,600
The NR is getting past the liver. Right. Well, that's the simplest explanation. You've got to

1280
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:30,600
start hand waving and saying, oh, well, the liver then sends out an enzyme or a signal.

1281
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:36,280
I think that's possible. They didn't look in the mitochondria. We don't know if the NAD made it

1282
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:40,920
into the mitochondria, correct? They didn't, but there are a couple of recent studies that show

1283
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:45,080
that it's very important for the NAD to go up in mitochondria particularly. Yes. And I don't think

1284
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:49,240
that's been demonstrated, has it? At least not in healthy. We're going to come back to the other

1285
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:55,240
study in a moment. If I recall that study you're talking about showed a few improvements in certain

1286
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,800
inflammatory markers, is that correct? Right. There wasn't much change with the NR. It was some

1287
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:06,200
inflammation went down in the muscle and if anything, mitochondrial markers of activity were lower.

1288
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:11,560
Were lower. That was something that didn't make a lot of sense. Although you could argue if the

1289
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,720
mitochondria became more efficient, perhaps you needed less activity, but you start to wonder if

1290
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:20,520
that becomes hand waving as well. What's your interpretation of that particular finding? I

1291
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:24,920
don't have a good explanation other than that's what happens and that's what we'll see with other

1292
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:29,080
studies. I think we just need to check if other precursors do that because we don't know if it's

1293
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:34,760
in our specific effect or if the whole class of molecules will do that as well. That'll be

1294
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:40,760
interesting to see. But what I can say is that it's a surprise because Johann Orrich, who's over

1295
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:46,920
in Switzerland and myself and Matt Caberline even, who's shown in mitochondrial disease that NMN

1296
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:51,560
and in some cases NR as well, does boost mitochondrial activity. Now these are mice and

1297
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:57,000
it may be unfortunate that humans are just not mice and that's where it ends. I don't expect that.

1298
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,720
I hope it's not true, but the data won't lie. We'll do the clinical trials and we'll be blinded.

1299
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:07,960
We've got many trials to go, but there are differences between NMN and NR. So curious to

1300
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:13,160
see if NMN has the same effect in humans as well. Those studies are ongoing. We don't have any good

1301
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:19,560
data just yet. And do you think that NMN would be best administered through a regular oral route or

1302
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:25,160
would you want to do it through an SL route, somehow bypass the liver? Do you think that there

1303
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:32,120
are opportunities there with either NR or NMN to get even higher plasma concentrations but without

1304
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:37,240
this compensatory rise in nicotinamide that potentially is harmful? Well the SL route I'm

1305
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:41,240
asked about a lot. Sublingual, put it under your tongue, try and get it taken up by that.

1306
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:44,520
Let me explain why this is the case because it might not be obvious if you're listening because

1307
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:48,280
you might be saying why would putting it under your tongue be okay but swallowing it not? And

1308
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:55,960
the reason is when a person swallows a medication it goes through from the stomach into the jejunum

1309
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:59,560
and the ileum, usually in the jejunum which is the first part of the gut after the stomach, it

1310
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:05,240
gets absorbed and that blood supply goes straight to the liver through this thing called the portal

1311
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:13,080
circulation. And so most drugs actually have to be designed with that in mind either immune to the

1312
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:18,840
liver's metabolism or designed such that they're pro-drugs and the liver actually turns them into

1313
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:23,160
the right drug. When you're talking about putting something under your tongue, just like someone who

1314
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:28,680
for example carries around nitroglycerin, if they run the risk of getting chest pain, that drug gets

1315
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:34,840
directly absorbed into the circulation and doesn't go through the liver. So I just explained that for

1316
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:39,320
the listener to make sure they understand why that would be a potential advantage. Yeah and also

1317
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:45,000
there's the complicating factor that our microbiome will love to chew up that NR probably and there's

1318
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:51,000
an increasing study showing that microbiome does eat up some of the molecules that we're ingesting

1319
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,240
so that niacin part of the molecule nicotinamide, it comes off pretty quickly even if a molecule

1320
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:02,520
in your fridge gets wet you all start to lose that nicotinamide bond and it'll break off.

1321
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:08,520
And in the gut some evidence that people have published and some haven't points to the gut

1322
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:14,040
playing a major role in how much this actually gets into the body and how. Typically the public

1323
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:20,600
are not doing this for a living. They don't see the brutal struggle for academic survival going

1324
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:26,040
on but now in the days of podcasts like yours Peter the public can actually see this play out.

1325
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,520
Now that's good because the public can see what is the cutting edge of science and make their own

1326
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:35,640
decisions and hear experts opinion but it's bad because it makes it look like science is

1327
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:41,160
one giant food fight but that's normal. Any new field will have these disagreements about is your

1328
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:45,800
essay working, is there a transporter taking it up, is the microbiome destroying it, do we need

1329
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:50,760
pro drugs for the liver or can we just put any men under the tongue and we don't have any good

1330
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:57,480
answers really good answers. I'm afraid to say that right now but I can tell you what I see emerging.

1331
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:02,600
I'm happy to give my opinion. These are not facts, these are opinions and I think we're all entitled

1332
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:09,160
to our own opinions, certainly not facts. My opinion is that the microbiome removes a lot of

1333
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:14,920
the nicotinamide from NMN and of NR before it's taken up by the gut. There are some studies that

1334
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:19,400
I've seen that aren't yet available that trace the movement of these molecules through an animal.

1335
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:23,800
We don't do those in humans typically because they're very expensive. You need to have isotopically

1336
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:28,840
labeled molecules labeling different parts of the molecule but then you can say okay where did the

1337
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:33,400
nicotinamide go, where did the sugar go and so I've seen some of that data. Now it's not all in

1338
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:39,800
agreement but if I was to summarize it I think there's a little truth in everybody's results.

1339
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:45,320
I think there's truth that it makes sense not to put it all through the gut. It makes sense that

1340
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:50,600
if you put a lot in the gut that's also going to work. Some of it will get through. There's some

1341
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:57,240
truth in that NMN gets broken down in the gut and then taken up by the gut and remade in the

1342
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:02,680
body into NAD because you're basically just pulling apart a you know a three-piece Lego set,

1343
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,360
putting it through the screener and then reassembling it on the other side.

1344
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:13,000
That seems to happen too but also I've seen data that looks convincing that some NMN and some NR

1345
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:19,000
gets straight into the body, goes to the liver, some goes beyond the liver into the muscle and

1346
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:23,960
so it's messy and there's probably never going to be one single answer to what's going on in the body

1347
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:28,920
with something this complicated. But here's the way I view it is that certainly for the members

1348
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,800
of the public I don't think they care if there's a transporter or not. They don't care what we want

1349
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:39,400
to disagree about a mass spectrometry assay for NMN. We'll figure that out. That'll come out in

1350
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:45,000
the wash. What's important is does it work in human? That's really all that matters. We know

1351
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:49,560
these molecules do amazing things in mice to health and in some cases to longevity.

1352
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:53,240
Though potentially the most important study of this is not yet out yet which is this

1353
01:57:53,240 --> 01:58:00,680
ITP for NR in mice, correct? That should be the most robust analysis of NR, should it not, in mice?

1354
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:05,720
It is. So they use mixed strains. They use a variety of labs across the country and so that's

1355
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:11,800
it's considered a standard but it's not definitive because there are plenty of ways to dose,

1356
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:18,360
plenty of ways to deliver it, plenty of molecules in our kit. But if it doesn't work it's another

1357
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:23,800
data point and so with ITP we'll see. Maybe it doesn't work. Johann Ulrich's over in Switzerland

1358
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:28,840
says if you give NR to old mice it does work to extend the lifespan a little bit. We don't know

1359
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:33,160
about NMN. We're running that experiment in my lab. That's no secret so we'll see if that works or not.

1360
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:39,560
We'll see. I think ITP is a good start. What I find somewhat frustrating is that they've never

1361
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:44,760
asked me for advice on how to dose or what to give or anything. Yeah I was surprised as well

1362
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:49,160
that you weren't involved in that. Now what you're basically saying is look in the end does this stuff

1363
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,840
clinically work is all that matters because there's really smart people out there saying

1364
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:59,160
show me the evidence that increasing intramuscular NAD matters. What if it's indifferent? What if this

1365
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:06,680
is true true and unrelated? Very recently a paper came out looking at megadose of oral nicotinamide

1366
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:14,680
riboside with pterastilbene in patients with ALS and it was a minuscule study that had as many

1367
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:21,080
dropouts as it had completers if not more but the gist of it was that on some what appear to be

1368
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:27,800
subjective measurements of quality of life there was an improvement in patients with ALS taking

1369
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:33,400
this very high dose of nicotinamide riboside with pterastilbene versus those taking a placebo.

1370
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:37,880
And what they measured some cardiac function as well. I think they measured one pulmonary function

1371
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:42,440
called forced vital capacity yeah so which is how much air could you blow which would be a pretty

1372
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:46,440
important pulmonary function which is one of the more important things that gets degraded in somebody

1373
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:52,120
with ALS. So the point is for a very small study that obviously didn't have any hard endpoints

1374
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:59,080
it looked like a success but I can't help but think of what you talked about earlier. What if

1375
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:05,720
this is another example of something where to see the effect you have to be testing it in the most

1376
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:10,920
distressed organism. You don't like to talk about people in that terms but a person with ALS is under

1377
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:15,800
far greater distress than you are and it's certainly possible that in somebody who is

1378
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:23,160
that close to the physiologic limits of survival can actually see a small benefit which I think

1379
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:27,080
is what that study assuming that study is replicated which of course is to your point that's

1380
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:34,040
the nature of science. I mean each experiment is nothing more than a way to alter a probability

1381
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:39,080
of something likely to be true but this would now make that case. But that was my reading of that

1382
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:45,560
study which was interesting but I want to see that in someone healthy. I want to see that in

1383
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:49,640
someone for the same reason I want to know what metformin is doing in somebody who doesn't have

1384
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:55,880
diabetes. So someone really smart I forgot who it was on this topic once speaking very specifically

1385
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:00,680
about this. There is so much smoke out there that you have to believe there's a fire but I just

1386
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:05,480
don't know where it is. I think that's sort of how I feel. Well with the resveratrol experience that

1387
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:12,280
I've had in my career and with NAD it wouldn't surprise me for what you said is true which is

1388
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:17,400
if you're in peak condition and you're young you're not going to see a big effect. If you've got ALS

1389
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:23,400
or some other disease that gives you low NAD levels so two ones are not working the way they should

1390
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,200
then you'll see the benefits. That seems to be a theme that's emerging. If that's true that's

1391
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:34,040
still good because we're not always going to be super healthy or able to run every day. There will

1392
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:38,200
be a come-time and for the ALS patients I'm sure they're rejoicing that this could be true. That

1393
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:45,720
study was the first real believable hint which is using my words very carefully but that one looked

1394
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:50,600
like there may be some fire there in the ALS patients. Now it was a p-value of 0.01 and there

1395
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:55,560
was some subjectivity but if you look at the placebo versus the control that placebos got worse

1396
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:02,760
and the drug experimental most of them went up in improvement in terms of life measurements. You

1397
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:08,440
didn't have to squint to see that result which was a nice thing. Now we'll see I mean again you got

1398
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:14,040
to remember that they don't have pure NR in this drug it's a mixture of. It's NR with terrestilbene.

1399
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:18,840
Terrestilbene is a very similar molycultura as veratrol. Yeah I was going to ask you the study

1400
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:27,720
was I believe they were using 1200 milligrams combined so it was a thousand of NR and 200 of

1401
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:33,080
terrestilbene. So that's six of those capsules that they sell. That's right now the question is

1402
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:37,480
is terrestilbene milligram for milligram as potent as resveratrol? In other words were those patients

1403
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:42,680
only taking one fifth of the dose of a sirtuin activator that you're taking? Yeah they would have

1404
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:47,960
been. So in other words 200 milligrams of terrestilbene is about the same as 200 milligrams of resveratrol?

1405
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:54,120
No one knows that but resveratrol is just again these methyls resveratrol has three little arms

1406
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:59,800
sticking out of two rings and two of those are methyls in terrestilbene. So it's very similar

1407
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:06,040
molecule to resveratrol whether or not it's superior I don't believe it is in some there's

1408
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:10,200
some marketing that says that it's better I haven't seen any data on that. If this study were done

1409
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:14,680
without the terrestilbene it might be more interesting because we could then it's almost

1410
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:20,280
like you'd almost have a third arm that had either nr only or pt only pt for the listener

1411
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:24,440
being terrestilbene. Yeah well that's the best way to do an experiment but it's probably an extra

1412
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:30,840
few million dollars to do that. Yeah interesting so what is the current field looking like on the

1413
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:36,200
sirtuin activators? Are there others coming down the pipeline? Is your lab working on next gen

1414
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:43,240
sirtuin activators? What we're pushing hard on are pro drugs of NAD boosters hopefully get around

1415
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:49,080
all the liabilities that we've discussed about these NAD boosters such as better absorption not

1416
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:55,640
digested by the gut bacteria is released in the gut doesn't fall apart in your fridge these are

1417
02:03:55,640 --> 02:04:01,400
all good things and hopefully is more potent than the natural molecule and those I've been working

1418
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,040
with a team of chemists for the last five six years with hundreds of different molecules that

1419
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:10,440
have been put at least through animals and hopefully one day will be put into humans.

1420
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:15,000
Our most advanced molecule in that class is in human studies right now at the Brigham

1421
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,800
Boy humans hospital. In what type of patient? Well these are healthy volunteers. So this is

1422
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:24,760
like phase one? It's a phase one yeah so phase two would be if all goes well next year. And what type

1423
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:29,480
of patient do you think would be most applicable? I can't divulge what the company's thinking

1424
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:33,880
because they're paying for it but I can say that they're looking at diseases that are not common

1425
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:38,680
and so very similar to what you're sort of like this example of the so people who are closer to

1426
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,680
the metabolic or to the sort of cliff edge. Well there are a number of reasons for doing that one

1427
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,200
is that there are there's good animal models for some of these diseases where these molecules and

1428
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:52,440
relatives of them have worked but also there's that business reason which is that trying to make

1429
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:58,840
a drug for obesity or longevity is currently no one would give you any money to do that be very

1430
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:05,320
difficult and so what's hard what people want to see is a fast track for a disease that is

1431
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:12,200
has an unmet need where patients are demanding something from the FDA and that there are actually

1432
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:17,560
bonuses incentives that the government has put in place to encourage people to make drugs for those

1433
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:22,840
diseases as well. Well David the last thing I want to talk about is how in the hell did you make those

1434
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:28,680
beautiful beautiful drawings in your book? Oh well. I was surprised to learn that you had actually

1435
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,680
done those. You're an actual artist you're an artist who masquerades as a scientist. Well my

1436
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:38,920
enemies would say I'm a BS artist but I do drawing as a hobby and it was actually a real pleasure

1437
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:44,840
that I was forced to do drawing. Hadn't done it since the 1980s but I used to do a lot of drawing

1438
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:50,120
I was going to be an artist or at least an architect a paid artist. I very nearly became a

1439
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,720
computer graphic design guy before it was such thing as Pixar. I loved biology though I ended

1440
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:01,800
up falling in love with lab work and thought aging was the biggest thing that needed to be sold

1441
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:06,440
rather than drawing pictures but the way I ended up having to draw all these pictures which are

1442
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:10,440
you haven't seen the book you can go on the website lifespanbook.com and I've got a lot of

1443
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:15,160
drawings up there even now they're posted. Well by the time people hear this the book will be out.

1444
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:19,320
Well fantastic so unfortunately they're reduced to the size of a postage stamp. I drew them the size

1445
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:24,120
of a foot by half a foot on a sketch pad. That's what makes them look so impressive though that's

1446
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:28,920
what they look like they're drawn by a computer they're so good because I'm trying to imagine you

1447
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:34,600
actually drawing them that small. Not that it's any less impressive that you drew them at larger

1448
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:39,560
scale but the detail is unbelievable. They actually look like photographs that were then rendered into

1449
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:43,800
sketches that's that's how impressed I was. That's why I originally did it and the lawyers at Simon

1450
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:48,680
& Schuster said you can't even use that you'd have to go and get permission from everybody who took

1451
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:55,800
the photo that I was rendering so I had to go back and basically make original art that I own.

1452
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:03,800
I had 28 days to draw 28 human faces and so it was fun I really enjoyed it. I would get home

1453
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:08,680
sometimes at 10 o'clock at night and have someone's face to draw and what was actually helpful was

1454
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:13,400
that I couldn't obsess over it because I have that kind of personality of perfection and I was forced

1455
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:17,320
I finally got an hour or two to draw this and I would just sketch it out. It actually wasn't that

1456
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:22,600
hard because these days you can hit control delete and or alt delete and get rid of what you've just

1457
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:27,000
done if you don't like it. In the old days with India ink you make a sketch and a mistake you

1458
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,560
forget it's over start again. It wasn't that hard but really enjoyed using that other part of my

1459
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:36,840
brain that I usually don't use. Well David thank you very much for stopping by today. Congratulations

1460
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:40,440
on your book I know how much work goes into that and I think people are really going to enjoy it.

1461
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:46,520
I think it's so funny like it's actually a pretty different look at a pretty common topic. I haven't

1462
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:51,080
done the google search on how many longevity books are in amazon but you probably need scientific

1463
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:57,000
notation to count it and most of them probably aren't worth reading to be honest with you but

1464
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:01,480
yours absolutely is. I think people will really enjoy it. Well it's a fresh look. I think from today

1465
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:05,080
it's been clear that there's a lot of new stuff in there. It's a different way of looking at aging

1466
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:10,600
this whole information theory idea. It's new. Nobody talks like I do about aging very few of us

1467
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:15,880
I should say and what's exciting about it actually is I was writing stuff down as it was happening in

1468
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:21,240
the lab so readers won't just learn about what I do every day and what my family does and what I

1469
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:26,200
think the future looks like but also what it's like to be part of these discoveries and how it feels

1470
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:33,400
and for the students and the impact on potential impact on the world. So yeah I'm very appreciative

1471
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:38,040
that you've had me on allowed me to talk a bit about what's in the book. I'm looking forward to

1472
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:42,200
reading yours when it comes out too. Well that'll be a couple of years from now but that'll be great

1473
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,320
we'll turn the tables. Anyway thanks so much David really appreciate it. Thanks Peter.
