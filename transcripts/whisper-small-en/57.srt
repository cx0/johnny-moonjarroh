00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,080
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,000
to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,560
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. I guess this week is my friend and legend,

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Rick Rubin. Rick is a Grammy award-winning recording producer. He's the co-founder of Def Jam

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,520
Records, which if any of you grew up in the era I grew up in, you're intimately familiar with

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,040
the incredible breadth of hip hop that spun out of that, the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J,

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,480
Public Enemy, Run DMC, Ghetto Boys, et cetera. In thinking about doing an introduction for Rick,

50
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,200
I almost wonder if it's easier to mention the artists he has not produced or worked with,

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,840
but rather than that, I'll rattle off, I don't know, a small fraction of those that he has.

52
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:57,640
ACDC, Adele, Aerosmith, Eminem, Jay-Z, Johnny Cash, which we talk quite a bit about, Justin Timberlake,

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,920
Kanye, Kid Rock, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, Soundgarden, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine,

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,880
Tom Petty, Smashing Pumpkins, kind of you name it, and he's worked with them. MTV referred to Rick

55
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,680
as, quote, the most important producer of the last 20 years, and in 2007 he appeared on Times 100 Most

56
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,880
Influential People in the World. This is one of those episodes where honestly we could have just

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,480
spent the entire time talking about music, and at some point I had to extract myself from the

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,960
discussion on music, which was probably about the first half of this interview. We also did this

59
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,040
interview in his legendary recording studio in Malibu, so I think a lot of my interviews feel

60
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,960
sort of personal because I do almost all of them in person. This one I would say even more so,

61
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,680
because we basically did this in a recording studio sitting on couches with boom mics down

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,680
in front of us so that you're barely even thinking about this as an interview, and it was

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,120
kind of just Rick and I talking like we would have been talking at his place or my place,

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,600
and I think that that allows us to get into some of the more intimate stuff about not just the

65
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,800
music, but the pain that sometimes drives music, the cycle of addiction. Rick is certainly no

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,760
stranger to seeing the downside of the creative genius phenotype that produces some of the most

67
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,520
incredible music that all of us love and listen to. We also get into his health. Many people know

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,640
Rick has lost a lot of weight and he was at one point morbidly obese, and so we talk about that,

69
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,720
which he's talked about a little bit before, this incredible transformation, but we also talk about

70
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,200
a really significant health scare that Rick had less than a year ago, and for me this was actually

71
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,840
very powerful because I lived this health scare with him as a friend, but I don't think as it was

72
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,280
unfolding I fully understood what he was going through because Rick is such a sort of happy-go-lucky

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,840
guy. I didn't appreciate at the time the challenges that he was dealing with, and I think being able

74
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,680
to relive it through this discussion was helpful for me, and I think it's going to be helpful for

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,160
many other people to understand the challenges that people are going through when they're

76
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,040
confronting something that's quite frightening, which it was. We could have spent honestly another

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,680
five hours talking, but we had to get back to his place for dinner, and I'm convinced that most

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,680
people will really, even if you're not a huge music fan, you will really enjoy this episode.

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,600
So without any further delay, here's my really fun discussion with Rick Rubin.

80
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,840
Well, Rick, this is a huge honor, man. Not only do I get to talk with you, but I get to do so in

81
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,000
a kind of legendary place, huh? Yes, sir. Can you tell me a little bit about where we are? I mean,

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,720
Eric gave me a tour that blew my mind, and I don't think that a listener could appreciate the

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,920
physical beauty of what we're talking about, but this is some... I wouldn't... When you said,

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,080
let's meet at the studio, I didn't have this in mind. Yes. How did this place get to be?

85
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,360
The band and Bob Dylan built it in 1974, and the house was already here. They put the studio in

86
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,920
before that they had been living in Woodstock in a place called Big Pink, and they made a famous

87
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,400
album called Big Pink, and then they all decided to move to California, and this was the place,

88
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,600
and they built the studio, and if you watch The Last Walls, all of the scenes that are not

89
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,080
the concert happen here, and all the rehearsals happened here, and all the interviews happened

90
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:23,400
here, and it's been rocking ever since 1974. The trailer out there was Bob Dylan's, huh? That was

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,320
his... There's the tour in that trailer. In theory. That's one of the stories associated with the

92
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,720
studio. So much of it is... There's so much myth. I don't know where the line is of what's real and

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:43,400
what's not. There's probably no average to this, but how long does it take a band to actually

94
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,440
produce a record in a place like this, assuming that they're not distracted by other things or

95
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,040
obligations, but if a band says, look, Rick, we want to come and we want to work with you and we

96
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,480
want to produce an album, and we've written the music, but it's still a little rough. Is that

97
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,120
something that a typical band would be able to do in a month, in two months? I mean, I don't even

98
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,080
have a sense of that scale. It could be a couple of weeks, and it could be a couple of years.

99
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,160
It really is dependent on the project. Everyone has its own

100
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,080
flow. Its own... It creates its own rhythm. So let's kind of go back to the beginning a little bit.

101
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,440
So you grew up in New York, right? Yes. Long Island. Mama Beach, Long Island. Did you always love music?

102
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Always loved music. And you went to NYU, if I recall. Yes. What were you studying there?

103
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,200
I started as a philosophy major, and then after two years I switched to film and television.

104
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,080
And when did you first start producing music, and what did that look like?

105
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,920
I was in a punk rock band and recorded a couple of things with my band. That was my first experience

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,120
of recording, and I enjoyed it. And then hip-hop was just starting in New York City, and it was a

107
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,160
small underground form of music. This is early 80s? Mid 80s.

108
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm gonna say 85. Something like that. I'm not sure exactly, but mid 80s. And I would go to

109
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,920
these clubs and hear this music, and at the time there was very little recorded rap. There would be

110
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,360
maybe... If you went to the stores where DJs would shop, which would have 12-inch vinyl singles in

111
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,480
those days, that'd be the only place you'd find any anything rap related. And it would be a 12-inch

112
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,120
single, and that's all there was, were these 12-inch singles. And maybe every week one or two

113
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,360
12-inch singles would come out, and that was all there was in rap music.

114
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,040
Then I would go to the DJ store every week and listen to all the new music coming out, and

115
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,520
the energy... When I went to a hip-hop club, what I felt there was very different than what I was

116
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,320
hearing on the records. The records were more... They were less like hip-hop records and more like

117
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,720
other kinds of records musically, other than they may have somebody rapping on them. But musically,

118
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,200
it could have been an R&B record. So at the time, where were the best clubs in New York?

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,400
For hip-hop. The only... When I started listening to hip-hop, the only place you could hear hip-hop

120
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:35,320
downtown where I was going to school, there was a reggae club on... It was either on First Avenue

121
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,880
or Second Avenue, down a flight of stairs, a small little club called Negril. And I think it was

122
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Tuesday nights at Negril, they would invite the hip-hop DJs from the Bronx and Queens to come.

123
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,600
There were some from Harlem as well, and that would be the only place you could get that experience.

124
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,920
And then as I got deeper into the scene, I would have to go to clubs in the Bronx or in Brooklyn or

125
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,360
in Queens or in Harlem. By mid 80s, by 84, I mean Run-DMC was already pretty well known.

126
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,920
But I'm trying to remember like... Yes and no. They were well known in New York and in 84,

127
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,880
they were well known in New York, but they weren't... What did Crush Groove come out?

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,840
I don't know. We were already successful. I mean, they made a film about us. So we were already

129
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,960
successful at that time. Okay. So prior to that, so I'm trying to think, when would Run-DMC and LL Cool

130
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,920
J first have popped up on my radar, which was before the Beastie Boys, if I recall, but maybe

131
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,200
not. But I mean, I wouldn't have heard of them until their albums came out, presumably, right?

132
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,640
Yeah. Well, Run-DMC's first album came out before I ever met them. I think that's the...

133
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, so Run-DMC's first album came out. Did they self-produce that? Like, how did they actually do

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,120
that? A guy named Larry Smith was the main producer and Russell Simmons was the co-producer.

135
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,160
There were things on that album that were really revolutionary in terms of

136
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,360
the first time we ever heard anything that truly sounded like hip-hop was on that album,

137
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,480
even though there had already been other records. The other records, again, were more like an R&B

138
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,560
record with somebody rapping on it. But the Run-DMC's first record had a couple of glimpses of

139
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,840
what was to come. So LL came from what part of New York? LL was from Hollis, Queens.

140
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Got it. And he sent a demo tape to the dorm room where Def Jam was located in my dorm room.

141
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Who did you found Def Jam with? Russell. Was it you and Russell? Yeah, actually started the first

142
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,400
couple of releases before I'd met Russell. Like, the punk rock records I put out were on Def Jam

143
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:53,800
of my band. And then the first single that I did in hip-hop was on Def Jam. And that's how I met

144
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,320
Russell, was because he heard that record and he loved it. And he was, again, I was a kid in college,

145
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,600
he was already a big fish in this small pond of hip-hop. Pretty much anyone who was doing hip-hop

146
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,040
was managed by Russell. So LL sends a demo? Yes. And Adrock from the Beastie Boys found that he

147
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,680
would listen to all the demos that came in. So you already knew Adrock and Mike and those guys?

148
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:29,080
Yes. Adrock found the demo, played it for me. We both really liked it. What song was on the demo?

149
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Can't even remember. What was it about LL that struck you as distinctive at the time?

150
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,880
Lyrical ability. He really had a great vocabulary and a great command of language and

151
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,560
believable in his presentation. And how old was he at that time? Like, 18? 16. Yeah. Wow.

152
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,000
So what were the next steps? So how do you take this kid with all this raw talent

153
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,000
and say, okay, like, I mean, how much money does he want me to raise? Well, again, he was 16. I was

154
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,400
maybe 20. Right. Right. Yeah. So how much money did it take at that time to turn what he had in

155
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,600
his head into an album that you could now put on a record store that is more than a single? Very

156
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,480
little. But we started with a single first. I think we maybe even did two singles. We did

157
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,800
two singles before we ever did an album. And the singles would have been, I would program the beats

158
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,680
in my dorm room. Then we would go to the studio, bring the drum machine, NLL. Oh, he would bring

159
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,960
all of his books of lyrics. I would go through the lyrics and kind of pick the stuff that I

160
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,560
liked. And then we would talk about how to form it into a song because in those days,

161
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,880
in the early days of hip hop, it was less about songwriting and more just about the

162
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,800
the vocal style. So typically at that time, it wouldn't be unusual in those 12-inch single days

163
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,600
for a song to be 10 minutes long and be more like what we would think of as a dance remix

164
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,720
of a song as opposed to the single version you'd hear on the radio. There was no hip hop on the

165
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,560
radio. That was not a thing. This was more something that would be played in a club.

166
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,760
So one of the things that because I grew up listening to the Beatles, I had this affinity for

167
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,760
traditional song structure. So many rap records you'd hear before, the ones that we made,

168
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,440
might just be a guy rapping for 10 minutes without any song structure at all. It might

169
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,920
just be a long, like a long monologue. No chorus. No, no chorus. So you wanted to impose a bit of

170
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,880
that structure. Yes. Just because that's the music I grew up on and liked it and thought it would,

171
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,960
I would like it better. So we started doing that and we would chop up these long

172
00:16:50,600 --> 00:17:00,120
raps into 16 bar verse and then create a hook. So the first singles we made probably cost,

173
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,280
I'm going to guess in the three to five hundred dollar range to record them and make them.

174
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:12,680
That's unbelievable. And how many would you typically make in a first print?

175
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,280
It depended on a lot of things, but I'll just... It could be like just a hundred or so.

176
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,720
It'd be like a thousand, between a thousand and five thousand. Got it. Because I was so young at

177
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,200
the time and I wasn't really thinking about anything beyond listening to the music, it's hard

178
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,920
for me to think about the logistics of it, but you only had how many record stores in New York

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
that could sell these or that had the people that would walk in that would know what to do.

180
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,880
Three or four. So basically you're physically taking these records in stacks to these guys and

181
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,600
the people that own the record stores like the music and they basically have the clientele that

182
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,760
are going to appreciate this. Yes. There weren't really dedicated hip hop radio stations at the

183
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,680
time. No. So how were you getting this on the radio and how were you? You weren't. You'd bring

184
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,840
it to Negril and then later the Roxy, which is as the scene at Negril grew big on those Tuesday

185
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,200
nights, it eventually moved over to a rolling rink called the Roxy. Then I went to the Roxy on the

186
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,760
first night that it opened for hip hop and it was this giant roller rink with maybe 50 people in it

187
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:24,520
and watched it slowly over the weeks and months become the hottest place in New York. So my only

188
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,120
goal was to get them to play it at the Roxy on Negril. That was the only place that we would

189
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,120
think about. So at that moment, like if you could put yourself back in where you were at the age of

190
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:43,080
20 making a thousand copies of LL's first single, did you have a sense of the fact that you were a

191
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,240
part of a new type of music? Not really. A new genre of music. Not really. We didn't think about

192
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,080
that at all. And there was no expectation that anything was going to happen. The whole goal

193
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,920
would be to sell enough records to be able to make another record. That was the whole purpose. It was

194
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,920
not a, nobody thought about this as a profitable venture at any point. So you're still going to

195
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,480
school while you're doing this? Yeah. Was the stuff you were learning at school applicable in some way?

196
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,320
No. No. So you were basically learning how to do this stuff? Absolutely. Absolutely. The best thing

197
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,760
about school was that it was just the location was that it happened to be in New York and that

198
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,480
happened to be where hip hop was happening. So had I gone to university of Chicago, my life would

199
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,520
have been very different. And that was a choice I almost made. So yeah, that's interesting, isn't it,

200
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,440
to think about these things. So you go to university of Chicago. You, I can't imagine there was an

201
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,280
underground hip hop scene. There was no arrival. What was going on in New York? No. So RunDMC were

202
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,320
basically the act of the, of that era when you were starting, correct? Yes. Maybe before them,

203
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,480
it would have been Curtis Blow. He was the first big, big rapper who Russell managed. And then

204
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:03,960
RunDMC who run was Russell's brother. And that was the next big band and eventually eclipsed Curtis.

205
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Yeah. It's amazing. And then of course by 86, License to Ill came out, which you produced as

206
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,040
well, didn't you? Yeah. That's the second album that I ever made. The LL Cool J's first album was

207
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,320
the first album I ever made. And License to Ill was the second album I ever made. I had to have

208
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,120
two copies of each of those. That's how much I wore both of those albums out. And both of them

209
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,920
were, there were like a handful of times in music when I can think about a huge step function in

210
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,560
what I was hearing. NWA was another big one in 89. For me as well. Like exactly the same. Couldn't

211
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,720
stop listening to it. What am I hearing? This is, yeah, the only way to describe it is to think,

212
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,160
it's a step function. It was nothing incremental. Absolutely. But License to Ill, probably even

213
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,240
slightly more. So what was LL's first album? Was it just self radio? Radio, that's right.

214
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,280
I mean, they were both, you couldn't stop listening to them. I mean, I literally remember

215
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,400
carrying around a boombox with the cassettes and it was like such a big deal. 13? 12, 13. And so it

216
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,960
was a really big deal when I could finally save up enough money to get a boombox that had two cassettes

217
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,440
with one in Dolby that I could start making mixed tapes. That was a huge step forward in my evolution

218
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,360
of being able to take my favorite of all the songs. Because then there was like also Run DMC

219
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,160
at that point. I think had two albums now if I can. Yeah. I played guitar in a couple of songs

220
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,040
on the second album, but I didn't produce them until the third album. And to be able to make mixed

221
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,560
hip hop tapes. Then I had one of my best friends in eighth grade, Mark Sillis was his name and I

222
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,240
probably haven't seen him in a thousand years and I hope someone listening to this knows him and can,

223
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,320
but Mark was a DJ. So he had these techniques, 1200s turntables in his basement and he had a heavy

224
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:08,360
bag. And at the time I was boxing, right? So boxing is my life. And so we would go and I would just

225
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,600
hit the heavy bag and the speed bag and he would take these albums and he was then making mixes of

226
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,280
these and we were creating tapes out of these things. And it was pure, I mean, that was heaven.

227
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:27,720
Yeah. So much fun. Yeah. License to Ill was perhaps the single most, I don't know, important

228
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,240
slash influential piece of music I listened to as a kid. Amazing. And it's really exciting because my

229
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,360
daughter now, I mean, knows most of those songs. I mean, I remember the first time she heard

230
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,760
No Sleep Till Brooklyn, like, and watching the video and it's like, and now I look back at the

231
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,800
videos and they seem more comical. Yes. Like at the time they were, they seem very serious to me.

232
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,040
Like, wow, this is, but now I look back and I'm like, Oh my God, they're kids, but they weren't

233
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,240
kids to me when I'm 13 and they were 20. They looked like grownups. And now I'm like,

234
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,200
look at Mike D and I'd rock on MC like they really look young. They are. They were in high school.

235
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,480
So how did you meet these guys? Just hanging out in punk rock circles.

236
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,040
And what, yeah. So what was their influence? Like what, because they, they also sort of,

237
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,600
they were really hip hop punk I thought of as, as a, like to me, LL was the pure embodiment of hip

238
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,640
hop. Yes. And the Beastie Boys had this sort of punk feel to them and rock. The Beastie Boys came

239
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:36,120
from a punk rock background. The band started as purely punk rock band. They put out at least two

240
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:44,520
punk rock only releases before I ever met them. And then they made a song called cookie puss

241
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:51,720
before I met them. That was the first sort of DJ based song. And it was great. And to perform

242
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,360
that live, they needed to DJ and they didn't have a DJ in the group because they were a band. And

243
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,080
I was invited to be their DJ. And that's how we started working together. How did you learn that

244
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,240
skill? Because I remember like going to Mark's, my friend Mark's house and sitting there with,

245
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,440
I mean, I can barely remember what I'm talking about now, but you had the two turntables on

246
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,360
either side. You had this like crossfader in the middle. You've got the, I remember you'd always

247
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,160
have one ear to be listening to this. And I mean, I was a Luddite. Like I could not do it. Like he

248
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,480
would try to teach me how to make my own tapes, but they suck. So I have enormous respect for

249
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,080
what a DJ is doing. Again, is that the sort of thing where you just had a natural affinity for?

250
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,000
I think so. I think it comes pretty naturally. It's like, there's a lot that you can learn.

251
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,440
And then there's also parts like you can learn to be a very good boxer, but to be the best boxer,

252
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,880
there probably has to be more to it than just the practice. Yeah, for sure. This, do you know,

253
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,320
there's, has both elements exactly. Natural affinity and the capacity to practice relentlessly.

254
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,120
Yes. So everybody can get better at anything they're interested in. I didn't know that until

255
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,680
Laird Hamilton really changed my life because I've, I lived my whole life with no physicality at all.

256
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,880
So for me, everything was music, but that was how I. So you're mixing for these guys now. You're the

257
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,640
DJ. Yes. How did License to Ill come about? In other words, how many of those songs did they show

258
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,800
up with? How did you guys even think about stringing those songs together? We really

259
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,600
wrote them, almost all of them, we wrote all together, just hanging out. Like we would

260
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,120
go out to dance terrier every night, which was a big nightclub, just listening to the music,

261
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,840
watching the people dancing, looking at the people and trying to make each other laugh.

262
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:49,240
And we would write rhymes with the idea of, you know, I would often me and adrock would be together

263
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,080
and I would say something, try to make him laugh. And then he would say something, try to make me

264
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,760
laugh. And if it was good, we would write them down. So we'd collect all of these phrases and

265
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,480
then eventually figured out how to put them together into things. And then we, one of the

266
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,480
secrets of that record is that we probably started it two years, two years before. And at that time,

267
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,440
people were making music in a shorter period of time, especially in hip hop might be, you know,

268
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,800
a month or two to make an album, but we did, we would only do a song when there was a song to do.

269
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:28,040
So, so it wasn't like we built up this big catalog of material and then went into record. It was like

270
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,120
we would stew on a song idea for a while. And then when it was written, then we'd go in and do that

271
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,720
one song. And then we would start from scratch again and just go to the club and make each other

272
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,720
laugh and eventually do another song over a long period of time. So your day job at the time was

273
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,960
still going to school. What were the Beastie Boys doing on the side or what was their, what was their,

274
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,400
were they same age as you? They were a year, a year younger and maybe two years younger. I think

275
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,560
Adam Yauch was one year younger. I think Mike and Adam might've been two years younger. So they were

276
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,760
out of high school, obviously at this point. I don't even know if that's true. I think they might

277
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:16,280
have been going to high school and I'm not sure. So did your parents like think this was awesome?

278
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,960
Were they so happy to see how passionate you were about something or were they sort of like,

279
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,800
look, you know, whatever, this is just another thing that you're doing on the side. My parents

280
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:31,400
were pretty supportive in general of whatever I did. That said, there was no hope that this would

281
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:41,480
be any, anything more than this fun hobby. That's really what it was. It was a fun hobby. My plan

282
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,800
was to go to law school. And if I went to law school, the plan was to have a job and to be able

283
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,000
to make music as my hobby. I never thought it would be. You didn't even think I'm going to go to law

284
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,560
school so I could manage musicians. No, I might've thought maybe there's a way to be involved in the

285
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,240
entertainment business as a lawyer because that's, I want to be involved in this world, but I don't,

286
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,560
I don't know anything about this world. I don't know any of the jobs or it just didn't seem like

287
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:18,600
a realistic thing to aspire to do. So I had a more grounded plan and then life took over and

288
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:27,320
dictated the rest of it. So when radio came out, which I think was 85, that sound about right?

289
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,960
That sounds about right. What allowed that to become such a hit or am I applying a bit of

290
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,760
revisionist history to it and did it become a hit after the fact? Like did it immediately take off

291
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,040
or did it take off only after Crush Groove? No, it took off. It did. Okay. So how does that happen

292
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,720
when there's no radio stations that are organically playing this and if you're not in New York in that

293
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,800
club scene, like how is it that a kid in Toronto could become? Well, the music was starting to

294
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:05,160
spread virally already. It was good, it was new and it was already starting to spread. Most of

295
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,760
the music up until that time had been put out by independent labels who didn't have so much of a

296
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,520
reach. They didn't have a distribution. No. And the first seven, 12 inches we put out, we put out as

297
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:23,400
an independent label where again, we didn't have so much of a reach. We found independent distributors,

298
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,240
I think there were 12 of them around the country that we would work with. So we would ship records

299
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,080
to Texas and ship records to LA and ship records to Seattle. There were a few hubs, but it was

300
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:44,440
still very baby underground business. But those seven, 12 inches were created enough interest in

301
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,920
the industry that Columbia Records came to us and offered to become our partners. And they were the

302
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:57,560
biggest record company in the world. So the first release through our relationship with Columbia

303
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:06,120
was radio. So you're 20, 21, 20. So how are you negotiating a deal with the big, you're a minnow

304
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:13,080
and the shark comes along to negotiate a deal. Yes. How did you not get squashed? We got squashed.

305
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,000
Did you? Did you? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. What kind of legal counsel do you need to help you

306
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,120
even? Well, my partner was five years older than me and experienced in the business. So he pretty

307
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:31,720
much, you mean Russell. Russell. He handled most of the negotiations, but then as time went on,

308
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,600
our vision sort of parted ways. This is a couple of years later now. And then as our visions parted,

309
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,520
I started getting a little more involved in some business stuff and then decided it was better for

310
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,720
us to just go our separate ways. And I asked, I remember going after lunch with him. I remember

311
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,800
the restaurant. I remember where it was. And I said, I don't think we should do this together

312
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,480
anymore. Do you want to leave the company? And he said, no. And I said, okay, I guess I'll leave.

313
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,800
And that was how we parted. And is that more because you and Russell were seeing things

314
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,360
differently or you and Columbia were seeing things differently? It was both. There were

315
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,840
two things going on. It's like I went to the label with a list of concerns on behalf of our artists,

316
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,920
really. We had, Russell and I had did our first trip to the UK because Russell managed other acts

317
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,520
that were not on Def Jam. We got to meet with people at all different record companies in England.

318
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,840
And all of these different people were so excited by the stuff we were doing. They just said,

319
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,560
any opportunity to work with any of your artists, anything we can do, we want to be in business with

320
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:47,320
you. And your deal with Columbia was worldwide exclusive. Yes. Okay. So then we went to our

321
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,800
last meeting was with Columbia who owned our work. I remember the guy's name. I won't say it here, but

322
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,800
sitting in his, and I don't remember anything, but I remember this. We're sitting in this dark little

323
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:09,800
office and the guy said, you were signed by the New York company and we view the New York company,

324
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Columbia as an albatross. So you're in LA having this discussion. I asked this is in London. Oh,

325
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,960
in London. Our first trip to London meeting the guy who controls our destiny in London,

326
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,400
which is the gateway to the rest of the world. Yeah. After having all these meetings of people

327
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,480
who are desperate to be involved in any way in a positive way, the person who's in control of our

328
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,120
stuff said, we look at Columbia records in New York as an albatross and this is nothing against

329
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,840
you personally, but because you come from them, we're just not interested. And I just like my eyes

330
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,240
got wide. It's like, okay, now I know what I need to do. I need to just go back. But, but the beauty

331
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,160
of it was I went back and met with the people in New York and I said, we have a problem and it's not

332
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,720
our problem. It's your problem, but there's a way we can fix it. We met with all these labels.

333
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,640
Everybody wants our stuff. Columbia is not interested. Why don't we together? I'm not

334
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:13,160
saying let's take it away from you, New York. Let's together find the best home for each of

335
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,840
these artists around the world and share everything as if you were putting it out,

336
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,360
but let's do what's right for the artist. And I was told that Columbia has a policy

337
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,520
that they would rather see the works die than have someone else have success with them.

338
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Wonderful policy.

339
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,480
That was to a 20 or 21 year old kid. That's not a reasonable, I mean, it wouldn't be reasonable

340
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:49,160
to me now, but then it seemed so far fetched and so counterproductive when there was an opportunity

341
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:55,960
to be had that they could participate in to turn that off because of a corporate policy. That was

342
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,600
one of my first experiences of that.

343
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,160
So Russell, he didn't want to rock that boat.

344
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:10,360
Well, they wrote a check to the company, which satisfied Russell, but didn't satisfy me because

345
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,840
I wasn't concerned with the check. I was concerned with what happened to this music.

346
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,160
This is what year? This is late eighties.

347
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,200
I mean, maybe 80, probably 88, either 88 or 89.

348
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:32,920
Okay. So now you're sort of, you've experienced pretty amazing success for a 22 year old.

349
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,560
Unbelievable.

350
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,680
It was unbelievable.

351
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:41,080
And I still want to come back to actually understanding how this music blew up. I want

352
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,440
to get a little bit more on that, but.

353
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,680
We can talk about that more first if you want.

354
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,720
Yeah. Well, I'll forget this question. I guess my point is you

355
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,040
basically risk giving everything up because in theory, I mean, you could argue you had the

356
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,600
artists, the artists cared about you because they saw your honesty and they saw that your

357
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,720
heart was with the music and not the money as evidenced by what you just did.

358
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,280
Yeah, but they didn't necessarily see that, but yes,

359
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,400
nobody really knew what was happening. So I can't say that they saw that or knew that.

360
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,520
Got it. So were you scared when you made that decision? Did you think, did you second guess it?

361
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,520
No, it may not have been the best decision, but it felt very natural to me. And it felt like

362
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm making things that I really feel good about. And I know that I'm going to keep doing this.

363
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,640
And if I have a partnership with this big company, that's doesn't want to do what we want to do,

364
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,520
I need to find a different way to do this.

365
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,400
And did Russell understand that by taking the check, but you leaving that the artists were

366
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,120
more likely to go with you than stay with Def Jam?

367
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,880
No, and they didn't. That wasn't even an option because we had contracts.

368
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,720
So you were walking away from everything.

369
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Absolutely. Which I did. Yeah.

370
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,640
Okay. So we'll come back to that in a second, but I want to come back to this point of

371
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,040
what is it that lit up license to ill?

372
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Well, one thing, it's crazy that this is the case, but it's the case.

373
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:19,880
It's a little bit why Elvis is Elvis, even though Chuck Berry and little Richard came before him.

374
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,320
The Beastie Boys were white and this was an underground black music. And in terms of

375
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:37,960
maybe in the city, it didn't matter. But in terms of deeply penetrating into the rest of the country,

376
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,600
the fact that the Beastie Boys were white played a huge difference.

377
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,280
I didn't see it so much then, but down retrospect, it's clear.

378
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,960
By 87, I mean, the Beastie Boys are one of the most popular acts in hip hop.

379
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,360
Yes.

380
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,280
How many copies did license to ill sell?

381
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
10 million, something like that.

382
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,760
And I can never keep these things straight. The colors that go with numbers and I hear

383
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,640
multi-platinum. I forget what all that stuff means. So a platinum album means what?

384
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,920
1 million. 500,000 is gold. 1 million is platinum. It doesn't happen often, but the 10 million mark

385
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,680
called diamonds, they're not so many of them.

386
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
So this was a diamond.

387
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,360
I guess it was, but I don't even know if they counted diamonds then. It's like it's so,

388
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,840
it was such a random event. There were very few things that sold that many.

389
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,080
How did the success of that album change your life and how did it change

390
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,840
theirs in the immediate aftermath of that? Because that's really,

391
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,160
that success is happening in the course of like 12 months.

392
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:52,600
It drove a wedge in our relationship in not a great way. And what it had to do with was,

393
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,160
I usually presented a pretty clear vision of the things that I thought that we could accomplish.

394
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:11,800
And in success, a lot of people started surrounding the artists who were more concerned with

395
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,400
placating the artist than doing what was best for the artist. And I would always fight for what was

396
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:33,000
best. And when there are other voices who are saying whatever you want, then it's easier to

397
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,160
tune out the voice of the person who's not going along with everything because it wasn't always

398
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,400
good.

399
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,320
So you're only a couple of years older than these guys. Is there a manager also in the mix at this

400
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,120
point? Or were you sort of acting as a de facto manager?

401
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Russell really was their manager. And then Lior Cohn came in to work with Russell as their manager.

402
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,840
Got it. So their next album was Paul's Boutique. Yes. And I know you did not produce that. No,

403
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,040
at that point, they left Def Jam. They left Russell as well.

404
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,320
They left Russell. Well, I was already gone. Yeah. I think when they left.

405
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,160
Yeah. I'm not sure if that's right. I can't really remember, but either way, we left similar times.

406
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,480
Yeah. So what do you do the morning after you wake up and you've walked away from Def Jam,

407
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:29,000
the label you've co-founded, you left all the money behind and you left behind artists who

408
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,480
had already been signed with an organization that you now know didn't even really care that

409
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,800
much about them. Did you think at that point, you know what, maybe I'm just going to go back,

410
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,920
go to law school and just make music on the side or did you, what was the internal dialogue to

411
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,240
sort of make the next decision? I thought that it was the Def Jam experiment had worked.

412
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,520
So I thought I could continue doing what I was doing, just that the framework that was set up

413
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,160
was not the best framework. So the goal was to start a new framework, which I did immediately.

414
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,240
And what was that called? At first, it was called Def American. And then it became American,

415
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,640
which is what it's called to this day. And at that point, what were the most important

416
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,080
lessons you learned from Def Jam that you instituted and kept in place? I mean,

417
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,200
was it basically we're not going to partner with another major record label or?

418
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,480
No, it was we have to partner with a major record company who's going to support what we want to do.

419
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Because again, the reason you knew about these artists living in Toronto was because of the

420
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,600
reach of the major labels, a combination of how good the music was.

421
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,640
If this had stayed independent, I probably would have never heard of it.

422
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:43,480
Yeah. Walk me through the economics of a record in a moment. So you've got again, it's so hard today.

423
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,760
Let's answer this question through the lens of 1990. I honestly don't even know if I'm going to

424
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,880
be able to answer the question because I never really look at that stuff. Like I'm trying to

425
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,240
think about how rent gets split, right? Like when I went into a record store and I paid $10

426
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:03,560
for a cassette or a record album, I'm guessing that Columbia is getting like seven of those $10.

427
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Maybe half.

428
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,640
And the artists, when everybody else gets paid, the artists are getting what, two or three?

429
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:21,400
Typically in those days, a record deal would be, the artists would get in the, let's say,

430
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:29,560
a 12% royalty of the retail price. So whatever that would be, would be not unusual. That would

431
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,440
be typical. A bigger artist, it would be a bigger number. Like maybe Michael Jackson might get 20%,

432
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,600
but 20% of the retail, not of the wholesale. Yeah. And also the retail number was a little

433
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,600
fictitious because it would, let's say it would be 1499 list, but then you might be able to buy

434
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,560
it in the store for $11. And they're getting it off the $4,999? Whatever the list price is.

435
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,720
The true list price. Yeah, not the sale price. Yeah. And that's of course changed and I'd love

436
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,320
to understand better how the world works today because when you think about the big disruptions,

437
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,920
I mean, it's sort of weird to think, I don't know the last time I went into a record store.

438
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,200
No, there are not so many to go into. Well, I still pass, like in New York, you still see them.

439
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,360
And every once in a while you'll go in and you'll find a place that's just got this incredible

440
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,000
vinyl. But the funny thing is I don't have a place to even play it anymore. Like I probably

441
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,120
still have a turntable at my parents' house. Techniques. You're the norm. That's not unusual.

442
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,040
So who was the next artist or who was the first next artist that you discovered when you went

443
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,920
out on your own? Probably Danzig. Slayer and Danzig were the next two, both of whom I think I

444
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,560
signed when I was still at Def Jam, but I signed them. And when I left, they did come with me

445
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,520
because they hadn't put out any music yet. Anyone who had put out music was kind of obligated to

446
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,640
say. So now we're in the late eighties. You're still in New York. When did you come out to

447
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,480
California? Probably maybe 1990, around the 89, 90, something like that. So as far as other huge

448
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,040
seismic or tectonic shifts in music, I think Nirvana would have to be viewed as another one.

449
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,040
How much was that on your radar? It wasn't the music you were producing, but what were you

450
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,280
thinking about it at the time? I wasn't thinking about it so much. When the grunge movement

451
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:31,080
happened, the people who were excited by it, it was newer to them than it was to me. It felt more

452
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:41,720
like a continuation of Aerosmith and Black Sabbath and the heavy metal I grew up on. So it didn't

453
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,920
feel as revolutionary as it ended up feeling to others. So I didn't get as excited about it as

454
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,200
other people did. And of all the bands, the band that most spoke to me from that world was Sound

455
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,800
Garden. You worked with Chris. You worked with Sound Garden, yeah? I worked with Chris in Audioslave.

456
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,080
Yeah, because it was sort of like, that's one of those things where at the time, I feel like Metallica

457
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:19,320
and Guns N' Roses were the biggest bands in rock and roll. And then overnight Nirvana showed up

458
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:25,640
and this album, I think Smells Like Teen Spirit was the first one. I don't know if it was the first

459
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,320
one, but that's the one that changed everything. And then Pearl Jam right on the heels of that.

460
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,520
They put out records on Sub Pop before. That was their first major label album.

461
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:48,040
It's just so interesting to contemplate all these things. So you come out to LA for what reason, besides the weather?

462
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,960
I never really thought I would live in LA. I thought I would live in New York my whole life. I came out here to

463
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,320
work on a soundtrack for a movie and I was out here for eight or nine months. Eventually I got tired of

464
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,720
living in a hotel, which I was living at the Mondrian on Sunset. And I would always drive

465
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,760
through the Hollywood Hills looking at houses because where I come from, everything is flat.

466
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,640
So seeing these houses built into mountains was unbelievable. So every weekend or late nights,

467
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,760
I had a friend who lived locally and we would drive the hills together. And eventually I found a little

468
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,880
house that I liked. So I bought this house thinking, okay, when I come to LA, this will be the place I stay

469
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,000
instead of staying in the hotel. And then ended up never really going back to New York. Maybe five

470
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,080
years later, I eventually took the things out of my apartment because I realized I wasn't going back.

471
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,640
But it was never like a decision to move here. Same thing happened moving to Malibu. I got a place

472
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,720
to come on weekends. I came the first weekend and never went back. I can see why you weren't

473
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,880
interested in taking me up on my offer to come and live with me in my guest house. You're like,

474
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,120
I don't do San Diego, but maybe on some deep down level, you're like,

475
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,920
there's at least a 1% chance I might get stuck there. So when did you first connect with the Red

476
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:14,280
Hot Chili Peppers? They had asked me to produce an album, maybe their third album, which is called

477
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:21,560
maybe Uplift Mofo Party, I think. Yeah. So this would have been like 93? No, no. I first met them

478
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:27,480
probably 89, 90. Mother's Milk was their first album, right? No. No. No, that meant Mother's Milk

479
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,200
might've been their fourth. Really? Yeah. At least third, maybe fourth. We have to check. Oh, okay.

480
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,720
Yeah. Cause Mother's Milk, I feel like that's the, that's the first album that I... That was their first breakthrough.

481
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:47,160
That was their first breakthrough. 89? Yeah. But they had, I want to say three, maybe two, maybe,

482
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,800
but possibly three before that. You know, we're going to talk about exercise in a moment, but

483
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,600
I do Tabata workouts once a week and they're really, really miserable, but it's like this four

484
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:02,120
minutes once a week where you're going to go as close as you could go to dying doing an exercise.

485
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,000
And so the musical selection for that four minutes really matters. Like I put a lot of time into what

486
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,200
song am I going to be listening to at a 97 decibels when I go to the point of puking. So for Monday's

487
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,400
workout, it was from Mother's Milk. It was Knock Me Down. Oh, great. It's a good song. Amazing song.

488
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,040
And as I was laying on the floor afterwards trying not to vomit, which is generally like most of my

489
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,880
effort is going into not puking after I'm on the ground, like listening to this song,

490
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,600
being about knocking me down. And I'm like, this is perfect. It's like really a great,

491
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,840
it's actually a great song. I posted something on Instagram about it like a couple of months ago,

492
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,920
because it's one of those songs like where I don't listen to it that often anymore,

493
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,200
but it's on shuffle. Like if I, it'll come up through my iTunes and it actually means much

494
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,960
more to me today than it did when I was 17 or 16 or whatever age I was when it first came out,

495
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:01,560
when I first listened to it, it really speaks to me more as like a struggle of like the grandiosity

496
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:08,760
that we experience as we get older and experience success more. And it's like, I was really moved by

497
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,680
it actually in a way that, and I guess maybe that's something about music in general that's just

498
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:19,240
very special. It can mean totally different things, not just to different people, which is

499
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,560
I think a bit more obvious, but to the same individual at different points in their life.

500
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:30,440
Absolutely. Absolutely. It's the poetic nature of it that allows, it's like if you,

501
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,200
it's harder for that to happen when you see a movie. A movie is more face value.

502
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,640
That's right. It takes some of the imagination away.

503
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:48,600
Whereas books and music, the reader or the listener is making the mental images that you

504
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:55,400
associate with it. You may be nudged in a direction by the artist, but the story that you make up is

505
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:02,280
your story. Yep. And that can change over time. I've become more cognizant of this in the past

506
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,640
year, especially when I hear a song that I haven't heard in five years, 10 years. I'm on a huge chili

507
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,080
pepper's kick right now. I keep forwarding you songs. I'm like, dude, this is unbelievable.

508
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,520
I remember once I sent you in and I was like, what is the world record for most times listening

509
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,400
to this song? I don't even remember which song it was, but it was on, I don't remember which album

510
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,080
it was. It was on Californication, but you were like, dude, how many times did you listen to that

511
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,880
song? I'm like, I think I've done 53 straight without stop. 14 years later, it means something

512
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,200
a little different or a lot different. Yeah, that's great. So the first time I met them,

513
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,520
I went with Adam Harvitz from the BC boys. We went to a rehearsal. I remember it was on Sunset.

514
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:52,520
They were signed to EMI at the time. It was in a place on the South side of Sunset Boulevard.

515
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:00,680
I think it was like an EMI rehearsal studio and the vibe was not good and it didn't have anything

516
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:09,480
to do with the music. It was just the energy between the guys in the band was something I

517
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:19,000
didn't understand. It just felt like I don't really want to be in this room. It was like a dark energy

518
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,880
and I ended up not working with them. Then I didn't end up working with them until two

519
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,960
albums later when I met with them again, it was like they were different people. It turns out,

520
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,080
was this part of through their addiction cycle? Yeah. So the first time I met them,

521
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,440
there were a lot of drugs involved. Now I've not done drugs and I hadn't really been around a lot

522
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,960
of people who do a lot of drugs. So I didn't really know even what it was, but you could feel

523
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:54,760
this sort of lack of trust in the room between the members that didn't feel, it didn't feel healthy.

524
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,040
Again, not knowing what it was, it just felt like whatever's happening here is not for me.

525
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,640
Then again, I met them maybe four or five years later and it was different. Everything was

526
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,560
different. Then we made Blood Sugar Sex Magic. It was the first album we made together.

527
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,200
Okay. So that was 91. I remember that pretty well. That had to be 91.

528
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,160
Yeah. So then I probably met them in 1888 Algaz before that.

529
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,440
So yeah, that makes sense. So Mother's Milk would have come out just after you guys met.

530
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,960
I think I met with them for the album before Mother's Milk, I think. And then Mother's Milk,

531
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,880
which could be three years, 18 months, 18 months. What's your favorite Chili Peppers album?

532
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,600
No idea. I never listened back, so I don't know. Really? Yeah.

533
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,080
Because that's funny. A lot of times I'll text you and I'll be like, dude, this song,

534
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,920
and it's a song you produced and you're like, which one is that again? Yeah. I don't know songs

535
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:59,640
by title. That's awesome. And it's the effort that goes into making these things is so grueling.

536
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,360
And in the process of making it, I might hear this song a thousand times. And by the time it's

537
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:12,840
done and signed off, I'm good. It's like I've had my fill of that song. So I don't feel the need to

538
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,440
go back. And there's so much music to listen to. I'd rather listen to something that doesn't make

539
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,400
me think of the process of making it, but just feels like you listen to music and you have this

540
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,920
wonder. I like that experience too. And I don't have that for the things I worked on. Yeah. So

541
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,360
you like to eat the sausage, but you certainly don't want to see the sausage. You don't want to

542
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,800
eat the sausage you made. Not often. I mean, I think it's great sausage. I mean, I love the

543
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,080
music we make. I don't feel the need to listen to it. If I go to a coffee shop and a song that I

544
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:50,280
produced comes on, it's a good feeling. And I wondered, does time heal that? Now heal is the

545
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,160
wrong word. It makes it sound like there's some problem there, but does time change that? For

546
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,760
example, if you go back and listen to something you produced 30 years ago. No, if there was a reason

547
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,240
to listen to it, I'll listen to it, but I wouldn't choose. I wouldn't out of the vast catalog of music

548
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:12,040
available to me. I can't imagine choosing something that I worked on to listen to for fun. Which

549
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:18,520
artist of the last 20 years that you've had no formal relationship with, are you most impressed

550
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:26,360
by or artists? First thing that comes to mind is there's a D'Angelo album called Voodoo that

551
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,600
is pretty much of a perfect album for me. Usually when I listen to an album, even when I like it,

552
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,880
I think about what I would do differently. And that's an album when I hear and I just

553
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,960
wish I was in the room to watch because it's so beautiful. Tell me why.

554
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:52,520
It goes against so many of the things we come to expect in music. For one, D'Angelo's a really

555
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:59,560
great singer with a beautiful voice. So you'd expect that voice to be, and he's a solo artist,

556
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,120
so you expect his voice to be front and center and the star of the show. Whereas instead his

557
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:14,360
voice is almost buried and his performance is so understated that it almost sounds like he's

558
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:20,840
dreaming it as opposed to performing it. The first thing about it's interesting is it doesn't work the

559
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:29,560
way other R&B records work. That's the first one. The next one is usually records sound,

560
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:36,520
I'll say perfect. Everything is played as good as it could be played and put together in a way

561
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:46,680
that is seamless. Whereas this album purposely always sounds like it's on the verge of falling

562
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,640
apart and it makes it thrilling. And I hadn't really heard music like that before. It almost

563
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:03,160
sounds like musicians who aren't really playing together, but somehow it manages to hang together.

564
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,720
So it's just interesting. It doesn't sound like anything else. That's the first one that comes.

565
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,600
Now before we leave that example, who produced that? I think it might have been D'Angelo himself.

566
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:20,120
I'm not sure whose credit is the producer, but Questlove was involved. Questlove was the drummer

567
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:27,080
on the project and I'm sure it had a hand in it. Have you talked to anybody involved in that about

568
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,560
how deliberate that decision was and how they did it? A little bit. And I hope to do more. Actually

569
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,920
I started doing this podcast with Malcolm Gladwell called Broken Record. And one of the episodes I

570
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,520
want to do, which we have not yet recorded, is a deep dive into the Voodoo album, talking to as

571
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:51,000
many of the people who were involved and understand the story of it. Again, anytime there's an album

572
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,560
that stands alone, it's interesting to me. There's another album where we did record. I've recorded

573
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:08,360
three interviews so far relating to an album by a group called Love called Forever Changes,

574
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:15,240
which is one of my favorite albums. And it's another album where it doesn't sound like any

575
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:23,160
loves other albums and no other albums sound like it by anybody else. It's a real moment in time.

576
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:31,160
So that's exciting to me. So you're still basically a student. I mean, everything about you is all about learning.

577
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:37,080
You have to be. I love pro wrestling and there's a funny line that a pro wrestler once said that

578
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,080
you can't call yourself a professor unless you two are a student.

579
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,160
And he was talking about wrestling, but it applies to everything. Yeah, for sure.

580
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,200
So you're about to say something else. There's another album you were going to refer to, or

581
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,120
artist, I think. The question was music that you have not produced that you are enamored with. Yes.

582
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:06,920
A more recent one would have been James Blake's first album. Beautiful. Doesn't sound like anything

583
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:14,120
else. Very original. Really touches me. That's how many, got a blank on the time. Is that like 10 years ago?

584
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,320
Or less? Maybe less. Maybe eight. Yeah. But I'm not sure. I'm not good with time. I'm not good with time.

585
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah. So let's go back to the chili peppers for a moment, just because it was the foray into this. But

586
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,160
drugs are forever a huge part of rock and roll, right? It's sort of like,

587
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,760
I don't know that anybody's ever done the actuarial analysis on it, but when I was in high school,

588
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,880
and I really liked all kinds of music. And so as much as I loved what was happening currently,

589
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:55,720
Beastie Boys, et cetera, I mean, I loved Hendrix. I loved the doors. And I remember at the time,

590
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:03,960
maybe naively thinking like, why do these guys keep dying? I couldn't understand the self-harm

591
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,680
that was going on. I just didn't have enough of a sense. And I don't know that I have a sense today,

592
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,880
although it makes you wonder, right? Is there a pain that's leading to this incredible

593
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,040
creativity that's along the, there's the collateral damage along the way is the soothing that's coming

594
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:28,760
from the drug use? Or do you think it's less about that and more about the culture of I'm a rock star.

595
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,720
I'm supposed to be doing this. It's the first, it's self-medicating. People who make music tend

596
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:41,880
to be very sensitive. If you think of Kurt Cobain as a raw nerve, he's going through this world

597
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,080
feeling things that other people who have the same experiences don't feel. It's painful. He can

598
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:55,240
put it into the music. It's why he is who he is, but it makes it hard to survive in life. No one

599
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:03,320
around him is savvy enough to understand what's happening because people don't look at that stuff.

600
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:09,160
And this goes for most musicians, but it's always the case of the musician just trying to

601
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:15,160
find a way to exist in a world where they feel like they don't really fit.

602
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't think that's something I appreciated until kind of recently. I remember with my daughter

603
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,040
about a year ago, maybe two years ago, watching, and I can't believe I'm even blank on the name of

604
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,280
it, but it was the documentary about Michael Jackson's preparation for his last tour. Yes.

605
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,720
You know what I'm talking about? I've never seen it, but I know it's a great story.

606
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,560
I've never seen it, but I know what you're talking about.

607
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,720
Yes. I'm blank on the name, but we'll link to it in the show notes. I'm sure many folks have seen it.

608
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,800
So you're watching this documentary, and it's really funny when I was growing up, although

609
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:55,320
Michael Jackson, Madonna, Beastie Boys were epic. For whatever reason, I didn't gravitate towards

610
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:01,480
Michael Jackson. So even the hit songs like Beat It, Thriller, Billie Jean, I didn't dislike them,

611
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,760
but I don't even think I owned those albums. Put it that way. It just wasn't on my radar for some

612
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:14,200
reason. So I think Michael Jackson is not someone I paid any attention to. And even when all of the

613
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,760
scandals were going on and all of the, oh, how many times is he going to have plastic surgery,

614
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,360
and he's changing his skin color, and then of course all of the sexual abuse stuff, it just

615
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:32,120
wasn't something I was reading about or particularly a pain in his teeth. And I think I knew most of

616
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,520
the facts. I knew that he was part of a band when he was a boy and all of these other things,

617
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:42,840
but something struck me when watching that documentary, which is like, what a fragile soul.

618
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:52,120
And given what I understand now about pharmacology, to imagine that this is a guy who all he wanted

619
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:58,360
to numb and soothe was like to have this doctor come to his house and give him a general

620
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:05,880
anesthetic. I mean, propofol is not, I mean, that is not really what we would think of in the,

621
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,000
even the mainstream of recreational drugs. Again, notwithstanding all of his faults, right, which are

622
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,000
numerous enough that we could spend a whole day talking about them. But I also sort of realized,

623
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,720
wow, talk about a traumatized kid. Like here's a boy who never stopped being traumatized by

624
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:33,000
something. And ultimately that trauma, he passed that on to other kids. And again, you talk about

625
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,520
the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Flea has been pretty open about his struggles and Anthony and stuff. I

626
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,640
mean, these guys make unbelievable music, but you get the sense that there's like, there's something

627
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,960
tormenting these people. It almost makes you feel as a, like someone like me, who's just a consumer

628
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,240
of music, right? Like there's nothing I do at all to contribute to the world of music other than

629
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:04,680
consume it. You feel a little bit guilty in the sense that I'm profiting for lack of a better word

630
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,360
at the expense of someone's pain. Now, of course they're profiting too. Everybody's getting

631
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:13,160
something in this transaction. I'm not even talking about money, of course. Yes. You seem to

632
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,960
have picked up on this sooner. I mean, I remember reading something a long time ago. It was actually

633
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:24,840
before Mac Miller died that you, you really tried to help him when he relapsed. I'm guessing that's

634
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:33,320
not the first artist you had to try to help. No, it's as much of the part of the job as the music

635
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:43,240
part is helping a sensitive soul work through this life and this business where there are,

636
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:49,080
there are a lot of voices who again are more concerned with getting the next record out and

637
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:55,800
cashing in and less concerned with the health of the artist. A mutual friend of ours who shall

638
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,520
remain nameless until we're having dinner tonight and then I can rat him out. He said something to

639
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:06,600
me once about you that I thought was really interesting. He said, you know, Rick has a

640
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:14,280
superpower and I don't know where he got it from, but he has the ability to take really creative

641
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:21,800
people and somehow disarm them enough to, I'm paraphrasing, he said it much more eloquently,

642
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:28,200
but disarm them enough to do their best work creatively, but still do it within the confines

643
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,160
of a business structure that allows, you know, a product to be made. Like there's a balance between

644
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:41,640
the business and the art and you've managed to sort of create this environment that fosters both

645
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:48,920
optimally and it's not exactly true. My feeling has always been that if you get the art right,

646
01:03:49,720 --> 01:04:02,120
the commerce side of it works itself out. So maybe in that I can help an artist to refocus,

647
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:09,640
to just pay attention to the art instead of overthinking what comes next and what other

648
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,040
people are going to say about it or what their manager's going to think or what the label's going

649
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,680
to think or what a radio station might think or what's going to be the first single or any of those

650
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:28,120
thoughts which tend to lower the vibration of the entire project. So we try to get to this pure art

651
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:37,960
place and in doing so it benefits them in all areas, but there's very little thought of the business side.

652
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,760
I think what he meant and I'm probably not articulating it is exactly that,

653
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:49,880
but what you're doing ultimately, though it's not your primary aim, happens to be in service of also

654
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,720
making something amazing commercially. Like it's almost like... It happens. Yeah, it happens as a...

655
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:02,360
You haven't diluted that. You haven't reduced the ability to be successful. No, but it happens more

656
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,520
through the purity of it instead of through aiming at it. Yeah, I can totally imagine that,

657
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,480
right? It's sort of like meditation. If you're meditating with the goal of becoming the best

658
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,720
meditator, it's very hard to. If you're meditating with the objective of... I'm going to sit here for

659
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,560
the next 30 minutes and that's all I'm going to do. Yeah. At the end of that 30 minutes,

660
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:30,360
you've succeeded. Yeah. There is no more to it than that. So hip-hop in New York seemed

661
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:36,200
just like a different vibe from the hip-hop that came out of LA. And I don't know if part of it

662
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:41,480
was that they were just temporarily offset, but is it a surprise to you that Gangster Rap came out

663
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:47,240
of LA and not New York? Not really, because there's more of a gang culture in LA in real life.

664
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:54,760
So the Gangster Rap sprung out of the gang culture that really exists. There's some gang culture

665
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:02,040
in New York, but it was less. And I never really ran into it in my New York time.

666
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,320
So were you here in LA when NWA's first album came out in that summer of 1991?

667
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,920
Yeah, I went to visit them in the studio while they were making Straight Outta Compton.

668
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:18,760
Yeah. And what was your impression of not just the music, but what was feeding this beast and

669
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,280
where was this going to go and how was this going to change the industry?

670
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:28,680
I never think about any of those things. I knew that like when you said it felt like a

671
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:35,800
tectonic shift in music. That was my experience, just like as a fan, it got me excited about

672
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,480
hip-hop again. By that time, after doing the stuff that we had done at Def Jam and having left,

673
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:51,160
hip-hop was not so exciting to me for that window between after Public Enemy and before NWA.

674
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:58,680
There was this window of rap where I wasn't really paying so much attention. NWA got me

675
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,720
excited about hip-hop again. That's so interesting because through your lens,

676
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,760
you see, I never consider there to be a window between Public Enemy and NWA. Like when I think

677
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:16,200
about, I just think Public Enemy just like ran into the back of NWA. There were a few years in

678
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:21,240
between there. See, for me, it was just like Public Enemy was everything at that point.

679
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:31,240
Where's Chuck D from? He's from Long Island. I mean, he strikes me as like lyrically one of the

680
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:40,920
most cerebral, gifted hip-hop artists of all time. Brilliant guy. Yeah, I can't imagine. And how much

681
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:46,840
of an act is Flavor Flav? Like what is he like when the mic is off? Same. He's the same. Exactly

682
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:53,240
the same. He is a living cartoon character. That is comical. Yeah. See, that's the other thing about

683
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,640
fun. Fun to be around. Well, I was just gonna say, that's the thing about music that's sort of

684
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:02,200
interesting is these personalities have to coexist. Sometimes it's a miracle to me that

685
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:07,720
bands can actually stay together as long as they can. Many don't. You know, it's... Yeah,

686
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,520
there's a survivor bias that we might... Well, absolutely. Imagine, think of how often

687
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,920
marriages work. Right. And that's between two people. Now you have a marriage between four people,

688
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:25,560
often younger with substance abuse problems. It's hard for that to maintain. Yeah, I was joking

689
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,680
with my wife the other day. We were watching this movie on Motley Crue and... How is it,

690
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:35,480
by the way? I haven't seen it yet. I mean, it's okay. It depends. Like for me, it's awesome because

691
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,920
I love Motley Crue. And so even though the acting is not that great or anything like that,

692
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,720
it's like, and they're lip syncing all the songs. Like it was... I really enjoyed it because it's,

693
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,680
again, it's taking me back to my childhood. Like I'm... These were the songs that I was listening

694
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:57,320
to in my basement doing the workouts that defined my existence as an adolescent, right? Yeah. And

695
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,640
for my wife, like, you know, Motley Crue was not even on the radar, maybe recognized a couple of

696
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:09,960
songs off Dr. Feelgood, but nothing before that. And so we're watching this and I'm already knowing

697
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:15,000
what's happening, right? Like, so I know in 84, you know, like the accident and I know all of the

698
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,640
details. And at the end of the movie, she asks kind of a logical question, which is like,

699
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:29,400
how are these guys alive? Like, how do they not just die 17 lives earlier? To which I said,

700
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,280
my guess is there's just a strong selection bias in this. The only reason we know about

701
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:39,880
Motley Crue is that they didn't die. And there are probably 20 bands that could have been Motley

702
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:47,000
Crue, but they just... They died physically and or blew up relationship wise along the way. And so

703
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,720
you're sort of seeing the ones... The one survivor is the one that sticks around. It's sort of like in

704
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,840
football, right? Like half of being Tom Brady is not just being the greatest quarterback. It's like

705
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,960
not getting injured for that many years is sort of what allows you the... You earn the right to

706
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:12,200
play the game. So when did you fully internalize that your role was not about making music as much

707
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:20,920
as it was about curating a person's soul and helping them express this? Because I think the analogy you

708
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,320
gave with Kurt Cobain is great, right? That is a beautiful image of a totally raw nerve

709
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:33,160
that he's seeing the world in 4k color to what everybody else is seeing in black and white.

710
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Yes. And there's good to that, but there's also bad to that. Absolutely.

711
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:45,800
Did you realize that even when you were 20 years old? No. For me, it started when I was 33.

712
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:55,640
I got very depressed and I would say that I tend on the depressed side anyway, which is part of

713
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:02,120
where the sensitivity comes from to do what I do musically. But at 33, it was crippling.

714
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:13,880
Wasn't able to get out of bed. It took about two years for that to change. And I had a much

715
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:21,080
greater understanding of the artist's pain after that experience. Do you know what precipitated

716
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:31,320
that? Yes. It was a phone call with the person who took over the company that I was partnered with,

717
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:38,520
the major label. So I'd been in a good relationship with this company. The person who I had made the

718
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:45,960
deal with was politically forced out of the company after years. And this new person came in

719
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:54,920
and we had a phone call and he said several things that just sort of to anyone else, this phone call

720
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:00,680
would have been non-controversial. Okay. See you back in LA and we'll talk about it then.

721
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,480
So you got wounded, not because someone threw a spear deliberately at you?

722
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:16,760
No, no, no, not at all. I got wounded because I was so vulnerable, having never really dealt with any

723
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,520
controversy other than the one that I told you about earlier with the guy in the UK who was

724
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,840
not supporting our artists. So this was another situation like that, except this one was

725
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:37,160
personally to me instead of about the artist. This was just... And was this person saying something

726
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:41,640
to you like sort of off the cuff? Like... Off the cuff. You know, Rick, the way you did such and...

727
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,200
Do you remember what it even was? Yeah, I do. But it wouldn't help to... Yeah, yeah, yeah. It wouldn't help.

728
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,640
So it was something relatively minor that was critically... No, it had nothing to do with me.

729
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:59,160
He said, this is the guy... So the person just became the chairman of the most loved record company

730
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:05,800
in the world. It would be considered the top job in the music business. And he calls me and he said,

731
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:12,360
I just looked at your deal and I'm jealous. I don't really like it. When you come back,

732
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:19,560
we should talk about it. That was the whole call. So help me understand what... Sent me into a

733
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,960
tailspin. It's the first time... Because you were worried that now there's this business thing that

734
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,240
you don't want to have to think about and you have to go back and negotiate a deal or something like

735
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:34,760
that. Well, my parents, as I said earlier, were always very supportive of me. Then while still

736
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:42,680
going to college, we have this tremendous success with Def Jam. So there's maybe been a... From 33,

737
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:52,440
there's been a 12 year run of nothing but success. I mean, there's all kinds of little issues along

738
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:59,640
the way, natural regular stuff. But for the most part, I've led pretty much a charmed life until

739
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:09,720
I'm 33. And now this phone call, it just felt like a pin that burst the balloon. And honestly,

740
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,520
truthfully, I'm still not the person I was before that phone call. That's how

741
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:24,600
radical it affected... How radically it affected me. And I can tell you that it was... I know that it was

742
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:35,560
a tiny thing. I know that anyone else would have not even registered. And this thing that was

743
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:42,600
catastrophic in my world then led to a much better situation that would not have happened

744
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,560
had that not happened. So everything about it in retrospect was...

745
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:55,240
It only... Everything worked out for the best. Yet still, the person who I was before

746
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:04,840
was different. And it just somehow triggered some vulnerability in me that I'd never felt before.

747
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,280
It's so interesting. I didn't know this about you actually. This is amazing that this has never

748
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:16,840
come up before. This is profound. And what's interesting to me in trying to imagine what

749
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:22,600
possibly could have triggered that, the first thing is, well, was their economic insecurity.

750
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,920
But that strikes me as highly improbable because one, you'd already been successful and two,

751
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,560
you were never even motivated by the economics of it. It was the feeling of the rug being pulled

752
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,120
out from under me. Is it because you'd already been through something with Columbia where you

753
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,640
had seen that a big corporation can change their mind and that can jeopardize your music?

754
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:55,080
I think it was more... I always had the trust of the people I worked with, even if they didn't

755
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:04,600
like the choices I made, I always felt like these people have my back. They get me. And it was a

756
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:14,280
sense of not being seen. That's what it felt like. So you said for the next two years, you had a hard

757
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:22,120
time getting out of bed. Yes. So what did you do during that period of time? I went to... I probably

758
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:32,440
had two therapeutic treatments a day of different kinds. I would go to see

759
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:42,440
psychiatrists. I would go to see psychologists. I would do acupuncture. I would do herbal remedies.

760
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:51,480
I would do massage. I changed my diet to be one that would better support my... the brain chemicals.

761
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:58,440
I did everything that I could do short of taking drugs because I was a non-drug taker

762
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:06,920
until eventually I found a woman who was a psychiatrist who wrote prescriptions

763
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:13,960
but who was also a psychic. And I thought, well, if she's a psychic, I'll go see her because

764
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:20,040
I don't like doctors and I don't trust doctors, but a psychic, I could get behind that.

765
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:28,520
And I had another friend in the music business who had started taking Prozac. And he told me

766
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:34,760
the wonders of Prozac as it related to him. He said... Meaning the good or that it blunted him.

767
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:40,920
For him, he said, I will never not take this drug for the rest of my life. It changed my life.

768
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:48,440
Everything is better, which it still didn't feel like this is right for me,

769
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:56,840
but I'm really suffering. I'm doing everything I possibly can to feel better. Nothing's working.

770
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,720
I was doing... At that point, I was only doing guided meditations because I wasn't able to do

771
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:10,200
a self-directed meditation. But if I was being instructed, I could do that. And I would still

772
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,840
show up to work. Oh, so you were still able to sort of get through work at this time?

773
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,760
Windows. I remember engineers would come and bring me mixes and I'd be laying in bed and

774
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,120
they would play the music for me. And I would say what I would hear. So what broke that cycle?

775
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,120
Well, the psychic woman prescribed

776
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:36,520
Paxil. And I took it the first night. I did exactly what she said. I took it the first night

777
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:43,560
and it was the worst night of my life because she said, well, you'll take this. You're not going to

778
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,080
feel anything. It takes about six weeks to two months before you'll feel anything, but it has to

779
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,720
build up in your system. We'll see what happens. I took it the first night and went to sleep. I

780
01:18:53,720 --> 01:19:05,080
woke up an hour later and it felt like there was a race going on in my body. I felt tremendous

781
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:12,280
energy rushing through my body and it felt terrible. And I remember just wanting to be

782
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:20,920
able to make it to 8am to be able to call her. But like, I just hang on and suffer through this

783
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:27,080
feeling until 8am. And then I called and eventually got her and she said, okay, don't take that

784
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:33,240
anymore. So that was good, good advice. But then eventually started on this journey of looking for

785
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:40,680
the right antidepressant. And I tried many and it took a long time and every one of them made me sick

786
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:46,280
in different ways. Usually more often had to do with nauseousness. That first experience was

787
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:52,920
different than the others. All the others would just make me sick nauseous until I finally found

788
01:19:53,480 --> 01:20:03,080
the magic drug, which was called Remeron. And I took Remeron and again, so each of these drugs

789
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:08,200
I'm taking, knowing they don't start working for six weeks. And the first night I took Remeron,

790
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:13,560
I can remember the room. I can remember what was going on. I took the Remeron and a half hour later

791
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:21,560
it felt like all the light in the room turned to candlelight. And I felt like I was being cradled,

792
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:28,280
like, well, Remeron has some really great sleep properties. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. And

793
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:34,440
then what I didn't know, I've always had a weight problem in my whole life. Yeah. What I found

794
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:43,160
quickly was that on Remeron ended up gaining 60 pounds in three months, something like that,

795
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:49,560
a tremendous amount of weight, but it helped me get through that period. So you sort of had to

796
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,440
break that cycle. Yes. And part of that I think is at the risk of stating the obvious, it's

797
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,880
psychological. Like you have to get through the cycle to know you can get through the cycle to

798
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:03,560
know that you're okay. Yes. And the idea of getting off the drug, which I always wanted to do,

799
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:10,200
was really scary because now I'm finally feeling okay. How am I going to ever stop taking this

800
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:17,560
drug? But then I did stop taking the drug and was able to manage. And you're still impacted by this.

801
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,720
You still look back and see a different guy. Yes. 33 before that phone call. Absolutely.

802
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:29,240
What's better about Rick today than that Rick? More empathic.

803
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,880
You don't strike me as one who would have ever lacked empathy.

804
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,880
It's different than it was then. I would say before that I felt more like Superman

805
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,760
and I've never felt like Superman since.

806
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,800
Interesting. I can't say that that Superman feeling before was

807
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,320
rational or correct, but that's what it felt like.

808
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:04,280
You've worked with many artists who have died. Which one do you feel,

809
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:11,080
I don't want to say the saddest about because it's hard. I don't think you can compare it in that way,

810
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:20,920
but is there one artist where a piece of you died with them or you felt like how could this have

811
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,640
happened or where you were most caught off guard or was there, is there anything that just stood out?

812
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:31,000
Because I mean, as I look through the list of all the artists you've worked with, there are

813
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:38,360
some tombstones there. Yeah. I would say every one of them had a jarring effect in a different way

814
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:45,960
in the moment. Obviously the younger the artist is, the more surreal it feels like. The most recent

815
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:51,400
one was Mac Miller. That wasn't even a year ago. That was like last fall, wasn't it? Yeah. It just

816
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:58,200
seemed like impossible. It seemed impossible. And I can remember when Chris Cornell passed,

817
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:03,240
I couldn't believe it. Could not believe it. When was the last time you spoke with Chris before

818
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:09,560
he died? How? Probably within a year, I would say. Did you work with Chester as well? Yeah.

819
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:15,640
Produced three or four albums of Lincoln Park. So I can't even keep track. At this point,

820
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:20,840
it's easier for me to think of artists you haven't produced, but I couldn't believe it when,

821
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,280
I don't know why I would have any reason to believe or not believe. I don't know any of

822
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:29,400
these people, but when Chester died, that was really heartbreaking in a way that,

823
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:35,800
even in a way that I didn't feel heartbroken with Chris or with Kurt Cobain, even though that was

824
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:44,040
such a big deal. But I don't know why that one just, that was. And I think also from a personal

825
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:50,680
level, I remember being really rocked when Johnny Cash died, which doesn't make sense because he'd

826
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,080
been sick for a long time. Right. And he's the one guy who dies of some chronic disease,

827
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:01,960
like the rest of us schlebs. It really shocked me. Why do you think that was?

828
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,720
Well, I was talking to him on the phone every day and he had been getting better and better.

829
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,600
There's a, you know who Phil Maffetone is? Of course. Okay. So I sent Phil Maffetone to live

830
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:18,440
with Johnny for a while. And Phil helped you. Phil helped me a lot. Yeah. And after he helped me,

831
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,320
I sent him to see Johnny. And when Phil showed up at Johnny's house,

832
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:29,400
Johnny was in a wheelchair and blind and Phil got him to walk and to see

833
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:37,640
miraculously. So I got to see that happen. So I saw Johnny going from very sick to only getting

834
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:43,000
better and better and better. It was the setback when June died. That was terrible. And he, it

835
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,280
really, it was June died pretty close to his death. He didn't live much longer than

836
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:54,040
I want to say it was within the year. Yeah. I want to say I'm pretty sure it was within him.

837
01:24:55,080 --> 01:25:01,720
But we continued, he started recording every day after June died because that was his reason to be

838
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:07,640
alive. He wanted to, he said to me, he said, you have to keep me very busy because if you don't,

839
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:15,880
I can't do this. I can't, I can't continue. The movie Walk the Line with Joaquin Phoenix in it.

840
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,240
I love that movie. And again, I don't know how accurate it is. And you always run the risk when

841
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:24,520
you fall in love with these Hollywood movies that you're sort of, but there are parts of that that

842
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,920
you just know are true factually, just based on what you've read, including the loss of his brother

843
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,400
and the sort of jarring effect that had on him. And there's yet another example of

844
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:43,080
we love this guy. Like we love his music. And to me, it only got better as he got older,

845
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,840
like his, the gospel stuff's not nearly as interesting to me as the pain stuff.

846
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:57,640
And of course, that's why we love it. Like we love that this person can articulate something that is

847
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:03,000
so deep inside of us that we don't want to think about or talk about. And yet he can create a

848
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
scaffolding upon which we can write our own narrative and feel understood. But it comes

849
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:14,680
back to this thing of like, if only he couldn't have suffered so much. Like I can't help but

850
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:20,520
wonder how much of the pain of his childhood and the loss of his brother and the shame with his

851
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:27,960
father. And like, did any of that get fixed as he got older? You know, I just know it sort of makes

852
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:37,080
me sad. Well, it, some of it got his relationship to a change through his spirituality. He was a very

853
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:44,520
devout Christian and he found great solace in his religion. But then like from the time I met him,

854
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:50,840
What year did you meet him? I don't know years. Roughly like 10 years. Yeah. The last 10 years of

855
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,720
his life we worked together. What was the last time? Probably met him probably so 12, 12 years

856
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:01,320
before he died. We probably met the, was the last song he did. He did the cover for Nine Inch Nails

857
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:09,000
that was like, is that, that's gotta be one of the last songs? No, that was on the fourth album we

858
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,600
made six. Although you know what, literally five and six I think came out after he died,

859
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:19,160
but we had been working on those. Maybe that's why I feel like that was the last album or one of the

860
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,200
last times he did. That might've been the last one that came out while he was alive.

861
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:28,680
I feel like I remember reading at some point, like he didn't even talk to Trent about this,

862
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:34,840
right? He just, no. And that always amazes me. Like when I hear of one mega star doing a cover

863
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:39,880
of another mega star, like I've always assumed like there's this, hey, you call the guy up and

864
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,800
hey, I love your song. You might have to do a cover. No. And I remember you telling me once,

865
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,080
cause I think I asked you like this last year and you said, no, any artist can do anything for any

866
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,400
artist as long as they don't. And then you said something that amazed me, which was the key is

867
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,120
they can't change the words. Like if they produce it, if they, if they sing it exactly as the original

868
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,680
artist did it, they'll pay a royalty presumably, but they they're allowed to do it. Whether the

869
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:07,240
second artist rises. And I can't remember if you told me this or I read this, but originally Trent

870
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:13,000
was not psyched on it, right? Correct. And this changed when he heard it. It changed when he saw

871
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,320
the video. When he heard it, he wasn't that psyched. He wasn't. Okay. No, but when he saw the video,

872
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:27,480
he got it. I would put that in the, if I were going to have sort of a top 10 songs

873
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:34,120
that speak to life, I think that has to be, I don't know how that's not in it, right? Yeah.

874
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,320
It's, it's a beautiful song. It's a beautiful song. Where did you guys do that? Did you guys

875
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:46,120
do it here? We recorded at my house in, in town. Did you realize what was happening when you were

876
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:51,240
making that? Like what, did he come to you and share like, I want to do this and here's why or

877
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:58,200
how did it evolve? That one, we would pitch each other songs. I would send him CDs filled with

878
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:05,560
possible songs to try. And I remember putting it at the top of the list. It was the first one on the

879
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:11,960
first, on one of the CDs I sent. And when he called, he reacted to several other songs, but he didn't

880
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:17,400
react to that one. And then I remember on the next compilation I sent him, I sent it again

881
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:24,360
with the note. I really think this first song could be special. And he listened to it. I think

882
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,640
part of it also is I can't remember what I was sending him. If I was sending him the, the Nine

883
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,880
Inch Nails version, it would have been hard for him to hear that and know what it could be.

884
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,960
Do you know what I'm saying? It's like, if you know the Nine Inch Nails version,

885
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:44,280
it doesn't sound very much like the Johnny Cash version. And the funny thing is I loved the Nine

886
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:51,080
Inch Nails version. Loved it. Great. But I like his more. Yeah. And that I think again speaks to

887
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:57,560
aging. Well, it's context also. It's like when you're in your twenties and you're singing about

888
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:03,560
regret, it has a certain weight to it. Now, if you're 70 and you're singing about a life filled

889
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:09,080
with regret by 70, you're supposed to have figured it out. Looking back with regret is a

890
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:18,840
young man's game. So hearing Johnny sing these words is shocking. And there's a reality to it.

891
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:25,000
That's different or a gravity to it. That's different than when Trent sang it just due to

892
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,720
his eight has nothing to do with the individual pain they were feeling. It, it just has to do with

893
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:36,760
the age. It really does change the way you understand these words. Do you remember when

894
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,400
he called you after listening to it and finally saying like, I got it or I'm willing to give it

895
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:48,280
a try? Like what was it that that spoke to him about that or what did he hear in there? He just

896
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,440
agreed that if it was important to me, he'd be willing to try it. I see. But he wasn't really

897
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:58,280
attached to that. So when it was all said and done though, he loved it. Yeah. Do you have a sense of

898
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:03,160
what song he was most proud of or what two or three songs he was most proud of over his career?

899
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,920
I don't know over his career, but I know the stuff that we worked together,

900
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,680
there were a handful that he would remark that really meant a lot to him. One was

901
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:16,760
there's a Nick Cave song called the mercy seat. And that was on one of the albums we did. And I

902
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:22,440
remember him thinking that was very special and it is very special, but that was one that really

903
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:29,480
resonated with him. There was a Cheryl Crow song on one of the albums called redemption day. Yep.

904
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:34,360
And he said, I forgot about that. I remember him saying, I would give up all of the other songs

905
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:40,600
just for this song. When it was all said and done, what is Cheryl? What a Trent? What do they think

906
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:47,800
of this once he has put his hand on it? Are they moved by that? Are they, they Cheryl was definitely

907
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:55,480
moved. Bono was moved by Johnny's version of one. I think Don Henley really liked Johnny's Desperado.

908
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,040
Most of the ones where I've talked to the artists, they liked it.

909
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,560
You know, I have a huge picture of Johnny Cash in my office. I tried to send you a picture of it.

910
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,360
I don't know if it's fulsome and it's a sketch. So it's like, it's a sketch off the very famous

911
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:14,920
photo when he's on the stage and he's given the finger down, but it's, it's like this beautiful

912
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,320
sketch that I was able to find. I remember saying to my wife, I'm like, I gotta get this on a t-shirt.

913
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,720
And she's like, don't be an idiot. Like, why do you want that on a t-shirt? And I was like,

914
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,560
I don't know. It's just so awesome. Like rationalize all the reasons why. Like don't

915
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:31,880
you understand what he was saying? And you know, this is why he was in prison and this is what he

916
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,880
was saying. And it's like, she's, she just didn't want to hear it. She's like, all right, settle down

917
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,320
over there. I actually don't know if any of the things that you just said were actually true

918
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:47,320
because what he was thinking was this photographer is a pain in the ass. Oh, that's really what he was.

919
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,680
I'm totally sure. Yeah. Like I'm applying my own ridiculous filter of all of this.

920
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:56,040
But that's how, what we all do all the time. That's to your point, right? That's music.

921
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:01,240
I think you know this, but do you know my son thinks I'm Tom Morello?

922
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,120
You told me. It's funny.

923
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:11,240
It's really funny. So the reason this all came up because there is an awesome video of

924
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:18,600
Bruce Springsteen and Tom Morello doing the ghost of Tom Joad circa 2009 Madison Square Garden.

925
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,960
So midst of the recession or, you know, like beginning of the recession, I guess in some ways.

926
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,240
And I feel like Tom Morello is in like a blue shirt or blue hat or something. And I like with

927
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,680
my daughter and we're like sitting there and we're watching this and we're just watching it over and

928
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:38,680
over again because, you know, my daughter is so musical and I love her getting to see these things.

929
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,400
And my son, who's like four at the time, comes in and he's like,

930
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,680
Daddy, I didn't know you could play the guitar. And I was like, what is he talking about? I can't,

931
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:52,360
you know, Reese, I can't play anything. He's like, no, no, no, that's you're playing the guitar.

932
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,400
And I was like, oh, no, no, that's not me. That's a, his name's Tom Morello.

933
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:00,120
You know, I started trying to explain to him, he's not having any of it. He's really like

934
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:06,120
perplexed by the fact that like all these years, Olivia has been playing the drums and you play

935
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:12,120
the guitar and you've never played the guitar for us. And I'm like, okay, Reese, sit on my lap.

936
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:17,880
We're going to watch this. He looks a little like me, but we're really different. But for whatever

937
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:23,400
reason, on that night, on that stage, he really does. I really do look like him. And this took

938
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:29,960
like a month of me having to show him this video to realize like that's actually not daddy. And

939
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:36,840
it's so awesome. Amazing. Yeah. Rage is another one of those bands. Like how,

940
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:46,520
how did they do that? And how did you see your role in curating is the wrong word, like fostering or

941
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:53,480
providing the creative space to do what they're doing. I mean, talk about hyper intelligence,

942
01:34:53,480 --> 01:35:00,200
anger, all of these things. I mean, when you first came into contact with them, and I don't

943
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:05,800
even know enough about the history of the band, like Zach and Tom were, what were they doing

944
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:12,200
before? How did they merge? Tom was in a band that was signed to Geffen that had, I think they put

945
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:18,520
out a record that kind of came and went. So of the guys in the band, Tom was the most experienced.

946
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:29,880
And Timmy and Zach grew up together. I can't remember exactly how they found each other,

947
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:35,480
but the four magic guys ended up finding each other. And when did you get involved? Because they

948
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,960
sort of. I got involved later. I mean, I knew them. I went to see them. I went to see them play

949
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:47,000
at the place called Coconut Teaser on Sunset Boulevard before their first album came out.

950
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,960
So this is late 80s at this point, maybe early 90s. I don't know. And there were maybe

951
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:59,400
40 people there. That was the first time I saw it. And did you at the time think this is?

952
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:07,240
I thought it was good, but it was not a great way to see them. It was not a good place to see a show.

953
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,720
It was hard to hear it. It was hard to hear what the music was actually doing. It just seemed kind

954
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:19,080
of like a din. And Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction was the person who recommended I go

955
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:25,960
see them. He loved them. And I went to see them. And it was, again, it was not the greatest show,

956
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:31,320
that show that I saw. It probably was, but there's so many things that go into what makes

957
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:38,760
something work. And it could have even had to do with my own emotional state at the time. There's

958
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,480
so much goes into it. I'm really careful with the way I, when people send me new music to listen to,

959
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,360
it can take me a long time to listen to it because I have to be in the right frame of mind

960
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:58,040
to be able to be present and open and feeling well enough to not let what's going on inside of me

961
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:05,480
affect the music that I'm listening to. It's not like I could just turn it on all the time. So it

962
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,960
may have been me. It may have been the fact that the sound was bad in the room, but my first

963
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:14,200
experience of it was it was interesting, but I didn't really understand what it was.

964
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,800
And then they made either two or three albums. And then they asked me to make,

965
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,240
they wanted to do an album of covers. They wanted to do a live album and an album of covers. And we

966
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:37,560
did both of those things. We did a live from the Olympic auditorium and the album of covers, which

967
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:45,160
has the cover says R-A-G-E kind of like the Gary Indiana love poster, except says rage. Yeah.

968
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:51,080
Yeah. Robert Indiana. I'm sorry. Gary Indiana's place. One of the things that happens when you

969
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:57,480
start to digitalize your music collection is I've started to forget what album covers look like.

970
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:03,400
And it sounds crazy, but one of the artifacts of being a kid making mixed tapes is you knew the

971
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:09,800
name of every single song all the time. Cause you were writing them out. And back then you had

972
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:14,040
albums and you had lyric jackets. And so you knew the words to every song and the name of

973
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:18,520
every song in the album. And you knew the cover and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, these days,

974
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:23,960
it's actually the exception when I can remember, like again, going back to the BC boys, like,

975
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,960
I remember exactly what the cover of Paul's boutique looked like. I remember everything

976
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,800
about the jacket. Remember it was that crazy color, like out of control. Like, I don't know

977
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:39,720
how they packed it all into that CD. Right. And of course, I mean the picture I used to sketch,

978
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:44,680
I would sit there in eighth grade sketching out the airplane on licensed ill and getting in trouble

979
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,720
for not paying attention in class. Like I just, you know, and I feel bad that we don't do that

980
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:53,560
anymore. Like, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't care that kids don't get that experience anymore,

981
01:38:53,560 --> 01:39:00,520
but there really is something so cool about the anticipation of a new album and physically going

982
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:06,600
there, taking your lawn cutting money to buy said album, to bring it home, to listen. And

983
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,840
yeah, I mean, I know, I know I just sound like an old guy, like lamenting the past or something,

984
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:19,000
but it's a give and take. I mean, it's definitely the experience of getting new music is less

985
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:26,360
special than it was. But now you can listen to anything you want, anytime you want. There's no

986
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:31,160
friction between you and the music, which as a fan of music, that's really great too.

987
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:38,760
Is it different today? So I keep trying to, you know, with my daughter, again, we listen to so

988
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:45,800
much music and we, I love to talk about this stuff with her. And, but I also realized that, for

989
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:52,040
example, like Zeppelin is something that we are really, really obsessed with. And her drum teacher,

990
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:58,120
who's an awesome guy, huge fan of John Bonham. And, you know, we're talking about like, you know,

991
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:02,120
what parts of this could she start to learn to play and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I,

992
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,080
I don't know why, but it only occurred to me a couple of years ago that, you know, Zeppelin

993
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:14,440
were only around for 10 years. Like, whereas when I was a kid, like they were around forever.

994
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:17,560
Because by the time I got into them, they were already, you know, Bonham had already died in

995
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:23,720
1980. So I wasn't following them when they were alive. But that was my first, first CD when I,

996
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:31,000
I remember in 19, the summer of 91, when I bought a CD player, I bought the Zeppelin box set,

997
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,640
which was a five disc set. It cost a hundred bucks, like staggering sum of money.

998
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,920
It's really good though.

999
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:46,440
Oh my God. So, so first CD I buy is this five disc Zeppelin box set. The next one I buy is Rush

1000
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:53,160
Chronicles. I mean, like only going with the best of the best. Is it a survivor bias again, when we

1001
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:57,480
look back at the seventies and think of the great music of the seventies or the great music of the

1002
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:03,000
eighties or the nineties for that matter. Whereas today I just think like, I can't tell the noise

1003
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,040
from the, like, I don't know what is it that my daughter listens to today that will mean as much

1004
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:14,200
to her in her mid forties as the music we're talking about does today. Like, is it going to

1005
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:21,800
be the same or has this frictionless system that you've described changed the way she will list?

1006
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:27,640
Like, will she look at Taylor Swift in 35 years, the way I look at the Beastie Boys?

1007
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:33,240
She might. It's hard to know. It's impossible to know. And there is an argument that the music in

1008
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:40,280
the sixties and seventies was probably the best music ever made. Because of the barriers to make

1009
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:45,800
it and get it to feel like you just concentrated more combination of all those things. And the fact

1010
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:52,120
that the technology was such that unless you were really good, you didn't even get to make a record.

1011
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:58,680
Yeah. Yeah. Just a pure selection bias. So now it's much easier to make. Anybody can make a record.

1012
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:04,920
Anybody can make anything now, which is great. But you just lowered the signal to noise ratio.

1013
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,640
Exactly. That is my intuition as well. The signal to noise ratio has changed.

1014
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:18,200
The barrier to listening has gone away. I love her telling me stuff that she's hearing that I

1015
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:23,880
would have never heard otherwise and trying to think like, will this song be relevant in five

1016
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:30,520
years, let alone 35 years. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to know. It's hard to know, even if we look back

1017
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:36,680
at music from the sixties or seventies, and if you look at the things that really were popular then,

1018
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:43,880
then some of them we still talk about and others that were equally popular then we don't talk about

1019
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:51,080
anymore. So it really does. There's so, there's so much to it. It's hard to know why we're

1020
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:58,120
impossible to predict why. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. You know, earlier you talked about the impact that

1021
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:03,400
Laird has had on you in terms of introducing a new dimension to your life, which is the dimension of

1022
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:10,920
physicality. So we go back to this period of your life when you were in the throes of depression.

1023
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,840
Remeron comes along and gives you some hope in the process. You gained 60 pounds.

1024
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:23,480
Remind me at your peak, what was your weight? The heaviest I got was 318 pounds.

1025
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:31,720
And if I recall it was really Phil Maffetone or was it Barry Sears or Phil Maffetone? One of those

1026
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:37,560
guys was kind of the first guy that got you to make dietary changes and exercise changes

1027
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:45,640
that began the process of, well, Phil was the first to do that, but I will say my whole life

1028
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:55,160
fighting weight issues was part of my world and I would do everything I could to try to lose weight.

1029
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:03,240
From the time I was a child, my mom was obese. So she had a stigma against weight issues because

1030
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:08,920
she had it. And it's so funny how there are some people who are overweight and they think, oh,

1031
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,840
everybody who's overweight is beautiful. And there are some people who are overweight and they think,

1032
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:19,800
I don't like fat people because it's just their experience of the world. So my mom was one of the

1033
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:25,640
people who did not like fat people who was fat. So how did that impact you if you were chubby as

1034
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:35,240
a kid? Well, I always felt sort of ashamed of my weight and her mom, my grandmother, was very hard

1035
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:40,920
on my mom about her weight. So it was sort of this generational shame. Generational shame.

1036
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:46,360
In college, were you trying different diets? What were you doing to?

1037
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:51,800
Yeah. Even before college, I can remember as a kid going to Weight Watchers, as a little kid.

1038
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:56,840
So I tried many different things over the years and for whatever reason, nothing really worked.

1039
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,680
And then at the time that I became my heaviest, I was vegan and I was vegan for 20 something years,

1040
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:12,040
thinking I was eating the healthiest diet I possibly could. And I just kept gaining weight.

1041
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:18,520
Was your foray into veganism, like was it an ethical issue as well with killing meat or with

1042
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:23,640
killing animals? Or was it mostly through the lens of this will be the best way to manage my weight?

1043
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:28,120
Mostly with the eyes of health. Although there's the compassion side too.

1044
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:34,920
But I would say the primary goal was to take care of myself and be healthy.

1045
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,600
How old were you roughly when you reached nearly 320 pounds?

1046
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,760
In my 40s, somewhere in my 40s.

1047
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,440
And it's sort of one of those things, right? Where you think,

1048
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:53,480
to a lesser extent, but I certainly remember when I was finally like at my absolute heaviest.

1049
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,720
And I look back at pictures and things like that.

1050
01:45:56,200 --> 01:46:00,200
It's not like there's a day that you wake up and you're at that weight.

1051
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,320
I mean, it's been going on incrementally, incrementally, incrementally.

1052
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:10,600
And I look at pictures over this span of probably five, six years.

1053
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,880
And I'm like, I wonder what I was thinking at that moment.

1054
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,880
Like clearly I realized I was much heavier than I ought to have been.

1055
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:22,920
What was your aha moment, which was like, I have to do something different.

1056
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,480
Well, I was always looking for something different to do.

1057
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,960
And my first aha moment was Phil Maffetone.

1058
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:35,160
I read, there was a book by a guy named Stu Middleman who ran a thousand miles in 11 days.

1059
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:41,080
And I'm thinking, I don't know how someone can run a thousand miles in 11 days when I can't walk

1060
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:44,440
to the corner without feeling like I'm going to pass out.

1061
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,160
How is this? It just seemed like so unrealistic.

1062
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,560
It's like, what does he know that I don't know?

1063
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:57,320
And I read his book and somewhere in the middle of the book he talks about, and then I met this guy,

1064
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:59,240
Phil Maffetone, and he changed my life.

1065
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:01,880
And I started to do training the way that Phil recommended.

1066
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:07,000
So I researched and this was early days of online for me.

1067
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,520
I don't even think I had a computer yet.

1068
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,160
It might've been web TV, something like that.

1069
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:15,400
But I somehow found a contact for Phil Maffetone and I sent him an email.

1070
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:16,600
And where was he at this time?

1071
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,200
Like Arizona, Florida.

1072
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:26,440
And I asked if I could become a patient and he said he was giving up his medical practice

1073
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,760
and wasn't taking any new patients and he stopped being a doctor.

1074
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,600
He didn't know who I was at all.

1075
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:39,400
And he mentioned in the email that he was giving up his medical practice to become a songwriter.

1076
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,560
You couldn't make that up.

1077
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,920
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

1078
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,440
And I sent a message and I said, well,

1079
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,280
I got a deal for you.

1080
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:55,160
Yeah, I'm involved with songwriters and maybe you can help me with my health and I can help

1081
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:56,840
you with the songwriting as best I can.

1082
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,160
And he was open to that.

1083
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:01,560
So the first time we met was in New York city.

1084
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,400
He was going to be in New York or something else.

1085
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,720
And I was going to New York or something else.

1086
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:10,280
And we happened to work out the timing where we could meet and he treated me in a hotel room.

1087
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,520
And we became friends.

1088
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:16,040
I started doing, he would recommend programs for me to do.

1089
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:16,840
And eventually.

1090
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:20,760
And how much of it was nutrition related and exercise related?

1091
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,560
It was both of them.

1092
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:24,120
And what were sort of those first steps that were being made?

1093
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:24,840
You recall?

1094
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:30,440
Well, I was still a vegan at the time and it was hard and he was frustrated clearly

1095
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,240
by me maintaining my veganism, but he had me cut out all carbs.

1096
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,080
Carbohydrate restriction is very challenging with vegans.

1097
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,400
It's not as challenging if you're a vegetarian.

1098
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:41,960
Absolutely.

1099
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,400
But when you're vegan, it becomes.

1100
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,920
A lot of soy.

1101
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:50,440
Well, and you just have to sort of like embrace a lot of plant fats in which are

1102
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,320
by themselves, not, I mean, no fat by itself is particularly palatable, but.

1103
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:02,120
So you're going through this and when was the first kind of glimmer of.

1104
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,080
He also had me get a heart rate monitor and had me start

1105
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:13,240
walking at my target heart rate for maybe the first 10 minutes and working my way up to eventually.

1106
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,360
And do you remember at the time what your maximum heart rate was or at what

1107
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,040
heart rate you would begin to feel gassed?

1108
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,440
Well, my heart rate would immediately go over my target immediately.

1109
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:25,160
Yeah.

1110
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,360
Just walk into the bathroom.

1111
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:26,840
Yeah.

1112
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:33,640
So it took time to kind of train myself down, even just to be able to go for a

1113
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:35,640
long walk in those days on a treadmill.

1114
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,960
Cause the place I lived was not so great to walk outside.

1115
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,240
I would do walk on the treadmill.

1116
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,960
And at first it was snail space walk.

1117
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,640
And then it was able to get faster and faster and faster and still be in that target zone.

1118
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,840
Eventually Phil ended up coming and living in my house with me for a couple of years.

1119
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,720
He came out here to LA.

1120
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,220
Yeah.

1121
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,360
Then he started having me doing stairs and I lived in a house that had one,

1122
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,080
two, three, it was a three flight.

1123
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:08,360
You could put together three flights and he would have me walk up the three flights and

1124
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,160
walk down three flights, but always watching the heart rate so that.

1125
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,600
And what was your target zone back then?

1126
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:17,880
I mean, Phil is a pretty big proponent of long, slow zone too.

1127
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,360
Yeah.

1128
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:18,840
Yeah.

1129
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:26,440
So it's probably, I want to say it was one 56 maybe was the target originally.

1130
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,240
Oh, that high.

1131
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:28,840
Interesting.

1132
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,080
Okay.

1133
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,040
Based on my age, that's what it was.

1134
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:35,800
When did you start to include animal products in your diet?

1135
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:42,600
Well, he convinced me to add fish and eggs, which were two things that I never ate.

1136
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,120
Even when I was a meat eater, I never ate fish and I never ate eggs.

1137
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:46,840
Never liked them.

1138
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:52,440
And he said, those would be the best things for you to start on and don't think of them as food.

1139
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:55,880
Think of it as medicine and you need this medicine.

1140
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,560
We find ways to mask it.

1141
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:02,600
So we do like a blueberry shake with three whole eggs in it.

1142
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:12,120
And I eventually was able to find one or two maybe sea bass and halibut were the only mildest white fish.

1143
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:16,520
To this day, those are the only fish that, and even now I don't even know if I'll eat sea bass anymore.

1144
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,840
Pretty much just eat halibut just because it's so.

1145
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,960
You don't eat salmon?

1146
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,400
No, it's too fishy.

1147
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:25,000
I'm going to make you a salmon that you'll eat.

1148
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,120
I promise you.

1149
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:32,280
I take pride in making salmon that most people don't even recognize who don't like fish.

1150
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:36,680
So that my highest point, my highest accomplishment in my life, certainly top three,

1151
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:40,520
is getting my sister to not just eat the salmon that I made, but love it.

1152
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:41,000
Wow, that's great.

1153
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,080
My sister is, she's always going to pick you eat her as a kid and like just wouldn't eat fish

1154
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,680
if her life depended on it.

1155
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:54,360
And a couple of years ago, her and her husband and kids were over at our place and I was making

1156
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,320
salmon and I was making something else for her because I knew she wasn't going to eat the salmon.

1157
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,760
She tried it and she was like, this is unbelievable and I couldn't believe it.

1158
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,000
The irony of this course, I learned how to do this from my dad.

1159
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,120
So she grew up with my dad making that salmon, but she would never try it.

1160
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:06,840
Amazing.

1161
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,120
If I'd thought of this, I would have brought some salmon up tonight and made it tonight.

1162
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:12,120
We're going to have a feast tonight.

1163
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:12,680
Moody Ells.

1164
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,120
She's.

1165
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:16,680
There's a reason I didn't have lunch today.

1166
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,640
Oh my God.

1167
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,040
Me neither.

1168
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,880
And that's unusual for me.

1169
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:22,120
I usually, I mean, I intermittent fast, but.

1170
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,200
Yeah, you don't, you skip the first meal.

1171
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,920
So you introduce the eggs, you introduce the fish.

1172
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,920
You're now doing the exercise.

1173
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:33,560
What is the pace with which that weight is coming off?

1174
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,520
It's not.

1175
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:39,240
I would say over the two years of doing everything Phil said with him watching me do it.

1176
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:40,120
Yeah.

1177
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,640
I maybe lost five pounds.

1178
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,200
Interesting.

1179
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:44,520
Yes.

1180
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:48,840
And he's, and he was befuddled and he said, I see what you're doing.

1181
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,160
I watch it every day.

1182
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,240
I watch everything you eat.

1183
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:58,760
99 out of a hundred people who are doing what you're doing, all the weight would fall off.

1184
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,360
Something else is going on.

1185
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:04,760
I would love to go back in time and look at your blood work from that era.

1186
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:09,000
I have a hypothesis about patients in your situation.

1187
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,840
I've seen four or five people where that has been the case.

1188
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:18,840
So that's probably more than 1% by the way, in my experience.

1189
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:24,280
It's so interesting because I think I didn't have the luxury of being able to watch those

1190
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,680
patients as closely as Phil is watching you.

1191
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:32,120
But I tell you, I was a hundred percent convinced that they were also doing everything.

1192
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:36,520
It didn't even cross my mind that they're not doing it or they're lying to me.

1193
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:36,680
Of course.

1194
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,040
I knew that they were doing it.

1195
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,080
And I know, and I would trust anyone by what they say because I know

1196
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,480
I'm a disciplined person.

1197
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,240
I just had bad information.

1198
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:49,960
And now I finally had good information from Phil, but I wasn't willing to fully embrace it

1199
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:52,680
because in my head, I'm a vegan.

1200
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:55,480
I'm eating fish and eggs as medicine.

1201
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,200
But you hadn't really been able to give up the carbohydrates.

1202
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,240
And I'm still a vegan.

1203
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,000
No, but I gave up carbohydrates.

1204
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,760
So what do you think?

1205
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,680
That's pretty amazing by the way, that you could stick to something for two years,

1206
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:07,880
losing five pounds.

1207
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,720
You've gone from 318 to 313.

1208
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,080
Well, it was easy because Phil was there.

1209
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,640
So it was like-

1210
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:13,960
You must have been feeling better though.

1211
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,560
I felt a million times better and it changed my whole life.

1212
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,800
He also changed my circadian rhythm.

1213
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,040
I used to work all night and sleep all day.

1214
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,400
He got me to change to normal hours.

1215
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:31,240
He changed a lot of stuff and my vitality changed.

1216
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,280
I definitely got healthier, felt better.

1217
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,560
I was just still big.

1218
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,560
So what was the next step?

1219
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,120
The next step.

1220
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:47,560
Then he started having me add more animal protein through other masked ways.

1221
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:52,040
The first one was we would make this vegetarian chili, which didn't have beans,

1222
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,760
but we would try to grind turkey and mix it in.

1223
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:03,400
So it would still be like vegan chili, but it would sneak in the protein that he wanted me to add.

1224
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:06,360
And at this point, I was vegan for six months.

1225
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:07,240
I did an experiment.

1226
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,840
And in just six months of giving up all animal product, when I went back to eating,

1227
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,200
and this was a planned six months.

1228
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,520
So I was like, I'm going to do this from January 1st to June 30th.

1229
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:21,320
And I remember on July 1st, when I went to the steakhouse to get the biggest steak I could eat,

1230
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,440
one, I couldn't finish it and two, it tasted disgusting to me.

1231
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:27,720
I had really in just six months lost my taste for meat.

1232
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:31,080
I assume for you, it was even more profound.

1233
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,120
It was impossible.

1234
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:33,480
Impossible.

1235
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:38,360
Again, it was always these masked foods for a while.

1236
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:44,360
And then it was, I think red meat was the last thing to go back in, which was,

1237
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:50,520
it was my birthday and me and Muriel had gone out to a restaurant that makes great steak.

1238
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:54,040
Although that was not something that I would, I would usually go there and eat fish.

1239
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:55,080
And we both ordered fish.

1240
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,520
She was vegetarian.

1241
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:01,960
And the plan was we would go and we would order a normal dinner, but we would also order a steak.

1242
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,640
So that if you want, you could have one piece of it.

1243
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,680
Yeah, which is what we did.

1244
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,920
We ate one bite and it was, it felt like we were eating human flesh.

1245
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,880
It was disgusting.

1246
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,160
Mm-hmm.

1247
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:21,960
And we did that every maybe two weeks for, I would say it would have ended up being maybe

1248
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:27,160
four times where we would get through a couple of bites of meat.

1249
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:32,360
And then by around the fifth time back, we just ordered steak.

1250
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:37,080
It took adding a little more, adding a little more, adding a little more.

1251
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,800
It's a bit of a tangent, but two nights ago, I made a venison stew.

1252
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:46,360
And this is from venison that I had shot with my bow and arrow hunting,

1253
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:48,760
which I've become obsessed with, by the way.

1254
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,440
So we'll have to talk about this over dinner tonight.

1255
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:57,480
I'm going to get you onto this incredible wild venison that is like nothing I've ever consumed.

1256
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,720
But whatever two days ago, I'm making the stew.

1257
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:04,840
I just happened to like, I can't, like I've got so much meat in the freezer that I brought back,

1258
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,680
but I can't always tell what's in the bag.

1259
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:07,960
So they're in these huge Ziploc bags.

1260
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:11,400
So I'll just take one bag out and thaw it and that becomes the stew.

1261
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,600
Well, I didn't do a great job of packaging this,

1262
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,000
where I didn't do a great job of thinking about it because

1263
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,720
it had like three hearts in there and kidneys, which is fine because I'm going to eat the organs.

1264
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:24,440
But I was like, oh, I didn't want to eat them all at once.

1265
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,600
So, you know, I thawed these things out.

1266
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,760
So I'm preparing it and I'm like, my first thought is, oh, I'm going to wait till

1267
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:33,240
like the kids get home so I can show them how to dissect the heart.

1268
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:36,680
Because the deer's heart looks just like a human heart.

1269
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:39,000
Like it is the organ that is identical.

1270
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,160
Like their kidneys are much smaller.

1271
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:42,440
Their livers look a little bit.

1272
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,720
Their livers are similar.

1273
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,360
Spleen's a bit bigger, but their heart is a human heart.

1274
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:47,800
Like it's indistinguishable.

1275
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:51,240
So then I'm like, eh, maybe that's not a good idea.

1276
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:51,640
I don't know.

1277
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,400
That might be one bit too far.

1278
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:57,320
So I'm just going through the heart and chopping it up to put it in the stew.

1279
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:01,960
And it kind of like it comes over me.

1280
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:09,000
I'm like, God, this is like, this is a little weird because the other times I'd eaten deer heart,

1281
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,880
it was in the field where it was fresh.

1282
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,880
And this reminded me much more of an anatomy class because it had come out of a freezer.

1283
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,280
And even though it didn't smell like the chlorophyll laden hearts that you dissected

1284
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:26,680
in anatomy class, it was firm in a way that wasn't natural.

1285
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:30,200
And so it made the stew and I didn't tell anybody what was in it.

1286
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,360
I didn't tell, I told my wife, I said, just so you know,

1287
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,520
you're eating a bunch of heart and kidneys and stuff tonight.

1288
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,280
Everybody loved it.

1289
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:39,160
They were like, dad, this is better than any stew you've ever made

1290
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:42,200
because I always make venison stew, but I'm usually using more muscle meat.

1291
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,320
So they loved it.

1292
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:44,200
It was a huge hit.

1293
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:52,920
And it occurred to me, it sort of made me think, it's upsetting to me to think that I could have

1294
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,320
eaten that on some level because doesn't this mean I could eat a human?

1295
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:59,720
If I was a cannibal, that could have been a human heart that I would have dissected.

1296
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:06,040
It just weirded me out in a way that I don't really know what to think about, actually.

1297
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,680
But I was thinking about it today for some reason, because I don't know why I was carrying

1298
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:12,680
like trash out and something made me think that like, I must have been some leftovers or something.

1299
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:18,440
I was like, God, that is so weird that I just like, my family just ate three hearts and

1300
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,720
three kidneys in the last couple of days.

1301
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:25,320
And of course, on the one hand, you realize like that's actually the healthiest meat in the animal

1302
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:31,400
is the organs. And that's, you know, when you look at our carnivorous ancestors, they were only

1303
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:35,880
eating those meats. They were actually giving the muscle meat to their dogs and to things like that.

1304
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:39,320
They were going for these nutrient dense organs that were incredible,

1305
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:45,480
but everything becomes acquired. And even that this is my first time putting a heart into a stew,

1306
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:49,240
because other times I'd fried it, but you're taking different cuts to it. And I was like,

1307
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:54,040
the valve, I don't want to eat the valve, you know, I got to cut that part out and stuff like that.

1308
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:57,800
The whole and the atria are not particularly interesting. I mean, it's all about the ventricles.

1309
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:03,400
So I can only imagine and I'm someone who's pretty used to eating meat. So I, it's, yeah,

1310
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:09,000
it's amazing to think what you would have thought. Yes. Eating a piece of steak and how

1311
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,040
disgusting that must have been. Yeah. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. It seemed like,

1312
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:18,920
how does anybody eat this stuff? Because even smelling meat cooking would have made me nauseous.

1313
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,880
So you're feeling a lot better, but obviously on some level, you're sort of thinking, gosh, I,

1314
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:26,840
I'd still love to lose a hundred pounds here. I mean, if for no other reason,

1315
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:34,680
than just the difficulty on your joints and stuff. I was so happy with the change in the way I was

1316
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:41,640
feeling that even though my main purpose was to lose weight, the change that I got was not that,

1317
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:48,440
but it was great. Yeah. I loved it. And I assumed that maybe it's just a genetic thing. And,

1318
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:53,640
you know, because my mom and it'll, it'll always be, it'll always be an issue,

1319
02:00:53,640 --> 02:01:00,920
but at least I feel healthy now. And then I was having lunch with Mo Austin, who's a guy who

1320
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:08,840
ran Warner brothers records for 35 years. He worked for Frank Sinatra. He signed Jimmy Hendrix.

1321
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:14,840
He signed the sex pistols. He signed black Sabbath. He's an unbelievable guy. I went out to

1322
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:21,640
lunch with him one day. We would see each other probably once every two months. And he said,

1323
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:29,000
you know, Rick, you're really getting big and I'm really worried about you. And I know that you,

1324
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,760
you know, I know you walk every day and I know that you're strict about what you eat,

1325
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:39,880
but something's wrong and I'm going to get a nutritionist for you. And I want you to go to

1326
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:45,800
see my nutritionist. I want you to do everything he says. And I said, okay. And I knew it wouldn't

1327
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:49,960
work, but I was happy to do it. It's like, I have nothing to lose. It's like, I'll do it, but I've

1328
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:55,800
done everything and nothing has worked my whole life. So I don't know why that would change now,

1329
02:01:55,800 --> 02:02:02,280
but I'm, I love this person and he's cares about me. And if he's got an idea, I'm open.

1330
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:12,600
And I go to see his name is Dr. Heber at you UCLA. And he hooked me up to a machine, like a body fat

1331
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:21,560
pedant. Yeah. And he told me how many calories I burn every day. And he told me what are the

1332
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:32,120
foods that I was allowed to eat and not allowed to eat and said, you know, you, you burn 2300

1333
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:41,080
calories a day. I'm going to put you on a 1400 calorie a day diet and you'll lose. And he said,

1334
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:46,200
you'll lose this many pounds over this period of time, just like, he's like, nope, like a hundred

1335
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:53,880
percent. This is how would this work? And I didn't believe it at all. And he also had me shift my

1336
02:02:53,880 --> 02:03:02,680
diet to be based around protein shakes. So he wanted me to have six or seven protein shakes a day

1337
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:09,720
every two hours. And then I could have dinner at night, which would be fish, soup, salad, like a

1338
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:16,280
light dinner, a low calorie dinner with no carbs. So, so it was basically amazed. You could have that

1339
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:21,480
many shakes and that low that, and he still eat a dinner and be under 1400 calories. Because the

1340
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:31,640
shakes were 120 calories each. Cause all it was, was J Rob egg protein powder and water. Yeah.

1341
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:38,760
There's no, nothing else in it. It wasn't so bad. It wasn't so bad. The first three days I felt a

1342
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:45,880
little dizzy doing this. And after three days, it was no problem. And how was your appetite?

1343
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:54,680
After three days, fine. Because the protein in the shakes was so satisfying. And I had had them,

1344
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:59,400
I had one soon as I woke up in the morning and then every two hours, I never really had a chance

1345
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:05,880
to get hungry. And then I would have again, this light dinner and I would spread out my dinner

1346
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:13,000
through the night. So I would have first I would have the fish and some cooked vegetables. And then

1347
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,960
an hour later I would have a vegetable broth or a chicken broth. And then an hour later I would have

1348
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:28,520
a giant salad, but with just a little bit of oil, a little bit of lemon maybe. And I did that. I was

1349
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:34,840
eating one piece of fruit at that time too. Cause it seemed really restrictive. And I remember

1350
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:40,040
saying to him, can I have like an apple a day? And he said, it'll slow things down, but you can.

1351
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:45,560
And I had an apple a day and really savored the apple. So then the weight starts coming off. Yeah.

1352
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:53,480
And then in 14 months I lost 135 pounds. Now that's also a testament I think to your being

1353
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:57,880
able to stick to it. How did you manage, you know, the social side of things going out for dinners? I

1354
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:03,320
mean, certainly it was fine. It was fine. You would just order appropriately when you would go out.

1355
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:11,320
Absolutely. Yeah. It was pretty easy to do. Are you a disciplined person? Yes. Like with everything,

1356
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:16,040
are there any things where you like, I don't consider myself a very disciplined person,

1357
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:22,120
even though I get accused of being one all the time, because in, I would say in some ways,

1358
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:27,880
very much so. And in other ways, less so. But with food, you're quite disciplined. I would say I'm

1359
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:35,960
diligent. So I don't like to settle. I'll continue. I have on the unhealthy side,

1360
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,320
I can be a perfectionist and that can really slow things down.

1361
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:49,080
So you lose some unbelievable amount of weight. You're down to, you're below 200 at this point.

1362
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:56,040
Yes. I met Laird when I had lost 90 pounds. And there was a friend of ours named Don Wildman,

1363
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:03,480
who was at that time in his seventies, super fit bicycle racer, unbelievable, unbelievable guy,

1364
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:08,760
and jacked. To give you an idea, I think he was maybe when he was 80, he did

1365
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:15,080
23 pull ups on the beach at 80 years old. Wow. And looked like a bodybuilder,

1366
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:23,400
until he passed recently, maybe between a year and two years, he passed away. But anyway,

1367
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:29,560
he was with Laird and he was, he owned Bally's Fitness and built Bally's Fitness.

1368
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:36,520
He was very impressed with the weight loss. He just said, you know, it's being in the gym

1369
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:41,640
business. He said, this doesn't happen often. This is really remarkable. And you might want to start

1370
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:46,520
training with us. Because at this period of time, is Phil still living with you at this point?

1371
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:51,080
Phil's not living with me. And all I'm doing is walking for an hour day. Oh, now I'm up to

1372
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:57,240
started jogging. Uh-huh. Now I can on and off jog. You can jog and stay mostly at your target.

1373
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:02,920
And stay at my target heart rate. Yes. But you haven't started to lift weights yet or do anything.

1374
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:06,200
No, no, nothing. So you're also kind of probably, you've lost a lot of weight, but you've probably

1375
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:11,640
lost muscle as well as fat. Oh, absolutely. Although that was one of the things that Dr.

1376
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:20,760
Heber said about the key to the diet is you want to have, and he told me what the grams were,

1377
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:25,560
I can't remember now. He's like, you want to have 200 grams of protein. Oh, I can remember. He said,

1378
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:33,240
your target weight, the first time he tested me, he said, your target weight is 235 coming from the

1379
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:41,080
one, the 318. And each time I'd see him, the target number would go down because he was making progress

1380
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:49,160
faster than he'd anticipated. Or the stats changed based on the stats where he wanted to see my,

1381
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:56,200
it kept moving. So at first it was 235. And so it was 230 or so grams of protein.

1382
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,680
So he was targeting you at one gram per pound of target by weight.

1383
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:04,200
And he said, if you do that, you're going to lose mostly fat and much less muscle.

1384
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:12,760
Diets like that have gotten people into a lot of trouble. And unfortunately, that created an

1385
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:18,040
enormous backlash against carbohydrate restriction because, you know, carbohydrate restriction is a

1386
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:23,960
pretty vague and broad concept, right? It can be anything from a ketogenic diet, which is,

1387
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:30,040
you know, say a four to one ketogenic diet, which is what you would give kids that have epilepsy,

1388
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:34,280
where you're pretty much, they're pretty much just eating fat. I mean, there's virtually no protein

1389
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:38,520
and certainly no carbohydrate in their diet. And at the other end of the spectrum, a low carbohydrate

1390
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:45,560
diet could be what you were consuming, very high protein. And, you know, there were some patients

1391
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:52,200
that got into trouble with these high liquid protein diets. And like with anything, you know,

1392
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:56,280
you see one or two complications because the wrong person is consuming this when their kidney

1393
02:08:56,280 --> 02:09:00,920
function can't handle or something. And all of a sudden it, you know, the world isn't smart enough

1394
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:04,920
to appreciate nuance. So it turns into anytime you're strict carbohydrates, you're going to

1395
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:10,440
kill yourself. So when did you start reintroducing food? Because at some point,

1396
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:16,360
let me say there's another piece of this, it's really important, which is had I not done the work

1397
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:23,320
that I did with Phil, the diet wouldn't have worked. It was the combination of Phil getting

1398
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:30,680
my body working again. And then actually the high protein and calorie restriction

1399
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:38,360
really changed everything for me because in the Phil was a believer in you don't count calories,

1400
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:43,880
you don't think about that. So I might eat half a jar of almond butter every day.

1401
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:49,080
Almond butter was healthy, but half a jar of almond butter might be 2000 calories,

1402
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:52,600
just in almond butter, forgetting all the rest of the food I was eating. Yeah.

1403
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:59,640
Yeah. My guess is if we could have gone back in time and looked at you, I would suspect that

1404
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,880
Phil fixed a lot of your fuel partitioning issues. So when you probably met Phil,

1405
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:12,200
my hunch is you were glycogen overloaded, hyperinsulinemic glucose dependent.

1406
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:21,560
I definitely was because I would get frantic if I didn't eat, like really crazed, desperate.

1407
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:25,960
I think what you're saying makes a ton of sense actually. I would suspect that Phil fixed your

1408
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:31,720
fuel partitioning and probably fixed a lot of the hyperinsulinemia. Yes. But to take it into

1409
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:35,000
next level, you just had to restrict calories because when you restrict those calories,

1410
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:40,680
you're going to deplete glycogen levels and you have to basically get, you have to take glycogen

1411
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:45,560
off the table. I'm actually convinced now. I don't think I was convinced of this even

1412
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:51,880
two years ago or a year ago. I don't think one can lose weight when the liver and the muscles

1413
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:59,000
are full of glycogen. That has to be depleted. And the two quickest things that you can do

1414
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:05,080
to deplete glycogen in the liver and the muscle are to exercise and to restrict calories above

1415
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:09,480
all else, but within the calories, carbohydrates are probably the most important to restrict.

1416
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,880
So when did the doc at UCLA, when did you guys decide, okay, you're at a goal,

1417
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:21,080
it's now it's time to start re-inducing food. When I came to see him one time, he was just like,

1418
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:27,480
you're at your target, which was, as I say, I got down to like 187, I think. But you were already

1419
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:30,760
training at this point now because you'd already met.

1420
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:37,720
Because I'd started when I'd lost 90 pounds, so probably had another 50 ish pounds to lose,

1421
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:42,280
but I started training at that point. And I can remember showing up at Laird's house the first

1422
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:48,680
day and I could not do one pushup. And he said, no, don't say you can't do it. So you haven't done

1423
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:53,560
it yet. And then he would... And did you know a lot about Laird before you guys met?

1424
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:57,240
Not much other than... Like you just knew he was some star surfer, but you...

1425
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:03,720
And I'd seen Riding Giants, which is a movie that he's the third piece of.

1426
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:09,480
And he just seemed like the most incredible person in the world. And he is. He's a really...

1427
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:19,000
He lives up to the hype. He is that guy. So I didn't go there to exercise with the idea of

1428
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,640
wanting to exercise. I went there with the idea of... It's interesting to be around people who

1429
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:28,840
are really good at what they do. And him and the group of athletes that would train there

1430
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:35,480
were so different than anyone I'd ever met in my life that it was interesting. And

1431
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:44,840
where I would think of exercise as this sort of tuning out grunt work,

1432
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:52,840
what I learned with him was that it was as mentally challenging as it was physically

1433
02:12:52,920 --> 02:13:00,200
challenging because everything was like doing two exercises at the same time while you're balancing.

1434
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:10,600
It was very focus intensive, which suited my same thing I do with music. So it didn't feel like,

1435
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:21,320
oh, now I'm giving up my focus to goof off in the gym. This was a cerebral... With certain things,

1436
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:29,400
the first thing to give out was the concentration. Concentration or the... I could only balance for

1437
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:37,560
so long before I would lose the ability to do the exercise. So different things started coming into

1438
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:44,840
play that were fascinating and fun. And with him, it was every day would be, you do an entirely

1439
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:50,440
different thing. And sometimes it would be weight training. Sometimes it would be, we're going to do

1440
02:13:51,560 --> 02:14:02,360
a hundred of each of these moves. Some days it was, we're going to do one rep of every exercise

1441
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:09,560
super slow, or we're going to just hold the weights in this position for as long as we can,

1442
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:16,520
or we're going to get into a horse pose and hold it for five minutes, or just all different kinds

1443
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:20,680
of things. Different machines, different... And then the pool training started happening.

1444
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:26,120
And I watched that evolve through... Yeah. What was the exercise, I remember you telling me about that

1445
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:33,560
you would do underwater with a dumbbell. There's a whole... It started originally when he started it,

1446
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:39,880
it was carrying heavy weights from the shallow end of the pool into the deep end of the pool.

1447
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:45,960
Yes, this is the one. And then coming back, doing a circle in the underwater pool. And that's how it

1448
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:50,120
started. That was the only exercise. And were you comfortable enough in the water to do that? Because

1449
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,960
for some people... I love being in the water. I felt best in the water. And I was, I really

1450
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:01,800
politicked to get to where we started doing pool training as a regular thing. Because they would do

1451
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:07,000
it sometimes for fun. And when you say they, who else was there? Was it mostly professional surfers?

1452
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:13,240
No, it's all different kinds of athletes. It might be... So this is like Laird's running a boot camp

1453
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:18,120
at his house? He's running a boot camp, but it's just friends coming to exercise because it's all

1454
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:25,400
anybody wants to do. So you'll see a football player and a basketball player and a hockey player.

1455
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:31,800
And just some guys from around town who were jacked and liked to lift weights. So it started,

1456
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:37,720
it was Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it was weightlifting. And then on occasion, we would do

1457
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:44,440
this pool workout. And then we started making the pool workout a regular Tuesday, Thursday, and

1458
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:48,360
Saturday. So Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was weights. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday was pool.

1459
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:55,160
And I remember the day, one day it was the time for the pool workout and Laird came down and he said,

1460
02:15:55,160 --> 02:16:01,160
I had a dream last night. And he said, another part of the exercise was, so let's say you have a

1461
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:07,480
40 pound dumbbells, 50 pound dumbbells. So the first exercise was the walk. Then you would go to

1462
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:13,400
the deep end of the pool. You would leave the 50s. You would swim up. You would catch your breath.

1463
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:23,160
And then when you felt strong, you would swim down and do as many curls as you could underwater,

1464
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:27,720
holding your breath. And then you would swim up, get a breath, go down and do another set. And then

1465
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:33,960
you do as many shoulder presses as you could. A lot of things are interesting about it. You're

1466
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:40,600
in cold water. It's not freezing cold, but it's still cold enough to change things. There's no

1467
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:46,120
lactic acid buildup at all. Your whole body's under tremendous pressure because you're deep

1468
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:53,000
underwater. So how deep was this pool? It's like 14 feet deep. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's deep. So you feel

1469
02:16:55,800 --> 02:17:01,640
very safe lifting weights that would feel scarier to lift on land

1470
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,520
because there was so much support from the water. And also Archimedes principle. I mean,

1471
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,920
you're technically moving less relative weight because the water is lifting part of it. Yeah.

1472
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:19,560
We were lifting the heavy weights and swimming up to get air. And you could only do so many reps

1473
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:25,400
and even so many sets because you just got fried really fast doing that. Yeah. And then

1474
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:30,120
he had this dream and he said, I had a dream last night. If we use lighter weight,

1475
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:37,240
it would be heavy enough to hold us down, but light enough for we could get up and get air.

1476
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:43,240
Holding the weight. Holding the weight. So then we started with 10 pound dumbbells

1477
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:53,880
doing jumps like, and it would be one breath per move because it was so, it started taking on this

1478
02:17:53,880 --> 02:18:01,080
yoga like practice. And then one day he's like, let's try doing backflips. So you come up,

1479
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:06,520
get a breath and do a backflip and then land. And then the next one was like, now we're gonna,

1480
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:11,800
and it became into, there are like 50 different exercises now. What is the period of time from

1481
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:17,240
which your first workout at Laird's house till you're doing backflips underwater with dumbbells?

1482
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:24,840
Is that a year? Maybe two. I mean, maybe two. And it might've been two more because

1483
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:33,320
those exercises didn't exist two years earlier. With him, it's always finding a new challenge

1484
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:41,160
and then learning to do it. I don't know what's a more remarkable transformation though. Losing

1485
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:50,440
140 pounds, which is remarkable. Or the physicality, as you put it, of going from a guy who, you know,

1486
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:55,880
has a hard time walking to his car or walking up a flight of stairs to a guy who's hanging out with

1487
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:01,560
pro athletes doing pretty hard stuff. I mean, I don't know that I could do any of this stuff

1488
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:06,040
you're describing now, actually. I don't know if you could do it the first time, but you could

1489
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:11,560
definitely learn to do it. It's complicated, you know, but that's kind of what makes it fun.

1490
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:18,360
Sure. And it feels good. It's not a, I wouldn't say it's grueling. It's fun. Being in a pool is fun.

1491
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:24,840
I mean, if you're not just swimming laps, you know what I'm saying? It's like the variety involved

1492
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:32,040
and the potential for new ideas. It's really fun. Super fun. And I even find it fun to just swim

1493
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:40,600
laps. Really? Yeah, I get. I guess I get in a good mood doing it, but the first half, and for me,

1494
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:45,720
my goal would be to swim a mile, and the first half of it would be pretty grueling, but then the

1495
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:53,320
second half would be kind of like the downhill. When I was training for a swim in Hawaii, the time

1496
02:19:53,320 --> 02:19:57,880
I lived in San Francisco, I had to do the swim in June. That was sort of my window to do it. So,

1497
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,560
you know, you know what the water's like in June in Hawaii. It's pretty warm. It's about 80 degrees.

1498
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:08,920
So I couldn't do my long, long swims in the ocean, in the bay, because it was,

1499
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:14,280
it's reverse acclimating. I actually had to learn to do long swims in the heat. Yeah. So. Very

1500
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:18,680
different. Yeah, totally different. You know, there's a sweet spot, like 70 degrees is perfect.

1501
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:25,480
You know, sort of 66 to 72 is really the right temperature for marathon swimming. So if you're,

1502
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:30,520
you know, if you're doing a swim in the 60s, you actually have to train in the 60s. And this was

1503
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:34,200
just the reverse. It was training in the 80s. So I had to do all these long swims in a pool.

1504
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:39,480
And that was one of the tougher swims to train for, because in the ocean, it's.

1505
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:42,040
It's completely different. Yeah, it's just, well, it's just.

1506
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:47,560
It's nothing to do with each other. Yeah. It's mentally a lot easier to swim 10 miles in the

1507
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:52,680
ocean than to swim 10 miles in a 25 yard pool. And, you know, so swimming in a marathon is no

1508
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:56,600
different from running a marathon. You have a very similar periodization of training where,

1509
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:01,240
you know, you'll, I forget, I think it was on, I was on a three week cycle. So each three weeks,

1510
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:07,560
I was taking a step forward of, you know, 20% additional volume. And then you would cycle up,

1511
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:12,440
down, up, down with these three week peaks or two weeks. I can't even remember, but I do remember

1512
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:18,600
the day very clearly when I had to do my longest pool swim, which was not going to be my longest

1513
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:23,640
swim. I was going to do one ocean swim in cold water just to get the really long swimming. But

1514
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:31,640
it had to be, I want to say like 28,000 yards in the pool without stopping, which was about as

1515
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:38,200
long as the pool was open on this particular Saturday afternoon. And the thing that I had

1516
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:44,920
learned doing these long swims is there's two options. One, you're going to get in the water

1517
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:50,040
and actually feel good. You're going to just be having a good day. And you'll know 1500 yards

1518
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:54,600
into this, like it's going to be a good day. And the good news is if that's the case, at least

1519
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:58,840
you're not going to suffer for the next eight hours. The bad news is you didn't build the mental

1520
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:03,880
toughness that you actually want for the real swim when it hurts. Conversely, you're going to get in

1521
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:09,240
some days and that first 1500 is going to feel horrible and it's only going to get worse. And

1522
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:15,480
you're going to, it's going to be the worst eight hours of your life, relatively speaking. When you

1523
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:19,960
finish, it'll be incredible because you'll have known you persevered through it. And you didn't

1524
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,400
know which of those two you wanted. In the short term, you sort of wanted the good day.

1525
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:23,960
Of course.

1526
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:31,880
So on this one day when I had to do my 28,000 yards or whatever, I mean 500 yards into that swim,

1527
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:36,440
I couldn't believe how much pain I was in. And then a thousand, I'm like, oh my God,

1528
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:41,160
this is going to be bad. And by the only way you can keep track of those swims is on the splits on

1529
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:46,600
your watch. So I basically knew exactly how many strokes I would take per length. And I knew to the

1530
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:52,520
second how long each lap was taking. And I was struggling to hold that pace even at 1500 yards,

1531
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:58,120
whereas the first 16,000 yards generally, you could turn your brain off and do it. And so sure

1532
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:00,760
enough, that ended up being one of the most difficult times of my life from a training

1533
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:08,360
perspective in the pool, swimming the laps in the heat. But when it was done, I was like, all right,

1534
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:13,960
well, you got through it. So the benefit is on the other side of that. So that was one of the few

1535
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:19,720
times when swimming laps was unbearable. But I can see what you're saying. There's an athleticism

1536
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:25,080
that Laird, who I don't know by the way, but just he writes a column in a men's magazine that I love.

1537
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:32,760
And you can tell like there's this interface between play and work and functionality. And he's

1538
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:38,440
very creative, right? Like he seems to be one of the most creative athletes I've ever read about.

1539
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:44,200
And it's not just in his sport, but it's also in how he sort of revolutionized the way he trains.

1540
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:50,760
It's the reason he does what he does in his sport is because of the way he thinks he's very

1541
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:57,000
out of the box problem solving. He sees something that no one's ever done before

1542
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:05,480
and thinks about, okay, how do we do this? It's very different than we know how it's done. And

1543
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:11,560
we're going to just grind it out. He's not the grind it out. He'll grind it out if that's the job.

1544
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:16,600
But what excites him the most from my perspective seems like is no one's ever done this before.

1545
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:21,480
Let's figure out the problem. And then let's train to be able to do this thing.

1546
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:29,080
Yeah, it's amazing. So this journey you've just described sounds like it took about five,

1547
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:34,760
six years to go from the guy who can't walk to his car to the guy who's, you know, frankly,

1548
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:40,040
I remember even seeing the magazine, I don't know, story what, six, seven years ago with you and

1549
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:45,960
Laird working out. And it was, I mean, a total transformation. Total transformation. Like I said,

1550
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:49,640
the first day I went there, I couldn't do one pushup. I got to the point where I could do

1551
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:54,920
a hundred consecutive pushups, which was crazy for me. That seemed insane.

1552
02:24:55,960 --> 02:25:02,360
How did this impact your work? So to think for a moment that you're doing this incredible work

1553
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:09,320
with physical limitations, I mean, at some point not having the energy to walk to your car

1554
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:13,800
must be impacting the energy you could bring to a studio or the duration with which you could be

1555
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:18,040
in a studio. I'm not sure. I don't know that that's the case. Interesting. I think it's almost

1556
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:26,200
like a different, if anything, I was just in a better mood. I feel like I came alive through

1557
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:31,640
that process in a different way. Now it was already alive in the studio, but maybe that was

1558
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:36,760
the only place I was alive before, but through the exercise, I became alive more in life.

1559
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:44,200
So let's fast forward to last summer. Okay. So we're sitting down to have a coffee in New York

1560
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:49,800
and you had stopped off on the way home from Italy. The story just makes me laugh to this day

1561
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:54,600
because I can't believe it, right? You had called me and said, hey, I was once told I might have

1562
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:59,480
aortic stenosis. The ask was like, what do you think or something like that? And I think I just

1563
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:05,800
basically said, you know, Rick, echocardiogram is pretty good, but really cardiac MRI is really

1564
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:12,120
the way we want to do this. And I'm sure there's a great place to do it in LA, but I know the best

1565
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:15,880
place to get it in New York. And since you're in Italy, why don't you just stop by and we'll do it.

1566
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:21,800
So great. So you stop by, you get the cardiac MRI, and then we met for coffee around the corner.

1567
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:27,720
And my phone is ringing, right? And it's like, I look down and it's Bob Peters,

1568
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:32,040
who's the radiologist. And I'm like, I wonder why Bob's calling me. It can't be that important. I

1569
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:36,520
don't even think to put the two and two together that he's calling because he's looking at the scan

1570
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:42,200
you had. And if I remember correctly, he called like 10 times. He called 10 times. And at which point,

1571
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:46,520
like, you know, my spidey sense goes off and I'm like, Rick, sorry to be rude. Let me just go see

1572
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:52,200
what this guy wants. And I call him and he goes, are you nearby? And I was like, yeah, dude, I'm like

1573
02:26:52,920 --> 02:27:00,520
100 feet away from, he goes, are you with Rick? I said, yeah. He goes, can you guys come by? And

1574
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:06,920
I was like, okay, sure. Now I told you, Hey, Rick, this is Bob calling for us to come and look at

1575
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:13,800
this. Did you, what did you think at that moment? No, I had no preconceived idea. Okay. So it didn't

1576
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:17,880
seem odd to you because this is just, well, it seemed odd, but I didn't know what to expect.

1577
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:24,760
I can give you another odd, just a little odd piece that happened before this, which is when I did

1578
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:34,520
the last echo out here after I was in Hawaii and before I was in Italy. Yeah. The reason that I had

1579
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:42,200
to do this, this new test. I do the test. Everything's fine. I'm leaving the test and

1580
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:48,040
the woman who does the test says, how are you feeling? I said, I'm feeling pretty good. And she's

1581
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:54,120
like, that's good. Like all things considered something like that, like, like, or in your

1582
02:27:54,120 --> 02:28:01,560
condition. Like, okay. Like I have no idea what she's talking about. And was there a followup to

1583
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:06,280
that discussion with her? I leave. You leave. Everything's fine. So you're in Italy and so

1584
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:12,680
it's two months. And I'm doing at this, at that point in time, Olympic deadlifts and squatting

1585
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:20,040
with as heavy weight as possible in this new experience of like the last 18 months had been

1586
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:25,800
devoted to just deadlifts and squats heavy. Oh, and that's the other part of the story that

1587
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:32,360
makes me laugh. While Bob is ringing me off the hook, we are discussing a new deadlift protocol.

1588
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:38,920
Yes. And I'm like, all right, you know, I'll come up to LA and we'll do, I want to really fix your

1589
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:45,080
deadlift and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Okay. So now three minutes later, we're

1590
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:51,800
sitting inside and Bob pulls up the scan. And again, it's, I'm more interested in your point

1591
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:57,400
of view because I don't need him to say anything because I've looked at a million scans so I can

1592
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:02,200
see it. But of course, if you haven't looked at one of these MRIs, like what would you know? What

1593
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:08,440
was your first recollection that something was wrong? Just the conversation that two you were

1594
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:13,640
having, I was just sort of watching you, you guys were comparing notes on what you were seeing.

1595
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:20,120
Right. And we were also probably not even making an effort either deliberately or not to communicate

1596
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:23,480
with you. I think we were just talking in the normal shorthand we would have spoken if you

1597
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:27,560
weren't there. Yeah. Again, I don't really remember much about like what was said, but

1598
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:32,440
it's like nothing I've ever seen before. And it's nothing Bob had ever seen before.

1599
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:40,920
Yeah. But I remember the conversation where you guys together said, you're going to need

1600
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:47,800
open heart surgery as soon as possible. And I remember saying, as soon as possible in the next

1601
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:54,440
year. And you're like, no. Yeah. And I said, in the next six months. And you're like, no,

1602
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:59,080
as soon as possible, but not emergency because we want to find the right doctor.

1603
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:04,680
Right. And I remember, I remember as you and I walked out of there, I said, oh, by the way,

1604
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:10,120
Rick, all that stuff I was saying about the deadlifting, scratch that you are not lifting

1605
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:18,920
a heavy weight until we get this resolved. Yes. And you are very good, I think, at

1606
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:26,440
not demonstrating or maybe you don't even experience it, but you never seemed stressed

1607
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:31,800
or panicked. And sometimes you would just have to tell me that you were stressed, but you never

1608
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:37,080
displayed this, right? Like so. So in some ways, I don't think I understood what you were going

1609
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:46,040
through at that time. I'm not sure that I did either. And I don't know that I was planning on

1610
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:51,000
acting on the information that we had gathered. And I guess just for the listener, I should

1611
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,440
explain what's happening since you've already, I mean, I had asked you before this, so just so

1612
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:57,640
the listener understands this, I would not have brought this up if Rick hadn't been willing to

1613
02:30:57,640 --> 02:31:03,400
talk about it. So Rick, you have something called a congenital bicuspid aortic valve.

1614
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:09,000
I was born. You were born, that's right. So the aortic valve normally has three leaflets,

1615
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:16,920
and this is from the way you're born. And a small subset of people are born with two leaflets, and

1616
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:24,200
hence the term bicuspid as opposed to tricuspid. And one of the real problems of a bicuspid aortic

1617
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:29,400
valve, and I have two patients with bicuspid aortic valves who we just follow, because we know at

1618
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:32,840
some point they're probably going to need surgery. In fact, I think Arnold Schwarzenegger had a

1619
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:36,680
bicuspid aortic valve, and that's ultimately why he needed to have a similar operation.

1620
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:42,760
But one of the drawbacks is it is more prone to calcification. So it basically,

1621
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:51,000
the valve starts to act like a piece of bone, and it models itself like bone. And the problem with

1622
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:57,160
that is it becomes harder and harder to open, and that is known as stenosis. So people with a

1623
02:31:57,160 --> 02:32:02,120
bicuspid aortic valve are much, much more likely to develop something called aortic stenosis. And

1624
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:07,800
the aortic valve is what empties the biggest, most powerful chamber in the heart called the

1625
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:15,160
left ventricle. And so several things are happening. One is as the heart is pumping,

1626
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:20,040
the ventricle is pumping, it's pumping against a greater and greater force of resistance.

1627
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:26,120
And for transient periods, that's wonderful. It's great for the heart to have resistance.

1628
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:31,480
But the heart being the most important muscle in the body has great adaptation. And one of the

1629
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:35,560
adaptations is it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and more muscular and more muscular as it

1630
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:41,480
goes against that. So among the things that really stood out to me looking at your cardiac MRI

1631
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:48,680
was how thick the muscles of your left ventricle and your septum, which is the muscle wall that

1632
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:54,120
separates the left and right ventricle, they were without exaggeration twice the normal thickness

1633
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:59,080
of a man your size. And that in and of itself becomes problematic for reasons that I won't

1634
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:03,880
bore you with, but you can get an outflow obstruction. In other words, the wall of the

1635
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:08,680
heart itself can begin to impede outflow. So that's one problem. The second problem is you're

1636
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:14,760
now having a harder and harder time getting blood out past the aortic valve. So you can actually

1637
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:19,240
have sudden death with something called critical aortic stenosis, which you have. And there's a

1638
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:25,080
threshold we use to define that based on the gradient and the pressure across the valve and

1639
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:33,400
the size of what's left. So the amount of room in an area, we say how many square centimeters

1640
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:38,280
of opening is there? And once you're below a certain level, it's called critical. And once

1641
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:43,960
you reach that, the probability of sudden death goes up significantly. But there was a third

1642
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:50,840
problem that was probably even more frightening on the MRA, which is the portion of the study that

1643
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:57,960
looks at the vasculature, which was the size of your aortic root was very dilated. And this also

1644
02:33:57,960 --> 02:34:04,120
tends to go hand in hand with aortic stenosis. And it turns out it's not entirely clear why. One

1645
02:34:04,120 --> 02:34:08,920
thought is the higher pressure gradient going across just stretches it out. But I actually

1646
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:17,240
think the literature is pointing to the fact that whatever congenital factors lead to the remodeling

1647
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:23,080
or the defective valve leaflets in the remodeling also speak to not having the right collagen

1648
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:27,560
mixture or matrix within the ascending aorta because it goes up like an arch.

1649
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:33,560
The normal aortic diameter there is about three and a half centimeters. And there are adjustments

1650
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:40,760
you can do based on a person's size. If you were even twice your size, the allowance would be about

1651
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:49,560
3.9 centimeters. I think you were like 6.6 or 6.7 centimeters. I mean, it was, again, one of those

1652
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:54,840
things where we have these nomograms that predict the risk of a sudden dissection. So a dissection

1653
02:34:54,840 --> 02:35:04,120
would mean that that thing tears. And unfortunately, that comes with a mortality of, I want to say,

1654
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:11,560
two to four percent per hour that it's untreated, which for many people means if it dissects, you

1655
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:19,000
die. And so we left and we went back and you were going to fly back the next day. And I was going to

1656
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,760
fly back the next day to California. And then the plan was we're going to find you who is really the

1657
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:29,400
best surgeon to do this today because the last time I had looked into who's going to be the best

1658
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:35,240
surgeon to do this, it had been a couple of years and you want to go with the best person. So what

1659
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:39,640
did you go home and talk about that night? Again, I guess I feel like I wasn't being very sensitive

1660
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:43,160
to what that news must have been like to you. I was sort of in business mode. I'm going to say

1661
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:53,240
that from leaving that meeting with you until the moment the surgery happened,

1662
02:35:54,200 --> 02:36:04,280
those were the most difficult, probably six weeks of my life. Terrified. And my nature is not to

1663
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:11,880
intervene in medical, certainly not in a surgical way and not even in a drug way. My

1664
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:19,240
instinct is always to follow nature, not to do an intervention. And I think I told you that

1665
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:26,680
20 or so years ago, my appendix burst and I never had it removed. And I remember I had a second

1666
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:35,560
version of an appendicitis, maybe less than two years, less than two years after the first one.

1667
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:45,960
My doctor called the pharmacy to get the same prescription antibiotics that I took the first

1668
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:54,040
time that it happened. And the pharmacist said, well, he had appendicitis two years ago.

1669
02:36:56,520 --> 02:37:03,880
He had his appendix out and the doctor said, no, he didn't have it out. And the pharmacist said,

1670
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:09,320
well, if you didn't have it out, he'd be dead and you're probably not a real doctor. And I'm not

1671
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:15,560
going to prescribe, I won't give him the drugs. By the way, it's so untrue. It's

1672
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:20,200
in fact, actually, I may have even told you this, it's actually come around full circle today. So

1673
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,440
we learned about the non-surgical management of appendicitis through the days of when sailors

1674
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:30,520
were going back and forth. Because appendicitis does have a very high mortality if left untreated.

1675
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:36,200
Yes. But they learned that if you put a person on their right side with the pelvis down, you

1676
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:41,000
could contain the rupture because the appendix is on the right. Nobody told me that. No, no, no.

1677
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:45,400
And so you put somebody in that position, they can abscess it off and it doesn't,

1678
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:50,200
as long as it forms an abscess, you're okay. It's like when it becomes systemic. And nowadays,

1679
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:57,400
the approach to appendicitis is much less surgical. It is a much more aggressive antibiotic routine.

1680
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:03,880
But that said, you are still very fortunate to have survived because the odds are not in your favor.

1681
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:12,440
No. And the only way I was able to do it was my osteopath, who's really my main doctor, said,

1682
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:18,520
I did a CT scan, I think. The guy who did the CT scan said, okay, you're going to leave here.

1683
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:22,840
You're going to go straight to Cedars. I'm going to call them and you're going to get an emergency

1684
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:27,800
appendectomy. And I said, well, what are my options? And he said, you have no options.

1685
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:34,040
And I said, well, what else can I do? And he said, if you were my son, I would say,

1686
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:39,880
you leave here right now, go to Cedars and get an emergency appendectomy. That's what you have to do.

1687
02:38:40,680 --> 02:38:44,840
And then my osteopath's office was right around the corner. I went to see him. I showed him the

1688
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:51,640
pictures and he's like, looks like you need surgery. And I say, no way around it. He's like,

1689
02:38:51,640 --> 02:38:56,200
I don't think so. He says, too bad we're not in Europe. I said, what are you talking about? He said,

1690
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:59,800
in Europe, they probably would give you a bunch of antibiotics and tell you to go home.

1691
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:06,840
And I said, well, I want to do it the European style. And he said, well, I'll help you do this,

1692
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:13,160
but I want you to see a surgeon and I want you to do it under his supervision. And we did that.

1693
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:16,920
And I ended up never having it. And what do you think was your aversion to surgery? I mean,

1694
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:21,560
it's obviously frightening under any circumstances. I have a needle, I won't, I have a needle phobia.

1695
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:27,080
So any, anything in any intervention like that, and it all stems back. It's funny. You talked about

1696
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:37,240
the heart dissection earlier. I can remember in fifth grade doing a frog dissection in biology

1697
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:43,720
class. And it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I see. So I've always been, and I was

1698
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:51,480
afraid to go to the doctor as a kid. I was, I've always had a never felt right to me. Yeah. I

1699
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:56,200
remember you saying that even just getting the MRI, if they had to use a needle, even to give

1700
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:03,400
contrast, it was going to be, yeah, I'm happy to do any non-invasive anything, whatever it takes.

1701
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:08,840
And I can be very strict. I just don't want it to have needles. Although I'm getting better at it

1702
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:15,720
now after this, after what I've been through. Yeah. Well, we ended up finding Joseph Wu,

1703
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:20,920
who's the head of cardiovascular surgery at Stanford. And, you know, in the process,

1704
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:26,440
it was really great for me to get to know him. And a good friend of mine, Randy Green, who's a

1705
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:32,200
cardiac surgeon and was one of my mentors connected us with, and he did the heavy lifting. He was like,

1706
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:36,360
look, cause I was like, well, it's really this guy or this guy. And he said, you know,

1707
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:41,560
those guys were the man five years ago, 10 years ago. You want the guy who's the man today.

1708
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:47,960
And it's, you know, with aortic surgery, it's really about the reps. Like you want someone

1709
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:52,120
who's doing that operation constantly. And he's doing that operation three times a week.

1710
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:57,880
The average cardiac surgeon might be doing that operation five times a year. Yeah. And I remember

1711
02:40:57,880 --> 02:41:00,840
when you went up, cause you went to Stanford, you went to, you went to a bunch of places,

1712
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:05,160
but I think you came back also realizing that it's not just the surgeon that makes it. It's

1713
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:09,000
what is the, what is the anesthesia team look like? What the nurses look like? What does the

1714
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:14,280
ICU look like? What is the step down unit look like? You have to have perfection across the

1715
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:22,360
entire spectrum. Yes. Now here's funny, I'm going to eat some crow. The next six weeks were not only

1716
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:26,040
you going through what you were going through, which again, I don't think I realized until the day,

1717
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:32,360
probably three or four days before the surgery, did I realize how anxious you were because you

1718
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:39,720
mask it quite well. And I was in New York and I was flying to San Francisco to see you the day

1719
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:45,160
after the surgery. And it was a couple of days before that that you called me. But prior to that,

1720
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:51,480
you are sending me emails and texts every day with cockamamie ideas to avoid doing this. Yes.

1721
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:56,040
And I couldn't, I honestly, at some point I was like, I don't know if he's serious.

1722
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:00,040
I was dead serious. I was dead serious. And I had something happen.

1723
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:04,200
This was, I don't think I ever got to tell you about this.

1724
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:13,320
I got a call saying this is maybe three days before I'm supposed to go to Stanford. And this

1725
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:18,040
is after you've gone up for your pre-op catheterization and everything. No, no, no, that was,

1726
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:23,720
I did that either the day of or the day before. Yeah. Okay. Same day. Yeah. I've only met the

1727
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:29,000
doctor, but I haven't done anything at the hospital yet, but I'm going in three days to do the surgery

1728
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:35,080
and I'm having, I have a dinner plan with friends at the same restaurant where I had

1729
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:43,800
meet the first time. And a friend of mine calls me and he said, I finally have found a cardiologist

1730
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:49,960
who might be able to help you. He's not like the other cardiologist. He speaks more your language.

1731
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:58,360
And his name is Dr. Junger or younger, younger. He wrote the book clean. He's known more now for

1732
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:07,400
cleanses and nutrition, but he is a trained heart surgeon. And he also has an aortic stenosis

1733
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:15,240
personally. I've pretty much given up hope at this point, meaning you've accepted the fact

1734
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:18,840
that you're going to have this operation. Likely. I'm still thinking even the morning of the surgery

1735
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:25,960
was still 50 50, but I'm, I'm more on the train of doing it than not. I'd also seen a, there was a

1736
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:33,320
Chinese healer who came to the house and did these ceremonies and she told me not to get the surgery.

1737
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:39,720
And Muriel, who's was very pro surgery, she's like, well, maybe, you know, maybe you don't have to do

1738
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:45,480
it. You know, the, the healer says you're going to be okay. Even then I was like, I feel like I have to

1739
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:51,880
do it now. I feel like I'm, I'm past, I'd lost hope at this point. I call the doc. He's like, I send

1740
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:59,080
him all the reports, everything, history and current. He looks at everything and he calls me

1741
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:04,440
back and he's like, I have, I think I have great news for you. Can you come see me? It's like,

1742
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:10,280
absolutely. It's like the clouds have parted and there's a God is speaking to you direct. There's

1743
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:15,480
a miracle. Right. And I say, great. I have a dinner in Santa Monica. I'll cancel the dinner. I'll come

1744
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:19,800
and he's like, no, no, it's fine. Go to your dinner. And then after dinner, come and see me. I'll be

1745
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:27,240
awake. He was close by. So I go to the dinner and I remember it was the greatest dinner in my life.

1746
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:34,360
It was like the last supper. I was, no, I was off the hook. It's like, this is it. The way the world

1747
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:42,920
is, it's like unbelievable. It was like the one moment of joy in my life was that dinner. After

1748
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:48,600
these six weeks of after six weeks of terror or anticipation of, yes. And second guessing,

1749
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:55,160
because I still don't want to do it. And the guy has good news for me. I go to see the guy

1750
02:44:55,160 --> 02:45:01,400
and he said, I looked at everything. He had a heart model on his and he takes it apart and

1751
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:07,880
he starts explaining everything to me. What's going on. He's like, this is great. It's so lucky

1752
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:16,440
that they caught it. They caught it in time. And, um, you're, it's so great that they found this

1753
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:24,440
and that you can do this surgery. Cause like, he's like, he said the fact that they caught this

1754
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:30,120
is the greatest news in the world. If you would have just gone on doing your deadlifts without

1755
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:34,920
knowing this is going on, there's a very good chance that you would not live long.

1756
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:43,000
You know, I look back at that and I'm sort of glad I didn't realize, again, I assumed you were

1757
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:49,480
definitely having the surgery, but you were just sort of tweaking me by sending me text messages

1758
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:56,680
every day of funny ideas to avoid it. And I was like, this is cute, but he can't be serious. And

1759
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:01,480
I don't know. I feel like at some point I kind of read you the riot act about your son, right? At

1760
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:06,680
some point I said, look, you're being a little selfish right now. You have a wife, you have a

1761
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:14,040
son and you're way too young to die. So you can't, you, you have to, I think I was trying to say like

1762
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:20,360
you have to do something that is really hard for you for them. I feel like once you sort of got to

1763
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:25,800
that point, it turned into, okay, how do I now hack the system and start doing things? And I remember

1764
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:30,440
one of the ideas you had was I want to take methylene blue. I want to have the anesthesiologist

1765
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:34,920
inject me with methylene blue. And there, I know you know why, but for the listener, the reason that

1766
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:40,040
this was of interest to you was you have to undergo what's called circulatory arrest.

1767
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:48,760
So this is such a big operation. This is a much bigger operation than even doing bypassing of the

1768
02:46:48,760 --> 02:46:58,040
heart because you actually have to do a special type of cannulation to create another type of

1769
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:03,400
blood flow to the brain to make up for the fact that even the vessels on the top of the aorta are

1770
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:10,280
not supplying the brain anymore. And this is a real reason why once I got to meet and talk with

1771
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:17,320
Joseph Wu, I was really comfortable that this was the man because this is an area of surgery where

1772
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:23,720
speed is everything. The human brain can only go so long without its natural perfusion from the

1773
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:31,880
heart. And the difference between Joseph doing this operation and somebody else was night and day.

1774
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:39,160
And when he called me after, by the way, and he read me all the stats, I was blown away at how

1775
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:45,160
quickly he was able to do this. It was literally in half the time I expected it would take at every

1776
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:49,720
step of the way. So what the cross clamp time was, what the cannulation time was, all these things.

1777
02:47:50,360 --> 02:47:55,480
Your question was, methylene blue can protect the brain. I'm going to have the anesthesiologist.

1778
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:59,000
I'm going to talk to them about doing this. And it's funny, I was really dismissive of this. I was

1779
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:05,720
sort of like Rick, you know, yeah, yeah, I know, methylene blue in theory could kind of work, but

1780
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:10,280
don't rock the boat. They're not even, don't even ask them. They're not going to say yes. Well,

1781
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:15,880
you ended up asking them and they said no. But it was amazing. It was two months later. So the

1782
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:21,160
operation happens or anything. Two months later, I'm doing research for a podcast with a guy named

1783
02:48:21,160 --> 02:48:26,680
Francisco Gonzalez Lima on Alzheimer's disease. In the process of doing this, I realized all of the

1784
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:31,720
work that he and his lab have done with methylene blue. And I start going through all the studies

1785
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:37,880
and I'm like, oh man, I was, I was really a jerk to be so dismissive of this to Rick. I,

1786
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:46,280
I didn't realize how much research was here and how much data existed on the neuroprotective

1787
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:52,520
benefits of methylene blue. And I would say to this day, I'm actually one, I feel bad that I

1788
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:56,600
was dismissed by that, but two, I'm like, I hope some anesthesiologists out there are paying

1789
02:48:56,600 --> 02:49:01,480
attention to this literature because I think there is actually an opportunity to reduce

1790
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:07,800
the morbidity and potentially mortality of these really, really dangerous, big, big operations

1791
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:13,160
where it's unavoidable that you have to alter the perfusion of the brain. Yes. And that idea came

1792
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:20,360
from Dr. Jack Cruz, right? Who's a neurosurgeon. Right. And he said, well, he also said,

1793
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:26,760
talk to your surgeon about this. You don't want to piss off your surgeon. You have to do what

1794
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:32,840
the surgeon says, but as someone who's more focused on the brain than the heart,

1795
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:38,440
while they're doing the heart surgery, I would really like you to have methylene blue in your

1796
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:44,760
brain. Yeah. And again, I do, I hope somebody out there listening to this who's a cardiac

1797
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:49,560
anesthesiologist or cardiac surgeon is, would consider doing a clinical trial on this,

1798
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:54,600
and again, it's possible it's been done and I wasn't looking at that literature, but it was,

1799
02:49:55,320 --> 02:50:00,120
I think it was actually a great idea. And I remember I sent you a list. I talked to all of

1800
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:03,640
my, I don't have to read. You sent me like 50 different things. I sent you a long list of 50

1801
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:08,440
things that I could do to sort of hack the system. And I remember you said, if you show this to Dr.

1802
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:13,960
Rook, he will not operate on you. Don't even show him this list. You cannot do these things.

1803
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:21,320
Well, some of the things made sense, right? Which were like, I'll eat a certain way going into it.

1804
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:25,000
If I showed up with more ketones in my blood, would that be protective? And I was like, yes,

1805
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:29,000
sure. But you don't have to explain that to him, right? Yes. But the two things that I fought for,

1806
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:36,760
which he said no to, who were the methylene blue and to not use opiates post-surgery.

1807
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:40,360
No, no, that made a lot of sense, but they said no. They said, well, they said we're not going

1808
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:46,200
to manage it. They said no, but then he, the anesthesiologist will, if you can handle the pain,

1809
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:52,200
that's right. But his initial reaction was no, I will not do that. Right. And the reason in their

1810
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:57,880
defense that they would say that is if a patient is in tremendous pain postoperatively, they are

1811
02:50:57,880 --> 02:51:02,360
less likely to move. They're less likely to take deep breaths. Their risks of infections are, you

1812
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:07,160
know, going to go through the roof and complications. But it turns out, and this is a whole other issue,

1813
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:14,280
postoperative pain management is a very poorly handled area. And there are lots of things that

1814
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:18,680
you can manage pain with using a very, you had a good epidural, you know, a good epidural is the

1815
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:24,120
beginning of all great pain management following surgery and liberal use of NSAIDs in Tylenol and

1816
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:28,920
things like that. And you can get away with minimal opiate use, if not any. In your case,

1817
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:32,360
you know, you had as big an operation as people get and to be able to get away with it is huge.

1818
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:36,680
There was one other thing that you were proposing that I thought in theory made sense,

1819
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:40,040
but I just thought there's no way they're going to go for it, which is just using exogenous ketones

1820
02:51:40,040 --> 02:51:44,920
as well throughout. Oh, and the other thing that you wanted, which I again, completely agree with.

1821
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:50,360
IV, IV ketones. Exactly. No dextrose. Instead of dextrose. Yes, no dextrose. And I was like.

1822
02:51:50,360 --> 02:51:55,560
Also because it would be such a shock to my system because I'm already a no card person for,

1823
02:51:56,200 --> 02:52:01,880
you know, two years and now I'm under the stress and now they're jamming a bunch of sugar into me.

1824
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:06,200
That can't be good. And I agreed with Jack on this that, you know, lactated ringers would have

1825
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:10,920
been the perfect intravenous solution and you could happily go days without glucose. But

1826
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:17,240
in the end they were like, look, don't tell us how to do it. What Dr. Wu said in his defense was,

1827
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:24,360
he said, the reason you came to me is because of my success rate. And the reason my success rate

1828
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:33,080
is what it is, is because we do everything exactly the same way. If we change any aspect of it,

1829
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:36,440
I can't guarantee you the same results that you're coming here for.

1830
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:42,760
So I forget, I think it was either the second day after your operation, your operation was a

1831
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:47,400
Wednesday and I got there on a Friday. Now I remember this. I remember September 12th. So

1832
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:54,280
yeah, I think that was a Wednesday. So I feel like I got there two days post-op and I thought you

1833
02:52:54,280 --> 02:53:04,120
looked amazing, but I could also see how frustrated you were that, okay, I did everything I was supposed

1834
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:09,400
to do. I had this stupid operation, but I think it was setting in that this was not, you weren't

1835
02:53:09,400 --> 02:53:16,840
going to be better in a week. No. And I think I even told you that so much of my frustration about it

1836
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:23,240
wasn't necessarily fear of dying, although that's a small part of it. It was more,

1837
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:29,480
this is just going to suck for a long time. Yeah. This is going to be really uncomfortable

1838
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:37,320
for a really long time. And it was. Yeah. You know, you developed atrial fibrillation post-op,

1839
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:41,880
which 20% of patients do. I didn't sleep for probably three weeks, you know, just couldn't get into a

1840
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:50,280
position comfortable enough to sleep. When you look back at that and look at where you are today,

1841
02:53:50,280 --> 02:53:55,800
where do you think you are in terms of percent recovery? I would say 90%.

1842
02:53:57,800 --> 02:54:04,440
So Dr. Wu was pretty on the money, right? Six months to recover 80 to 90%. Yes.

1843
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:12,840
Yes. That said, I've not picked up anything more than five pounds since the day we had lunch and

1844
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:18,360
went to see those pictures. I do remember also when you got back to Malibu after the surgery,

1845
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:24,440
I remember one day I called you and I was like, how was your walk today? And you were like,

1846
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:29,320
I didn't walk. And I said, how come? And you said it was too windy. And I was like,

1847
02:54:29,320 --> 02:54:33,240
what? And you were like, yeah, it was just too windy. I didn't want to go for a walk.

1848
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:38,840
And I was like, Rick, you got to go for a walk, man. And you were like, no, no, it's really windy.

1849
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:41,960
And you sent me a video showing me how windy it was. And I was like, all right, that was pretty

1850
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:47,080
windy. I'll give you that. But I also sensed, I mean, did you struggle during that first

1851
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:52,840
month coming home? Like even though you're back home and your pain is okay. Thank God that the

1852
02:54:52,840 --> 02:54:59,960
house didn't burn down until six weeks after the surgery. Because had it burned down two weeks

1853
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:05,480
after the surgery, I don't know how I would have been able to handle it. I mean, as uncomfortable

1854
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:11,480
and terrible as the experience was, at least the comfort of home got me through those first six

1855
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:19,240
weeks. The first night after the surgery where I stayed in San Francisco, that was my first night

1856
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:26,600
of not sleeping. And I attributed it more to I need the comfort of home. And then when I got

1857
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:31,560
home, I still couldn't sleep, but I was definitely more comfortable being home. And I remember the,

1858
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:35,960
you would send me the screenshots of your aura ring and it was, it was pretty bad for a while.

1859
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:39,640
It really was. And I gotta tell you, this is one of those things that I think in medicine,

1860
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:45,720
we don't get training on. Maybe it's changing today, but certainly I don't remember ever once

1861
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:51,240
spending a moment, not one second thinking about how is a patient going to sleep when they get home.

1862
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:57,880
And, and someone who's young and healthy like you, they get over it. But when you, when you start

1863
02:55:57,880 --> 02:56:03,000
operating on patients who are older or patients who already have even the slightest amount of

1864
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:09,560
cognitive impairment, that sleep deprivation, I've seen it on several occasions, it precipitates a

1865
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:13,880
spiral that they never get out of. Yes. Looking back at that, what's,

1866
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:17,160
what is the most profound thing you learned about yourself?

1867
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:28,600
I won't say this about myself, but I'll say it about being a human, that as humans, we can

1868
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,760
really handle much more than we think.

1869
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:37,160
It's interesting that the surgery would be something to point that out to you.

1870
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:43,800
I would have thought that you figured that out just based on what you'd learn through your,

1871
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:47,960
you know, going from zero pushups to a hundred pushups to me would be an even

1872
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:53,720
more remarkable example, but different. That made me think you can train to do anything,

1873
02:56:53,720 --> 02:57:01,080
which I do believe, but it's different than you can't train to do a surgery. That's just

1874
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:06,680
you just have to show up. Yeah. It's again, it's like a, something to overcome. It's different.

1875
02:57:09,720 --> 02:57:14,520
Your disposition makes it, I think somewhat easier, I think, as an outsider looking in

1876
02:57:14,520 --> 02:57:19,720
at you as a friend to go through these things. But at the same time, I guess it also, the

1877
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:24,120
challenges, people don't always know what you're going through. When you think back on that two

1878
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:28,920
years of depression, were the people you were working with aware of what you were going through

1879
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:35,160
or were you able to do your job well enough that people weren't necessarily aware of that?

1880
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:38,840
I could usually hold it together enough where people might not notice.

1881
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:45,960
What are you most interested in passing on to your son and maybe assuming you have other kids,

1882
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:51,240
but in terms of lessons you've learned in life, experiences, both positive and negative,

1883
02:57:51,240 --> 02:57:56,520
I feel like one of the beauties of having kids, I was talking with Eric before when we were just

1884
02:57:56,520 --> 02:58:00,200
walking around and he was giving me a tour of the studio and there's that beautiful

1885
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:05,160
tree. Well, there's a tree that's been cut down. It was a tree that just fell. Yeah. Yeah. And

1886
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:11,000
like a week ago. Yeah. Yeah. And I had to take a picture of it because the cross section of that

1887
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:18,440
tree is so beautiful and only because my middle son has become obsessed with counting the rings

1888
02:58:18,440 --> 02:58:22,920
of trees, did I even notice it. And we went up and we were like talking and I was like, oh my God,

1889
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:28,600
look at this year versus this year versus this year. We were agreeing that because he's got a

1890
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:33,560
young child as well, that one of the cool things about having kids is you get to rediscover things

1891
02:58:33,560 --> 02:58:38,840
that you once knew about that you've since forgotten about and now you get re-reminded of it.

1892
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:44,040
I also think another part of having kids that anyone listening to this who has kids appreciates

1893
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:49,880
is there's this desire to protect them from the things that hurt us. So when you reflect on all

1894
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:59,080
of these things, the successes, the failures, the fear, the pain, knowing that your son has to find

1895
02:58:59,080 --> 02:59:06,120
his own way in this world, what do you want to impart on him? To try to have as much fun as possible

1896
02:59:07,720 --> 02:59:18,360
to be prepared to work hard for the thing that you're interested in doing, whatever it is,

1897
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:26,920
knowing that anything that's worth doing is going to take a commitment and you have to work hard and

1898
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:33,800
it feels good. Work isn't something to be avoided, it's to be embraced, but balanced with that idea

1899
02:59:33,800 --> 02:59:44,280
of having fun, which I did not have. I had more of a workaholic side and I think so much of it has

1900
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:51,720
less to do with what we wish to impart and more to do with what we will really impart, which is

1901
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:57,640
just based on how we live our lives. So it's not about what I can tell him, it's about

1902
02:59:58,760 --> 03:00:03,880
what you can show him, living a loving relationship, living in a loving household

1903
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:11,320
where we care about each other and making sure he always knows how much we love him and are there

1904
03:00:11,320 --> 03:00:21,000
for him through demonstration. Rick, it's been awesome to sit down and have this discussion in

1905
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:25,560
what I'm willing to say is the greatest place I will ever sit down to record a podcast. I'm

1906
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:30,520
willing to predict that already. I will never again get to record a podcast in an environment

1907
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:36,680
so beautiful. Until our next one. Yes, there you go. And above all else, I want to say, I was

1908
03:00:36,680 --> 03:00:40,200
partially worried that we were going to do this in a sauna like you did with Tim.

1909
03:00:41,240 --> 03:00:45,480
I remember after I heard that, because that was years ago, right? Yeah. I was like, Tim,

1910
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:51,960
how did you not electrocute yourself with the recording device getting just sweating all over

1911
03:00:51,960 --> 03:00:56,280
the thing? And he's like, yeah, it was tough. And the real issue was that we were holding

1912
03:00:56,280 --> 03:01:02,440
the microphones, which were burning hot. Yeah. That became the problem. This was your idea.

1913
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:06,360
There's no way this was Tim's idea. No, it was my idea. Yeah. Thank you for not subjecting me to

1914
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:10,760
that. As much as I do enjoy sauna, I don't think I could. It was kind of a one-time thing. And it

1915
03:01:10,760 --> 03:01:19,240
really was a case of having done a lot of saunas at that period of time, I realized that the

1916
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:28,840
conversations that happen in the sauna are really good. So it helps to turn off a part of your brain

1917
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:39,240
that's maybe more guarded. You're preoccupied in the sauna with survival. Yeah. Same as true as

1918
03:01:39,240 --> 03:01:45,960
like within ice bath. You've done many ice baths. Yeah. And you're experimenting with meditation.

1919
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:51,560
Now I know the best meditations you've had in your life, I guarantee you were in the ice bath,

1920
03:01:51,560 --> 03:01:59,240
whether you knew it or not, because it's a one-pointed activity where the other problems of the

1921
03:01:59,240 --> 03:02:05,240
world don't come with you into the ice bath. That's a great point. It's a forced meditation.

1922
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:12,840
You don't have to do anything but survive. But because of that, you are very present and in the

1923
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:20,840
moment. I look forward to giving that a try deliberately. Yes. All right. Is it time for

1924
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:26,920
that awesome dinner I've been waiting for all day? Let's do it. You can find all of this
