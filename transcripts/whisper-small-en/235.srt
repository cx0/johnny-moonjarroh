00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,120
Well, Lane, we're back for another round of this, but this time we finally get to do it in person.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,800
Yeah, I'm looking forward to this. This will be a, I said it'd be a little bit different.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
So let's talk about your training because right now you are training for the worlds in powerlifting.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
We had a great chance to kind of catch up on some of your training yesterday. I probably won't get

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
into as much detail as you and I got into last night because that might be more detailed than

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,160
the average non-nerd is interested in. But maybe just briefly kind of explain the sport of power

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,680
lifting. You know, there are three lifts, how it works. And then I want to talk about kind of how

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
you're training for that and some of the challenges of that. Yeah. So power lifting is a very basic

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
sport. Like you mentioned, there's three lifts, the squat, the bench press, the deadlift, and they go

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,880
in that order. You get three attempts on each and they're progressive. So for example, once you put

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,800
in an attempt, like let's say you put in a squat attempt of 550 pounds for your opener, if you miss

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,800
it, you can't go down. So usually the way people do it is, you know, first attempt is a pretty

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,120
conservative weight, kind of like a last warm up. Second attempt is getting close to something that's,

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,000
you know, pretty reasonable, like, you know, RPE 9, 9.5. And then your last one, you're hoping to

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,120
get kind of your true maximum. And it's basically highest total wins. Between the three different

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,280
lifts. Correct. So at Worlds, they will give medals for individual lifts. So there'll be a

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
gold, silver, and bronze for squat, gold, silver, bronze for bench press, and gold, silver, bronze

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
for deadlift. And then there'll be those medals also for the overall. And the overall is just the

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,600
summation of the total of the number of lifts you hit. So when you do your three squat, three bench,

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,080
three dead, are you doing them in that order or are you going? Yeah. Yeah. So it's you do all three

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,040
squats go, then all three bench press, then all three deadlift. Typically how much time in between

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,120
each attempt? Yeah. So it just, it can really depend. The last time I did Worlds in 2015,

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,960
that was a very, very fast meet. So in our flight, there was only 11 people. So meaning, you know,

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,920
you have the person who has the lightest squat will go first up to the heaviest squat. And then

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,280
those will continue to cycle through. Same thing for bench press thing for deadlift. And the whole

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,600
meet took over just, just over two hours. But I've been in meets that have taken as long as three

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,560
and a half. So it really just depends on your flight, how quickly the spotters. But if I'm doing

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,240
the math, I mean, that means you might only have 15 minutes between lifts. Usually you'll get about

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,160
at least 30 because the way they run it is there's, there's no real breaks for people who are

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,680
spectating. So they'll have two flights going at the same time. So what'll happen is they'll have

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
an A flight and a B flight typically. Sometimes they'll have C flights as well if they're, if it's

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,840
a really, really packed meet like Nationals. But at Worlds, it's usually just an A and a B flight.

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,320
And they just separate those based on opening squats. And usually the B flight will have the

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,800
top lifters in it. So you have some time. So you're, while the other folks are lifting,

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,600
you're typically warming up, getting ready. And then once, for example, the squats are finished,

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,440
A flight will start for bench. And then if you're in B flight, you can have time to warm up.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
So what are you doing between? So let's just say between lift one and two,

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,880
lift one shouldn't have been that stressful if you did it correctly.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,480
Is, does your, does what you eat matter much? Does how you, are you getting any tissue work? Like what,

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
what do you need to do? Let's just say you have 30 minutes between those attempts. What do you need

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,920
to do to maximize your odds? So usually between the lifts themselves, like between squat and bench

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,000
press, we'll have 30 to 60 minutes, depending on how quickly things are going. But what about between

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,480
the squat attempts? Like between the actual attempts themselves? I mean, I'll take a drink

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,520
of water. I might like throw some candy in or something like that really quickly if I feel like

46
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,400
I need it. But for the most part, I'm just mentally trying to get myself in the right zone.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,400
And it is a little bit tricky because you can't keep yourself at that really high level of arousal

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,840
the entire time because you'll just wear out really quickly. So for me, the trick is bringing

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,360
that arousal down for about, you know, five minutes or so, so that I can just relax just enough,

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,080
and then start to focus back up. And it's almost like, it's like a wave, you're kind of letting

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,120
yourself come down. And then when the time is right, and really timing is a big thing in this,

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,880
because once the bar is loaded, they call bar is loaded, you'll have one minute to get the down

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,720
command for squat or bench press or whatever it is. So really, and there can be mistakes where

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,160
like maybe you come out and you forgot your belt or you something happens. So I really try to make

55
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
it to where when they say bar is loaded, I get out there very quickly so that if there is anything

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,760
wrong, I can address it and have time. So really timing it and saying, okay, how many people were

57
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,040
in front of me? How long do I need to amp up? Usually for me, I like to have about two or three

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,320
minutes to really get like very aroused and very amped up. And so just trying to time that correctly

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
is kind of tough. But like I said, for the first five minutes afterwards, I kind of let myself

60
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,760
come down, but I never like truly relax. I'm still like got my music on. I'm still thinking

61
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,120
about what I've got to do, but I'm not like really hyper focusing. And then as it starts to come into

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,840
the last five minutes for the lift, you know, I'm putting whatever I need on to focus myself,

63
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,360
you know, mental imagery, visualization. And then by the end, I'm even doing like breath work. Like

64
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,960
I really I want my heart rate to be about 160 170. By the time I go out to hit my left, like I want

65
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
to be very amped. Yeah, I was gonna ask you what your heart rate got to. I would imagine your blood

66
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,240
glucose is probably about 160 as well. Probably. I've never. Your liver is just, you know, hepatic

67
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,120
glucose output at the max. Yeah. I mean, you know, your stress hormones are going to be high. You know,

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,720
it's really interesting. I was a little bit off topic, but I was listening to a sports psychologist

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:42,400
talk about how the differences between excitement and anxiety are and anxiousness are almost you

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,120
can't almost pick them out. It's just your perception. And I remembered when I played

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,960
baseball in high school, I would come up to the plate with the thought process of don't strike out.

72
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
You don't want to look stupid. Just put the ball in play. It wasn't the process of I'm going to

73
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,760
drive these runs in. I'm going to, you know, do X, Y, Z. And I was watching an episode of the ultimate

74
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,560
fighter probably 13, 14 years ago is where Matt Sarah versus Matt Hughes. And one of the fighters

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,280
was getting like really like like vomiting before a match because he was so nervous and he was over

76
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,120
the bucket going, I can't do this anymore. I hate the way this feels. I can't do this. And Matt

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Sarah just looked at him and said, what are you talking about, man? That's the feeling of being

78
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,720
alive. You care about something so much that your body is reacting this way. And ever since then,

79
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,960
it completely flipped the way I looked at competition. And so now before when I would

80
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,200
get nervous playing baseball, I would try to like calm myself down. Like, why can't I feel normal?

81
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Why don't I feel relaxed? And now when I feel those nerves start to kick in, I just tell myself,

82
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
this is a good thing. This is a good thing. This is your body getting you ready. This is you being

83
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,480
ready to go. And really like that reframing of things and just accepting and being okay with

84
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,720
the anxiety has helped me so much. Yeah. Well, I think, you know, something like that in power

85
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,880
lifting where the stakes are really high and it's really short. It's not like, you know, in tennis,

86
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:23,280
you can have one bad match, right? Or one bad serve and it doesn't end the entire thing. In power

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
lifting, it can. And I guess the other thing I guess is the stakes are kind of high from an injury

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,000
standpoint as well because you are pushing at your limit. Have you ever injured yourself in a meet?

89
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,280
So not to the point where I couldn't continue or, you know, had really bad pain during, but at the

90
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,560
Arnold in 2015, at the Arnold Pro meet, I had aggravated my back a week out pretty badly.

91
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,440
And then the day of the meet when I hit my last squat, which was 661 pounds,

92
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,520
I kind of rotated a little bit coming up. And the next day I could definitely feel it like in my,

93
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,160
it was actually closer to my upper lumbar or lower thoracic. I definitely had quite a bit of

94
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,480
pain there. So what's interesting is you don't, you typically don't see people get injured at

95
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,520
meets. It does happen, but I would say that it's less frequent than during training. That's, I don't

96
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,360
have any data on that. I'm just guessing. But I think part of it is you are so focused and you are

97
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,800
so excited. You're very tight. Like you're, you're very, you know, conscious of what you're doing.

98
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,840
At the end of the day, it is just one rep where I've tended.

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Yeah. Where's the volume when you're training and you're also probably more broken down and

100
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
more fatigued. Yeah. So when you get ready for a meet, if you've done your due diligence,

101
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,920
hopefully you've kind of dissipated a lot of that fatigue to, you know, rest and tapering.

102
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,120
Whereas when you're in the throws of training and you just kind of high levels of fatigue,

103
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
maybe you're just not able to execute the lifts as well because of that fatigue.

104
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,480
Um, that's where things tend to happen, especially like if you're doing, you know,

105
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,960
multiple repetitions as you get closer to failure, just the opportunity to get out of position or

106
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,600
make mistakes, those sorts of things. So it is definitely, uh, one of the things that, you know,

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,280
is part of the game. Um, like you're just going to deal with pain. Um, but I always tell people to

108
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:30,400
like, you know, I'm 40 now and most 40 year olds, 50 year olds, they have pain anyway. So I'd rather

109
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,320
be strong and have pain than be weak and have pain. How many times a year can you peak for a meet

110
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,000
or maybe not necessarily even you, but at the top level of powerlifting, how many really good meets

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,960
in a year does it, does it lift or have? So I, this is just completely my opinion. Uh,

112
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,280
and it's, it's based on my own experience, but for me, I've done it where I've only, I've done one,

113
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,040
I've done it where I've done like four level meets. Four was way too much. Um,

114
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,520
I think probably two is the sweet spot for me. Um, you know, it gives you time to really,

115
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't think I've ever gone into a meet and just been like, Oh, I feel a hundred percent healthy

116
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
and nothing hurts or anything like that. It's, it's kind of, it's not the same thing as getting

117
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,040
ready for like a fight, but I mean, in order to be able to execute a heavy lift, you have to lift

118
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,160
heavy. And so part of that is you're going to accumulate some from dinks and some dunks.

119
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:37,040
And so really it's about getting to competition day with enough fitness level in terms of being

120
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,000
able to execute heavy lifts while dissipating fatigue and being in low enough levels of pain

121
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,840
that you can execute. Um, and so afterwards, really, it's always been the most dangerous when

122
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,560
I feel good after a meet. Cause then I just tend to like go in like on Monday and say, well, let's

123
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,480
get right back into training. And really the smart thing to do is just to take some time, you know,

124
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,880
train for fun, you know, keep that core strength, but move more towards accessory movements and

125
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,040
things that don't beat me up so much for several months, then kind of reenter like a more of a,

126
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
like building accumulation phase where volume is going up, but the weights still aren't super heavy.

127
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,040
And then those last three, four months, four week, now it's time to start putting in, you know,

128
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,000
more heavy weights and starting to ramp up towards where the end, I mean, like by the end of my

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,120
training, I'm mostly on my competition lifts, just hitting heavy singles. So that's where I want to

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:40,480
talk about is, um, what can the rest of us who aren't power lifters learn just about strength?

131
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
Because if I wanted to frame this for a listener, cause people have heard me talk about this, but

132
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,840
the two metrics that are most significantly associated with longevity. Uh, so if we were

133
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,320
to stack up every possible known risk factors, the smoking type two diabetes, high blood pressure,

134
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,080
coronary artery disease, end state kidney disease, whatever. And we were to talk about

135
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,200
how much of a hazard ratio do these bring to you in terms of all cause mortality.

136
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,120
They're, they're quite big, you know, hypertension is about a 20%. Uh, type two diabetes is about a

137
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:25,200
30% increase in mortality. Smoking is 50% increase being weak relative to being strong is about 250%.

138
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,800
Having a very low VO two max in the bottom 25% of the population versus being in the top

139
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,600
two and a half percent of the population is about 400%. So when you line everything up, the two things

140
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,440
that stand out the most are incredible cardio respiratory fitness as measured by VO two max

141
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,400
and strength. And then a third is muscle mass. But I think when you look at the data, you realize

142
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,320
muscle mass is so coupled to strength that that association is tight. The point being is if you're

143
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
listening to this podcast and thus far into this podcast, your eyes are sort of glazing over as

144
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,520
we're sitting here talking about powerlifting. It's probably worth pointing out that even if you

145
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,320
never once care to do a heavy squat or heavy bench press or a heavy deadlift, you have to be strong.

146
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,240
And in these studies where these associations continue to show up over and over and over,

147
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,960
again, they're using things like grip strength, bench press, leg extension, things that are a

148
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,160
little less technical. But the point remains, anybody who's going to a power meet and crushing

149
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,120
a deadlift has pretty strong grip strength. So I think it becomes important for people to

150
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,120
understand how to train for power. And so let's now talk a little bit about that. So if a person

151
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,520
comes to you and says, I want to get stronger, and that's my primary objective in the weight room,

152
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,440
it's more so than the aesthetic, because we're going to talk about that later. What are some of

153
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,440
the principles they need to keep in mind? So what's interesting is the principles are pretty much

154
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,360
the same. It's just the level to which they're applied. And I think it's important to point out

155
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,240
that there are diminishing returns with strength and turn. Well, I'm sure there are. The studies

156
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
are refined enough to pick this out at this point, because it's not like they're getting a population

157
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,800
of power lifters looking at their longevity. But my guess is that at a certain point, you pretty

158
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
much get all the benefits and just getting even stronger is probably not going to give you more.

159
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,640
Especially if it comes at the risk of injury that can later on in life.

160
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,240
Sure. And then I think like, you also see with like running, there's kind of like a J shaped curve.

161
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,480
Part of me thinks that just the people that take it so far, whether it be powerlifting, running,

162
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,440
whatever, that it's not that their sport makes them more prone to more to early mortality,

163
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
but more so that they probably have other behaviors of being an extremist that probably

164
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,400
contribute to that. Interesting. But I think that's something that I think

165
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,040
as far as strength goes, really what we're talking about is progressive overload.

166
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,320
I mean, that that is the most important core principle. And it actually really applies to

167
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
a lot of things in life, to be quite honest. But when it comes to lifting weights, a lot of people

168
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,880
hear progressive overload and they just think weight on the bar. And that is the most simple

169
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,560
way to explain it, right? So if you come in, you've never done some sort of squat movement before,

170
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
and you do 95 pounds for five reps. And then the next week you come in, you do a hundred.

171
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,160
And the next week coming into you to 105. At the same number of reps.

172
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,000
At the same number of reps, right? You know, that is a form of progressive overload. And most people,

173
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,240
when they enter the gym, that's kind of their experience. They don't need to increase that

174
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,440
number. They don't need to really, they can increase the reps. But for the most part,

175
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,720
when you first start going to the gym, you're just going to be able to put more weight on the bar

176
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,360
pretty much every week. And that is a perfectly reasonable way to progress. And I mean, even,

177
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,280
you know, I know we haven't gotten here yet, but people will say, well, you know, I'm post-mental

178
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,200
pause a woman or I'm a 75 year old male. Like it's too late for me. No, it's not. Now is the best

179
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,560
time. In fact, when I was at University of Illinois, where I was in a department of nutritional

180
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,280
sciences right across the street in the exercise physiology department, they were conducting a

181
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,680
study on frail elderly. So people who basically almost couldn't couldn't really walk like they

182
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,040
could, but it was very tough for them. And they just started progressive overloading them. And

183
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,040
that looked like basically squatting to a really high chair to start. Right. And what they saw was

184
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,600
incredible in like 12 weeks, they actually had people who could squat down to like a below

185
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,440
parallel chair and come back up, which may not sound like much for the average person. But when

186
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,920
you're talking about somebody who's, you know, frail elderly, the difference in functionality

187
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,080
and their lifestyle is going to be incredible in terms of what they can do. So what I'll tell people

188
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,040
is what you can learn from power lifters is that progressive overload one in terms of weight on the

189
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,240
bar, but nobody's able to increase weight on the bar forever. That that's just, it's not going to

190
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,560
happen. And the longer you get into it, the more nonlinear it's going to be. It's going to be,

191
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,440
you're going to go down and come up and go down and come back up. But there's also other ways to

192
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,560
progressively overload, one being more repetitions and the other being adding more hard sets. So

193
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,600
the latter adding more hard sets is really something you only need to get to as you get to

194
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,840
be more advanced. Because like I said, you're not going to be able to add strength forever and you're

195
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,320
not going to be able to add reps forever either. So by the way, this is one thing that from one of

196
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,280
our earlier discussions that really started to change my training, I started adding a little

197
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:13,360
bit more set at slightly lower RPE to net increase volume. So I was, I think doing a lot more RPE 8,

198
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,000
9 stuff, but you can only get a few sets at that level. Like you're really, really spent. And instead

199
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,120
I was saying, well, wait a minute, why don't we do a little more RPE 6 and 7 and add more sets,

200
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,040
more volume. One, I feel like it's lowering my risk of injury. And two, as you said, it's really

201
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,520
just another way to progressively overload. Yeah. And you're always weighing those two things,

202
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,320
kind of your stimulus versus fatigue ratio. And that's something, so I'm coached by a guy named

203
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:48,000
Zach Robinson, who's doing his PhD in Mike Zordos' lab at FAU, great lab. And he talks about stimulus

204
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,720
versus fatigue a lot. And they do a lot of training in that kind of RPE 5 to 6 area, which

205
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,600
some people call that easy. When it comes to compound lift, I wouldn't really call it easy.

206
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,440
But it's kind of like, how can we maximize our stimulus and minimize fatigue? And if you're

207
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,480
talking about an RPE 9, for example, how many sets at RPE 9 can you get?

208
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,280
I don't know about you. I have like one to two.

209
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,200
Right. Right. Before you really have to drop the weight down or whatnot.

210
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,840
Or before someone like me who's not at the level that a power lift is at,

211
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,920
my form starts to compromise. Right. And Mike Israel actually had a great kind of take on this

212
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,600
too, in terms of training to failure. He's like, if you take a squat, like a free barbell squat to

213
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,800
failure for 10 reps, and then you try to do another set with that same weight, how many reps will you

214
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:53,360
get? I mean, I know from doing sets to failure of 10 reps of free barbell squat, I might not even

215
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,160
be able to get like two or three reps on my next set because it's just so fatiguing.

216
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,320
So that is one thing that's important to point out when we talk about RPEs, which is kind of a

217
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,080
measure for proximity to failure. Yeah. I guess just we talked about it on a previous podcast.

218
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,920
Why don't you tell people how RPE works? Because I think it's really a fantastic system.

219
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
But you do need to push yourself in the gym to really understand what they feel like.

220
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:28,480
Yeah. So RPE is kind of a, it's been adapted from running to lifting and it's on a scale of one to

221
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:36,000
10 or I guess even zero, but RPE 10 being you had no more reps left. That was your absolute all out,

222
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:44,000
like a hundred percent effort. RPE 9 is you could have done one more rep, RPE 8, one more rep,

223
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,520
so on and so forth. And one of the issues is we know you don't have to train to failure to grow

224
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,720
muscle. In fact, it may actually be a little bit counterproductive just in terms of the fatigue

225
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,320
that it causes relative to the stimulus. We know that, you know, for most movements,

226
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,480
you get most of the hypertrophy and strength benefits going within a few reps of failure.

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,840
So RPE like seven, eight. And obviously if you can do more volume, it may be even more beneficial.

228
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,880
But the downside is if you've never actually taken something to failure, like true failure,

229
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,600
people are really bad at estimating it. And so it was beginners and intermediates. They find that

230
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,480
they tend to underestimate their RPE by about five, which is pretty incredible. And we've seen it in

231
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,360
the lab, like we'll take somebody in and they'll put a weight on, they'll do a rep and-

232
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,440
And you'll ask them what's your RPE right now?

233
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,640
What was that like? And they'll say their RPE and then the research will actually make them take it

234
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,960
to failure while they're like yelling at them and encouraging them. And on average, they'll get five

235
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,720
more reps than they estimated they would have. I can totally believe that.

236
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:06,400
Yeah. Whereas when they look at RPE validity and advanced lifters, it tends to be much more

237
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
accurate, much more accurate. So there was actually a study, I was in a powerlifting meet

238
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,240
where they had a Tindo unit on the bar and they were measuring our bar velocity and they were

239
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:24,400
asking us to rate our RPE after every attempt. And they found that RPE as validated by velocity data

240
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,840
was a pretty good measure in that population of power lifters because they've taken so many sets

241
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,480
near failure. So your point is well taken. You do need some experience of going really hard and

242
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,000
really close to failure. But once you have that experience and you understand what that feels like,

243
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,560
then you can estimate better. You're probably better off staying a few reps shy of failure

244
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,640
and accumulating volume that way just because going to failure is just so incredibly fatiguing.

245
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,320
So for a person who, again, is not planning to go to a power meet,

246
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,800
is there a need for them to go below four reps in training?

247
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,480
I would say-

248
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
That's an arbitrary number, but you know what I'm getting at.

249
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,760
I would say probably not. I mean, you can get plenty strong, even doing sets of 10,

250
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
those sorts of things.

251
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,520
Oh, that's interesting. I would have thought you needed to get at least into the fives and

252
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,400
sixes sometimes.

253
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,560
But-

254
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,520
So you can get really strong doing sets 10, 15, those sorts of things. Now, you will not be as

255
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,040
strong even per cross-sectional area as somebody who trains for strength because strength is a

256
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:46,000
specific skill. And even like myself, you know, my best squat ever is a 668. And when I was, you know,

257
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,040
six months out from that, it's not like I, you know, I added weight to the bar that I was able

258
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,640
to squat, but it's not like I added that much more lean body mass because I didn't.

259
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:05,440
I was practicing the skill of a one rep max, which allowed me to better do the one rep max.

260
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,520
And you were practicing at what percent of ultimately became 661?

261
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,360
Usually around 90, 95, but not very much at 95, mostly at 90 for like singles.

262
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
And what was your RPE when you did those singles?

263
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,040
So usually about eight and a half or nine.

264
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,280
Yeah.

265
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,800
Okay. So you would do multiple of that. Just doing the math. Let's just say that's 620 or

266
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,520
something like that.

267
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,920
Yes.

268
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,760
Yeah. So let's say it's called 600 pounds. So you would do a 600 pound signal

269
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,680
three times in a workout.

270
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,880
Something like that.

271
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,200
Okay.

272
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,680
And what you're, what you're kind of making gains on at that point is just your

273
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,040
one, it just teaches you how to grind through a lift because a lot of people have never had

274
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,440
the experience of really sticking with a lift. And interestingly, the more advanced somebody

275
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,040
gets in terms of strength, the slower their one rep max velocity will be.

276
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,960
And we see this in research studies all the time.

277
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,280
Somebody who's kind of new will come in, they will absolutely smoke a weight.

278
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,760
You put five pounds on and then they get stapled because it's just,

279
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,040
they don't have that grind capacity.

280
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,000
They don't, they don't know how to do it. And part of that may be psychological,

281
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,920
but part of that's probably physiological too.

282
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,640
So interesting.

283
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,680
In terms of you just haven't trained your body to recruit all the fibers that it can get.

284
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,800
So, you know, lean body mass and strength are very closely tied together.

285
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,360
But when it gets to those finer levels of strength, it's kind of just practicing

286
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
the actual one rep max.

287
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:43,920
So when it comes to getting strong, you can absolutely get strong doing sets 10, 15,

288
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,520
because you're increasing your lean body mass.

289
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,120
Do you need to do sets of three, four? No.

290
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,040
But what I would say is don't necessarily count them out because a lot of people actually just

291
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,800
do really well with variety.

292
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,400
So, you know, periodization was kind of a big thing for lifting back in the day.

293
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,640
And now we've kind of shown that at least in the research studies, it doesn't appear to

294
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,480
produce greater gains in lean body mass, maybe a little bit better strength gains,

295
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
but that's probably just because people peak better when you're periodizing things.

296
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,160
But what tends to actually be shown is that people just tend to like periodization better

297
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,600
because they're varying their repetitions.

298
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
They're not as bored, right?

299
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,440
So you never want to kind of poo-poo the psychological effects of those things.

300
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,800
I talk about this with diet as well.

301
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,960
Adherence is the most important thing, just getting people to come in and do it.

302
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,120
So especially for people who are coming into the gym, you know, if they're just trying to get

303
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,440
stronger and be healthy, well, for me, if I'm like talking to them or coaching them or whatever it is,

304
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
it's like, well, what do you enjoy?

305
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,920
What's going to get you to show up consistently, right?

306
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,240
Oh, you don't want a free squat? That's fine.

307
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,120
Let's leg press.

308
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,040
You know, there's many ways to skin a cat.

309
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,040
You don't want a barbell deadlift?

310
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,320
Okay, no problem.

311
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,640
Let's do some RDLs, you know, those sorts of things, you know, slightly less technical lifts.

312
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,480
They're still going to produce really great gains in terms of strength, lean body mass,

313
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,280
those sorts of things.

314
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:20,240
So if you're not going to specifically compete in a strength sport, there's so many paths to roam

315
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
in terms of getting stronger and increasing lean body mass.

316
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,800
So do you think there were some principles, for example, like let's say a person isn't

317
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
confident that they have the technical ability to execute a squat or a deadlift.

318
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,760
Let's look at a hip thruster.

319
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,920
Again, you can screw that up too, and you could hurt yourself, but it's a lot harder to hurt

320
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,800
yourself doing that.

321
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,480
Do you think there is still an essential need for some sort of compound movement,

322
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,240
like a hip thruster, at least as a compliment or a leg press, as you point out?

323
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
You know, it's pretty funny.

324
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,960
I went through a phase where everything I learned from the magazines, the bro science,

325
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
I was like, well, this all has to be junk, you know?

326
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,560
And now we're actually having studies come out that are validating some of this bro science

327
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,920
from like 20, 30 years ago.

328
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,960
So there does appear to be like different areas of the leg muscles, the quadriceps,

329
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,760
for example, that are better activated by say a leg extension compared to a leg press

330
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,200
compared to a squat.

331
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
So I do think it is good to have variety.

332
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,640
I think it is good to have compound lifts as well.

333
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,000
And in fact, there's some interesting data that suggests that you don't have to get as

334
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,360
close to failure on compound lifts to still get the same stimulation compared to isolation

335
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,000
exercises where you do seem to have to get much closer to failure to get those benefits.

336
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,560
But also just thinking about like, again, if we're kind of like looking at the longevity

337
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,840
or the quality of life piece, what is most analogous to what these people are going to

338
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
be doing or where they're going to be needing it?

339
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,040
Well, if it's bending over and picking something up, that's some kind of hinge,

340
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,200
right?

341
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,920
Some kind of hinge.

342
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,800
If it's sitting down and standing back up, some kind of squat.

343
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,560
Now, you can use variations, right?

344
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,440
And I would never, I don't want to say never because it's a superlative.

345
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,080
But I very rarely would take somebody who's like fresh off the street and just put a barbell on

346
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,520
their back and say, okay, learn how to squat because I mean, it's going to be like Bambi

347
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,560
trying to stand up, right?

348
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,480
Ideally, you're probably going to maybe even start them off with no weight and just teach them

349
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,280
how to hinge, how to use their hips, how to use their knees, how to track their legs with their

350
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,120
feet and those sorts of things and just balance.

351
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,480
Because if you've never put a barbell on your back, I mean, it's not a comfortable position.

352
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,320
And honestly, to do it well, you shouldn't feel comfortable.

353
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,720
You should feel very tight most places.

354
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,800
And then once they're established with that, then moving to where they're holding a kettlebell in

355
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,320
front of them, and then you can progress with weight with that.

356
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,640
And then maybe you progress to something like a safety bar where they're not having to worry

357
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,480
so much about hands and whatnot to a box and then eventually take the box away.

358
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,720
And then maybe then you can progress to a barbell squat.

359
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,120
But I would say that, you know, the Puritan and me would be like, yes, everybody should barbell

360
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,440
squat. But I know that that's not true.

361
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,880
I think the biggest thing is just getting something close and analogous to the things

362
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
that are going to be important in your day to day life.

363
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,520
As you get older, especially if, you know, quality of life is important to you.

364
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,320
And I mean, when we talk about, you know, people who fall as elderly, I think I read something

365
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,920
insane, like half the people over age 65 who go in the hospital for a fall never come out.

366
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,840
Or I think it's something of that nature.

367
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, I mean, I've seen many studies on this.

368
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,160
The one that sticks out in my mind was 30 to 40 percent of people over the age of 65

369
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,440
who break their hip will not live will be dead within a year of that insult.

370
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,520
Yeah, because you got infection and then you have that you're also like,

371
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
they're going to have to be immobilized.

372
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,320
Right. And then they get pneumonia or adelectasis pneumonia or something like that.

373
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,080
So, yeah, it's it's awful.

374
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,320
I mean, I think, you know, there's a study and I think I even mentioned this on a previous

375
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
podcast, but we should link to it.

376
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,000
It was an Australian study that took a group of older women.

377
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,480
I don't remember exactly how old they were, but they certainly looked like they were in

378
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,160
their 60s or above who all had osteo, at least osteopenia, if not osteoporosis.

379
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,720
And it put them on a relatively unsophisticated lifting program, unsophisticated in that there

380
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,160
wasn't a lot of instruction other than just pick up weights.

381
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,120
It was mostly just pick up weights.

382
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,840
And as I saw the video on YouTube of the P.I. discussing this, isn't it fantastic?

383
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,640
Because they're in this totally old school gym and you've got these old ladies picking up weights,

384
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
walking around some of them getting really I remember one lady was picking up her body

385
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,920
weight. Yeah.

386
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,840
I mean, she was basically deadlifting her body weight.

387
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,320
Yeah.

388
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,880
These are women who had never lifted a weight before and their symptoms just got so much better.

389
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Absolutely. And I mean, the best thing you can do for like bone density is lift weight.

390
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
So this isn't like a mutually exclusive thing.

391
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,680
In fact, people get really focused on the bone density portion of this when we talk about falls

392
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,480
and whatnot. So they get very focused on how do we keep them from breaking their

393
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
hip? What if they didn't fall in the first place?

394
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,120
Yeah.

395
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,280
Right. What if they had the strength to catch themselves?

396
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,000
Exactly. Yeah.

397
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The balance to catch themselves. And then like, again, even if they did fall, if you have more

398
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,800
muscle mass, you're probably going to have more bone density as well. These are all things that

399
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:49,920
are going to help. And, you know, resistance training is great because you can have these

400
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,600
other sort of interventions that can improve lean body mass and whatnot.

401
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,720
But they all work way better with resistance training because you're creating the need

402
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,240
for the tissue. And that's something I think that has been missed a little bit is the

403
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,520
teleological perspective of this, which is you have to give your body a reason to lay down tissue.

404
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,120
Muscle tissue is pretty energetically expensive, relatively speaking. So again,

405
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm kind of speaking philosophically, but the body is not just going to go, oh, yeah,

406
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,480
we got some extra calories. Let's just lay down some lean tissue. It doesn't make sense because

407
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,560
from the body's perspective, the number one thing it's trying to do is keep you alive long enough

408
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,280
to reproduce. And then once you've done that, just trying to prevent you from starving,

409
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,440
like the risk of dying from starvation over the course of human history is way is magnitudes

410
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,760
greater than like diseases from too much nutrition. I mean, that's basically a 20th,

411
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,720
21st century problem. So the idea that, oh, well, like if I eat some higher protein, I can lay down

412
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,400
some more lean body mass. Yeah, you can, but it's going to be really, really minimal compared to

413
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,320
what you can build through resistance training. And then when you couple resistance training with

414
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,480
high enough protein or, you know, any of these other modalities, now you're creating the turnover

415
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:22,160
in the tissue that the body has the requirement to lay down that tissue. So what do we know about

416
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,600
the peak capacity for strength as a person ages? Does this differ between men and women? And I'm

417
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,160
sure there's variability for people, but I mean, on a per pound basis, are you stronger today than

418
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,280
you were at 20? Yeah, I am stronger today than I was at 20. Are you stronger than you were at 35?

419
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,920
No, no, that's come off my peak a little bit. But that's, I don't think that's like a

420
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,480
sarcopenia thing. I just think that that's accumulation of injuries and not being able

421
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,640
to train the way I used to be able to train. Okay. So I used to be able to train much harder

422
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,320
than I can train now. Like my, my governor is not the work ethic. It's the, it's the, okay,

423
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,680
how hard can I train before the pain level gets too high? So it's not that you're losing type

424
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,360
two fibers, that you're losing some of the 2A or 2B fibers, and that that's why you're not quite

425
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,480
as strong. Would you, do you believe that on a muscle biopsy basis, you're, you could be as

426
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,760
strong now as you were at 30? I think I probably could. Yeah. It's, it's, if you look at the

427
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,040
research literature, you do see differences between young and old, but most of those get

428
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,240
ameliorated when you start adding in resistance training. And more to your point, you know,

429
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,360
the idea of how much strength could I gain? How much lean mass could I gain?

430
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,000
Based on what I've seen, so let's take men and women, for example,

431
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,480
women have been shown to gain just as much lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass.

432
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,480
It is the relative increase. So for example, if people add 10% lean mass, something like that.

433
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,920
Well, if you're a male and you have, you know, 70 kilos of lean mass, now you're 77. If you're a

434
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,840
female, you had 50 kilos of lean mass, now you're 55, right? So the male added seven kilos, the female

435
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,480
added five kilos, but relative to their start, they added the same. And that's what the research

436
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,360
literature says is they pretty much can add the same amount as a percentage of their starting lean

437
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,440
mass and the same thing for strength. And actually, there's some evidence that women

438
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,200
may be able to tolerate higher training volumes than men too. Now, I'm not sure if that's-

439
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,560
Is that across all ages, you think? Or is that within a certain age?

440
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,880
They've only really looked at it in kind of young adults, like 20s and 30s. So it's hard to say.

441
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,560
But I wonder if that's just more of a function of they're just smaller bodies handling less weight.

442
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,960
I do- My wife would tell you that no one can handle a cold less than me. And I think it's true.

443
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,960
I have an insanely high pain tolerance, except for when my sinuses are congested and I have a

444
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,000
miserable cough and I turn into a little baby. So there might be something about women just being

445
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,080
tougher too. Yeah, I think. So I've thought about this quite a bit. So if you look at,

446
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,920
let's look at super heavyweight power lifters, just an extremely simple, right?

447
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
And these are guys that weigh over what? What's the-

448
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, like Ray Williams, for example. So he's one of the greatest drug tested power lifters in history.

449
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,880
First man to raw squat over a thousand pounds. He was a college football player. They dexed him.

450
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,160
He had 308 pounds of lean mass and he's probably over 400 pounds of total body weight.

451
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
How much? Lean mass?

452
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:49,120
Over 300 pounds. Incredible. Now, his, like, let's say we're talking about working with 80%

453
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,680
of a one rat max. His 80% is 800 pounds. A female is 80% if she's doing a one rat max of 300 pounds

454
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,080
is 240 pounds. They're the same percentage. I'm not sure that you can say that the same thing in

455
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,000
terms of what happens with the body. I know- Because at the end of the day,

456
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,160
connective tissue is connective tissue. Right. I know very, very few super heavyweight power lifters

457
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,240
who train the main lifts like three, four times a week, like some of the lighter weight classes do.

458
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,040
So I do think there's something about like the absolute load. So part of me thinks the idea

459
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,400
that women can recover a little bit better might be that they're just using absolute lower loads,

460
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,560
but we'd have to have some more intricate research.

461
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,400
Now, there's an interesting point about that study because I know the one that you were talking about

462
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,680
and I've heard people use that study to suggest that testosterone is not important

463
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,280
in muscle gain. The idea being if women can add 10% to their base and men are adding 10% to their

464
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,000
base, clearly men and women have a log full difference in testosterone. Therefore,

465
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,160
testosterone doesn't matter. But of course, you only need to look at tested versus untested

466
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,760
power lifters and bodybuilders to know testosterone is doing something. So how do you reconcile these?

467
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,640
I think part of it is, so if we look at like, let's take the men and women example.

468
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,960
One of the main benefits of testosterone is the increase in satellite cell number that you get,

469
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,000
which is going to increase your potential for increasing muscle mass. So I don't want to talk

470
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,440
about this like it's hard and stone proven, but there's a theory out there I tend to agree with

471
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,080
called the myonuclear domain theory. So for those people who aren't familiar with satellite cells,

472
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:47,280
satellite cells are quescent cells that sit on kind of the outside of a muscle fiber.

473
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,280
And through various ways, resistance training, testosterone, whatever, you can get those

474
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,280
satellite cells to be donated to the muscle fiber and muscle fiber is the only cells that are

475
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:10,240
multi nucleated. And we think the reason is, is that each myonuclei can only control protein

476
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,320
synthesis for a certain area. So you can only get the muscle fiber can only grow as big as it has

477
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,600
myonuclei. So the more myonuclei you can donate, the greater your potential is. And so one of the

478
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,160
things that we think is a reason that men have more lean mass than women, you know, is during

479
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,880
puberty, because up till puberty, males and females tend to have similar amounts of lean mass.

480
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,560
But during puberty, that's when we start to see these hormonal differences emerge. And that

481
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,600
exposure to testosterone increases that myonuclei number and just gives them a greater overall

482
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,640
potential for lean mass, which again, makes sense if you think about it as a relative percentage.

483
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,360
So now when you talk about taking exogenous levels of testosterone,

484
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:02,000
now you're donating even more myonuclei. And so you can reach a higher ceiling. So I think,

485
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,720
honestly, I mean, this, this might give me a little bit of trouble, but I think that's actually the

486
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:14,480
strongest argument against kind of the crossover of transgender sports of, you know, people who

487
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,800
previously were male now identify as female is you can't really get rid of those extra nuclei of the

488
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:31,200
of the long term benefit that's conveyed by the fusion of those myonuclei. So for example,

489
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,320
and we see this with like muscle memory, for example. So we know that when you stop,

490
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,880
if you've trained before, but you stop training, you can gain back muscle much faster than it takes

491
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,560
to build it. And they've even shown this in people who have stopped training for years,

492
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,680
that they gain it back faster than it originally took to build it. The other interesting thing is

493
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,560
they did a study where they looked at giving testosterone to it was either rats or mice. I

494
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,800
can't remember which one. So they, they were able to resistance train them. And it's funny to see

495
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,160
these like rat resistance training setups. I'm sure you've seen them. So one group, they did not

496
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,800
give testosterone. The other group, they gave testosterone. Now, of course, both gain strength,

497
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,160
both gain lean body mass, but the group getting testosterone obviously gain more. Then they had

498
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,280
a complete washout period. And basically for as long as it took for them both to get back to kind

499
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,720
of their original lean mass number, then they both had them retrain again, but no drugs in either

500
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,120
group. And the group that originally had testosterone just that once gained muscle significantly faster

501
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:42,320
than the other group. And our best understanding is it's probably these myonuclei that got fused

502
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,920
through that extra testosterone that confers that long-term benefit. So that's kind of how we think

503
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,800
about that. Do we think that that's kind of like only during a critical window of development,

504
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,880
or does that happen if you're 40 years old and you're taking exogenous testosterone?

505
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,440
See, that's where it gets more tricky. We don't, we don't really know. I think part of it may be,

506
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,440
you know, if you're, if you have a certain testosterone, and I'm, there's no data on this,

507
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,240
so I'm, I'm speculating 100%. But if you have a certain level of testosterone, you've had that,

508
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,400
you know, through puberty and now you're an adult, and you kind of maintain that, that's just kind

509
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,320
of your native natural, let's say you don't get too obese or too underweight, whatever.

510
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,120
You've probably fused the amount of myonuclei that you're going to fuse, at least from testosterone,

511
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,720
right? But now if you start taking exogenously, you've now ramped that up another notch. Now you

512
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,800
can fuse more myonuclei, which again, anecdotally would make sense because if we look at the drug

513
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,840
use and bodybuilding, it's continued to go up, up, up, up, up. And now we're getting to the point where,

514
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,800
you know, these guys really aren't getting much bigger, because there's just only so many drugs

515
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,880
they can take before. I mean, and we're seeing it now, many of them are, I think last year,

516
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,320
there was something like a half dozen professional bodybuilders who died. So it's getting to the point

517
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,200
where they really can't go any higher in drugs. And you're seeing that lean mass start to cap out.

518
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,080
And this is why because you compete in tested or drug free powerlifting,

519
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,760
as good as it is, they make you guys take a polygraph that says, have you used drugs in five

520
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,000
years? And that's an interesting window of time, right? Because you'd think like, why would they

521
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,840
care if you used performance enhancing drugs five years ago, but in theory, they do care,

522
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,040
because you may still confer a benefit five years later, even if you've actually been drug free.

523
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,320
So that's what we did natural bodybuilding when I competed in natural bodybuilding.

524
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,440
And powerlifting, they don't do the polygraph. They don't. So you just, you cannot test positive

525
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,000
so we are completely underwater. So basically the way the water drug testing works is once you

526
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,240
enter the water drug testing pool, so you've qualified for some kind of international competition,

527
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,240
you could be drug tested at any time. So you have to provide, you have to use a whereabouts form,

528
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,920
you have to provide your whereabouts, all that kind of thing. And if they, if it's during your

529
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,400
window and they say, Hey, you need to be drug tested and you don't do it, you can get a strike

530
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,360
against you and be out of competition for a certain period of time.

531
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,040
So there's pluses and minuses to both methods, right? Like polygraph obviously

532
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,120
is not something that's crazy accurate, right? I don't think they allow it in a court of law.

533
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,880
But just the idea that you are going to be asked that and it could be something that you fail,

534
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,000
probably keeps quite a few people from doing it. And the other thing I tell people is

535
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,320
there's just not really any money in this stuff. So it's, you know, are there cheaters,

536
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,800
absolutely. Is it rampant? I would kind of be surprised because there's just not that much

537
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,760
money. Now, when you talk about sports where you can make millions of dollars,

538
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,800
yeah, I would not be surprised if there's rampant cheating because you're talking about millions of

539
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,080
dollars. I think the most money that's ever been on the line for me competing was like two or

540
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,760
three thousand dollars. So it's, you know, I love to do it. Not being done for the money.

541
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,640
No, no, for sure. Yeah. So with the, with the polygraph, at least it allows you to kind of go

542
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,040
back, like you said. Now, interestingly, the data that we just talked about kind of suggests that,

543
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,960
well, if it was five years ago, it doesn't matter. You still got an advantage. But they're also

544
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,680
trying to balance that with, you know, at some point you got to let people come clean if they've

545
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,800
used in the past. Yeah. And I actually agree with that point of view in terms of like I spoke with

546
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,640
a guy who competed in bodybuilding. He's like, you know, I was 17 years old. Some guy to Jim gave me

547
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,800
something. I was an idiot. I didn't like ask what it was. And, you know, I got like a bunch of side

548
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,880
effects and like, you know, I got bigger and stronger. But he's like, you know, looking back,

549
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,680
it was like I really regret doing that at that age. Well, should that be punished for like his

550
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,600
entire life and not able to compete in drug free bodybuilding? I mean, you can make the argument. I

551
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,880
understand the argument. But, you know, I'm in favor of being a little bit more inclusive in terms of

552
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,960
that. So, you know, you've you mentioned that, you know, you're as you're getting ready to train

553
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,440
for worlds. Just I think it was a couple of days yesterday. You've said to me, you know, your back

554
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,760
kind of hurt. You really backed off. Also, this is your first major international meet in about seven

555
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,920
years. And a lot of that was due to injuries, of which back was the most prevalent. But I think

556
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,160
you also mentioned a little bit of knee pain as well. Right. Yep. Yep. So how do you think about

557
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,600
this personally? How much longer do you want to be loading yourself at the, you know, basically

558
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,360
putting cars on your back and lifting cars off the ground? Right. Which is effectively what you're

559
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:50,000
doing. Yeah. I mean, candidly, if I went out my one master's worlds, I'd probably give a real hard

560
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,760
thought about like, OK, I think I'm done at least competing in this. But the other part of me

561
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,320
is kind of like I think that part of my problem is I love to train so much. I never really gave

562
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,320
myself the time to get pain free. As soon as I started feeling better, I would just start pushing

563
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:18,320
again. And I do think I've slowly gotten more intelligent because I used to think I was basically

564
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:26,160
Superman. So I think I've just matured a little bit. And even like yesterday, like getting to a

565
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,640
certain point, warming up on squats and saying, all right, it's not happening today. There's no

566
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,000
reason to try and force this. I think previously I would kind of create a narrative in my mind of

567
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,560
I'm going to power through this because it's what it takes. And yeah, at some points like you have

568
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:46,560
to I think one of the most important things is knowing when to press the gas pedal and knowing

569
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:52,480
when to back off a little bit. And sometimes discretion is the better part of valor. And for me,

570
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,800
I'm probably a little bit weird in that like I would train three or four hours a day because

571
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,520
I just love to train. I love the way it makes me feel. I love feeling strong. Part of me,

572
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,400
the egocentric part of me probably loves to feel like a badass loading up, you know, five,

573
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,960
six hundred pounds in a gym and whatnot. But I've kind of gotten to the point now where I'm like,

574
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,760
all right, if it's there today, we take it. If it's not there, we take what's there. And then

575
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,920
we live to fight another day because I've just had so many experiences where I've tried to

576
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,560
press on this. And with the way pain works, the more pain you have, the more pain you're going to

577
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,240
have because you just end up getting fixated and ruminating on it. And the research actually shows

578
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,800
that the more you ruminate on it, the more you think about it and the more times you trigger it,

579
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,040
the worse it's going to get. And so it's like this delicate balance between, you know, I kind

580
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:53,840
of know how far I can press something before I'm making it worse because the research also shows

581
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,320
that you don't want to completely just stop lifting because you detrain. And then when you come back,

582
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,080
even if you're pain free, you're more likely to retrigger it because you've lost that adaptation.

583
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,000
So it's kind of like when you have those pain triggers, trying to find either a weight amount

584
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,040
or a movement pattern or something similar to what you're trying to do, but it's low enough pain

585
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,720
that you can start to build back from that. So like, for example, yesterday,

586
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,120
ideally I would have done some squats and deadlifts. Couldn't do them. Okay. I'm going to go

587
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,280
and do some leg press. I'm still going to get some stimulation from my quads, the primary movers of

588
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,360
the squat. I'm going to go do single leg dumbbell RDLs. I was able to do those with no pain. Is it

589
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,640
loading it as much as I would like? No, but I'm still using my hamstrings. I'm using my lower back.

590
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:48,960
I'm getting in some of that movement pattern and I'm still getting a training effect, some adaptation

591
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,440
without further triggering that pain. So. And then so what did you do today? So today I just kind of

592
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,840
was like pretty much just cleaning up stuff I missed throughout the week. So I just had some

593
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:07,520
dumbbell pressing. I did some more single leg RDLs and I did some mobility work. So not a whole

594
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:18,160
lot of intensive stuff, but you know, really when you consider like what I do, ideally all I would

595
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,240
do would be squat bench press and deadlift. Right. It's completely specific to what I'm going to

596
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,600
express on competition day. But those are also very fatiguing movements. I think, and I think

597
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,000
part of that too is just when you know how much you can do and you know how much you've done,

598
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,920
you kind of have like this anxiety about those movements because it's like you're almost being

599
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,920
tested and comparing them to what you previously done. So sometimes just creating, you know, a

600
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,360
little bit of a variation of that movement where you're not, you can kind of just let the weight

601
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,640
happen and pick your RPE. And if it's not, you know, a previous set weight, it doesn't bother you.

602
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,560
So I've started using a lot more variations to build that baseline level of strength. And then

603
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,640
again, when it comes to the actual competition lifts, I'm mostly just focusing on doing like

604
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,640
heavy singles and building my volume through other areas. And how many times a week will you do those

605
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,080
heavy single workouts? Once or twice. Once or twice, just depending on how I feel.

606
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,040
I've often thought there would be a really interesting experiment I'd like to do.

607
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,160
I wouldn't do it, but I'd like to oversee it. I'd like to see it being done, I guess,

608
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,160
which is you take a power lifter and their entire training cycle, like six months building up to a

609
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,960
competition, they have no idea what's on the bar. So they're basically, they have a really good coach

610
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,960
and the coach is telling them for every set, how many reps to do or what RPE to go until.

611
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,160
So it's completely being programmed, but you get out, you eliminate the problem you just talked

612
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,840
about, which is you take the psychology away and you don't let the athletes suffer from knowing,

613
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,800
oh my God, I should be able to do this many reps. They don't know. So one day they might get down on

614
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,080
a bar and the bar is going to be really light and they're going to be told, you're going to, you know,

615
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,280
I think you're going to get 10 reps here. Let's see it. And they have no idea what percentage of

616
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,800
their max it ever is. So it's interesting. One of the top lifters in the world, somebody I competed

617
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,360
against multiple times, a guy named Bryce Lewis. So he actually trained an entire training cycle

618
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,480
that way. So he would have his girlfriend put trash bags over the weights. I don't know if

619
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,480
he still does that, but he- So she would load up every set. So she, but she had to be the one to

620
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,840
know what every set needed to be in advance. So she was, um, she's a competitive power lifter as

621
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,120
well. I think a world champion as well. And so yeah, she would kind of like look at what his

622
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:54,560
RPs were supposed to be at, load the weight up, put the trash bags over it, and then he would go do

623
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:01,440
it, you know, and probably just for what she meant. Super interesting. Now for me, that might work,

624
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,280
but I, for whatever reason- You like to control things a little bit. Yeah. There's some people on

625
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,880
meet day, they'll tell their coach, don't tell me what you're putting on the bar. Just tell me

626
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,880
what it is. Just put it on. Just make me do it. I'll go do it. I want to know. Uh, I don't know.

627
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,680
Maybe it's just part of how my brain's wired, whatever, because I also have a trust with my

628
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,840
coach and all the coaches I've had have been great. Honestly, I've worked with a couple of different

629
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:32,720
people and they've all been great. Um, I just had such a good, um, trust in my coach that I just

630
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,480
knew if they put something on the bar, they're not going to put something on the bar that they

631
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,440
don't think I can do. They know I can do it. It's my job to go and execute. And I think that that's a,

632
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:51,040
a really, when you have a good like meet day coach, that is so valuable because like I know

633
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,200
they're not going to put something on I can't do. So it's just up to me to go out and do it.

634
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,600
So what about nutrition? How does nutrition faction into factor into powerlifting? You're,

635
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,320
you're at 208 pounds or so right now. It's about the weight you're going to compete at.

636
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,840
You once told me that the difference between powerlifting and bodybuilding is in powerlifting,

637
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:15,440
all of your pain is compressed into the gym and bodybuilding. Most of your pain is actually out

638
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,400
of the gym. Uh, and having not done either, I mean, I did some powerlifting growing up,

639
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,360
but, but basically having never really done either of those at a serious level,

640
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,440
I can appreciate it just based on the concept. So, you know, you've been here now a few days,

641
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,400
we've had a bunch of meals together. You're just eating like a normal guy. Like, you know, we're,

642
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,240
we're eating whatever the hell we want. Um, is there anything you will do as you get closer to

643
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,360
the meat with your nutrition specifically? Because I know that you'd like to come in two

644
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,600
pounds or so below your target, but that's something you can modify in days outside of

645
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,160
just calories. Is there something you're going to manipulate with macros or anything that you're

646
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,560
going to be thinking about, you know, with respect to more creatine that you're going to be loading

647
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,000
or anything that you're, you're needling that way? Not really. I mean, at least for me, because I'm

648
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,640
sitting, you know, very close to the weight class that I'm going to compete in. Um, I don't really

649
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,480
have to make a bunch of changes. Now, if it was, you know, if I was sitting at say 215 pounds,

650
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,760
217 pounds, then it gets to the point where a weight cuts to a five becomes a little bit

651
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,360
untenable because, uh, where I compete, it's a two hour weigh in. So if you're cutting, you know,

652
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,400
10, 15 pounds, you're not going to be able to rehydrate and refuel quickly enough.

653
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,360
Two hours, meaning two hours between weigh in and competition.

654
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,840
And lifting, correct. Yep. So.

655
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,400
Yeah. Unlike the day before where you'd have a full day to catch up.

656
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,320
Right. So there are organizations where you can weigh in a day before. And I think actually one

657
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,640
organization had 48 hour weigh in. So there were guys, which actually in a way makes it more

658
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:55,280
dangerous because people will cut really, really cut. Oh yeah. I think Dan Green, who's, uh, really

659
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:02,720
well known, untested power lifter. Uh, I think he weighed in at 220 and then like the next day was

660
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:09,920
walking around like 255 or something like that. So just incredible like amounts of weight these guys

661
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:16,080
are cutting. Um, and so yeah, you'll see them with IVs and all that kind of stuff. So for us,

662
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,280
I mean, it's really like you can cut two, three, maybe 4% of your body weight, but you really don't

663
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,640
want to go much more than that because with two hours, you just don't have time.

664
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,200
So are you sticking with the same, are you doing one or you doing five grams of creatine daily right

665
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,560
now? Yep. I, so I, I keep my creatine in because I can modify, which is like sodium and modifying

666
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,840
fiber a little bit, uh, to get some water weight out those, those last few days. Uh, and like you

667
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,720
mentioned, I'll usually try to be a little bit under the day before the meat so I can eat enough

668
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,920
calories the day before where I don't feel like I'm having to shovel down food because, you know,

669
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,280
if you had to go pretty, if I have to go pretty aggressive, like for a Saturday meet Thursday,

670
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,760
Friday. Now on Saturday with that weigh in, I've got two hours to get food down. There's also a

671
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,920
lot of stuff I got to do. I got to get, um, you know, I got to warm up. I got a, I want my brain

672
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,480
free to think about the stuff I've got to do not be like, okay, well I've got to get down this.

673
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,800
I've got to get down that like I'll take some PD lighter or some kind of electrolytes, those

674
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:22,240
sorts of things. But for the most part, I've never really had issues with cramping. Uh, I've never

675
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,280
had issues with energy on meat day. Um, and I think a lot of that is just, I keep myself

676
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,120
pretty close to within striking distance. And then the other benefit is, you know,

677
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,240
your leverages can change it, you know, based on your weight thickness, you know, your, the tightness

678
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:41,280
of your belt can change. All that stuff can make a difference in terms of the style of squat you do

679
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,920
or how you feel. So just, you know, being able to train in a manner that's going to be very

680
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,920
similar to how I compete, I feel like is a little bit of an advantage for me compared to people who

681
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,360
have to cut quite a bit of weight. And if you had to guess by Dexa, what would your body fat be

682
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:02,560
at weigh in? Uh, I caliper at around 8%. So I would say Dexa is probably like 11 or 12,

683
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,600
something like that. Cause in my experience, Dexa is usually three, four percent higher than calipers.

684
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:13,120
So by most people standards still incredibly lean, but not necessarily by bodybuilding standards,

685
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:18,880
of course. Yeah, absolutely. So, okay. Well, let's actually, let's talk a little bit more about

686
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,840
creatine. Um, we talked about it really briefly on one of our podcasts, but we, we were kind of

687
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,200
at the end. So I want to kind of go back and make sure people understand that it's one of the

688
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,160
supplements we get the most questions about. It's also one of the supplements that we feel the most

689
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:39,040
confident telling patients, like if, you know, this is a supplement worth taking, it's clearly

690
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:45,280
passed test number one, which is it's safe. Uh, and it passes test number two, which is it's probably

691
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,520
got efficacy. Um, Washington said it's got efficacy. The real question is, you know, are you okay with

692
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,080
a little bit of weight gain? Cause that's, you know, you're going to pull more water in. So, um,

693
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,960
explain to people a little bit about why creatine is so important. And presumably this is something

694
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,640
that's really important in powerlifting. I'm guessing going into a bodybuilding meat,

695
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:11,120
you probably don't want creatine for that extra weight or do you? So I think it's actually great

696
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,240
for bodybuilding. Okay, great. I want to hear about it. Cause I would assumed it would, you'd

697
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,920
have a little more water, but maybe the water is all in the muscle and that's where you want it.

698
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:25,760
Yeah. So, uh, so creatine is a high energy phosphate donor. So in, in muscle,

699
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:32,000
it exists as phosphocreatin. And when you take supplemental creatine, uh, you'll,

700
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,080
it'll come into the muscle, it'll get a phosphate attached to it, phosphocreatin. And originally

701
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,000
the only mechanism we thought of, well, it's a high energy phosphate donor. So people will perform

702
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,560
better. But then we saw people increase their lean body mass, increase their strength. Uh,

703
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:52,400
and there's even like benefits in terms of cognitive benefits appear to be pretty clear

704
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,560
that there's some cognitive benefits as well. Uh, so as you mentioned, like in terms of safety

705
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,960
and efficacy data, I mean, to me, there's no strikes really, I tell people, I'm like, I don't

706
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,160
even know where we're having this conversation anymore. And it's also, you know, it's gone up

707
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,480
in price a little bit recently because of the supply chain stuff, but it's still relatively

708
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,040
inexpensive, incredibly inexpensive for, for what you're getting here. So, you know, when I see

709
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,880
people talk about like some of these other supplements and they're not even taking creatine

710
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,440
monohydrate, and I'm like, well, you're, you're stepping over pennies or sorry, you're stepping

711
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,840
over dollars to pick up pennies because this is just the lowest hanging fruit.

712
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,120
But are you still at, even at your size and even at your demand, is there any benefit to taking

713
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:39,360
more than about five grams a day? Some people have postulated there might be, I haven't seen

714
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,320
really clear evidence for it yet. You could argue that there's really no downside to taking the

715
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,640
extra. The downside might be some GI irritation for some people. Creatin can be a GI irritant,

716
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:58,160
which I think we'll circle back to. But we know it can act as a high energy phosphate donor. So,

717
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,240
when you are exercising or just doing anything, you, your energy currency of yourselves ATP,

718
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:13,440
and in order to drive muscular contraction, your ATP donates a phosphate and that liberation of

719
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,520
that phosphate to form ADP and a free phosphate is energetically favorable and helps drive these

720
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:26,240
muscular contractions. So creatine can act or phosphocreatin can act as a high energy phosphate

721
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:34,640
donor to reform ATP and allow you to perform better. But it's also a really powerful osmolite.

722
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:41,600
And so it pulls water into muscle tissue, which in and of itself may actually be anabolic. So

723
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:49,120
like just a muscle cell being more hydrated, there's some evidence that that can actually

724
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:54,960
improve the, that it's more anabolic environment. But regardless of the mechanism, we do know that

725
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,480
when you take creatine, you see improvements in lean mass. And some people will say, well,

726
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,040
that's just water. Well, that's what muscle mostly is. That muscle is 70% water. So whether it's,

727
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,760
and there's actually research to show that even non-contractile, just water improves,

728
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:21,760
may improve strength and contractability. So we're not sure exactly how, but it could just be like

729
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,640
the volumization of the cell is just a benefit. There's also sort of a, you could also kind of

730
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:33,600
make up at least conceptually a framework that says a more hydrated cell is more able to calculate,

731
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:39,920
more able to carry out its function, right? So the function of a myofibril is contractile release,

732
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:46,240
contract release, and it has more water. It sort of seems logical to me that it's going to be better

733
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,960
at clearing metabolic waste and recruiting fuel, which at least be two things that would factor

734
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:58,320
into its ability to do that. Yeah. I mean, the other thing about it is if you look at like

735
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:04,960
anything that improves hypertrophy, a big portion of it is water. It's not just all myofibrillar.

736
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,280
So I think regardless of the mechanisms, I mean, it's pretty clear that this stuff works. It's

737
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,640
pretty clear it's safe. I mean, they've done numerous randomized control trials, some of them

738
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:23,280
being well over a year long. Yes, you get an increase in creatinine, which can be a marker

739
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,000
of renal function. Although the data, on this lane, there was a paper that just came out a

740
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,200
couple of weeks ago that we were really happy to see. We've abandoned looking at looking at serum

741
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,760
creatinine for renal function because it's just too easy to get fooled by people with varying

742
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,440
muscle mass and training volume. So we've completely abandoned it. So every time you order labs on

743
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,760
somebody and you see their creatinine, it'll tell you what their estimated glomerular filtration

744
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:55,040
rate is. We just ignore it completely. We only look at cystatin C. So everything we do is based

745
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,720
off that. And there was a paper in JAMA a couple of weeks ago that basically said as much, which

746
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,560
is maybe we should look more at cystatin C instead of creatinine. So I would even say that hopefully

747
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:10,720
this is a PSA for other docs out there listening and other patients to say, please look at my

748
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,880
cystatin C as a way to estimate kidney function. Yeah. I tell people, there's some other things

749
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,240
that can get a little bit wonky, like from lifting weights like liver enzymes and whatnot.

750
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:26,560
And I tell people you have to keep in mind these are markers. Okay. So if you have liver failure

751
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:32,240
or you have kidney failure, it's very, very likely you will have elevated liver enzymes and elevated

752
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,320
creatinine. But just because you have elevated liver enzymes or elevated creatinine does not

753
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,720
mean that you necessarily have damage to those tissues. So you have to disconnect those two.

754
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,240
And I don't think that, you know, I feel like correlation versus causation is just not something

755
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,880
that's taught very well in school. Because I even see not really good doctors, but some physicians

756
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,840
get so hung up on just, well, this is on the page and this is supposed to be in normal range and it's

757
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,760
not. It's like, but just look at the person sitting in front of you who obviously works out, is in good

758
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,160
shape. If you're concerned about their kidneys, then do a 24 hour urine collection or an ultrasound

759
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,680
or whatever you have to do to verify that they're safe. But I mean, I just, I don't worry about that

760
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:23,280
kind of stuff. There's also been some people who have said, well, creatinine can cause hair loss and

761
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,880
you've got to be careful about that. I'm not, I don't think the data on that's very compelling at

762
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:36,800
all. So there was a single study that showed an increase in DHT from supplementing with creatinine.

763
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,560
One study, 2009, I've never seen it replicated, never seen any follow up.

764
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,560
How much did DHT increase by?

765
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,440
I'd have to go back and look. I can't remember the exact amount. It was significant.

766
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,800
But the interesting thing is we know creatinine doesn't affect androgen levels. So it's kind of

767
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,000
like, where is this increase in DHT coming from? Right? Like it has to come from somewhere.

768
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:08,240
And we, like I said, there's no randomized control trials showing that creatinine actually causes

769
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:17,920
changes to hair follicles or actual hair loss. So maybe it does. But I would think that if that

770
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,720
data existed, we probably would have seen it already. Do we think that there are significant

771
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,960
benefits from supplementation even on nonlifting days? So for example, on hard cardio days,

772
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,680
assuming we're not talking about sprints. So clearly there would be a benefit in sprinting

773
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,520
because the creatinine phosphate system is really lending to that ATP generation during that

774
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,880
incredibly high intensity stuff. But like if you're out there doing a VO2 max day, which is,

775
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,960
that's a really hard day. Those are kind of three to eight minute all out intervals,

776
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,640
which is aerobic. It's peak aerobic. Do you still get a benefit, do you think, from creatinine?

777
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,880
I would guess yes. There was a recent meta-analysis that came out and looked at like different ways

778
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:09,920
of taking creatinine. And it was useful data, but in some ways it was kind of frustrating because

779
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,400
they basically showed, well, you take five grams a day, you get increases in lean mass and strength

780
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,480
and performance. You take more than five grams a day, you also get increases in lean mass and

781
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:24,880
performance. But it's hard to kind of compare them directly based on the way they did the meta-analysis.

782
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,280
And then they also looked at, okay, if we just take them on lifting days, okay, you get benefits.

783
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,800
If you take them on non-lifting days, you also get benefits. What I would say is that

784
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,640
you probably can get away with just taking it on lifting days, but keep in mind that the benefits

785
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,840
of creatinine are an accumulation. So you've really got to saturate the muscle cell. That's

786
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,840
the key. Because when we were kids, you would load it. You would do like, I feel like you did

787
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:58,080
30 grams a day for a week or something crazy. Yeah. And then five grams thereafter. And of course,

788
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,320
this was reading bro science magazines. You would then do that for a couple of months,

789
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,600
and then you would come off it for a month, and then you would repeat the cycle. Am I making that

790
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,280
up or is that about- No, no, that was definitely a thing. So I will say that the research does show

791
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:17,840
if you load it, you will saturate the muscle cell faster. Now, I always try to tell people,

792
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,400
there's no solutions, there's only trade-offs, right? So the trade-off with this is a lot of

793
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:30,880
people will get pretty bad GI irritation with loading creatinine in terms of like GI bloating,

794
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,360
nausea, those sorts of things. So if you just take- Because you're playing the long game,

795
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,200
it doesn't really matter. Right. I mean, you're talking about getting the results you want in

796
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,600
one week as opposed to three weeks. It's really not a big difference. So if you just want to take

797
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,400
five grams a day, within a few weeks, you'll be saturated and you'll be getting the same benefits.

798
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,200
So it's really, I guess if you were somebody who'd never taken it before and you've got a big

799
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,240
athletic event coming up and you really want to be on it for it, that could make sense. But for

800
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:06,480
most people, I would say just take five grams a day. And when people say, well, what if I just

801
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,360
take it on lifting days? Yeah, probably could, but it's also like, it's pretty darn cheap.

802
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,160
Yeah. I actually think it's just easier to not forget. It's easier to forget something when you

803
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,000
only do it on certain days. Sometimes it's just easier to make it a part of the routine.

804
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,560
Yeah. And what I would say too, is people ask you about timing of creatine, those sorts of things.

805
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:33,200
There's some really small, really tenuous, I really want to emphasize that evidence that perhaps

806
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:38,560
after a workout might be better than before workout, but I tell people, just take it whenever

807
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,000
you'll take it regularly. So for me, I just get up in the morning and I take it. And that's what

808
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,520
I worry about. Now, as far as like the cycling on and off. So there's evidence that you do reduce

809
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,600
your endogenous production of creatine when you're on it. There's also evidence that the

810
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:59,200
creatine receptor on the muscle cell does down regulate a little bit. Now, the important thing

811
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,520
to keep in mind is that doesn't mean that your intracellular levels of creatine are falling.

812
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:10,560
So they've actually never shown that even like far out that those phosphocreatin levels in your

813
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,920
muscle drop. So what I would say is I don't really think there's a reason to come off because

814
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,440
they have shown that if you do come off within a month or so, kind of everything goes back to

815
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,000
normal, but you lose the benefit of the supplemental creatine. So I would say as long as

816
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,640
intracellular levels of creatine are not falling, there's really no benefit to coming off. I mean,

817
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,120
it used to be like, I think people kind of just equated supplements with steroids. And so like,

818
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,320
well, you're supposed to cycle steroids, so we should cycle supplements. And you know,

819
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:46,560
creatine is not hormonal. It's not the same biofeedback loop. So I would say there's probably

820
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,520
no reason to cycle it. So something else that kind of bridges the world between bodybuilding

821
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,120
and powerlifting is this question I wanted to ask you about, which is basically one of

822
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:04,880
Newton's laws, right? So force equals mass times acceleration. Okay. So let's just say I'm on the

823
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,080
ground. I've got my dumbbells or I'm on a bench and I've got my dumbbells and I'm going to press

824
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:14,720
them. One school of thought is press them as quickly as possible because force equals mass

825
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:21,440
times acceleration. The mass of this thing is fixed. So any speed with which I lift it is

826
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:27,920
accelerating because I'm moving against gravity, but the faster I can do it, the greater the force.

827
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,680
But of course, at some point, the weight becomes so heavy that you increase the effort more on the

828
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:41,280
mass variable than on the acceleration variable. So in other words, we can manipulate mass and

829
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:48,560
acceleration to reach maximum force. Now, an extreme example of that is you doing a one rep max.

830
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:56,160
But as you pointed out, the more elite a powerlifter becomes, the slower that is. In other words,

831
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,880
the lower the acceleration is, and therefore the more they're emphasizing the mass, which is of

832
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:07,440
course what you get scored on. No one's scoring you on the acceleration. Right. How does, how do

833
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:13,360
we think about that in terms of mixing and matching the mass versus the acceleration variable

834
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,280
in an effort to optimize force? Because of course we also don't want to go to maximum force every

835
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,840
time because if I did maximum force with a lightweight, I'd probably move it too quickly.

836
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,080
I could injure myself as well. So did you think about the variation of mass and acceleration

837
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,440
when you're moving weight? So yeah. So if you think about what the expression of strength is,

838
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,520
it's basically force. So as you mentioned, if it's a very heavy weight, it'll just move slower.

839
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,200
If it's a lightweight, you can still apply the same force and it will just move more quickly.

840
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,560
So this is actually a concept that I heard my coach Zach talk about on a podcast

841
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:57,680
was they do quite a bit of, we'll do a heavy single or double or whatever it is. And then

842
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,920
our back offsets are relatively light, like talking RPE four or five, but trying to move

843
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,720
them as quickly as possible. On both. Let's just talk about the concentric now. And then I want to

844
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,080
actually come and have the discussion about the eccentric. Yeah. On the concentric. Yeah. Exactly.

845
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,360
And because that is in terms of strength, that is the closest expression of that.

846
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,320
So in other words, if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying your coach is saying, look,

847
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,920
on the heavy weights, they're going to move slow because they have to.

848
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,040
But to keep training strength, I want you to move as quickly as possible as we come down on weight.

849
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,480
Bingo. Bingo. And that, so the idea is, but we're still applying the same force, it's going to move

850
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,600
more quickly, but it's going to be less fatiguing because it's lighter weight. So that's kind of the

851
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,160
concept behind it. Now in terms of. Is that happening with you? So for example, when you did,

852
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,600
let's just say your back wasn't hurting yesterday. If you were out there doing,

853
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,680
today was an RPE six day. Do you think that your speed would have increased sufficiently that you

854
01:15:53,680 --> 01:16:00,000
would have almost matched 90% of the force you'd put out on a one rep max best? It's hard to tell

855
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,800
because I've never actually done a calculation of the force. I imagine there's probably a sweet spot

856
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,800
somewhere in there where like too heavy probably has less force than, you know, but yeah, I'm not,

857
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:18,800
I'm not sure where that is. As far as like, um, hypertrophy, I think that force is probably less

858
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:26,160
important. I think it's more about just having enough sufficiently hard sets, however you slice

859
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:33,680
that. So, uh, for example, like the whole idea of time under tension training was very popular. Um,

860
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,960
and if you look at some of the initial research, um, I think there was a study where they had people

861
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,880
doing curls and I may butcher the study, so I apologize, but it was kind of like a six second

862
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,400
eccentric six second concentric. And they had them go to failure and they had another group that just

863
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:57,040
did normal kind of cadence and they had to match the number of reps and found that the group that

864
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,800
was, uh, doing the slow eccentrics and slow concentrics gained more muscle. And so people said,

865
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,320
well, see, there you go. Well, the problem is they were using like 30% of their one rep max for like

866
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,600
10 reps going really slow. Well, if you're going at a normal pace, how many times could you do 30%

867
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:20,480
of one rep max? I mean, you could do 30, 40, 50 reps, right? So it wasn't, I don't want to say the

868
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:26,160
study was bad. It's not bad. It answered the question it wanted to answer, but if you're going

869
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:31,040
to compare them straight up, really what it needs to be is if you take both of these things to failure,

870
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:38,000
so the same level of intensity or sufficient difficulty, what does the outcome look like then?

871
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,240
And so when they do that, they really see very little difference between, uh, slow lifting and

872
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:51,120
fast lifting. Um, there was a study that just came out that looked at fast eccentrics versus slow

873
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:58,000
eccentrics and found that there was actually a little bit better, uh, outcomes with fast eccentrics

874
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,280
compared to slow eccentrics. And that actually relates back to, with respect to muscle mass.

875
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,240
Yeah. Which you mentioned this to me earlier. The only time I've ever done a fast eccentric

876
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:14,640
is on my extra fly machine, that machine that I, in the gym, because you're forced to, like it's,

877
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,440
it's pulling you down so quickly that you're screaming down and you're coming to a stop.

878
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,000
Outside of that, it never occurred to me to do an eccentric quickly. Like if I'm doing

879
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,080
eccentric deadlifts, I'm actually almost trying to come down as slowly as I can in my head,

880
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,440
thinking this is more beneficial because I was thinking it's more time under tension.

881
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,080
It's probably partly with the lift too as well. Um, and, um, there's probably

882
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,880
it's cut, it's kind of like you don't want to take it too extreme, right? Like if you're

883
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,360
actual, like if you're doing a squat and you just dive bomb and there's no tension on the bar,

884
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:58,320
right? One, that's going to look really bad when you're trying to come out of it. Uh, and two,

885
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,040
it's probably not the, what they're actually seeing in the research. I think the idea of a,

886
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:08,000
let's use a bicep curl cause that's a, it's a safer exercise. So this research suggests that

887
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,560
you've take two people that are doing the exact same weight and they're the same people basically.

888
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,840
And they're doing the same speed of their concentric. And one of them is doing, let's say

889
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,640
it's a two second concentric and he's doing a two second eccentric. And the other guy's going

890
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,760
two up six down. They're saying the two, two will technically produce more hypertrophy.

891
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,200
Might be better. So I say might because it's just so interesting. Yeah.

892
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:38,640
Now, if you think about like mechanotransduction and you know, the force, the mechanical tension

893
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,880
being applied to a muscle, when you're kind of getting to that point where the muscle is stopping

894
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:49,360
and then having to come the other way, if it's fast, I mean, that's probably more tension at

895
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,080
that specific point. Yeah. Yeah. So we just don't know enough about this stuff right now to really

896
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,840
be able to say for sure. But I think, you know, and I also don't want to make it sound like there's

897
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:04,720
no benefit to like slow movements, especially for people who like have pain or they don't want to go

898
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:10,560
heavy, you know, those sorts of things. Then, you know, slowing down a movement to either one,

899
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,560
because a lot of times pain can be tied to velocity. If you just slow down a movement,

900
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,800
it will be as painful. So I've used tempo training, like pretty liberally in some of my training

901
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:26,800
cycles just to make it so I had to use less weight, but still make it pretty difficult.

902
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,360
Now, was it as good as, you know, me doing my regular movement? Maybe not, but it's still

903
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,720
better than doing nothing. Right. So it's always important to keep those, like those things in mind

904
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:43,280
in terms of like, don't let, you know, perfection be the enemy of progress. So I do think that like

905
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,960
slow movements still have application for people, like I said, who have pain or if they don't feel

906
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,240
comfortable with heavy weight, you can make it much more difficult just by slowing down the movement.

907
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:00,640
At the end of the day, the biggest determinant is just doing enough number of hard sets. However,

908
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:05,280
that kind of looks now, there are a couple of patients that I've had over the years whose

909
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:13,200
disdain for exercise is so great that the most I can negotiate them doing

910
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:21,040
is one 20 to 30 minute workout per week doing the super slow protocol where they go to, you know,

911
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:27,040
they have these specific gyms that have very specific types of equipment. Yep. And they're

912
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,720
going to do, I don't know, maybe eight to 10 different machines, and they're only going to

913
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:39,120
do one set and it's going to be to failure. And the sets are typically titrated to be somewhere

914
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:46,880
between 90 and 105 seconds. So about a minute 30 to a minute 45 is the sweet spot, right? So if you're

915
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,040
going more than that, the weight's too heavy. If you're, the weight's too light, if you're less than

916
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,600
that, the weight's too heavy. And they might do like four simple upper body, four upper lower. So

917
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,600
there might be a press, a pull, a bicep, a tricep, a leg press, you know, all that kind of stuff.

918
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:07,760
Now, the reason I sort of negotiate that is my alternative is they'll do nothing. And I'm thinking,

919
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,720
I probably can't get any better benefit in 30 minutes once a week than I can there.

920
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,880
If it's done right. Now, the challenge that I've realized with that type of exercise,

921
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:27,440
because I've done this many times myself, it's actually really hard to go to failure.

922
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:35,120
At the end of the day, it can be done, but it can't be done often. And I actually think it's

923
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,680
really hard to do it eight consecutive times, which is basically what you're asking a person to do

924
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:47,840
in 30 minutes to truly go to failure. So what is your take on the super slow protocols,

925
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,480
which clearly guys like Mike Menser have, you know, like there are really famous body builders

926
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,760
who have taken these protocols to the limits. But what's your take both on the physiology of it and

927
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,200
then the psychology of it? Yeah, so I think that just kind of shows that there's, you know,

928
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:08,800
there's many ways to skin a cat, right? And when it comes to hypertrophy, you really have a lot of

929
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,320
options and certainly no one will argue that you can grow, can't grow muscle that way because you

930
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,360
can. It is kind of remarkable, isn't it? To think that like, yeah, these people could do 30 minutes

931
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,000
once a week and grow muscle. Yeah. In fact, there was, there was actually, so a friend of mine,

932
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,960
Jeremy Linneke is professor at Ole Miss. I had Jeremy's been on the podcast. Yeah. BFR. Yeah.

933
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:37,280
Yeah. He's great. My claim to fame is I actually introduced him to BFR. So, but they actually

934
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,280
published a paper where they looked at just flexing like isometric contraction. And we're

935
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:49,200
actually able to show like with long isometric contractions, like some hypertrophy, which before

936
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,640
that we always thought, oh, isometric doesn't actually grow muscle, right? Like there's,

937
01:23:52,640 --> 01:24:02,480
there's a little benefit to it. So yeah, I think that we just, I hate to be the typical tools in

938
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:08,000
a toolkit, but things are tools in the toolkit. And we were talking about people who are, you know,

939
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,440
they don't want to be bodybuilders. They just want to get some of these benefits from resistance

940
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:21,120
training. It really is what can we do to get them in the gym consistently? And is it as good as like,

941
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:27,440
you know, compound movements with free bar and, you know, training at a normal pace? Maybe not,

942
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,200
but it's a heck of a lot better than them sitting at home and doing nothing. So I think, I think

943
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:37,280
that's really important to understand. And when it comes to like the super slow, the physiology of

944
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:45,680
the hypertrophy response, what's wild is we still don't fully understand how the process of muscle

945
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:52,800
hypertrophy occurs. Like we know that you need to progressively overload to continue causing the

946
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,560
hypertrophy response. We know what things are associated with hypertrophy, but every time they

947
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,160
try to get really granular with it, we still have a lot of gaps in our understanding. Now,

948
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:10,160
one of the things we do think matters is metabolic stress. So this idea that you're accumulating

949
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:17,600
these metabolic byproducts inside the muscle as you work it out. So that kind of like the pump,

950
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:27,680
right? That does appear to have some decent mechanistic data to support it, like in terms

951
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,040
of, you know, hydrogen ion accumulation, how that may affect some, you know, signaling,

952
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,320
those sorts of things, even right down to like calcium release into the sarcoplasm.

953
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,880
So I think when you're dealing with like that super slow protocol, you're kind of pushing a

954
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,840
little bit more on that metabolic stress as opposed to like the, the mechanical tension portion of it.

955
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,760
But there still is mechanical tension. I think a lot of people think about mechanical tension just

956
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,200
literally as weight on the bar. And I think what people don't realize is mechanical tension is

957
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,440
kind of cumulative. Because otherwise, why wouldn't we just load up a heavy single and just do that

958
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,360
every time, right? Because that's the most amount of mechanical tension you can get in terms of like

959
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:15,200
a set point in time. So to me, it seems pretty obvious that mechanical tension has to be like a

960
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:20,880
little bit cumulative throughout a set. And so if you're doing super slow, okay, you might have a

961
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,240
pretty lightweight, but you've also got a really long time that's under that really lightweight,

962
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:31,840
and you're accumulating the metabolic stress and some mechanical tension. So to me, it makes sense

963
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,720
that you would have some of those benefits. What I would say is, I think the bigger downside is

964
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:42,880
you're probably not going to get as strong doing that methodology as you are actually like doing a

965
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:50,160
little bit more normal pace. And it may have a little bit less functionality than somebody who's

966
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,760
done kind of more traditional strength training. That's my bigger issue with it truthfully is,

967
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,600
it's the one, I don't think people really can go to failure. Because I mean, you'll get a couple

968
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,640
of sets here and there, but it's really difficult. So I think it's easier to do an exercise where

969
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:08,720
you don't have to go to failure, but you make up for it on volume. But then your other point here

970
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:16,560
is, I think you're really missing out on the reason why we exercise. We generally don't, I mean,

971
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,120
sometimes we exercise to be a better at lifting. Powerlifting is the only example of that. But

972
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:29,440
outside of that, we lift for life. And I do worry that when we rob people of movements that require

973
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,240
more than one plane, movements that require balance and some coordination,

974
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,760
we're not giving them the full benefit of the exercise, of the reason to exercise that is.

975
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,680
Yeah. And I would agree with that. And again, that has to be one of those things where...

976
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,040
It's better than the couch, as you said. It's much better than the couch. Yeah. And so,

977
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:56,240
I mean, we, I think a lot of people when they get into things, especially now we have paralysis

978
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:03,760
by analysis. And I'll tell people like, you know, at a certain point, your paralysis by analysis is

979
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:11,840
actually just your excuse to do nothing. So just go do, go do something, right? Like go throw

980
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,040
something against a wall and see what sticks, right? But when it comes to people who may have

981
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:22,240
been sedentary, I mean, sometimes the conversation I'll have is, hey, what do you like doing? Like,

982
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:28,880
is there something you like doing? Right. And let's press on that a little bit. Because if the,

983
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,840
if the only outcome that we're going for is perfection, well, not a lot of people are going

984
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,720
to be able to hit that. So, yeah, I really do think a lot of it boils down to a conversation of,

985
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,560
okay, yeah, this isn't as good as this, but it's still better than that. And I think

986
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:49,280
that conversation is a lot of the stuff that gets lost, that nuance gets lost in a lot of

987
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:55,120
these conversations, especially because, and, you know, you're an optimizer. I love to talk

988
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,120
about optimal because it's like, as scientists, that's kind of where we live and what we think

989
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:05,600
about. But it's like, do people really need optimal to get out of like the state we're in,

990
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,440
where so many people have type two diabetes and have, you know, obesity and these are dying from

991
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:17,200
heart disease and cancer? No, we just, like, honestly, if we get them to get 50% of the way

992
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:21,920
there, probably see a huge benefit. Well, and that's really the flip side to this, the stats

993
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,720
I gave earlier in this discussion, which were how high VO two max and high strength were the two

994
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:36,080
biggest predictors of longevity. And that's true by a country mile. But the part that I didn't

995
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:42,240
mention that is now worth mentioning is that when you break people down into quartiles or

996
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:49,760
quintiles of fitness and strength, the biggest jump in the benefit, right? So the biggest

997
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:55,760
improvement in mortality always comes from being in the bottom quintile or quartile to the next one.

998
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,080
This is a really important point that shouldn't be lost. So people are sitting here listening to us

999
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,720
thinking, look at these two idiots who train all day and love this stuff. Like, that's nice for

1000
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:12,080
you to say, no, actually, you're going to achieve the most benefit when you go from being in the

1001
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:18,400
lowest 20% of the population to the second 20th percentile of population. And that can't be

1002
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,280
overstated. I mean, that's so in other words, the curve looks like this. And I think one of the

1003
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,880
biggest failures of the fitness industry, quite honestly, is convincing people that they need to

1004
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:34,560
have a shredded six pack and be really muscular to be fit. Like, no, you don't have to. In fact,

1005
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:39,360
I would argue that most people that are that lean probably don't feel that fit. I know that when I

1006
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,480
was very lean for bodybuilding, I had no energy, no sex drive, thought about food all the time,

1007
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:51,200
and, you know, was a miserable human. So like, the real sweet spot is probably where you got a little

1008
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:58,960
bit of fluff. You're still relatively lean. But, you know, even not getting to that point, just

1009
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:07,040
moving. I mean, look at the step data. The step data is very, very clear too. Like, there is a

1010
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:14,160
huge inflection at about 8,000 steps per day. Where, yeah, you still get benefits by going even up to

1011
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:20,480
like 20,000 steps a day. But the vast majority of the benefits just go from like, I mean, the

1012
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:26,160
dip off in mortality. I'm sure you've seen it. It's like going from 2,000 to 8,000. It's like

1013
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:33,680
precipitous. It's like free falling off a cliff. How drastically that decreases mortality. And I

1014
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,960
don't think there's anything magic about steps. I just think you're just literally looking at people

1015
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,640
getting more active. So I think one of the biggest failures in the fitness industry is the messaging

1016
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:49,200
that you need to look like this in order for you to be healthy. When the messaging should be,

1017
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,480
hey, for you to be healthy, it's really like a very low barrier to entry. Like, even if you just

1018
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:01,360
get out and walk, you know, for 30 minutes a day. So much benefit from that just compared to just

1019
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:07,360
sitting down. You know, just doing anything in the gym, even if it's people say, oh, machines are

1020
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,000
worthless. They're not worthless. Machines are great tools. You're still applying tension to

1021
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,840
the muscle. Would I argue that maybe, you know, a free barbell movement might be more functional?

1022
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:24,640
Maybe. But if it's the difference between the 70 year old female who's never resistance trained

1023
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:29,760
before getting into the gym and doing something or not, I'm going to be like, yeah, knock yourself

1024
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:35,680
out of machines. So I think that is a huge failure of the fitness industry in the messaging, which is

1025
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:45,120
you need to look like this in order for you to have achieved health. So on that front,

1026
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,160
because I do want to talk a little bit about bodybuilding, both in your own personal experience

1027
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:56,240
and just again, the insights that we can gain. I don't think most people listening to this myself

1028
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:03,520
included ever want to be 4% or 5% body fat, which is you don't. Yeah. So, but look, I'm sure somebody

1029
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,400
who's 25% body fat would like to be 20% body fat. And can they learn something from bodybuilder? But

1030
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:16,320
just picking up where you went, where do you see, you know, kind of the general role of fitness

1031
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:28,560
experts in social media? How can a person sort of make sense of the never ending sea of experts out

1032
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:35,520
there? Man. So a couple years ago, we had a guy in our podcast named Alan Livenovitz. He's been on Joe

1033
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:42,480
Rogan's podcast too, and he's a religious studies expert, but he wrote a book on kind of like the

1034
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:49,360
naturalism fallacy. And we were talking about like how hard it is for people to identify experts.

1035
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,760
And he said something that I thought was really insightful. He said, what you should look for

1036
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:59,040
an expert is the exact opposite of what you probably think you should look for. If somebody

1037
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:06,320
sounds really confident, they're probably not an expert. What you really want to look for is people

1038
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:14,880
who sound kind of doubtful. And they say things like probably, maybe, possibly, you know, if you,

1039
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:20,800
when you speak to true experts, usually if you ask them a question, the first thing they'll do is ask

1040
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:26,080
you a question back, unless the question is very contextual, right? So I'll get people who say,

1041
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:34,560
hey, what are your thoughts on X, right? And usually I'll say, okay, well, as it pertains to

1042
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:40,480
what, like hypertrophy or strength or fitness or, you know, like I need context in order to be able

1043
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:48,880
to answer the question correctly. And so I think looking for people, like people ask me like, what

1044
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:55,600
do you think about like credentials? I'm like, credentials help. Like if I see somebody has a

1045
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:01,600
PhD in a certain subject, I'm probably going to give them a lot more leeway in terms of, okay,

1046
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,240
if they say something I disagree with, let me see why they said that, you know, let's,

1047
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:13,840
let's dig a little bit deeper. But I've seen some PhDs say some really dumb stuff. I've seen people

1048
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:20,400
from Harvard say really dumb stuff. I've probably said really dumb stuff, right? Like it doesn't

1049
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:29,760
stop you. Credentials aren't a, they're a nice thing, but they're not foolproof. So really,

1050
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:36,880
I try to listen to how people speak. But given that you have such a knowledge background,

1051
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:43,520
it's, it's a lot easier for you to kind of look at, you know, someone's Instagram account and

1052
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:50,000
pretty quickly realize this person knows nothing. They might look good. They might be a great

1053
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:56,320
marketer, but they don't really know anything. Yeah. But, you know, the average person doesn't

1054
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:02,240
have your knowledge base. Correct. And so what, what else can they rely on? So clearly that's one

1055
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:08,960
great criteria or two, right? Is, you know, some sense of credentialing can be helpful. Some sense

1056
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,720
of speaking with nuance and being comfortable with uncertainty. I think that's also helpful.

1057
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,400
Are there any other tools that a person can use to disentangle this world?

1058
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:26,800
People who say the magic words, I don't know, you know, like that again sounds counterintuitive,

1059
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:34,160
but I remember when, so when I was part of getting my PhD, I had to do what was called a qualifying

1060
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:42,160
exam. And so that is a four hour oral examination in front of four professors. And when I was

1061
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:48,560
prepping for this, Dr. Lehman, who you've had on the podcast, he, he said, they're going to push

1062
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,520
you in whatever subject they start out on until you don't know. And you need to be able to say,

1063
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:59,280
I don't know. And so they did exactly that. Like I'll still never forget the way they started off

1064
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:05,920
the qualifying exam was let's talk about vitamins. What's your favorite? So vitamin D. Okay. Where

1065
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,720
is it synthesized? And they kept pushing until I just didn't know. And I'll still never forget.

1066
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:14,880
They asked me like an acid base balance question in the long and I started to get up on the wipe

1067
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:19,440
off board and like try to draw. And I just turned around and said, I don't know this one. So, okay,

1068
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,440
move on. And when I got done, they said, you were actually one of the best students we've had the

1069
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:29,360
last few years because you knew what you knew and you knew what you didn't know. And they, that

1070
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:35,120
division puts such an emphasis on not going outside your lane, not speaking about something,

1071
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:40,160
not speculating, not speculating about something that you didn't know and trying to pass it off

1072
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:45,600
like you did. So I think that just got hammered into me. So when it comes to looking at other

1073
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:52,800
folks, one, if they're willing to like know their scope and not feel the need to comment on every

1074
01:37:52,800 --> 01:38:01,440
single thing, that's a good, that's a good metric. Also, you know, I'm going to paint with a broad

1075
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:07,840
brush and there's always exceptions to this. But people who use like tips, tricks, hacks,

1076
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,880
five things to never do, five things to always do the best worst people who use a lot of superlatives.

1077
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:22,400
That's not typically the way that experts talk. You know, I say a lot, there's no solutions,

1078
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:27,280
there's only trade offs, right? There's certain tools that make a lot more sense,

1079
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:33,440
depending on somebody's goals and where they're at than compared to somebody else and vice versa.

1080
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:40,800
But that almost suggests that social media is negatively selecting, because a lot of those

1081
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:48,560
things that you said, certainty, you know, a flare for showmanship, tips, tricks and listicles,

1082
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,640
that's against attention. I think the algorithm likes those things because they get a lot of

1083
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:58,000
attention, even if some of that attention isn't warranted. So that adds another layer of confusion

1084
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:03,440
to this, which is it is difficult. And it's, you know, even when I scroll through Instagram,

1085
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:11,760
I'm amazed at how much it's trying to push to me. You know, I miss the day when all I saw on

1086
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,320
Instagram were the 40 people I followed. Yep. Like those, I feel like that was the good old day.

1087
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,400
And in the sequence of the way things were posted too.

1088
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,320
It was like, oh, here's what this friend of mine did. Here's what this friend of mine did. Here's

1089
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,440
what this person who I don't know, but who I respect, the way that I did it, I was like,

1090
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:35,440
and now it's insane, the barrage of stuff that Instagram thinks I want to see. And admittedly,

1091
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:41,600
sometimes it's right. Yeah. But so many times it's just wrong. And it makes me think, well,

1092
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,400
if that's my experience, that's got to be everybody's experience. And it is. I think

1093
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:54,240
Alan talked about this as information silos. And this is a broader problem, but it is a problem

1094
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:00,640
in nutrition and fitness specifically. You know, people don't really, if you just follow the people

1095
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:06,560
you follow and the accounts that get suggested to you, you're actually not broadening anything.

1096
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:14,320
Right. So you're, you're sitting in an information, information silo. And what happens is,

1097
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:22,320
or at least what I think is happening is, you know, previously nineties, two thousands,

1098
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:27,840
eighties, whatever, you know, you'd come across people with differences of opinion to you and

1099
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:33,520
you could have a conversation with them. And it usually was, you know, sometimes it could be

1100
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,360
contentious. But for the most part, I would say like, when you can sit down and look a human being

1101
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,200
in the eyes and talk about your differences, it's usually not as confrontational. Right.

1102
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:47,920
Now we have whole generations of people who are not used to seeing opinions different than their

1103
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:53,120
own or thoughts or beliefs that are different from their own because they're in those information

1104
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:59,040
silos. And when they get exposed to something different, they just don't know how to handle it.

1105
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:06,640
And so, I mean, like you see some really like extreme responses, even to stuff like nutrition,

1106
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:14,000
you know, like I can't name how many times I've been called a shill for, you know, XYZ, you know,

1107
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:23,360
big meat, big dairy, artificial sweeteners, big sugar, you know, because it's almost like, well,

1108
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:28,560
it can't possibly be somebody just has a different opinion based on this data. They have to be a bad

1109
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:34,800
person. So I do think it's a real problem. And what you said is very well taken that is, you know,

1110
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:43,360
you almost have to be willing to do clickbait to really get your stuff out there. And so I, as a

1111
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,760
business owner who does a lot of the business through Instagram, I really have to try to screw

1112
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:55,120
it a fine line of I am trying to get people's attention and not lose the nuance and the context

1113
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:02,000
and all those things are important. And, you know, trust me, there's days where I'm like, man,

1114
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,320
I can make so much money if I just, you know, but that isn't how I want to live my life or leave my

1115
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:14,880
legacy or anything. And so you're an interesting person because your personality on Twitter and

1116
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,680
your personality on Instagram are quite different. And your personality in real life is totally

1117
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:25,520
different. Yeah. So people who know you, like I know you, you almost don't recognize. Now, tell

1118
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,360
me a little bit about that. Has that been an evolution? Because I have to be honest with you,

1119
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:37,200
I quite envy your personality on Twitter. I've just made a decision that I've almost always been

1120
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:43,360
able to uphold, which is I'm not going to get drawn into it. Yeah. Right. In fact, I don't

1121
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:47,600
really even look at comments on Twitter anymore. Posting ghosts. Posting ghosts as Rogan has

1122
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:54,400
adequately reminded me many times. So, but I'll be honest with you, I see enough negative ones

1123
01:42:54,400 --> 01:43:01,600
where I just want to spank the living shit out of the person on the other. I mean, I want to,

1124
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:09,520
with words, eviscerate them. Yeah. And 99.9% of the time I refrain from doing it.

1125
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:16,640
But I really get a kick out of the fact that a lot of times you just spank people into the next

1126
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:23,440
century. So tell me about that. How, you know, so is it a conscious decision? Because it never comes

1127
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:29,520
across as unhinged. It never comes across as terribly reactionary. It usually comes across

1128
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:36,480
as kind of calculated. Yeah. But yeah. So just walk me through your thinking. So I think it

1129
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,520
probably was a little bit unhinged when I first started, you know, like the internet was just in

1130
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,680
general, like I'm bodybuilding forums. It's like, well, you disagree with me. You call me a name.

1131
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:53,600
Well, you know, but I think, you know, my style isn't going to be for everybody.

1132
01:43:54,160 --> 01:44:00,560
And I think part of it, honestly, if I had to like psychoanalyze myself, probably goes back to like

1133
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:11,360
me being bullied as a kid. And I almost view like misinformation and people who, especially

1134
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:17,280
like you've probably noticed, I save my most, the biggest amount of vitriol for people who

1135
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,600
is very clearly have a pattern of behavior that's also being monetized. Right. So that's like,

1136
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,720
when you're like preying on the desperation and ignorance of people, I'm going to have very little

1137
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:37,360
sympathy for you. And I think part of that evolved to out of my coaching and seeing how many people

1138
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:44,320
came to me, like quite frankly, feeling broken, because they tried so many of these things that

1139
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,400
were the solution and the cure. And when it didn't work for them, they're just like, oh, I'm,

1140
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,320
you know, something wrong with me. It's like, nothing's wrong with you. You just like, you

1141
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:59,280
haven't been executing on these principles that work. Right. And so I really have tried to kind

1142
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:03,920
of like dial it back a little bit because I think I took it too far at a certain point.

1143
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,080
But now I just try to like use it to be funny, right? Like to get to get some attention. Like,

1144
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:16,560
I think one of my, one of my most popular. So what's funny is like my best Instagram posts are

1145
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:22,160
all just screenshots of my Twitter. Like if you look at my, you can go to your insights, right?

1146
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:29,840
And you look at my top performing posts. It's like 95% Twitter screenshots, right? So,

1147
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:40,560
um, yeah, I think my, one of my top rated posts of all time was, um, Mark Hyman had said something

1148
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:47,440
and my, my response was just stop making shit up. Just, just, you know, very like, you know, uh,

1149
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:54,880
cavalier and, you know, funny. And, you know, I think there are some people who would absolutely

1150
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,440
would turn them off and I get that. But then I also speak to the person, people who are like,

1151
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,280
yeah, I'm tired of like stuff being overly sanitized. And I just wish somebody would tell

1152
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:09,600
me how they really feel. Right? So, and it's funny cause I've had so many academics reach out to me

1153
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:14,480
behind closed doors and say, I love your Twitter. I love just watching you like, you know,

1154
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:19,120
break this stuff down. And the thing is I'll say to people is it's like, you know,

1155
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:27,920
it's never just me attacking the person. I'm also providing like citations and I'm, or logic and

1156
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:34,480
data and whatnot. Uh, but I'm just trying to make it funny and engaging, you know, um, you know,

1157
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,560
but I'll always have a conversation with some, with somebody like, for example, um,

1158
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:45,040
Thomas DeLauer is a great example. So, uh, I've done several videos, kind of debunking some of

1159
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:50,960
the claims he made. And actually one day he just reached out to me and said, Hey man, I want you to

1160
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:56,080
know that, um, I actually really respect you and you've actually made me change the way I think

1161
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:02,560
about some of this stuff. Would you want to come on my podcast? Yeah, man, let's do it. Because I

1162
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:08,560
really respect anybody who can be self-reflective enough to go, you know what? I might've been

1163
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:16,160
wrong or just even like wanting to get a different perspective on things. So just another great

1164
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:21,920
example of that. I'm actually going and speaking at a low carb conference next year. Um, the joke

1165
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:27,120
was like, are you, are you going to need a, do I need to bring bodyguards? You know? Um,

1166
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:32,160
it, that's so interesting to me. I, um, I don't know. And I'm not close enough to any of the

1167
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:37,200
dietary communities to know. Uh, obviously I still get very strongly associated with a low carb

1168
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:44,800
ideology, which is funny given that you see how many carbohydrates I eat. Um, but what is the

1169
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:50,560
view about you and low carbohydrate diets? Because you know, I, I, I've never heard you

1170
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:56,480
say anything that is uniquely, uh, anti low carb other than, you know, the stuff we've already

1171
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,160
talked about on the previous podcasts. Yeah. So I always tell people, so I'm like,

1172
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:05,280
how could I be anti low carb? If you go to my, our, our nutrition coaching app, carbon diet coach,

1173
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,080
two of the, two of the six settings are low carbohydrate. There's low carbohydrate and

1174
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:16,880
there's ketogenic. So how could I possibly be low carb or anti low carb? And I think that this is

1175
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:25,360
just an example of, uh, I call this the Tim Tebow effect. So, uh, but it's just like polarization. So

1176
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:30,880
do you remember when, uh, Tim Tebow was playing NFL football? My hypothesis was there is very few

1177
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:36,000
people, there are very few people in the middle about Tim Tebow. You either love them or you hate

1178
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,640
them. And the way this kind of comes up is like, if you watch this guy and you're like, yeah, you

1179
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:48,000
know, he's not really that good. He's got weird mechanics. He's more of a running back than he is

1180
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,440
a quarterback and he's kind of preachy, but you know, he's all right. But then you see all these

1181
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,600
people saying he's the Heisman. He, you know, he's going to playoffs like, well, you know, he's

1182
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,120
better than your quarterback. Like, you know, this, that you go, what are you talking about?

1183
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:06,640
Like his completion person, it just like 45%. How can you say he's good? Then you have the other side,

1184
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:10,000
which people like, like me, I actually was kind of a Tim Tebow fan. Cause I'm like, you know,

1185
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,280
he seems like a nice guy who works hard. Um, maybe not the best genetics to be a quarterback,

1186
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:20,560
but like, you know, he's been successful. Like that's, that's admirable. And then you look over

1187
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:25,360
here and you see all these people going, he sucks. He's terrible. And it's like, well, he did win a

1188
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:32,400
playoff game, you know? So I think this happens in, with many different subjects and even right. Like

1189
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:39,600
we were talking about this the other day, you know, you're a car guy. I'm not a car guy, right? So I've

1190
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,240
posted many times. In fact, when we bought our, our new house, I'm going to take a picture of me

1191
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,120
with the car outside the house. It's going to be the greatest picture that ever goes to my social

1192
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:52,160
media. Cause I've still got my grad school car, which is a 2003 Alero. And I've just never,

1193
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:58,080
I just never felt the need to get rid of it. Right. So you got this really dinky old car with

1194
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:03,680
me on the hood sitting outside this, you know, wonderful, you know, big house and sure enough,

1195
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,920
we got like 1500 comments, but some of the comments were, and I was talking about how

1196
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:15,440
basically saying, you know, my ability to delay gratification is what got me here. And

1197
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:22,000
you can do it too. Like delaying gratification and anything is so essential for success in almost

1198
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:29,520
any goal. Cause it's so crazy how in almost anything, whatever provides you like short term

1199
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:35,920
relief for happiness almost always makes it worse in the longterm and vice versa. But people

1200
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,880
would say, why do you, why do you hate people who buy nice cars? I'm like, where did I say I hate

1201
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:47,840
people buy nice cars. I never said that, you know, same thing with low carb that my messaging has

1202
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:53,280
consistently been usually there'll be some kind of insane claim, you know, like calories don't

1203
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:57,920
matter or, you know, you can eat as much on low carb as you want, not gained fat. And then I'm

1204
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:03,520
like, well, here's citation, citation, citation, low carb does not appear to be better for fat loss

1205
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:11,760
than, you know, calorie protein, equated diets that are not low carb, but that means choose what

1206
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:17,600
you prefer because it's not worse. So by all means, like if you like low carb, go right ahead.

1207
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:25,840
I don't enjoy low carb, but I know many people that do. And so I think one of the reasons people

1208
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:33,600
get so troubled about this is they find something that worked for them and they then retroactively

1209
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:43,120
try to find the evidence to show that it's the best thing that there is. And which, which of the

1210
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:50,160
two landscapes, nutrition and exercise, do you think is more culty? My impression is nutrition.

1211
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:55,600
Definitely nutrition. Definitely nutrition. And do you think that that's because of the

1212
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:02,240
ubiquity of food in our lives and the fact that we all have almost equally a personal relationship

1213
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:08,080
with food, whereas not everybody exercises the same amount. And do you think that that's.

1214
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:14,720
So there's two things, especially here in America, we come from a Puritan background. And I think

1215
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:21,040
that this this kind of thinking that anything that is pleasurable at all must be bad for you

1216
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:26,080
and you cannot have it. You should feel bad about it. Right. So I think that causes people to get

1217
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:33,200
a little bit tribal in terms of like, I mean, I've had people like say horrible, like moral judgments,

1218
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:37,520
because like I'll post me eating a bag of Skittles or something like that. You know,

1219
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,400
never mind the fact I just went and trained for three hours, you know.

1220
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,600
I think somebody like called me a disgusting sugar addict one time.

1221
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,440
So that's one part of it. I think it's the smaller part. I think the bigger part is what you just said.

1222
01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:00,320
If it's funny, whenever I meet new people, I'm always kind of hesitant to, you know,

1223
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,520
if they don't know anything about me to tell them that I have a background in nutrition,

1224
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:09,280
PhD nutrition, because usually one of a couple of things happens. They either clam up real quick,

1225
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:12,240
like brought to dinner and they get very self-conscious about what they're eating, which

1226
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,200
bro, I just ordered the fries like, you know, you're good.

1227
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:27,040
Or I get like blitzkrieged with questions, but mostly people wanting me to validate what they

1228
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:32,560
already believe to be true. But if I was, if I sat down, I said, you know, I'm a theoretical

1229
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,840
astrophysicist. We might talk about space a little bit, but they're probably not going to question my

1230
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:45,200
beliefs or my opinions on string theory. Right. But I think because everyone eats and everyone

1231
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:52,880
knows something about their body, right or wrong, they have drawn certain conclusions about what

1232
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:58,800
they put in their body and what happens to their body. And so I think because of that, because

1233
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:04,800
everybody has an opinion about nutrition, it makes it really tough because people are already like,

1234
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:13,920
just natively have certain beliefs. And we know how hard it is to change people's beliefs. There

1235
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:20,880
was a classic study. It was in politics. It was a classic study where they showed hard data,

1236
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:30,240
and this was for both parties. They would either refute a preconceived belief or support it.

1237
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,920
I think one of them was with I can't remember what they used for Republicans, but for Democrats,

1238
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:46,400
the belief was that I think George W. Bush stopped or outlawed funding for stem cell research or

1239
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,720
something like that. The reality was he just stopped federal funding. He didn't outlaw it.

1240
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:58,320
So they showed people this, these facts. By the way, again, if I butchered that, I apologize

1241
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:03,520
to anyone watching, but I think that was it. They showed people these facts and it didn't matter.

1242
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:11,120
If they believed that he had outlawed it, even if they showed them the facts that he didn't,

1243
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:17,120
they still, it still reinforced their pre-existing belief. It actually made their belief stronger.

1244
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,040
And the same thing was true for Republicans, by the way. And I don't think it's a Republican or

1245
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:29,840
Democrat problem. I think it's a people problem, to be honest. And I think one of the benefits I had

1246
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:40,320
very early on in grad school was Dr. Lehman just absolutely dismantling so many beliefs I had.

1247
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:47,920
But then, but doing it in a way that wasn't judgmental or made me feel bad. And what I

1248
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:54,000
tell people now, it's like being wrong about something is a beautiful thing. Because if I'm

1249
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,880
already right about everything, then I'm already doing everything the best I can and I can't get

1250
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,760
better. But if I'm doing something, if I'm wrong about something, that's actually awesome because

1251
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:11,280
now I have something I can improve on. So now I tell people I like being right, right? Like I'll

1252
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:18,480
do cartwheels in my living room if I'm right. But if I'm wrong, I don't really take that much

1253
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:24,960
offense to it because it's just data. It's not, there's no ethical judgment. And I've changed my

1254
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:31,760
mind about a myriad of things. I was going to ask you, what are three of the most impactful things

1255
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:39,120
that you have changed your opinion on in nutrition specifically? And let's make it recent, because I

1256
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:44,400
know for any of us, if we go back a decade, it's an eternity in terms of our understanding of

1257
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:49,120
nutrition science or something like that. But let's pick a narrow window of maybe like three or four

1258
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:57,680
years. What would be sort of three areas where your opinion has really changed in a manner that

1259
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:05,920
actually leads to either a different behavior in you or a different coaching input to your clients?

1260
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:13,600
I think of three things right away. So first thing being LDL cholesterol. So when I got to grad school,

1261
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:22,240
the kind of the narrative and even out of the lab I was in was, it's really, we don't think it's LDL.

1262
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:26,560
It's more the HDL to LDL ratio and the particle size and those sorts of things.

1263
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:34,880
And I kept that probably until about five years ago, four years ago. And I just saw enough of these

1264
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:39,680
Mendelian randomizations come out. It's like, wow, that's pretty powerful. When you look at the

1265
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:45,040
mortality rate and it is like linear with the exposure, the lifetime exposure to LDL, I'm like,

1266
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:49,520
can't really hold this belief anymore because it's just not supported by the data.

1267
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:56,240
And it actually changed my opinion on like, you know, now I'm a little bit more conscious about

1268
01:57:56,240 --> 01:58:01,520
the saturated fat I consume. We talked about like I actually started taking a low dose of a statin.

1269
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:09,840
And that's helped. So I've never had super high LDL, but I've always been around 150 to 125,

1270
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:15,600
even if I reduce my saturated fat, increase my fiber. I eat probably 60, 70 grams of fiber a day.

1271
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:24,720
So, you know, I think people get that one twisted a little bit because they'll hear things like,

1272
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,120
well, it doesn't consider HDL. It doesn't consider this. No, you have to understand what an

1273
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:34,400
independent risk factor means. It means that all things being equal, are you better off having

1274
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:41,120
higher HDL? Yeah. But HDL is more of a marker of metabolic health because we have some drug trials

1275
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:45,280
and Mendelian randomizations now where they modulate HDL and it doesn't really seem to make

1276
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:54,480
a difference. Whereas if you modulate LDL, so even at high HDL or low HDL in both stratifications,

1277
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:00,000
lower LDL is almost always better for cardiovascular disease and mortality.

1278
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,120
I feel like I need to do a podcast on Mendelian randomization. I write about it in my book.

1279
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,600
And I actually- It's very powerful.

1280
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:15,200
Yeah. And I understand why it doesn't get more attention because you do have to really get into

1281
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:22,400
the weeds of genetic sorting and the statistical methods that are involved. But I actually in the

1282
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:28,000
book write about it as one of the five pillars of evidence that we should be relying on as we

1283
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:35,360
formulate insights with respect to anything that we do. So that's an interesting one. And obviously,

1284
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:40,560
it has a parallel piece, which is around your relationship to saturated fat.

1285
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:46,160
Yeah. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is when you're looking at mortality,

1286
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:51,120
cardiovascular disease, this is where nutrition science can become so limited. And the power with

1287
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:54,720
Mendelian randomization is you're kind of looking at a lifetime randomized control trial.

1288
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:59,840
That's right. Right. So people will point out things like the Minnesota coronary study,

1289
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:03,600
and I think there was another Australian study and they said, well, look at this randomized control

1290
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:08,640
trial where they looked at high saturated fat versus low saturated fat, and there wasn't a

1291
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:14,080
difference or that sort of thing. And one of the biggest problems with those studies is,

1292
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:19,600
you know, they're two years, which is a really long time for a randomized control trial.

1293
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:25,440
But when you're talking about a disease that is a lifetime exposure, two years in people that are

1294
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:29,360
in their forties, I mean, you're just not going to have that many incidences to pick up on.

1295
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:35,760
So when you're looking at Mendelian randomization, you can get around that because you're looking at

1296
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:41,600
people across their lifetimes. And the way I kind of explain, and I don't consider myself a lipid

1297
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:48,000
expert, but the way I try to explain like lifetime exposure risk is imagine if you and I start

1298
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:56,560
investing, right? And you get in at 8%. We both invest $10,000. You get an 8%, I get a 6%.

1299
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,280
If we look after a year or two, I mean, you'll have more, but it won't be like statistically

1300
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,400
different, right? But if you look at four years, you're going to have a lot more. And I don't know

1301
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:13,280
how much exactly, but my guess is it's going to be magnitudes of times greater because you're, again,

1302
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:19,280
lifetime exposure. Actually, I've done this exercise and it was initially in my book. I

1303
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:26,480
actually use this exact analysis was $1,000 invested at, I think I chose 6% versus 4%,

1304
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:34,640
or maybe it was even 6 versus 5. It was something that was small enough that at 5 and 10 years

1305
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:41,120
wasn't enormous, but at 40, 50 and 60 years was staggering. And that was the exact point,

1306
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:49,840
which is the cumulative effect of compounding over a lifetime is so nonlinear that I don't think

1307
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:55,440
we are capable of understanding it. Like I don't think we can ever cognitively realize it until we

1308
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:59,680
literally just do the calculations and they're staring us in the face. Yeah. And I think, you

1309
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:06,080
know, that, that again, that's one thing I changed my mind on that. I was pretty, I was pretty strong

1310
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:11,200
belief about it. And, you know, it's kind of like, well, how much evidence do you need? Like,

1311
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:16,240
you know, we, we still have kind of LDL denialists out there. And I think it's one of the, I think

1312
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:20,640
it's one of the most dangerous things I see actually. Yeah. I mean, like you have the mechanism,

1313
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:24,880
the penetration of the endothelium, it's very clear that that happens. We have the animal models

1314
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:29,760
that show linear dose independent effects. You have the Mendelian randomization and you have

1315
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,960
the clinical trials in humans. And you have the prospective cohort studies. And then you have the,

1316
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:40,240
you have the genetic studies. So, right. You have the PCSK9 over and under expressors. So, so,

1317
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:46,000
I want to come back to the Minnesota heart study in a moment, but let's go on and hear the other two.

1318
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:52,000
Yeah. So supplemental branched amino acids. That's another one. I used to be a big advocate for that.

1319
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
In fact, the first supplement company I had five years ago, we sold a product with branched

1320
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,480
amino acids in it. And then my, my current supplement company, Outwork Nutrition,

1321
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:07,440
we do not have a branched amino acid product because. And that was basically taking the three

1322
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:14,160
branched amino acids as an in workout supplement. As a post-workout recovery supplement. I still

1323
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:19,120
do think there may be a small benefit for delayed onset muscle soreness with branched chains that

1324
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:25,840
may be outside of just regular protein, but based on the cost and honestly, like the,

1325
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:30,320
the negative impact on taste too, because that's the, the Lucene is horrible, right? Oh, yeah.

1326
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:37,040
You know, I used to, I think I told you, I used to spike five grams of Lucene into my water

1327
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:42,880
during a workout. I mean, it's the most awful tasting. Is there any other, is there any other

1328
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:48,240
amino acid that tastes as bad as Lucene? Probably some of the sulfur based ones, you know, cysteine

1329
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:55,040
or methionine. Yeah. No, it's pretty bad. And the fact it's also non-polar, so it doesn't dissolve.

1330
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,440
Yeah, it doesn't dissolve. Well, you're shaking it constantly.

1331
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:02,240
Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, I was a big advocate for that. I was sponsored by a company called

1332
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,720
Salvation for years that had a branch amino acid product.

1333
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,960
Has the rest of the world caught up to that or BCAA is still a big product.

1334
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:15,120
They still are a big product. They still are a big product, but most evidence-based folks,

1335
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:20,560
you know, will say, Hey, we just, there's, it's not really, it's not better than protein.

1336
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,400
Yeah. Right. In fact, the actual,

1337
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:26,160
the research tends to suggest whey protein is actually better than branched chains.

1338
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,760
Even when you equate for the dose of branched chains in the protein.

1339
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:36,000
So yeah, I just kind of got to the point where I'm like, if I, if I put this in the products,

1340
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,320
I'm just doing it because my, you know, I'm tied to branch chains, right? Like people are expecting

1341
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:47,440
this from me because like my PhD was in Lucene in the branch, amino acid and the metabolism and

1342
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:52,400
other effects on muscle protein synthesis. But I just, I couldn't hold that position anymore based

1343
02:04:52,480 --> 02:05:00,480
on the evidence because it was just too strong. And then the other one that I have now lost in my

1344
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:10,800
brain. Oh, so the idea that I used to really kind of discourage people from intermittent fasting.

1345
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,320
So the other thing I changed my opinion on was intermittent fasting,

1346
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:21,520
at least in terms of like your traditional 16, eight, because I used to say, well, I'm worried

1347
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:27,920
about the, the catabolic effects of it, you know, that sort of thing, at least when combined with

1348
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:35,040
resistance training and sufficient total protein and that the caveat should be that they also,

1349
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:38,720
the, in these studies, they trained within their feeding window. There's some really good studies

1350
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:44,640
by Grant Tinsley on this. There doesn't appear to be at least not statistically significant

1351
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:50,480
differences in lean mass between people who do 16, eight intermittent fasting versus people who

1352
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:55,280
just eat continuously. So I used to be like somebody like, well, you know, really like every

1353
02:05:55,280 --> 02:06:01,920
four hours should be getting a protein dose, that sort of thing. Maybe if you plot it out over 30

1354
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:05,520
years, it'll make a difference on how much lean mass you gain. So I would still say if you're

1355
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:13,200
somebody who is a bodybuilder and you want to absolutely squeeze out every last ounce of muscle

1356
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:18,160
that you can get, I still would say like any form of intermittent fasting probably isn't optimal,

1357
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:25,440
but for the average person, can you get plenty strong, plenty big and still do intermittent

1358
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:30,480
fasting? At least the 16, eight, I would say absolutely. Which is really interesting because

1359
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:36,160
I've kind of gone the other way from you. Yeah, you were saying. I used to be a big proponent

1360
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:42,640
and then what I was seeing clinically, so this was really just anecdotal, but when you see it

1361
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:48,080
over and over and over and over again on so many patients on whom you have DEXA data and

1362
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:55,600
was, we were seeing a real deterioration of body composition. Now were they still definitely

1363
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:00,160
getting enough total protein? No, and that's my point. So what I know was happening was

1364
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:07,760
they were falling behind on protein. And so the question then becomes one of efficacy versus

1365
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:14,880
effectiveness. In other words, the data which are done under controlled settings say if I control

1366
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:22,640
for total protein, it can be identical, but the effectiveness version of that is in practice,

1367
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:30,720
do people make that happen? And I guess what I would say is we weren't seeing it. So we still use

1368
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:39,120
intermittent fasting in patients as one of the three big levers of energy restriction, but we

1369
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:47,360
have a big red caution button all over it that says if you choose this instead of caloric

1370
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:51,760
restriction or dietary restriction, if you want to choose time restriction as your lever,

1371
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,720
you're going to have to go out of your way to make sure you are not compromising protein.

1372
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:05,040
Yeah. And I think one of the things I'll tell people is, and I can do dogmatism over all these

1373
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:11,360
different disciplines, including what I like, which is flexible dieting, but people get too hung up on

1374
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:16,480
the actual fasting part of intermittent fasting. You're reducing your energy intake. It's a tool

1375
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:22,080
and a lot of people, it works great. They say I'm not hungry. It didn't feel like I was dieting.

1376
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:27,120
Awesome. But so people will say, well, is it going to break a fast if I have coffee?

1377
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:31,680
Will it break a fast if I chew gum? Will it break a fast if I have a protein shake? And what I'll

1378
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:38,080
say is like, well, why are you fasting? And usually if they're like... And by the way,

1379
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:45,040
I'm only laughing because I'm guilty of this. Right. I used to really think about the details

1380
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:52,640
of that and that I just don't think... Look, I think autophagy is an incredibly important

1381
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:59,600
part of our ability to regenerate. I just don't think there's a chance you're getting any meaningful

1382
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:06,560
amount of it in 16 hours. And therefore, to your point, we would even tell patients now to have a

1383
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,840
protein shake outside of that feeding window. In fact, I think you and I even spoke about that idea,

1384
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:16,160
which was if it's really all about energy restriction, what's an extra 200 calories

1385
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:19,760
outside of your feeding window? Exactly. Actually, if you look at some of the effects of high protein

1386
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:25,680
diets, they actually are not dissimilar from some of the effects you get from fasting, at least like

1387
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:32,880
liver metabolism and whatnot. So I would say to somebody, well, don't worry about breaking your

1388
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:39,280
fast in terms of you're eating something. If you're worried about it, intermittently fast your

1389
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:43,840
carbohydrate and fat intake and just have an extra dose of protein in the morning, or essential

1390
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,800
amino acids or whatever you want. Because now you're getting that anabolic stimulus,

1391
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:52,560
spreading it out a little bit more. You're making sure you get enough total protein in during the

1392
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:59,920
day. And quite honestly, I mean, this is a theory that Dr. Lehman and I had, which was breakfast

1393
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:06,480
probably is the most important protein dosing of the day because you are coming off a significant

1394
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:10,560
period of fasting. And then if you're extending that out, like how much longer are you extending

1395
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:14,880
that out? What does that mean? You know, it's long term. I think I told you, I've officially

1396
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:21,120
taken to bribing my 14 year old daughter. Yeah. Yeah. So there's now real stakes on the line for

1397
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:25,520
her to get that minimum 30 grams of protein. No pun intended mistake, right? That's right.

1398
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:31,200
Minimum 30 grams before she goes to school in the morning. Yeah. I'm like an awful father.

1399
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:39,840
So it's interesting how that that that kind of dogmatism plays out. Like you have the same thing

1400
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:46,240
with low carb, right? Like people so worried about getting any carbs. Meanwhile, they're like dumping

1401
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:51,520
oil on their salad and, you know, putting butter in their coffee and, you know, eating like loads

1402
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:57,040
of bacon or they're, they're eating keto ice cream because it's not spiking their blood sugar. But

1403
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:01,600
it's like, if you looked at the keto ice cream, it's actually more calories than like, like we're,

1404
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:07,280
we're missing the entire point here, right? Yeah. And the same thing goes for like flexible dieting.

1405
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:11,840
Like I had people who were like, it's like they were trying to hack the system of how can I eat

1406
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,120
as much junk food as I would. I'm allowed 3000 calories a day. What if it's all Skittles? Right.

1407
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:23,760
So like, what if I do just protein shake, you know, Skittles and peanut butter. And my point is like,

1408
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:29,760
listen, like if you take anything too far, it's probably a really bad idea. Right. And one of the

1409
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:34,400
things I said about flexible dieting too is like, we know fiber is really important. Like, you know,

1410
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:41,440
there are some folks who are kind of anti fiber now. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. I've missed this. I've

1411
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:46,480
missed this move. Well, the carnivore, the carnivore folks. Ah, okay. Okay. It's funny. Like, um,

1412
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:51,200
I was in a debate one time with a carnivore advocate and you know, my research was sponsored

1413
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:55,920
by the Egg Nutrition Center, the National Dairy Council and the National Cattlemen's Beef

1414
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:02,160
Association. And I, if anybody should be pro carnivore. Yeah. And I said, the fact that I'm

1415
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:08,160
sitting here defending plants is actually kind of mind blowing to me. And if anything, it should

1416
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:14,480
actually increase your trust in what I'm saying, because I mean, I am a fan of high quality animal

1417
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:20,560
protein. I think it's, what is the argument? Let's talk for a moment about the carnivore diet.

1418
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,640
Obviously for people listening, it's pretty straightforward explanation. It's a diet where

1419
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:29,760
you only eat meat. Right. And I've heard some versions now where people eat honey and fruits

1420
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,960
and whatnot, which I'm not sure how that's carnivore anymore. But in any case, I would say

1421
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:40,480
that's a little better. But so the argument against, what's the argument in favor of that?

1422
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:45,040
What do they propose is the reason to do it? So the reason to do it is, I mean, it's basically

1423
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:50,240
anecdotal. People have done this and they've seen this, right? And of course, like you could

1424
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:55,920
absolutely lose weight doing something like that. Some people. It was pretty easy to see how you

1425
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,800
would lose weight only through the lens of dietary, the strict enough dietary restriction

1426
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,280
is going to ultimately reduce. I mean, how much meat can you eat? Even if it's fatty meat, right?

1427
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:12,080
Like so. And the justification is why I still go to the bathroom just fine. It's like, well,

1428
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:16,400
that's not why you should eat fiber. I mean, yeah, it helps, but that's, that's the last reason to

1429
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:23,280
eat fiber, in my opinion. So that the, they also, some people have said, well, it helped clear up

1430
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:30,160
some autoimmune issues. That's hard to quantify. And some people say, well, like it lowered my

1431
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:35,920
inflammation and, and, and my GI problems. So this is one thing a lot of people get mixed up.

1432
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,200
They'll get like bloated or have GI discomfort and they equate that with inflammation.

1433
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:44,640
Yeah. You may have like some, you might have some, like some localized inflammation,

1434
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:48,720
although it's probably based on what we know about like IBS and whatnot. It's probably just like,

1435
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:55,200
like Barrow sensitivity, but that's not the same thing as like, well, usually say, well,

1436
02:13:55,200 --> 02:14:00,560
did you get your CRP measured? Like, did you get your IL-6 measured? You know, that's inflammation.

1437
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:04,000
When we talk about inflammation, that's what we're talking about. Now.

1438
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,320
But how do you make, let's assume that they, that all those things are true. Let's assume that I

1439
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:15,680
went on a carnivore diet and my actual biomarkers of inflammation improved and my symptoms improved.

1440
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:20,880
I don't know what the number is, but if you think of the average number of foods a person will eat

1441
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:28,160
in a given week, different foods, let's posit that it's in the tens, maybe a hundred. If you

1442
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:35,440
eliminate all but one of them, it's not a good experiment to, you haven't really learned a lot.

1443
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:42,240
You've learned that something in those 99 might have been the problem. That's a hard way to learn

1444
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,520
that. So one of the things I've said, I think a lot of people are getting benefits is they're

1445
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:51,440
basically doing an elimination diet. So for the most part, most people don't have sensitivities

1446
02:14:51,440 --> 02:15:01,040
to meat, but like I think many people just not being in tune with their body probably have IBS,

1447
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:07,600
FODMAP sensitivities where they're fermenting a lot of fructans, oligosaccharides, those sorts of

1448
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:16,240
things. And that fermentation for people with IBS is even though it's a healthy thing because

1449
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:22,720
bacteria getting fuel from fiber is a healthy thing. If it's causing pain, they're equating

1450
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:26,640
that with being something negative, which obviously we don't want anybody to be in pain.

1451
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:30,240
I still believe that there are a lot of people who have wheat sensitivities that are not

1452
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,480
full on gluten sensitivities that don't rise to the level of celiac disease.

1453
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:41,600
Yeah, it's possible. So it's one of those things where they eliminate all plants and they go,

1454
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:49,440
well, I feel better. Okay. Well, now the next step should be adding things back in one by one

1455
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:55,120
and let's figure out what's actually causing those problems. So what I would submit to people is like

1456
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:59,520
still try to include fruits and vegetables and just slowly add them back in and see what works

1457
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:07,600
for you because I think, and this gets into kind of like dietary protein longevity. I think a lot of

1458
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:17,200
this negative perception of animal protein with longevity and health is people who eat high

1459
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:22,640
amounts of animal protein. These aren't people for the most part. They're not eating like lean cuts

1460
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:27,600
of sirloin and chicken breasts and whatnot. People eating high meat are typically eating

1461
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:33,920
high amounts of processed meat and they eat less amounts of fruits and vegetables. In fact,

1462
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:43,440
there's a really classic study, in my opinion, from Maximoff in 2020 and they looked, I think it was

1463
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:51,120
quintals, so four different like serving amounts of fruits and vegetables and four serving amounts

1464
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:59,760
of meat, so lowest to highest, right? And when you look at like low vegetable intake, there is like

1465
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:05,760
a linear effect of, or sorry, if you look at like going from high to low vegetable intake, linear

1466
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:13,680
effect on the incidence of cancer and meat, as you go up in meat, not correcting for fruits and

1467
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:20,400
vegetable intake, you have a linear effect of meat on cancer. But guess what happens when you couple

1468
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:25,120
the highest quintile of meat intake with also the highest quintile of fruits and vegetable intake?

1469
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:34,000
There's no effect. Like you have the same risk for cancer with high meat and high fruit and

1470
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:40,560
vegetable intake as you do with low meat and high fruit and vegetable intake. So to me, that suggests

1471
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:48,720
it's less about the meat you're eating and more about what you're eating instead of, right? So

1472
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:54,960
one of the things to keep in mind with nutrition is when we tell people to eat more or eat less of

1473
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:59,840
something, usually there's a replacement that happens, right? It doesn't happen in a vacuum.

1474
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:09,280
So to me, if we're talking about carnivore, sure, okay, I like high quality protein, great.

1475
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:15,680
I would argue probably lean cuts are a little bit better option. But for God's sakes, have some fruits

1476
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:19,520
and vegetables with it because it's what's going to mitigate your risk. Now you said you're getting

1477
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:25,520
about 40 grams of fiber a day. I'm around 60. 60. And that's total soluble and insoluble.

1478
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:30,320
Yeah, it's total. And so what are your sources? Where do you get the, like, what's the main foods

1479
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:38,400
that are contributing to that? So I'll do like a lot of rice to cauliflower. I'll do quite a, you

1480
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:46,160
know, broccoli, some beans. I'll also do, I love apples. So that's kind of my go to fruit source.

1481
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,600
How many grams of fiber in an apple?

1482
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:52,400
Oh, I want to say it's like three or four grams, maybe a little bit less than that.

1483
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:52,640
Okay.

1484
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:56,880
It's not a huge amount, but like, if you want something a little bit more packed, you know,

1485
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:01,200
like berries, berries tend to be really fiber dense compared to something like apples.

1486
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,960
You know, like something like a banana is a fruit, but relatively low fiber, all things considered.

1487
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:14,000
But even like the higher sugar, lower fiber fruits are still like relatively well associated

1488
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:21,120
with good health outcomes. So, and then honestly, like people are going to laugh and be judgmental.

1489
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:25,840
I love popcorn. So popcorn actually is pretty darn high fiber.

1490
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,240
More than corn on the kernel per kernel basis.

1491
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,280
I don't know about that.

1492
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,920
Because I feel like you could eat more corn than popcorn.

1493
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,640
Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. So popcorn is actually very filling.

1494
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,560
That's one reason I got into eating it during bodybuilding competitions.

1495
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:45,120
Like obviously like I would just like air pop popcorn and I'll usually like put a little bit

1496
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:50,160
of cinnamon and Splenda over that and then like a little bit of like the butter spray.

1497
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:53,120
I mean, it takes you, you know, for 50 grams of carbohydrate from popcorn,

1498
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,000
it'll take you like 20, 30 minutes to eat it, you know.

1499
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,040
So I just found that that like helped me control my hunger.

1500
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:03,920
And in 50 grams of popcorn, you're getting around like

1501
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:07,680
6 to 10 grams of fiber depending on the specific brand you're using.

1502
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:12,640
So that's actually like, I love that as a snack because it's like, it's, you know,

1503
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:16,880
is it as healthy as if I had some fruits and vegetables? Probably not.

1504
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:21,600
But you know, as far as a snack goes, it's, you know, pretty good and very filling.

1505
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:25,760
So I do that. And then like just miscellaneous sources throughout the day.

1506
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:32,560
But I think one of the things to really look at is, you know, people,

1507
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:36,480
I was in a debate with Paul Saldino one time and we were talking about fiber.

1508
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,880
And one of the things he said- And he's a big carnivore advocate.

1509
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:41,200
Big carnivore advocate. One of the things he said was,

1510
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:45,680
well, you know, this stuff with fiber, it's just healthy user bias.

1511
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,040
People eat more fiber.

1512
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,160
You know, they just have other health promoting behaviors.

1513
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:54,320
Now that's a real thing in terms of like cohort studies and cross-sectional data.

1514
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,320
Observational data. It is a real thing.

1515
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,400
But when you're dealing with something that's kind of a healthy user bias,

1516
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:09,920
typically you'll see like the data is not consistent, right?

1517
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,840
Like some one study will say one thing, one study might have no effect.

1518
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,120
One study might say a different thing.

1519
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:16,720
And that's what like you see that with meat.

1520
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:17,120
That's right.

1521
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,720
Like you see that with meat longevity.

1522
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,760
I was just looking at some meta-analysis earlier that one meta-analysis

1523
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,760
even showed that after controlling for confounding variables,

1524
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:28,720
that actually animal protein was not associated with increased mortality.

1525
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,800
But- You don't see it with exercise.

1526
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,080
You don't see it with exercise.

1527
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,080
You don't see it with the smoking studies in the opposite direction.

1528
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,320
You don't see it with fiber.

1529
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:44,560
The effect in fiber, at least in terms of like cardiovascular disease, cancer,

1530
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,880
it is a very consistent effect.

1531
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:50,640
And it's very consistent even across all the meta-analyses I've seen.

1532
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:56,240
So do we have a 10 year randomized control trial of giving people enough fiber versus

1533
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:57,840
not enough fiber and seeing how that comes?

1534
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,520
No, and we'll never have that.

1535
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:05,520
But do I feel very comfortable saying that I think fiber helps reduce the risk of

1536
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:08,480
cardiovascular disease and cancer based on the data we have?

1537
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,040
Oh yeah.

1538
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:10,720
I feel very comfortable saying that.

1539
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:14,000
And what's the RDA on fiber?

1540
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,240
Is it 30 grams?

1541
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,640
Not that the RDA matters.

1542
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,360
I'm just kind of curious.

1543
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,640
I think it's 20 to 30 grams.

1544
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,280
I'll be honest.

1545
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:22,080
I haven't looked at it a while.

1546
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,880
I know they change the guidelines a while back too.

1547
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:30,880
What I tell people a good target to shoot for is like 15 grams per thousand calories.

1548
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:36,080
I mean, I would love to go more, but at some point it just becomes intractable

1549
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:37,680
to get that much fiber at that low calories.

1550
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,600
Now all the things that you mentioned for fiber, you're eating real food to get it.

1551
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:43,280
So how do we think about it in terms of,

1552
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:48,000
bars and things that seem, I've heard different things about this where,

1553
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:51,920
you know, if you look at the incretin effect, for example, you know, it would

1554
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:56,560
suggest that the fiber that's in a processed bar is not really contributing

1555
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:59,600
the way a fiber is in the way you just described it.

1556
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,560
If you're actually eating cauliflower or beans or things like that.

1557
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:03,520
Yeah.

1558
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:07,360
So I try not to fall into the naturalistic fallacy, right?

1559
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:11,120
And I get, I get a little bit cringed when I hear processed fiber.

1560
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:14,160
A little bit cringed when I hear processed, unprocessed,

1561
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,240
because what we do to food now and everything's processed.

1562
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:17,040
Yeah.

1563
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,560
Processing in and of itself.

1564
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:18,720
Yeah.

1565
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:19,840
Processing doesn't mean bad.

1566
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:23,120
I just mean, and I'm really talking about this purely through the lens of the

1567
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:24,480
disruption of the actual kernel.

1568
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:24,880
For sure.

1569
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:28,000
And what that actually does at the GLP one level.

1570
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:28,240
Yeah.

1571
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:28,720
Yeah.

1572
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:33,200
So getting back to that, yeah, I would say that mother nature's kitchen is probably,

1573
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:38,800
you know, better than, you know, a fiber bar that's like some indigestible form of glucose or,

1574
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:43,920
you know, some less digestible form of, of a starchy carbohydrate.

1575
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,800
But is it better than nothing?

1576
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:49,920
Again, it's kind of like, you know, it's probably better than nothing.

1577
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:53,760
But if somebody says, well, I'm getting 40 grams of fiber a day and it's because they're eating

1578
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:58,640
like three protein bars, that 14 grams of fiber, I would argue that, well, it's probably not

1579
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:01,840
equivalent to getting six to eight servings of fruits and vegetables.

1580
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:06,480
So let's, let's talk about one other sort of macronutrient or subset of macronutrient,

1581
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,560
which is polyunsaturated fatty acids, right?

1582
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:14,720
So this is one of those things I always tell people, there's nothing in nutrition that I'm

1583
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:18,880
more confused about than the role of omega six PUFAs.

1584
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:22,720
So let's go back to that Minnesota coronary experiment that you mentioned.

1585
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:26,640
It's, it's a very unique experiment, probably never to be replicated.

1586
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,320
No, no, IRB would ever approve it again.

1587
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:37,760
And I'm still trying to track down Chris Ramston who wrote the, like, paper that looked at all of

1588
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:43,600
the data that were never published in Franza's first study, but I'll, I'll retell the study to

1589
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,400
the best of my recollection, which is super foggy at this point.

1590
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,800
So this was a study carried out in Minnesota.

1591
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,640
Please correct me if I'm missing any details.

1592
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:57,120
It was carried out in an assisted living or mental facility and it might've been two arms.

1593
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:57,840
I can't remember.

1594
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:05,040
What makes this special then is that the subjects in this study were fed every meal.

1595
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:11,440
So what makes this a really unique study is that it was not a free living study,

1596
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:13,120
though it had free living duration.

1597
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,840
I want to say the average duration was three years.

1598
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:17,920
Just over two, I think.

1599
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:18,240
Was it?

1600
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:18,480
Okay.

1601
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,280
Just over two.

1602
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:21,040
So the study was five years.

1603
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:21,280
Yes.

1604
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:21,440
Yeah.

1605
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:23,440
But the feeding intervention was only two.

1606
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:26,640
Two, I think because people were kind of going in and out of facility,

1607
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:29,440
the average subject duration was about two, two and a half years.

1608
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:34,720
So for this period of time, every meal is being fed and there's, patients are randomized

1609
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:44,880
into two groups, isocaloric, isomacro, but at the fat level, one group was high saturated fat,

1610
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,640
one group was low saturated fat.

1611
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:52,720
If I recall the reduction in saturated fat was not trivial.

1612
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:55,280
It was 30%.

1613
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,480
What was it?

1614
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:03,920
18.5 is a number that sticks out in my mind and I can't remember, but do you remember the exact?

1615
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,840
I don't remember the exact number, but it was.

1616
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,520
It was a really big reduction in saturated fat.

1617
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:10,320
It was not something that I would say, well, there just wasn't a big enough difference.

1618
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:10,720
That's right.

1619
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:10,960
Yeah.

1620
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:15,840
So I think we can all look at it and say, wow, these guys were getting a lot of saturated fat.

1621
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:19,200
These guys were getting a lot of omega six polyunsaturated.

1622
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,480
Was it canola?

1623
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:22,640
What was the dominant form of the oil?

1624
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,920
I don't remember that actually.

1625
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,120
It might've been corn oil.

1626
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:31,040
I don't remember which one it was, which of the big four safflower.

1627
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,680
But I think it was canola, but I could be wrong on that.

1628
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:35,600
We'll obviously post a link to the original study.

1629
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:40,960
The study goes on and it completes, they get all the data.

1630
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,800
Oh, what was the hypothesis that was being tested?

1631
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:47,600
The hypothesis was being tested was in this really well designed, elegant study,

1632
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:55,040
the group on the lower saturated fat arm should have had fewer cardiovascular events.

1633
02:26:55,040 --> 02:27:03,200
Because this was right at the time when the theory initially proposed by Ansel Keys in about 1961

1634
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:09,760
was that saturated fat specifically was the driver of blood lipids.

1635
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,920
And this was really the connection to the lipid heart hypothesis.

1636
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,960
This was supposed to be kind of like the nail in the coffin for that hypothesis,

1637
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:19,280
in terms of like cementing it as legit.

1638
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:19,760
That's correct.

1639
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:24,880
Because so the idea was this group on the higher saturated fat, they would have more heart attacks.

1640
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:27,040
And you couldn't argue these data.

1641
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:28,480
This was really clear.

1642
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:33,040
You've also had a high power to this study because it was very large.

1643
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:35,360
It was like 500 something people.

1644
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,240
Oh, I think it was more.

1645
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:36,800
Was it more?

1646
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:38,320
Yeah, I think it was a stag.

1647
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,360
I was amazed at how big the number was.

1648
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,520
And they were old, which meant you were going to see events.

1649
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,440
You couldn't do a two year study in 40 year olds.

1650
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:51,120
You see no events in anybody.

1651
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,440
So it had all these things going for it.

1652
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:56,720
1973, the results come out.

1653
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,080
There's no difference.

1654
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,360
The study goes unpublished.

1655
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,760
It's not published until 1989.

1656
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:04,720
16 years later, Frans publishes it.

1657
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:09,040
When asked why, he said quite plainly, we didn't like the way it turned out.

1658
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,320
Now a guy named Chris Ramsden, who I believe is still at the NIH though,

1659
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:17,200
if you're listening to this and anybody knows him, please tell him I've been trying to reach

1660
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:19,760
him for the past two years unsuccessfully.

1661
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:20,960
Won't return any emails.

1662
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:30,480
He comes along maybe five years ago and finds a whole bunch of unpublished data and republishes.

1663
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:33,120
I think one, if not two studies in the BMJ.

1664
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:41,440
Before we get to what Ramsden's findings are, my interpretation of the study that I just

1665
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:46,640
described, my initial representation or my initial interpretation of that 10 years ago

1666
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,880
was saturated fats not causing heart disease.

1667
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:55,040
10 years later, my representation was or my interpretation was

1668
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,720
that study wasn't long enough to see a difference.

1669
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:03,280
Cholesterol, at the time they did measure total cholesterol levels, they didn't fractionate

1670
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:04,000
cholesterol at the time.

1671
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,160
They couldn't measure LDL or HDL or anything like that.

1672
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:13,920
There was about a 30 milligram per deciliter reduction in total cholesterol on the low

1673
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:19,520
saturated fat group, which again, now you have a biomarker that tells you, this intervention

1674
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:24,480
worked and the majority of that 30 milligrams per deciliter was probably LDL cholesterol,

1675
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:25,360
could they have measured it?

1676
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:31,120
Then my interpretation turned into two years of an intervention wasn't long enough.

1677
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:35,760
If you took a bunch of people and put them on a statin for two years, you probably wouldn't

1678
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:36,560
see a difference.

1679
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,440
You could miss a difference.

1680
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:40,480
Now, the PCSK9 trials suggested otherwise.

1681
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:45,440
It was really interesting, the Odyssey and Fourier trials in 2015, which were testing

1682
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:50,800
the most potent lipid lowering drugs available, actually did show a benefit in about two and a

1683
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,600
half to three years.

1684
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:54,640
They were crushing LDL.

1685
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:57,120
Again, it's an area under the curve problem.

1686
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,160
This one was reducing it, but not crushing it.

1687
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:02,400
That's where I left it.

1688
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:06,960
I think it's important to point out too, that the modifications you can make to cholesterol

1689
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:14,560
from diet in some cases can be quite small compared to what you can get from pharmaceutical

1690
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:15,360
interventions.

1691
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:15,920
That's right.

1692
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:24,320
Outside of the most extreme, I'm sure if somebody went on to a zero saturated fat, 12% total fat

1693
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:28,480
calorie restricted diet, they could probably cut their cholesterol in half, but they'd be

1694
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:30,560
doing a whole bunch of harm, I would argue, along the way.

1695
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:35,840
In the other direction, you do have some people like in the low carb community who are bragging

1696
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,000
about LDL cholesterol levels in the 500s.

1697
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:38,720
Well, that's what I was going to say.

1698
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,240
You can do the opposite much more.

1699
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:42,400
It's an unbounded problem above.

1700
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:44,720
It's obviously a bounded problem below.

1701
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:52,000
Ramston's data suggests that actually the people in the PUFA group had worse outcomes.

1702
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:56,640
Now, that really kind of throws me for a loop and that's frankly why I kind of want to have him on

1703
02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:04,000
the podcast because his data suggests that at least this particular PUFA had a negative

1704
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,760
cardiovascular effect.

1705
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:14,960
Now, to me, that study is probably, if the details of that study are consistent, that would be

1706
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:25,360
the most damning evidence against N6 PUFAs in terms of lowering lipids, but raising events.

1707
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:26,960
By the way, there is a precedent for that.

1708
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:32,160
There was a drug that was approved in the 1960s that actually lowered cholesterol, but

1709
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:33,520
increased cardiovascular events.

1710
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:35,040
That drug was withdrawn.

1711
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:35,760
This was back in the day.

1712
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,280
Do you know what the mechanism was for that?

1713
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:39,040
I can speculate, yeah.

1714
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,960
I actually recently discussed this on a podcast.

1715
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:50,240
The mechanism that it's believed that this drug worked is it prevented the conversion of

1716
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:53,280
desmostral to cholesterol.

1717
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,880
That's the final step of cholesterol synthesis in one of the two pathways.

1718
02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:01,040
When you gave people this drug, and the name always escapes me,

1719
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:08,240
triametral or something like that, when you gave people this drug, their cholesterol went down

1720
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:09,120
significantly.

1721
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:13,680
The drug was approved on the basis of cholesterol lowering, not on the basis of outcomes.

1722
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:17,040
Today, cholesterol drugs are only approved on the basis of outcomes as well.

1723
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:21,120
But then it had to be pulled from the market because you saw the events.

1724
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:26,080
I don't think they ever investigated it, but I think today we look back and we think that

1725
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:32,640
desmostral acted perhaps as bad, if not worse, than cholesterol in terms of the oxidative process.

1726
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:37,040
You basically lowered cholesterol, but the precursor went through the roof and the precursor

1727
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,200
was at least as bad, if not more damaging.

1728
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:40,080
Ah, interesting.

1729
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:40,880
Yeah.

1730
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:42,240
So that's the suspicion.

1731
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:46,720
The point only being there is there was a precedent for you can lower cholesterol and worsen events.

1732
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:47,360
Yeah.

1733
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:54,720
And so Ramstein proposes a series of mechanisms by which that might be the case with at least this

1734
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:56,560
polyunsaturated fat.

1735
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,200
Conversely, there is a lot of epidemiology that says the opposite, that polyunsaturated fats,

1736
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:07,360
whenever you substitute saturated for polyunsaturated, things get better.

1737
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:09,280
Nobody's disputing MUFA over here.

1738
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:14,640
Like the data seem unambiguously clear that MUFA is the best of the three fats,

1739
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:18,160
both epidemiologically and experimentally.

1740
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:23,280
So how do you think about the breakdown, not the breakdown, but what I mean is the

1741
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,560
distribution of how one should think about distributing their fats?

1742
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:31,200
So I've actually have seen some epidemiology that showed that

1743
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:33,680
PUFAs were actually lowering events more.

1744
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,480
No, that's what I'm saying.

1745
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:34,640
Yeah.

1746
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:35,040
That's what I'm saying.

1747
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:39,840
The PUFA data look like it's more favorable than the SFA.

1748
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,240
Well, even then model-unsaturated too.

1749
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:42,880
Ah, okay.

1750
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:44,000
Yeah, I got it.

1751
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,200
But I mean, again, you're dealing with cohort data and whatnot.

1752
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:48,480
We all know the limitations there.

1753
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:57,360
As far as the Minnesota coronary study, I think I get really,

1754
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:07,360
it's probably going to sound like a cop out, but I've really gotten to the point after seeing

1755
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:12,080
just so many random events and studies where I go, I don't know what one study means, no matter

1756
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:13,200
how well done it is.

1757
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:23,760
Now, I have seen studies that were so compelling that I swayed my opinion a little bit, but it was

1758
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:28,640
usually because there was also other contextual data that made sense.

1759
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:34,880
The way this one came about, it's like, like I said, we don't really know how to reconcile this

1760
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:41,440
because even if you look at some of these Omega 6 fats, and I think one of the big mechanisms

1761
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:45,920
has been proposed is, well, they're going to increase inflammation because those double

1762
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:48,720
bonds can be oxidized, that oxidation cause inflammation.

1763
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:53,360
But if we look at the hard outcome data and randomized control trials where they give

1764
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:58,720
like linoleic acid or alpha linoleic acid or whatever, I mean, you just don't see inflammation

1765
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:01,840
go up if they're not increasing total calories, right?

1766
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:07,120
In fact, you usually, especially if you're replacing it for saturated fat, sometimes

1767
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:08,400
you see inflammation go down.

1768
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:14,160
So I just don't, honestly, this is one of those things where I go, I don't really know what it

1769
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:14,800
means.

1770
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:15,840
And I think-

1771
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:19,280
So I don't feel bad now saying, I literally don't know what the answer is.

1772
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:19,440
Yeah.

1773
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:19,760
Yeah.

1774
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,440
I mean, I just have no clue.

1775
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:26,080
I think it's one of those things where it's, you kind of have to look at the weight of the

1776
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:33,200
evidence and then couple that with some of the mechanistic evidence and look at the human

1777
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:39,360
outcome mechanisms we can see, which is, okay, maybe we can't do a two year randomized control

1778
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:43,680
trial, but 12 weeks is enough time to see differences in inflammation if something's

1779
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,680
going to cause a difference in inflammation.

1780
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:46,720
So we can look at that.

1781
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:51,680
I don't know if that was his main mechanism that he proposed for how it was occurring.

1782
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,360
It was absolutely one of them.

1783
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:53,600
Yeah.

1784
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:59,840
God, it's been so long since I looked at his bigger BMJ paper.

1785
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:04,400
So I don't want to, we'll attach to the paper in the show notes so people can kind of go

1786
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:04,800
through it.

1787
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:06,800
He actually, if I recall, I can almost picture it.

1788
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:11,040
There's a figure that kind of actually kind of nicely walks through what the proposed

1789
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:11,920
mechanisms are.

1790
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:17,280
So I think the other thing to consider is like we just talked about how when you suggest

1791
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:21,280
cutting something out, you place it with other things.

1792
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:29,840
And I think in the last 20 or 30 years, the biggest contribution to added calories in

1793
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:31,520
the diet is actually added oils.

1794
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:40,080
So on a per calorie basis, I don't think that there's like, you know, the big demon right

1795
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:40,880
now is seed oils.

1796
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:45,040
Like that is like, I haven't even done a post about it yet because the anti seed oil crowd

1797
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:51,280
is just so vitriolic and so nuts that I'm like, all right, how, how, when do I want to

1798
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:52,560
wade into this conversation?

1799
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:56,640
But I think that.

1800
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,000
And tell me about this crowd.

1801
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:03,680
This, this, this, this particular sect is of which religion?

1802
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,480
Are they?

1803
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:07,680
They're definitely more towards like the low carb carnivore.

1804
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:12,320
I think a lot of this is there's a lot of people in the low carb community who've kind of like

1805
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:15,440
tried to abdicate saturated fat, like make it.

1806
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:17,200
Oh, it's it's not bad or it's not.

1807
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:22,000
It's innocuous, you know, that sort of or it's even it's it's healthy because look at,

1808
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,840
you know, if you look at elderly people, people who have higher LDL cholesterol live longer.

1809
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:30,080
And it's like, well, that's because they're probably actually getting in enough food.

1810
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:34,640
And when you're elderly, it becomes a wasting problem and not a not an obesity problem.

1811
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:37,040
But that's a that's a separate conversation.

1812
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:42,960
But I think a lot of it stemmed from, OK, we want to make saturated fat a good guy.

1813
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,200
So somebody has to be the bad guy.

1814
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,360
And so and so it's been it's been seed oils.

1815
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:54,880
And yeah, it's very, very like very powerful belief that some people hold on this.

1816
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,080
So I think.

1817
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:04,560
And again, if you just look at top level stuff, it fits.

1818
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:06,720
It fits a pretty good story, right?

1819
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:10,320
Which is we never ate these seed oils 120 years ago, right?

1820
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:14,400
They represented this much of our total fat calories today.

1821
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:16,080
They're this much of our fat calories.

1822
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:18,560
And look at all the things that are wrong with the world today.

1823
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:23,120
So it's got that kind of top level story, which I think a lot of things do.

1824
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,800
Right. Sugar has the same thing.

1825
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:27,600
Like we ate this much sugar in 1900.

1826
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,840
We ate this much sugar in the year 2000.

1827
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,280
Look what got worse.

1828
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:34,080
So it's it's it's important to understand, I guess, how.

1829
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,200
I mean, I've certainly fallen for that, right?

1830
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:40,800
Like there's I've looked at that and gone, yeah, that that's got to be the seed oils.

1831
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:41,520
It's got to be the sugar.

1832
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:44,240
It's got to be that it's got to be it's really easy to make a bogeyman.

1833
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:45,120
Yeah.

1834
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:50,160
And I think when you look through the data and try to be unbiased about it,

1835
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,760
what you see is like the continuous.

1836
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:56,960
The continuous bogeyman is really it's just energy toxicity.

1837
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:01,120
I mean, what you're dealing with is just extra energy because regardless,

1838
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:05,920
because people will say, well, you know, we did the the food guide pyramid and people

1839
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,080
did it and everybody got sicker.

1840
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:10,800
People kind of did it.

1841
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:15,760
They didn't really do it because the food guide pyramid also said exercise and reduce your

1842
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:16,640
calorie consumption.

1843
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:22,560
So, yeah, they they add in more carbohydrates, but they really didn't decrease their fat intake

1844
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:28,400
either. And so, yeah, as we added more calories, we had more of these problems.

1845
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,040
And so that's interesting.

1846
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:36,960
I'd really love to know because unfortunately we only have food availability and waste data.

1847
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:42,000
So we have to use food availability and waste to take a delta to estimate what's happening.

1848
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,040
And I've personally always found that to be difficult.

1849
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:47,920
The other thing I find impossible is to estimate what I eat.

1850
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:52,160
I want to actually ask you about how you do it because I think you're much more dialed into this.

1851
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:57,120
If I could tell you at the end of a day within a thousand calories, what I've not a thousand,

1852
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:58,480
I could probably do it within a thousand.

1853
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:02,400
There's no way I could tell you within a day, 500 calories within what I've done.

1854
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:03,280
It's just not possible.

1855
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:04,560
I can't personally do it.

1856
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,160
I don't have that that infrastructure.

1857
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:14,320
So I really believe that we've probably underestimated in the low fat craze how much

1858
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:18,880
fat didn't go down and how much low fat stuff did go up.

1859
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,440
Well, think about going to a restaurant.

1860
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:26,320
Right. And if you've ever been to a restaurant where they go to the cheesecake factory,

1861
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:27,760
you look at the calories and the dishes.

1862
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:30,240
Like, how do you get that much in there?

1863
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:33,680
Well, you carbs contribute to that.

1864
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,960
But the way you densify food is with fat.

1865
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:42,000
Like fat is what will take something from a 500 calorie dish to a 1500 calorie dish.

1866
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:47,920
So I think when it comes to estimations.

1867
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:53,920
Yeah. Last night we were out and you were eating ad lib.

1868
02:40:54,720 --> 02:41:00,240
But I know in your head the wheels were kind of telling you like at some point,

1869
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:04,320
I think I even asked you and you made some comment like, yeah, I got about 600 more to go.

1870
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:10,240
Is that literally just repetitions like you've done enough food logging in your life that you

1871
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:14,000
you can look at a brownie and you can look at a sandwich and you just sort of know what you're

1872
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:21,360
getting. So I'll tell people for some people like that's not a sustainable way to live to

1873
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:23,360
just keep a running track in their head or whatnot.

1874
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:29,120
Because you let me back up just a little bit higher level view.

1875
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:33,680
If you want to lose fat or control body weight, you have to practice some form of restriction.

1876
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:40,000
Now you can pick the form of restriction you want. For me, the easiest thing for me is to be able to

1877
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:46,240
eat what I want within reason. Right. What you want, when you want, but just control the amount.

1878
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:50,560
Bingo. Right. So if you do that, you're going to have to track calories or macros or whatever it is.

1879
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:55,680
Or you can restrict time. Right. Or you can restrict a certain macronutrient group or,

1880
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:00,000
you know, you say, I'm just going to eat mentally processed food. So there's some form of restriction

1881
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,720
you have to do. Now, what's interesting is none of these forms of restriction seem to be emerged as

1882
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:12,400
being better than another in terms of adherence across a population level. So it really does boil

1883
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:17,600
down to the individual. So I always say you have to practice some form of restriction, but choose

1884
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:21,760
the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive for you. So for me, that's just been

1885
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:30,240
tracking macros. Did you play much with the others? A little bit. Yeah. Like, you know,

1886
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:34,240
kind of clean eating back in the early 2000s, which was, you know, mentally processed foods and,

1887
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:39,760
you know, high fiber and whatnot. And I actually found that I just ended up kind of, I wouldn't

1888
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:44,800
say I developed binge eating disorder, but I did start kind of binge eating because it was like,

1889
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:50,160
so if you look at the psychology of binge eating, it's really interesting. We had Professor Jake

1890
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:58,720
Leonard on our podcast a while back and his expertise is in eating disorders. And he said,

1891
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:03,680
really, there's two things that are kind of essential for an eating disorder to emerge.

1892
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:11,600
The first is, you know, some sort of poor body image perception, right? That's kind of a prerequisite.

1893
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:17,520
The second is hard food rules. So when you create hard food rules,

1894
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:25,760
it just does a weird thing in your mind. So for example, I'm sorry, are both of those

1895
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:32,960
necessary or sufficient or the necessary and sufficient? Both of those seem to predict.

1896
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:36,560
So when you look at the vast majority of people, I want to say every single person.

1897
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:40,320
Sure. When we look at the vast majority of people who develop eating disorders, those are two things.

1898
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:47,280
Those two things show up more often. So what I found was that I would kind of take it.

1899
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:52,720
And sorry for my ignorance. Is binge eating defined as, because that obviously doesn't involve

1900
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:58,560
purging necessarily. Right. Binging just means overeating. Like how do we technically define

1901
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:08,880
binging? Yeah, it's I actually don't know the criteria, but from what Dr. Leonard said,

1902
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:16,560
it's kind of like periods of really intense food consumption, followed by a lot of guilt,

1903
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:23,440
like feeling guilty and with or without compensatory mechanisms. Because sometimes

1904
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:27,680
people will exercise in response to people. Okay. And or deprivation would be another

1905
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:33,600
compensatory. Correct. Correct. Okay. And usually you're talking about like, you're not talking

1906
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:37,680
about, Oh, yeah, I had an extra cookie. You're talking about like, you ate the whole box of

1907
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:42,480
Oreos or whatever it is. So usually, I mean, I'm guessing, but it would probably be on the

1908
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:47,040
magnitude of like, you know, over a thousand calories that, you know, a sitting unintended.

1909
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:55,280
And the other thing is it tends to be kind of a it can be tied to stress as well. That's another

1910
02:44:55,280 --> 02:45:00,560
part of it. But for me, I found that I would just kind of go in the bodily magazine said I couldn't

1911
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:06,640
have sugar, you know, can't have, you know, this can have that. And the rules for what was clean

1912
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:11,680
seemed to be very arbitrary. But I was young, I didn't know any better. So I'm like, Okay, well,

1913
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:17,840
I'll I won't have these quote unquote, bad foods. And the weirdest thing started happening,

1914
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:21,520
I actually started eating more of them. Because when I would get more of the things you weren't

1915
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:27,440
supposed to write because when I get exposed to it, I wasn't able to moderate it. Because it was like,

1916
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:33,040
you know, I'm in college, buddies bring home a pizza, the apartment, hey, Lane, you want some?

1917
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:42,160
Sure. Or I would like try to avoid and it feels so bad that I'm trying to avoid. But the outcome

1918
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:47,440
was the same, which was I would just end up eating way more than I had intended to or even felt hungry

1919
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:54,960
for. But it was like this mindset of, well, this is bad. This I'm not going to eat this again.

1920
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:59,600
It's my last time eating this because I'm going to be really serious after this. So since I've

1921
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:03,680
already broken the seal, as well just go all the way by as well just go all the way. Right.

1922
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:07,280
And so I just kept going through this. And finally, I was kind of like,

1923
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:14,800
this seems to be really ineffective towards my goals. I wonder if it's the fact that I'm just,

1924
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:18,880
you know, I have pizza or the fact that I'm eating like an entire large pizza to myself.

1925
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:23,520
That's the problem. So at that point, I was kind of like, well, let's just try this whole portion

1926
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:28,080
control thing and see if this works. And funny enough, I was able to modulate my body composition

1927
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:33,920
by eating foods I still enjoyed, but controlling portion size. And it was really interesting. I was

1928
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:38,960
supposed to debate this is like seven, eight years ago, I was going to debate a bodybuilding coach

1929
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:46,400
at a seminar about clean eating versus flexible dieting, which is kind of what I practice,

1930
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:49,600
which is, you know, tracking my macros and kind of treating it like a budget.

1931
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:56,080
And my opening argument, he ended up bowing out of the debate. But my opening argument was I had

1932
02:46:56,080 --> 02:47:00,800
gone to his Facebook and looked at his cheat meals and had estimated the calories in his

1933
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:07,360
cheat meals in terms of a per week basis and then put up what my calories were from, you know,

1934
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:12,640
junk food on a per week basis was going to show that his was actually higher because in the

1935
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:16,720
concentrated amount he was taking in, he was actually taking in more calories from those foods.

1936
02:47:16,720 --> 02:47:22,880
And so my point was going to be. So you're telling me it's really bad to have a cookie,

1937
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:26,560
but if I binge on it, it's OK as long as I don't have it the rest of the week,

1938
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:32,800
because that seems like a really odd metric. I mean, my guess is that everyone, if we exposed

1939
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:38,080
everyone to all three different forms of restriction, you would have a rank order for any person of

1940
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:43,920
what's most effective, both biochemically and also psychologically. It's a min max. You'd have

1941
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:50,240
to find an optimization. What fraction of the population do you think will do best, meaning

1942
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:56,560
they'll have the best physical response and also just psychologically will have the best response

1943
02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:03,360
to caloric restriction as a tool or flexible dieting? And I say this knowing there's no data,

1944
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:06,400
but thinking asking you to think about clients and what percentage of people.

1945
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:12,960
Yeah, I think, you know, part of it is some people will be resistant at first and then

1946
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:19,360
actually really enjoy it later, which I'm sure you've seen that with fasting as well or, you know,

1947
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:24,880
low carb, those sorts of things. But it really just boils down to how willing is somebody to

1948
02:48:24,880 --> 02:48:30,080
make this part of their lifestyle. Right. So all of them have downsides. Right. Like if you're on a

1949
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:35,920
ketogenic diet and you go out and I mean, there's a lot you can't eat, but you can usually make do

1950
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:39,920
most places like get some funny looks from your friends and family, but, you know, whatever.

1951
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:45,280
Time restricted feeding. You know, hey, you want to go out and join us for breakfast?

1952
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:50,720
Oh, I can't. I'll sit and I'll drink some water. You know, so there's downsides with flexible

1953
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:58,560
dieting. The downside is I've got to account for it. Right. And actually, so we know the data on

1954
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:06,640
reporting for food is like people under report by like 50 percent and it's pretty consistent in the

1955
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:13,440
studies and people really take that as like an affront. So I'm not a liar. Yeah. Well, I don't

1956
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:17,760
think that people are lying. I think people are just really horrible estimators of what they eat.

1957
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:22,240
You know, like if you ever want to be depressed, go way out of serving of cereal or way out of

1958
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:28,400
serving of ice cream or serving a peanut butter. You know, people when they do these these food

1959
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:35,360
recalls, I mean, a serving of ice cream is not a bowl of ice cream. Like a bowl of ice cream is

1960
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:39,520
probably three times more than a serving in terms of what people are actually taking in.

1961
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:44,800
So it makes total sense as to why people underestimate their energy intake.

1962
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:50,880
And one of the things I'll say is even if you don't land on flexible dieting as the tool that

1963
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:57,040
you want to use, tracking and weighing every single thing you put in your mouth for a week

1964
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:03,040
is an incredibly valuable tool because it will teach you about portion control. And actually,

1965
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:06,880
you'll learn more about nutrition in that week than probably doing anything else, to be honest.

1966
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:09,920
Now, a lot of people don't want to do it because it's a lot the same reason a lot of people don't

1967
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:14,000
want to keep a budget for for their money because they don't want to know where it's going because

1968
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,360
then it's kind of like here's the mirror and you have to look at yourself and say,

1969
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:21,840
oh, where have I been spending my money? Right. Oh, I spent, you know, five hundred dollars on

1970
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:27,760
Uber Eats last month or, you know, whatever it is. But then with, you know, macro tracking again,

1971
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:35,440
it's very much, oh, man, I want and I've I've I have had this so many times people say I'm

1972
02:50:35,440 --> 02:50:40,000
eating fifteen hundred calories a day and can't lose weight. And it's hard to believe you can't

1973
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:48,160
lose weight on fifteen hundred calories. There was a I will say there was a metabolic award study

1974
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:52,480
where they put people on fifteen hundred calories and there was actually one person who gained just

1975
02:50:52,480 --> 02:50:58,560
a tiny amount of weight over like a camera with a time period. But the vast majority lost weight.

1976
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:03,760
I wonder what was going on with that one person. Right. So maybe endocrine issue or something like

1977
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:13,680
that. Yeah. Yeah. So I think the point that I would make is that I do think it's useful for people

1978
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:20,400
to try tracking for a while. I mean, again, we have people like, you know, our app is different than a

1979
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:27,360
calorie tracking app because it actually gives you, you know, macros to eat based on your dietary

1980
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:30,720
preference and your goals, and then it will it will adjust them based on how you're progressing.

1981
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:35,760
So it's not just a one and done calculation. And a lot of people love that. But they also

1982
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:39,040
people who have never tracked before go, oh, my God, I didn't know what I was eating.

1983
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:44,320
Like and, you know, it has a barcode scanner and all that kind of stuff. So it's much easier.

1984
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:48,160
Like when I first started doing this, it was me going to the grocery store with the complete

1985
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:54,880
book of food counts and going, OK, where is it? OK, there it is. But now, after having done this

1986
02:51:54,880 --> 02:52:03,920
sort of stuff for, you know, 20 years. Like last night, picking up that brownie, I'm picking it up.

1987
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:09,520
And I know what's the calculation. How did you do the count? So all I do is I just like, I don't

1988
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:14,000
know what particular brownie that is. I don't know how they made or anything like that. But it's

1989
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,480
likely that the calorie density is going to be similar to other brownies. Right. The carb fat

1990
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:21,600
ratio might be a little bit different, but the calorie density is probably going to be pretty

1991
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:27,040
similar. So I really just try to think about what do I think this weighs? Right. And so last

1992
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:32,720
time I was kind of like, it's a little bit denser than normal brownie. I put it about 40 grams.

1993
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:38,400
Right. And so I put that in. Now, did I? You didn't put it into an app, did you? Didn't.

1994
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:43,920
Yeah. Oh, you did. I just put it in my app. Oh, OK. OK. But I just pulled up like some random brownie

1995
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:51,280
from Sara Lee or whatever. Got it. Got it. So I'll kind of do that now. OK. I feel a bit better now.

1996
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:55,040
I literally thought you were doing this in your head the whole time. Oh, no, no, no, no. I was like,

1997
02:52:55,040 --> 02:53:04,560
God, how is he doing that? So I, yeah, the apps now make it much easier. But then the night before

1998
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:08,160
when we were out at dinner or two nights ago, I didn't see you putting anything in the app. And

1999
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:13,920
I did it after. But how? How did you remember what we ate and how would you like the bone marrow and

2000
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:18,400
all that crazy stuff we were eating? So like how are you estimating all that stuff? Yeah. So there

2001
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:24,800
was an entry for bone marrow that I found. Now, again, the point that I think I'll make is it's

2002
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:32,480
very likely that some of these are inaccurate, right? But it's better. It's going to be more

2003
02:53:32,480 --> 02:53:37,200
accurate than just kind of going, oh, I have no idea. So I'm not going to worry about it.

2004
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:42,080
Right. Do you think that the act of tracking it is what's putting a governor on it? In other words,

2005
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:46,000
do you think the fact that you had to enter 40 grams of brownie is what prevented you from having

2006
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:52,400
three? At this point, no. But for some people, absolutely. Right. And we, I mean, this is the

2007
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:58,880
one of the most basic laws of science. When you monitor something, it changes. Right. So I've done

2008
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:02,960
this so many times with people who have said the following, you know, like I'm eating for

2009
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:08,080
ten or calories, can't lose fat. And I've said, listen, I don't expect you to do this forever,

2010
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:14,320
but for one week, just one week, everything you put in your mouth, weigh it on a scale and track it.

2011
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:20,480
Okay. And then come back to me and let's talk. One of two things happen. They go, oh, my God.

2012
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:26,480
Oh, I was actually eating 2800 calories. I go, well, welcome to freedom because now you know

2013
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:30,320
that you're not broken. Right. Like you're you're actually like you can modify. Right.

2014
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:35,200
Or the other thing happens. They actually eat the amount of calories they said they were eating.

2015
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:42,400
And they're starving. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, it's it's what monitored

2016
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:47,520
is what gets changed. And we know that like right down on a particle basis, if you monitor it,

2017
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:54,640
it changes its behavior. So when you get people to monitor things, they change their behavior.

2018
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:59,600
It's like if I if somebody is like, oh, we're going to do we're going to do Lane's budget

2019
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:03,840
for the month and, you know, we're going to put it on YouTube as a video or something. Right.

2020
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:09,440
Okay. Well, like all of a sudden we're like, well, let's spend money on this. It's not going to look

2021
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:14,480
good. You know, like when we monitor things, it changes. But but we know that about behavior.

2022
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:20,720
We can use that to our advantage. So I think the like if I was getting ready for a bodybuilding

2023
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:28,080
show, for example, I would have to change how I do things. I couldn't just go out and just kind of

2024
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:32,880
guesstimate like that. I would have to get much more granular. And now the sacrifice might be,

2025
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:38,480
okay, maybe I'll still go out to eat, but I'm going to have to take all the ingredients,

2026
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:45,520
put them on my scale and, you know, and then and then track. Oh, so which sucks. But no, I mean,

2027
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:48,640
look, that's if that's what you're doing, that's what you're doing. Like that's that's the price

2028
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:53,600
you have to pay to to get it good. And then the other the other the other the sacrifice that if

2029
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:57,280
I want to do a bodybuilding shows, OK, I'm just I can't go out my friends anymore. Right. Yeah.

2030
02:55:57,280 --> 02:56:01,680
Or at least in the final. Yeah. And I would say like in the last four weeks, I don't I pretty much

2031
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:07,440
a hermit. You know what I mean? But yeah, it's all all these different forms of restriction are just

2032
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:13,760
tools. Right. But I do think having that accounting, looking through what you're actually

2033
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:20,000
having is really educational for a lot of folks. And I would say to people who are listening or

2034
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:24,960
who are watching and have never done it, like try to do it without judgment towards yourself.

2035
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:33,120
You know, like really without judgment, just be curious, you know, and see, hmm, I wonder what

2036
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:39,280
this is. And I think what you'll find is if you just enter it with that genuine curiosity,

2037
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:45,280
you'll find some things out that will be really helpful towards you for you.

2038
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:52,160
And you'll also learn so much about portion sizes that you'll go, whoa. Yeah. I didn't realize that

2039
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:56,960
restaurants serve such massive portion sizes. Right. Like it's going to sound bad, but I can't

2040
02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:01,600
tell you how many times I'm going to eat something and go, yeah, I'm good. I don't I don't I don't

2041
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:07,120
need any more. And are you still hungry when you push it away? It's, you know, being in tune with

2042
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:12,560
your hunger signals, plus like some bit of monitoring is helpful. The one other thing I'll

2043
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:18,400
say is like, you know, being in tune with hunger signals is great, but that's also hard when you're

2044
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:23,360
eating processed food, like energy dense, hyper palatable food. You know, previously,

2045
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:29,760
based on our hunger signals, we could, you know, auto regulate what we ate. Yeah. Because we're in

2046
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:34,880
a situation where food wasn't energy dense enough, like you would have to become uncomfortable,

2047
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:39,520
you know, to just based on the volume, just based on the volume of food you were eating.

2048
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:45,360
And even like up until the 1950s, we had hyper processed, you know, food, whatever. But you had

2049
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:51,200
to walk down to the bakery to get it. Right. You didn't have it in like really nice available. And

2050
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:55,200
I still think the serving sizes were a lot smaller. Oh, yeah. If you look at dinner plates,

2051
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:59,520
like the early 1900s, they're like this, and then they're like this. And then now you got

2052
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:04,720
dinner plates. I think anybody listening to this who's been to Europe will will will recognize

2053
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:11,600
this, but it never ceases to amaze me no matter how many times I go to Italy or something like

2054
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:18,720
that. I can't get over how small the portions are. And it's really wonderful because I'm just a

2055
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:22,720
glutton. Like I will I don't know. I think it's part of it is like you grow up as an immigrant

2056
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:29,280
kid. You eat what's on your plate. Like we do not throw out food in this house. And how many times

2057
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:34,640
do I get that lecture about those kids in Africa that don't have anything? And it's like you're

2058
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:38,240
going to sit here until you eat that thing on your plate. And it wasn't like I was being forced to

2059
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:43,520
eat bad food. It was like, right, you know, liver and spinach and stuff I hated. But like the clean

2060
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:48,640
plate was just a part of your mind. Same. Grew up in a lower middle class family. And so it was very

2061
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:54,000
much like we don't waste food in this house. So I think there's still a little bit of the, you know,

2062
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:57,920
I was joking about it yesterday. Like I eat off my kids plates now. It's like what you're not

2063
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:05,200
throwing that out. Give me that. Do you think you'll do another bodybuilding show or you do you

2064
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:12,000
plan to do that anymore? Right now I consider myself in a long off season. I'm not sure. I think,

2065
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:20,720
you know, it's if right now there's just so many things going on business wise.

2066
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:28,480
And, you know, I'm kind of in a place where I'm very grateful for that and I want to get it while

2067
02:59:28,480 --> 02:59:32,960
I can get it. And hopefully we can get to the point where we're working because we want to work,

2068
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:37,280
not because we feel like we have to work. I mean, that's kind of the dream. I love what I do. I don't

2069
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:44,000
see myself ever like retiring, retiring. But it would be nice to be able to have like a little

2070
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:49,120
more freedom to go and do the things that I really am super passionate about doing and not having to

2071
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:53,280
worry about doing some of the more granular stuff. So, you know, bodybuilding, getting ready for a

2072
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:58,080
show would would take a significant amount of energy and time. So in powerlifting already does

2073
02:59:58,080 --> 03:00:03,280
that. It's just that, you know, I can do that without the brain fog and the mood swings and

2074
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:08,160
all that kind of stuff. I mean, it is it's really funny if you look at case studies of bodybuilders

2075
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:15,360
like by the time they're at show. So literally every single case study on natural bodybuilders

2076
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:19,840
shows that they're hypogonadal by the time they hit stage. Of course. Yeah. I mean, and I'm somebody

2077
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:25,040
like my testosterone. I've had it measured probably a half dozen times in the last five years.

2078
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:31,920
The lowest it's ever been is 900. And the highest it's been, I think I hit like almost 1100.

2079
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:36,000
And that's, you know, people will say, well, see, he's not drug free or whatever. But

2080
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:39,760
I would tell you my LHS normal and my FSH is normal and all that kind of stuff. So

2081
03:00:40,480 --> 03:00:48,480
but when I was competing in bodybuilding, it was under 300. Like when I was that close to a show,

2082
03:00:48,480 --> 03:00:55,760
because it's just it just I mean, think about the hungriest you've ever been in your life.

2083
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:00,880
And now imagine that feeling doesn't leave you for weeks. That's all and the lowest energy like

2084
03:01:01,440 --> 03:01:07,200
I can how many what's the absolute nadir of calories you're consuming at the lowest. So the

2085
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:15,360
lowest I've ever been like at kind of this level of lean mass was nineteen hundred. And how many

2086
03:01:15,360 --> 03:01:20,400
grams of protein are in that nineteen hundred. So that was like 260 grams of protein. So I was like

2087
03:01:20,400 --> 03:01:24,640
around one hundred or under one hundred grams of carbohydrate a day and like 30 40 grams of fat,

2088
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:28,880
if I recall correctly. What does that look like? Practically. Like what are the what's the actual

2089
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:37,920
foods you're eating? I mean, egg whites, chicken breast, some Greek yogurt, you know, fat free

2090
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:43,200
Greek yogurt. I mean, you're really you have to be very careful with your fats when you're that low

2091
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:48,000
calorie. Meaning you have to be careful you don't go too low on the fats. Well, and that you get.

2092
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,880
But at a certain point, you know, the idea is well, keep your fats high enough and you're

2093
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:53,840
going well at a certain point, you're like, all right, yeah, I'd like to have my hormones there,

2094
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:58,400
but I also need to get lean enough. You know, so. So meaning be careful that too much fat isn't

2095
03:01:58,400 --> 03:02:03,200
sneaking in. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, like just eating something that's, you know, like seven

2096
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:09,520
grams of fat, which all, you know, accounts is a low fat item. I had to be careful about that

2097
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:13,280
because it could just sneak up very quickly. Yeah. You can't have nuts or something like that.

2098
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:22,000
Oh, no, no, no, no. So, you know, the low energy to like I can literally remember

2099
03:02:22,880 --> 03:02:26,000
being on my couch. I was probably three weeks out from a show.

2100
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:33,920
I had just gotten done training sitting on my couch and the remote control was probably I just

2101
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:39,360
like sat down like literally like plopped down. Remote control was probably, you know, five feet

2102
03:02:39,360 --> 03:02:49,600
away. And the Real Housewives of some county was playing. I abhor that show. And I sat and watched

2103
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:54,320
the entire show because I was not willing to get up to go get that remote because I was that

2104
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:59,360
exhausted. And it's like now you see like. And how many weeks in to that degree of

2105
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:04,800
color restriction? Do you think you were at that point? That was like 20 weeks in. Well,

2106
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:12,400
not not at 19. So my calories have progressively come down. Really, it's it's mostly a body fat

2107
03:03:12,400 --> 03:03:19,120
issue. Like I've I've had clients who were able to eat higher calories and get really lean at a

2108
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:25,280
certain point of body fat level. It just doesn't matter if you're that lean and your leptin is that

2109
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:34,480
low and your testosterone is that low. I mean, yeah, it's it's just Eric Helms describes contest

2110
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:41,280
prep is like you're circling a drain and you're just trying to delay going down the drain as long

2111
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:45,840
as possible. But eventually you go down the drain. So how do you get the energy to get on stage? Is

2112
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:52,160
that basically one big push of carbs shortly enough before you go on stage that it's not going

2113
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:58,960
to show up in your physique? So I will say like there are spurts where you feel OK when you're

2114
03:03:58,960 --> 03:04:04,640
when you're in those, you know, the dregs of contest prep. I'll also say that like for me to

2115
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:10,960
get from like say 15 percent on calipers to seven percent on calipers. It's not difficult at all. In

2116
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:15,680
fact, I I had gone up a weight class in piloting a few years ago and then came back down. It was

2117
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:23,760
about a 30 pound weight drop. But so 15 to seven easy from seven to and I think the lowest I ever

2118
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:28,400
caliper it was two percent and terribly watching. No, I don't think I was two percent. It's probably

2119
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:37,200
more like five or six. But to go from seven to three or two, which is an absolute lower amount

2120
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:44,000
of fat loss, was infinitely more difficult. It's like the best way to describe it is like kind of

2121
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:50,560
like you get a fresh roll toothpaste to get out some toothpaste. Very easy. Then as that toothpaste

2122
03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:56,080
tube gets, you know, emptier and emptier. How much effort do you have to put in to just squeeze out

2123
03:04:56,080 --> 03:05:00,640
that last little bit of toothpaste? I mean, it's it's magnitudes higher than at the beginning.

2124
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:08,640
And contest prep is very much like that. So like you. But you do have times where you have energy

2125
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:12,880
because you start to train two or three hours. Right. And trust me like that.

2126
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:17,920
That is actually the part I despise the most of contest prep is at a certain point, I just don't

2127
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:22,960
like training anymore. I'm just doing it for energy expenditure and retaining muscle. I'm not doing it

2128
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:28,480
because I'm passionate about training and I'm somebody who I love to train. It's like my favorite

2129
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:33,360
thing in the world. And but there will be times where it's like you go and you have a little bit

2130
03:05:33,360 --> 03:05:39,600
better workouts. I did periodize my nutrition, so I would have some higher calorie days on days that

2131
03:05:39,600 --> 03:05:44,880
were more demanding for training, usually like lower body training days as far as like getting

2132
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:51,360
on stage. Well, one thing is I never cut water for bodybuilding shows. A lot of people do that.

2133
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:58,560
I think it's silly because think about a muscle is 70 percent water. And in your native state,

2134
03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:02,480
you you keep more water inside your muscle cell than you do outside your muscle cell.

2135
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:09,760
And, you know, this is just basically shot the A's principle. If you begin removing more fluid,

2136
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:17,760
like via dueritic or fluid restriction or sodium restriction. Well, what happens? Well, sure,

2137
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:21,520
you remove it from the subcutaneous layer, but you're also going to remove it in the same

2138
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:25,840
proportion from the from the intracellular layer. All you're going to do is just become flatter.

2139
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:29,280
In the intravascular layer, you get hypotensive. Exactly. So

2140
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:33,840
one thing that helped me is that I didn't cut water, so I felt I never was like dehydrated or

2141
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:38,000
anything like that. Didn't cut sodium and I could go into the physiology behind why I think it's

2142
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:42,960
silly to cut sodium as well. I didn't take it to erratic. But yes, like during peak week,

2143
03:06:42,960 --> 03:06:51,200
food went back up because the idea is diuretics even legal in tested take OTC diuretics. So you

2144
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:57,520
could take like dandelion root and those sorts of things. But yeah, it's it's very funny like the

2145
03:06:57,520 --> 03:07:03,920
logic behind why people cut water and sodium. And I think it's like somebody just saw a figure of

2146
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:08,640
the sodium potassium pump in a book. And they're like, oh, see, the cell wants to get sodium out

2147
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:12,640
and potassium in. So let's cut sodium and load potassium. And it's like, if you actually look at

2148
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:18,160
the physiology, if you get the sodium to potassium ratio too low, it'll actually cause you to retain

2149
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:23,120
water as well like the you'll actually start reabsorbing water in the distal tubule of the kidney.

2150
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:29,840
So yeah, I think that that helped with my energy and whatnot. But definitely food in the days before

2151
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:33,920
the competition comes up, because at that point, like if you're still trying to lose body fat that

2152
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:42,320
close, it's probably not going to go well for you. And so I'll like usually in peak week, I'll start

2153
03:07:42,320 --> 03:07:47,840
feeling better as opposed to worse. And then on the day of the show, you know, I'm usually having,

2154
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:50,480
you know, three to 400 grams of carbohydrates, something like that.

2155
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:57,280
So it's, you know, it's very interesting because a lot of the dogmas in bodybuilding originated

2156
03:07:57,280 --> 03:08:03,920
like wrestling and endurance running. You know, if you look at the correlation was kind of like,

2157
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:09,680
well, wrestlers cut water and they look really lean. So we should cut water. Right. And I'll always

2158
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:16,880
use the example of if you've ever seen George St. Pierre when he weighed in, he looked like

2159
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:25,280
gaunt, you know, not very, I mean, just didn't look healthy, not very muscular. And then the day

2160
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:29,920
of the fight, 24 hours later, I mean, he looks like a bodybuilder. You know what I mean? Like he

2161
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:36,720
looks pretty jacked. Well, that will just show you what, like drinking water, eating enough sodium

2162
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:44,720
and carbohydrate will do for your muscle fullness because muscles are 70% water. So yeah, I think

2163
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:50,720
that that all that stuff kind of helped me have a little bit more longevity in that sport. And so

2164
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:59,120
far as like I wasn't beating my body up with, you know, fluid restriction. So you're 40 now when

2165
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:07,520
you sort of think about yourself being 60 or 70. How do you think about aging in terms of the

2166
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:13,520
reductions in strength, which is obviously an important part of your identity? And I think

2167
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:20,720
part of your identity and the change in physique, you know, do you think that it's going to be a

2168
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:26,000
difficult transition? And I'm not suggesting that the alternative to what you're doing now is sitting

2169
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:30,640
on a couch all day drinking beer, of course. But, you know, invariably, whether you're Arnold

2170
03:09:30,640 --> 03:09:36,560
Schwarzenegger or, you know, anyone who's really fit, like you're not going to look the same when

2171
03:09:36,560 --> 03:09:43,360
you're 60. I think about this a lot, you know, I bugged my wife or not bugger. I just, I say all

2172
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:48,240
the time, I'm like, God, I can't stand my face like it's so wrinkled and beaten up from all the sun.

2173
03:09:48,240 --> 03:09:51,600
And she's like, well, you don't do anything about it. She's like, you could go and see a dermatologist.

2174
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:56,480
And I'm like, yeah, I'm just too lazy. I think it's easier to sit here and sort of gripe about it

2175
03:09:56,480 --> 03:10:01,600
and think about like, just have these vain thoughts of, well, the older I get, the older I look,

2176
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:07,360
you know. Yeah. I mean, I consider and say, oh, no, I'll be fine. No, of course I'm going to struggle

2177
03:10:07,360 --> 03:10:13,840
with it. Like, you know, look at any like athlete, you know, that is your identity for such a long

2178
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:18,720
period of your life. Now, I think I'm fortunate in that I've kind of had multiple identities.

2179
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:29,120
So I've had, you know, academic, you know, influencer, entrepreneur, you know, power lifter,

2180
03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:34,160
bodybuilder, scientist. So I think it'll be a little bit easier for me because I already have

2181
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:39,920
other things that I care about, you know, and then being a dad, I already have other things I

2182
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:49,680
care about. But of course, it'll be hard. Like, you know, like, don't. Nobody who's successful

2183
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:56,080
doesn't have any ego whatsoever, you know. And so I'm not going to lie, like when I load up a bar

2184
03:10:56,080 --> 03:11:01,040
with 500 pounds in a commercial gym and, you know, I'm squatting that like part of me feels like a

2185
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:06,240
badass, you know what I mean? And so, yeah, there's going to be part of me that absolutely

2186
03:11:06,240 --> 03:11:10,240
missed that. You know, that's why you have the guy who's like, well, you know, when I was in high

2187
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:14,480
school, you know, I benched four or five or whatever it is, or, you know, I squatted 600 until

2188
03:11:14,480 --> 03:11:21,760
my knees hurt. So my goal is to not be that guy, you know, other than just like if somebody asked

2189
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:27,520
me about what I've done to do it. But I think really what's going to be most important for me

2190
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:35,440
is just trying to not judge it and just, you know, find other things that I can, you know,

2191
03:11:35,440 --> 03:11:40,720
be interested in. And I still always left. I'll always train. I love it too much to not do it.

2192
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:45,680
It makes me feel too good. And quite frankly, like, if you look at some of the people who've

2193
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:50,640
been doing it for a really long time, I mean, you know, it was I got a great compliment the other

2194
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:54,560
day because I was in the gym and I just kind of casually brought up that I was I turned 40 this

2195
03:11:54,560 --> 03:12:00,880
year and lady was like, what? I was like, yeah, you know, and she said, oh, I would have guessed

2196
03:12:00,880 --> 03:12:07,200
that you were like, you know, mid 30s. Oh, thank you. You know, but I think like resistance training,

2197
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:14,320
I mean, as far as like keeping you young, that's one of the things I agree. I feel like I feel like

2198
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:20,320
for both men and women, it's it's it is it is a fountain of youth, both cosmetically and also

2199
03:12:20,320 --> 03:12:25,840
internally. Oh, even looking at some of the the bodybuilders out there, notwithstanding like some

2200
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:30,720
of the drug stuff. Yeah. But some of them still look really good into their fifties. You know,

2201
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:34,000
if they if they continue to do it. Now, there's a lot of guys who get out of it and kind of once

2202
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:38,480
that identity is gone, they just go, what's the point of putting energy into lifting? But, you

2203
03:12:38,480 --> 03:12:43,200
know, like Jay Cutler is in his 40s. And yeah, I was about to say Jay Cutler is my favorite of the

2204
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:48,480
kind of recent bodybuilders. He's the only bodybuilder like of that group that I follow on

2205
03:12:48,480 --> 03:12:54,080
Instagram. I enjoy looking at him. Yeah, I know. I mean, he still looks to be in insane shape.

2206
03:12:54,080 --> 03:12:58,640
Yeah. And if you look at him, he goes trains every day. He still eats really well. You know,

2207
03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:02,880
he just kind of got he likes that lifestyle and got used to it. And, you know, it shows.

2208
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:08,720
But yeah, it would definitely be a hard transition. But I'm I'm sure I'll find something to,

2209
03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:13,840
you know, bury myself in. And, you know, who knows? We'll see.

2210
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:18,160
Well, we went a little longer than we expected to.

2211
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:23,280
We've cut ourselves out of a few extracurricular activities. I had planned this afternoon, but

2212
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:27,280
maybe we'll have time tomorrow. So anyway, Lane, awesome to sit down with you.

2213
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:39,200
Thanks again for making the time. Yeah. Thanks for having me. It was fun.
