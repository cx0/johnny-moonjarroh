00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,960
Hey, Don. Thank you so much for making time to sit down today. I've heard a lot about

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,660
you over the past couple of years from our mutual friend, Lane Norton, who suggested

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,900
that we sit down and go even deeper down this nutrition pathway. What you may not know about

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,360
me is nutrition is my least favorite subject, but I think I say that only because I'm so

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,880
tired of the religious aspect of nutrition. I enjoy talking about nutrition through the

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,040
lens of biochemistry, but thereafter, my patience for it has dwindled over the past decade. I have

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,640
a feeling we'll get along just fine because your entire background is based on nutritional

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,880
biochemistry as opposed to nutrition religion. First of all, it's great to meet you, Peter,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,560
and even electronically. My interest was a little sort of the opposite. I was interested in

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,600
biochemistry first, and studying organic chemistry just seemed so boring and esoteric that nutrition,

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,400
I could actually apply my biochemistry to things people were interested in. I kind of like that

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,280
split, but I totally get your aspect of the zealot ends of the spectrum. You grew up on a farm,

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,240
if I'm not mistaken, correct, in Illinois? Yes, that's correct. Before we started recording

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,480
this, you mentioned to me that your parents, your dad lived to 97, your mom to 102. You're at the

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,640
midpoint of your life right now, essentially, based on your good genes. What was it like growing up

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,920
on a farm 70 years ago? It was a great experience. Back in the 50s, when I was born,

18
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,680
agriculture was very poor in the United States, and so you sort of grew up in that background.

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,760
But I think some of the things I learned was I learned about animal growth, I learned about

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,240
reproduction, I learned about growing corn and soybeans, I learned about life cycle. I just got

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,840
an interest in food. We were growing it, we had it there on the farm, and so it just made me

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,800
interested in it. Combined with that, I always had an interest in science and sort of evolved to be

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
a kind of a natural marriage, I guess. When you're going to college, did you study biochemistry and

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,440
organic chemistry first? That was your undergrad? Yeah, the background, the serendipity of how I

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
got into nutrition, it certainly wasn't anything I knew about. I was in a small town, went to a

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,320
school that had like 400 people in it, and so it certainly wasn't anything I knew about. But I knew

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:04,160
I liked science, so I went to first Illinois State University to study chemistry, and I pretty quickly

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,560
realized I had no aptitude for inorganic chemistry, but I sort of understood biochemistry pretty well.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,120
I got to the end of it, and it was actually during the Vietnam War, and I was scheduled to go into

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,680
the military, and so I was totally unemployable, and the university said, hey, you're doing really

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
good at this chemistry stuff, we'll give you graduate assistantship, and you go when you go, and

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,480
all of a sudden I ended up with a deferment getting a master's degree in biochemistry,

33
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,800
and my mentor at that time says, you really have a knack for this nutrition part of it,

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,640
why don't you do a PhD? And I sort of said, oh, really? And so I ended up at University of

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,320
Minnesota doing a PhD in nutritional biochemistry and fell in love with all of it, so it certainly

36
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,200
was no grand plan, but it kind of fit my background of agriculture, food, sports nutrition.

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,160
I fell into a group that was doing muscle metabolism, and it just kind of all felt

38
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,320
together for me. Now, was Ansel Keys at the University of Minnesota at that time?

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,560
He was not. He had left, but his legacy was there with George Blackburn and Ivan France and some of

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,280
those individuals, so I certainly got that background while I was there, and certainly

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,680
invested a lot of how my early thinking of nutrition, and I think Lane Norton, who you've

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,240
talked with before, has talked about how our thinking of nutrition evolves. My certainly has

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,040
evolved. Well, tell me a little bit about what, at least as far as you can remember,

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:53,520
what was your underlying philosophy of nutrition circa 1975, which is probably when you were doing

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,600
your PhD, I'm guessing? Yeah, I think sort of one of my earliest sort of thinking about nutrition,

46
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,240
again, it sort of dates to my interest in animal growth, but also sports nutrition.

47
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:17,680
I very early developed the philosophy that nutrition was really about two tissues, the brain

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,320
and skeletal muscle. If those two tissues were healthy, you were going to live a pretty good life.

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,680
Everything else is regulatory, the liver, the heart, the kidney, the gut, everything else

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,840
adapts to your environment, but you have to focus on those two, and I think if you tailor your

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,520
nutritional requirements around that thinking, you end up with a much more sensible approach, and I

52
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,560
sort of coined the concept that my colleague Dr. Gabrielle Lyon and I always use of muscle-centric

53
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,200
nutrition, and if you keep muscle healthy, you've got a good shot at avoiding obesity, avoiding

54
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,120
diabetes, avoiding cancer, etc., etc. Well, let's go into that a little bit. I mean, I want to get

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,920
into some weeds on a whole bunch of other really nuanced stuff, but let's follow this thread for

56
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,680
a moment. So when you say that, I assume you're at least in part referring to the following two

57
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:25,360
facts. One, muscle is the largest sink for glucose. So, you know, 75 to 80 percent of our glucose

58
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,600
storage capacity exists within skeletal muscle, and then there's another factor of muscle which is

59
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,320
it's a very early depot for excess adipose tissue. So once we start to let little droplets of fat

60
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,680
accumulate within muscle cells, it leads to this process of insulin resistance that then creates a

61
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,480
problem for the first point that I made, which is you now make it harder for your carbohydrate storage

62
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,640
unit to accept carbohydrates, and of course that leads to hyperglycemia and ultimately diabetes.

63
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,200
Is that part of why that formulated your thesis or is there more to it?

64
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,680
More to it. I mean, I think what you stated is correct, but I do think about it differently.

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,560
I think about muscle really serves two functions. One, the obvious one is mobility.

66
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:28,000
Most people get to the age of 65. Beyond that, most people actually die from some form of

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,960
immobility. Falls, breaking something, hospitalization. So functional mobility is critical.

68
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:44,240
But the other aspect is metabolism, and muscle is a primary site for insulin activity. You mentioned

69
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:53,120
glucose storage. I look at it more as an issue of glucose utilization and also fat utilization.

70
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,160
So basically your blood glucose and your blood lipids are heavily, I mean obviously the amount

71
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,080
you eat makes a difference, but the actual level is heavily dependent on your muscle metabolism.

72
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,840
You sort of commented about insulin resistance being associated with fat. Actually insulin causes

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,280
insulin resistance. So if you chronically elevate insulin too long, that is the definition

74
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,000
of type 2 diabetes is that basically insulin causes insulin resistance.

75
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,440
Well, say more about that. I mean, it's hard to untangle some of the causality here. I mean,

76
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:40,400
I spoke with Jerry Shulman, God probably it's been two years ago. In his paradigm,

77
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:49,440
you have the accumulation of diacylglycerides within the actual myocyte. So not interstitially,

78
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
or not between them, but it's the actual accumulation of lipid within.

79
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,680
It's funny, I'm blanking on which enzyme now that inhibits, but it's basically down the PI3K pathway,

80
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,640
the PI3 kinase pathway, where you basically render the muscle cell less sensitive to

81
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
the signal of insulin telling the glute IV transporter to come up.

82
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,520
This hyperinsulinemia is effectively the first way that you can externally measure

83
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
insulin resistance. Is that sort of in line with what you're saying?

84
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes and no. So Jerry Shulman is great. I definitely followed his research a lot.

85
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,640
And the thing to understand about the biochemistry is you can create the models

86
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,360
to give you a negative feedback. So he's absolutely correct that

87
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,400
that diacylglycerol or ceramides will feed back to the insulin receptor, the glute IV transport

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,960
and the insulin receptor and cause insulin resistance. So that's true. So that is a

89
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,480
philosophy of fat centric that fat causes all the problems. On the other hand, you can do the exact

90
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,720
same thing with glucose. Too much glucose will also inhibit the insulin receptor and cause that

91
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,120
same exact feedback. It doesn't accumulate the ceramides or the diacylglycerol. I did some

92
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,560
research with diacylglycerol. And if you sort of do it in the issues of high carb, low carb,

93
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,480
you won't find those effects. So the question then becomes which one's more likely to be

94
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:47,840
physiological because people are eating 350 grams of carbs per day or because they're eating 90

95
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,640
grams of fat per day, which one's likely to cause it? Bob Wolf, there's a philosophy called the

96
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,360
Randall hypothesis. I don't know if you've heard of it, but basically the philosophy is the Randall

97
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,960
hypothesis was that fatty acids, the diacylglycerol, cause all the problems. And what Bob Wolf did was

98
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,080
basically run that experiment with stable isotopes. And he showed us actually the reverse, that fatty

99
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,600
acids are not inherently toxic, but glucose is. It has its own disease. We call it diabetes. And so

100
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
when you eat excess carbs, you must get rid of them. You absolutely have to dispose of them in

101
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,120
the next two hours or fat basically can hang around for much longer. It's just simply not that

102
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,080
toxic to the body. In fact, the body always wants a certain level of free fatty acids in the blood

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,160
because that's the fuel for the heart. Okay. So it's always high. Now, basically the issue is the

104
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,560
balance. Yeah, what about the ability that that excess, the ability to turn that excess glucose

105
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,160
into fatty acid via de novo lipogenesis? Are you saying that that doesn't happen quickly enough

106
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,520
to alleviate some of the toxicity of acute hyperglycemia? It doesn't happen super quick.

107
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,600
I mean, that's a great question. There's a lot of people who argue how much de novo lipogenesis

108
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,720
actually occurs, but basically when you get into requiring high amounts of de novo lipogenesis,

109
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,880
now we start talking about fatty liver. And so now you start seeing triglyceride problems.

110
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,520
And so people who are actually doing a lot of de novo lipogenesis typically have elevated

111
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,320
triglycerides. So that's one of the first signs that you're disrupting that flow. Triglycerides

112
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,160
in general are there to recycle free fatty acids. So the bottom, the blood's all the adipose is

113
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,640
always dumping free fatty acids out for the heart and other tissues. The problem comes in

114
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,560
is when you start blending that with too many carbs and too many fats. So, first and foremost,

115
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,600
calories are always the problem, but when you have excess calories and then you start rebalancing

116
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,360
these macronutrients is when you get into trouble. Yeah. You're obviously intimately familiar with

117
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
this, maybe even some of the listeners are, but there's a very famous paper by Mark Hellerstein,

118
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,840
you know, it's kind of circa mid 90s, 94, 95 that demonstrated really a very small amount of de

119
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,320
novo lipogenesis taking place with carbohydrate feeding. I absolutely believe the results of

120
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,520
that paper, but I also think it's a very narrow context and it's not necessarily the context of

121
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,320
an overfed individual. And therefore I think our capacity for de novo lipogenesis depends heavily

122
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,920
on total energy content or total energy balance. And therefore I think there is a scenario where

123
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,600
in the Hellerstein paper, you can feed a high carbohydrate diet, but within the overall

124
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,680
composition of a low energy diet or a balanced energy diet and DNL is actually quite low.

125
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,080
Conversely, you can feed a high carbohydrate diet in the context of a high energy diet. And I think

126
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,440
we would probably see a much greater amount of DNL. Yeah, totally. And so yeah, I think the context

127
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
matters. You're exactly right. And I do think that the first, if we were describing this as a

128
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,920
polynomial, right? Like the first order term is energy. The first order term is how many calories

129
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,920
are coming in. And that probably matters more than the ratio of carb to fat. Yeah. Go back to that

130
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,320
Randall hypothesis or Wolf discussion. You always want to think about it as that carbohydrates,

131
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,280
excess glucose is toxic. If the blood level is high, you'll damage basically every tissue from

132
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,520
your eyes to your toes. And so you have to dispose of the glucose. So Hellerstein's,

133
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,240
what he showed was that if you have a diet that say, say the American diet, 50% carbs,

134
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:11,360
35% fat, and you take in a thousand calorie meal or 800 calorie meal, which one are you going to

135
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,120
put into fat quickest? You're going to put in the easiest one, the one that's already fat. And so

136
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,640
the carbohydrates going to get burned and the fats going to go to fat. It's just simply the body is

137
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,880
selecting the easiest pathway. But if you switch that and Jules Hirsch did it and then, and then

138
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Jeff Volek did it later, if you switch that to a 80% carb 10%, then you'll see that de novo liposynthesis.

139
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,960
And one of the interesting things out of it is when the body makes fat, the only thing it can

140
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,200
make is saturated fat. So we have a lot of saturated fat in the blood that actually doesn't

141
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,880
come from eating fat. It comes from eating carbs. Yeah. Again, in the context of how much we're

142
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,560
eating, right? Yeah, exactly. All right. So taking it back. It's important to realize, it's important

143
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,800
for people to realize we burn around a hundred calories per hour. That would be 2,400 calories

144
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,520
per day. So a hundred calories per hour, uh, in a two hour period, you're only burning 200 calories.

145
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,600
So everything else has to be stored. Average American meal is 400 to a thousand calories.

146
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,240
That means you have to store all of that. Yeah. Interesting. Is that an argument you think for

147
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,480
spreading out calories more over the course of the day? That takes us into a protein discussion.

148
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:41,120
And I would say absolutely not. Um, the two, two angles to that. One was there was a theory back

149
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:50,000
when I was early in my career, back in the mid eighties by Gil Lavelle, and he was arguing that

150
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,840
lots of small meals was good for, uh, less fat deposition. And it was an artifact of how he did

151
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,240
the study. We ran, he did it with animals and basically showed that when you made the adaptation

152
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,400
to lots of small meals, uh, the animals didn't gain as much as if you, uh, adapted them to like

153
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,640
two meals per day. But the artifact was when you adapt an animal to two meals per day, they go

154
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,960
through a starvation period because they'd have to learn to do it. And when you come out of a

155
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:27,440
starvation period, you're making more fat. So we redid it with a longer adaptation period. And what

156
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,960
we found was that, um, reducing the number of meals per day actually is thermogenically

157
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,240
advantageous. You actually waste more calories. So we actually redid that and published it.

158
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,760
The other aspect we can get into is protein. Protein needs to be distributed at specific meals.

159
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,560
The distribution needs to be high and eating lots of small meals, uh, is a really bad choice for a

160
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,840
lot of reasons. And we can get into that. But anyway, well, I, yeah. And I definitely want to

161
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,200
get into that because if there's, if there's one area I really want to double click on today,

162
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:09,440
it's everything from protein timing, protein type versus plant protein efficiency, amino acid

163
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
variability, all that kind of stuff. We're going to, we're going to go deep on that, but let's go pick

164
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,160
it up back in university of Minnesota. You've got the legacy and I'm guessing at the time, you know,

165
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,400
keys is really famous for two things in the mid seventies, right? I think by that point, he's

166
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:30,960
probably already published his seven country study and the hypothesis now is a very fat centric view

167
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,040
of, you know, the negative consequences of dietary fat, specifically dietary saturated fat

168
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,320
in the American diet, especially as it pertains to ASCVD. And then I suspect the second thing

169
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,200
that he's probably still famous for is the starvation experiments, um, that were, I'm

170
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
guessing done in the 1950s. I mean, these were done on conscientious objectors. So they're

171
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
probably in the forties or fifties, right? Yeah, I can't exactly date that, but you're

172
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:05,280
exactly right. So those were, I mean, we learned a lot about starvation at that point for obvious

173
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,880
reasons. We can't do experiments like that before, but we learned a lot about body composition and

174
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,400
how the body star. So those were good, but certainly the legacy was there. And when I got

175
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,240
to Minnesota, you know, I sort of bought into the cholesterol and the saturated fat and total fat.

176
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,040
And you know, I sort of, okay, this is what everybody's teaching. And you know, that's what

177
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,160
I was forced to learn. That's what they were teaching. Uh, and so I bought into it, but,

178
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,240
you know, as I slowly started doing experiments and early in my career, we did a lot of fasting

179
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,720
type of experiments with animals to look at composition changes. And I did malnutrition

180
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,520
work in Northern Africa. And I sort of got into all of that and I, I started realizing, you know,

181
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,160
I don't really believe that. And one seminar I will always remember at Minnesota was individual

182
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,440
by their name of Fred Kumburrow came to Minnesota and gave a seminar about the dangers of cooking

183
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,880
oils and specifically trans fats. And Blackburn and France just ridiculed him, basically said,

184
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,560
this is the craziest thing we've ever heard. All these plant oils are great. Uh, and basically,

185
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,080
you know, 20 years later, we banned trans fats from foods literally as the most dangerous fat

186
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,520
that you can encounter. So I, I always remember that just sort of thinking, well, you know,

187
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,440
people who have bought into this dogma aren't necessarily right. And we need to keep questioning

188
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:47,120
it. Speaking of France, um, obviously in 1973, he completes a study, the minute Minnesota

189
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:55,040
coronary experiment. Um, I actually find this to be one of the most difficult studies to interpret,

190
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:02,720
not so much the one that he published 16 years later, by the way, in 1989, but the one that

191
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,120
Chris Ramsden republished just a couple of years ago, based on all of the data from France's study,

192
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,680
plus data he never published. This to me is one of the most complicated stories. And I, I will tell

193
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,320
you, I have posed this question to every friend of mine who is more steeped in nutrition than I am.

194
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,120
And, um, I still don't have a great sense of how to explain these results. So I'll explain it for the,

195
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,280
for the listener and the viewer. And I'm curious to your thoughts. So the experiment was done, um,

196
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,280
in basically institutionalized patients. So again, maybe not a study that could be done easily again

197
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,400
today for ethical reasons, but had the advantage of being so well controlled. You, you basically

198
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,600
had patients that were randomized into two groups. Their total energy was identical. Their total split

199
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,840
of macronutrients was identical. The only thing that differed was that in one group, it was high

200
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,040
saturated fat. And in the other group, it was high polyunsaturated fat. The hypothesis being tested

201
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,720
was is saturated fat intake leading to increased major adverse cardiac events, heart attacks and

202
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:22,880
strokes. The experiment that completed in, I think it ran, I can't remember exactly, I think it ran

203
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,160
about five years in 1973 showed no difference. There was no difference in cardiac events,

204
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,920
despite the fact that the group that was on the higher polyunsaturated fat group did indeed have

205
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,760
much lower cholesterol levels. Now this was this predated the sub fractionation. So they weren't

206
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,440
measuring LDL and HDL. They were just measuring total cholesterol. And at the time there was some

207
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,600
correlation between cardiovascular disease and total cholesterol levels at the extremes. That

208
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,240
was certainly true. Again, because I didn't think we'd be talking about this, I don't have the

209
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,840
numbers all in my mind, but we'll link to it all. But directionally, I believe that the higher PUFA

210
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,920
group relative to the saturated fat group was about 30 milligrams per deciliter lower in total

211
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,440
cholesterol. And based on everything we know today, we would assume that much of that was in LDL

212
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
cholesterol indeed being lower and non HDL cholesterol. And yet there was no difference

213
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,400
in events. And of course, it's become a very famous and unfortunate story in nutrition research and

214
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,680
that Franz chose not to publish it because he didn't like the results. It didn't match his hypothesis,

215
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,520
which was that the group on lower saturated fat would have fewer events. Ramsden went and

216
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,920
published all of these data plus a whole bunch of sub data. As I said just a few years ago,

217
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,520
I believe in the British medical journal and actually found something that was that threw

218
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,040
a wrench in my initial hypothesis. My initial view of the Minnesota coronary experiment was

219
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,160
it probably wasn't a long enough intervention. It might be that five years was not long enough

220
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,040
to appreciate a difference. And so it was underpowered or too short in a duration to see

221
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,200
a benefit if there was a benefit. But in Ramsden's analysis, you actually saw the opposite because he

222
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,440
now looked at some subgroups and you actually saw a higher incidence of coronary events in some of

223
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,320
the people that were consuming the high polyunsaturated fat diet. And I can't remember what

224
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,520
the dominant oil was. I'm blanking on it. I don't remember if it was canola or safflower. I think it

225
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,920
was safflower. So how much of that do you remember, Don, from your time there? And can you

226
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,200
shed any light on this or do you have any thoughts on how to interpret that experiment?

227
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,920
Well, first of all, I am definitely not a lipid expert. So I sort of remember the study,

228
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,440
but I can't put any more numbers to it than you did. I actually did some research with Ivan

229
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,680
France and Penny Cruz-Etherton when I was at Minnesota. So I sort of was in the loop at the

230
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,760
time, but that's been a couple of years ago. Yeah, I think if one really looks at the literature

231
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,920
on saturated fat and is fair about all of those studies, you find a very mixed bag,

232
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,200
the Women's Health Initiative and all of those kinds of things. And unfortunately,

233
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,920
the people who believe the hypothesis have either delayed publishing it or said, well,

234
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,360
it couldn't have been wrong and tried to, you know, it could have been wrong and they tried to find

235
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,480
all kinds of excuses as opposed to just believing it. You know, there's an old theory in science

236
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,960
that, you know, if the theory is correct, it will get stronger over time. And if it's not,

237
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,800
it gets weaker. And I think one would have to realize that, A, the cholesterol theory,

238
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,040
the total cholesterol theory has definitely gotten weaker and the saturated fat hasn't held

239
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,920
up very well. You know, we still believe it, but your comment a little bit ago, it's first and

240
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,240
foremost calories. If you put excess saturated fat on top of too many calories, that's probably a

241
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,160
problem. But if you're at or below your calorie needs, I don't see any data that suggests it is.

242
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,600
So, you know, my sort of joke or comment all the time is that if you're committed to being

243
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,800
obese, you probably ought to pay attention to the quality of your fats. But if your goal,

244
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,480
if your goal is to be lean and healthy calories is what you're paying attention to. And the macro

245
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:34,800
distribution is sort of your personal preference. So let's talk a little bit now about how your

246
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,680
interest in protein came about because, you know, of all macronutrients, this is the one I have to

247
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,000
pay the most attention to. And it's honestly the one where I feel like I fall the shortest. You

248
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,720
know, I feel like I have some days when I nail it and I have too many days when I come up short.

249
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,600
I never go overboard. I never go to bed at night thinking, God, I ate too much protein today. But

250
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,360
I do go to bed sometimes thinking I don't think I ate enough for my goals. Right. My goals are to

251
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,640
sort of maximize muscle protein synthesis. My goals are to preserve lean tissue as long as I can. And

252
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,560
frankly, that's the goal for my patients. So how did this become a strong interest of yours?

253
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,240
Well, the real interest started in my master's degree because I got interested in studying

254
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,720
protein turnover, protein synthesis. And I was working with Arlen Richardson, who was an expert

255
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,000
in aging. And we were studying age related changes in protein synthesis. And we actually

256
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,760
discovered the changes in mRNA over time that the poly A tails on mRNA get shorter. Your ability to

257
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,200
put ribosomes on the message goes down and you have lower synthesis. So that efficiency of change

258
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,240
of protein synthesis over time is a theme that runs through all of my research. And we'll get

259
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,840
into efficiency and adults and things like that. So that was sort of the beginning when I went to

260
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,480
Minnesota, then I sort of got a muscle focus on it. And one of the first things I learned in graduate

261
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,880
school is we don't really have a protein requirement. We have a requirement for nine essential amino

262
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:23,920
acids and organic nitrogen, organic amines, which all translates into the fact that we can make 11

263
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:32,160
of amino acids and nine we have to have in the diet. And one of my favorite quips I use when I'm

264
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,160
talking to groups on stage is that, you know, protein we should think of as a vitamin pill.

265
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,440
We don't have a daily requirement for a vitamin pill. We have a requirement for 12 vitamins inside

266
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,080
the pill. We don't actually have a daily requirement for protein. We have a requirement for

267
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,760
nine or 20 amino acids inside of it. And so it's talking about a protein requirement

268
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,520
just to reflect ignorance. We have specific requirements for nine essential amino acids.

269
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,760
And that gets into the complexity then because these amino acids are essential for building

270
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,280
blocks for new protein, but every one of them has a metabolic role like leucine and mTOR or arginine

271
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,640
and nitric oxide or lysine and carnitine or cysteine and glutathione. And all of those roles

272
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,440
are vastly above the minimum that is detected for nitrogen balance for the RDA. And so that's where

273
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,600
people fall apart is that we think about vitamin C and we know there's a minimum RDA to prevent

274
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,160
scurvy, but people will take five or 10 times that during COVID for immune response. But we

275
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,240
resist thinking that way about amino acids and it's exactly the same.

276
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,840
You know, that's a great point, Don. Maybe we should spend a minute helping people understand

277
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,840
what an amino acid is because, you know, I took biochemistry, I have my little cue cards, I can

278
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,800
draw every one of the amino acids. Not anymore, by the way. I can't. Yeah, I was gonna say not anymore.

279
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,280
But there was a day when I could draw all nine of them. But let's help people understand. I think

280
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,040
most people understand what glucose looks like. If you've listened to this podcast, you're no

281
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,920
stranger to the idea that glucose is a six carbon ring and each one has a couple hydrogens on them.

282
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,960
And one of them's got an oxygen and a hydrogen on it as well. I think most people who have listened

283
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,600
to this podcast have a decent sense of what a fatty acid looks like. Long stretch of carbons.

284
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,080
If it's saturated, there's no double bond. So it's just littered with either two or three hydrogens,

285
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,560
depending on where it sits in the chain. And then, of course, you store them by putting three of those

286
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,520
onto a nice little three carbon glycerol backbone. But I actually think most people

287
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,480
understandably have less clarity around what an amino acid is. And you've already alluded to the

288
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,280
fact that there were 20 of them and nine of them we can't even make. I mean, we're if we were

289
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,880
deprived of these things, we'd be dead. So we got to eat them. But can you give folks a sense of

290
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,800
the nomenclature? What is an amino acid? What do these things look like? Yeah. So a little bit like

291
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:21,440
a fatty acid, an amino acid has a carboxy end connected with a carbon and then it has a nitrogen

292
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,400
end. And when the body is making so when we eat protein, we get these amino acids in some sort

293
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,640
of a string, but we totally digest them down to probably individual amino acids, maybe di or

294
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,360
tripeptides, and we absorb them that way. They get to the blood as single amino acids for the most

295
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,760
part. And then the body begins to reconnect them based like on the messenger RNAs. Our DNA tells

296
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,880
us how to reconnect them. And so we connect a carbon to a nitrogen and we string them together.

297
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,400
Of these 20 amino acids though, they all have that that acid and nitrogen part, but they also

298
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,680
have a side chain ranging from very simple one like glycine with just a hydrogen to ones like

299
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:14,240
tryptophan that have a big aromatic part to them. And so all of these are different and they go into

300
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,120
proteins in different structures. The DNA tells us how we put them together and proteins can be

301
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,720
simple like insulin with 51 amino acids, or they could be like myosin with thousands.

302
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,280
And so they're all and then every protein in the body has a different turnover rate. Some of them

303
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,600
like insulin might last 15 minutes and some of them like myosin or let's say collagen might last

304
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,600
250 days. And so they turn over at different rates. So that's sort of what they are.

305
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,000
But beyond that building block structure, then every amino acid has other kinds of structures.

306
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,760
It might be like lysine where part of it becomes the molecule known as

307
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:09,280
carnitine, which is for fatty acid metabolism, or it might be the nitrogen off arginine that

308
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,000
goes to nitric oxide for vasorestriction, or it might be cysteine which goes to part of

309
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,640
creatinine or glutathione. So we can get the leucine, which is sort of my favorite, which is

310
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,840
a signal which really got me interested in protein and metabolism is a signal for muscle protein

311
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,480
synthesis. So again, they all have this building block structure. They get strung together

312
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,840
in different links. But they also have other metabolic functions. And that's what people

313
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,200
don't recognize when they're talking about protein requirements.

314
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,520
So let's talk about that RDA, right? Because when we look at our patients and evaluate them from an

315
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:01,920
nutritional standpoint, almost without exception, we come to the conclusion that they are not getting

316
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,560
enough amino acids based on how much protein they're consuming. Now, I don't know how much of

317
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,880
that is the nature by which food is prepared these days, the nature by which, you know, protein makes

318
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:23,840
up a certain amount of the caloric intake based on various types of, you know, prepared foods and

319
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,640
things like that. And how much of that just based is based on a belief system of what people need,

320
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,640
perhaps coming back to the RDA. So how what's the first of all, let's tell people what the

321
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:43,040
actual RDA is and, and how it came to be. So the RDA is a recommended dietary allowance. So it's

322
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,520
some people think it's a daily, but it's a dietary allowance. So it's sort of a generic number.

323
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,040
And the argument is that for all our DAs, we sort of test the population and come up with an average

324
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,280
number. And then for a safety factor, which average would be 50 percent would be deficient.

325
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,400
And so we add a safety factor of two standard deviations, which supposedly 97.5 percent of the

326
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,960
people would be adequate to prevent any, any signs of inadequacy at that point. But that also means

327
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,560
2.5 percent of the people are actually deficient at that point. So that that's sort of the definition.

328
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,040
Where does the RDA come from? I think it's useful to go back in history just a little bit then on

329
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,600
protein. How did we begin to evaluate protein needs? Well, it all came out of animal sciences.

330
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,640
Back in the early 1900s, before we even knew the essential, all the essential amino acids,

331
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,880
farmers were trying to say, how do I get animals to grow best, you know, and different kinds of

332
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,560
proteins and things like that. And they develop protein quality scores and things like that. So

333
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:00,640
how much growth did I get for what I fed? How much nitrogen did I deposit for how much I fed?

334
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,800
So these are all rapidly growing animals. And we developed this concept really of nitrogen retention.

335
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,600
That basically, we've now translated into what's called nitrogen balance. And

336
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,120
that's how we determine the protein requirement. Basically, what's important in all of that

337
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,720
discussion, that long-winded explanation is that all of the concepts were developed for growth,

338
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,000
where nitrogen balance was positive. You could measure a change over time. And as we've now

339
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,040
tried to start applying that to non-growing adults, it gets a lot more vague. So it's important to

340
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,960
recognize that what we think about protein requirements is a, develop from nitrogen balance,

341
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,600
where you measure all of the nitrogen you're eating, which you can do pretty good, but then

342
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,880
you have to measure all of the nitrogen you're losing, which we're really bad at. And we call

343
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,840
that nitrogen balance. Can you explain how that's done? Don, this is, I think we're going to talk

344
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,640
so much about it that I think it's worth getting into the details of how nitrogen balance is

345
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,600
calculated. And let's do it in a human. So if I came into your lab, how would you do this?

346
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,640
So let's start with the front end. Let's start with nitrogen in. So that's basically, you just take

347
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,320
a bunch of food and you do a chemical analysis and you measure the nitrogen and you multiply it by a

348
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,000
factor of 6.25. So A, you're measuring nitrogen. It's not really protein. It could be nucleic acids.

349
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,120
It could be anything with nitrogen. You're calling it protein. And then you're multiplying

350
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:45,600
it by 6.25, which says, I believe that protein contains 16% nitrogen, which also isn't always

351
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,440
true. So now we've got this error on the front end and now on the back end, we're going to try and

352
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,360
measure losses. So the primary loss of nitrogen in the body is in the urine, urea. So that's pretty

353
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,680
easy to measure. You can collect that. Second would be the stool. So you can collect that,

354
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:13,840
but then you get into things like sweat and skin loss and hair loss and respiratory nitrogen

355
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,640
ammonia in the breath. And those are all incredibly vague. So everyone who knows nitrogen

356
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:28,800
balance says that nitrogen balance underestimates requirement. Everybody, uniformly. But that is

357
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,160
where the RDA comes from. And when you do short-term studies, what you find is most people

358
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,320
young and again, all these studies were done with college age students. So they're kind of right at

359
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:51,280
the end of their growth. And basically in a short-term seven day study, they look okay. So that's

360
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,640
where we're at. In the last 20 years, those of us who studied protein have gone beyond that and said,

361
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,800
well, nitrogen balance is one outcome, but it like the vitamin C argument, there are other outcomes

362
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,760
based on amino acid metabolism that may be more important than minimum nitrogen balance. And we

363
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,160
now know that protein handling goes down, the efficiency goes down as we get older. So now we

364
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,600
have much higher requirements that we, that most of us talk about for adults. So just to be clear,

365
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,760
Don, going back to something you said, the reason we all agree that that standard nitrogen balance

366
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,960
underestimates the requirement is it's easier to measure the sum of the ins than the sum of the

367
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:44,880
outs. Yeah, exactly. And the chances are you're significantly underestimating the outs. Yeah.

368
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,520
Especially if you do, I mean, when I was a surgical resident, there were times we did

369
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:59,360
nitrogen balance on patients who were on long-term TPN, total parenteral nutrition in the ICU. These

370
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,040
were patients that it wasn't clear how long it would take for their guts to start working again.

371
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,760
So they had to be fed all of their nutrition through a central line, which is very complicated

372
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,480
feeding to do. And when we would have the nutrition team come and do a consult and do a nitrogen

373
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,240
balance, I mean, they literally had to put a tent over that patient. They were doing the best that

374
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,680
they could in the ICU to basically create a laboratory environment to calculate nitrogen

375
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,360
balance, which turns out, you're not surprised, very important for a critically ill patient.

376
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Right? I mean, that is a hyper hyper catabolic state. And if you're trying to create an

377
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,600
anabolic state in that person to keep them alive, it's imperative that you understand how much

378
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:55,920
nitrogen they have or how much money they require. So the simple idea of I'm just going to tell you

379
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,720
how much protein you're eating and I'm going to measure the nitrogen in that's coming out in your

380
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,480
urea, that's just not going to cut it. That's just too simple. Yeah. And currently a lot of those

381
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,440
studies are simply done with a factor. So they don't put them in tents or buildings or whatever.

382
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,440
They just measure urea in the urine and everything else is just sort of, well, we think it's a

383
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,120
one point. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so obviously we're perpetuating an error based on ignorance.

384
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:34,400
So then let's go one step further, Don. How do you use isotopes to now really get into what's

385
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,640
happening, not just on the boundaries, but like how that nitrogen and by the way, I think there's

386
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,400
one point we should make for the listener who might be still lost as to why we're talking about

387
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:52,640
nitrogen. Proteins have nitrogen. Amino acids all have nitrogen. Carbs and fats don't. So this is

388
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,920
where we can really speak to the source of the nitrogen, right? And now, as you mentioned,

389
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,960
anything with a nucleic acid is going to have nitrogen as well. But the majority of the

390
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,560
nucleic acids come in proteins. Come in. Would be found in the foods. Yeah. Would be found in protein

391
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,760
based foods. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You're exactly right. I mean,

392
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:25,840
car, I mean, fats and for the most part, annoying essential fatty acids, carbs and fats are basically

393
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,840
energy sources. They're carbon carbon bonds that provide energy where amino acids have a very

394
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,640
different purpose and structure. And that nitrogen is part of what makes them different.

395
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:45,920
Yeah. In other words, we consume carbohydrates virtually exclusively for their energy content,

396
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,720
fat mostly for its energy content. There is some structural importance that comes with fat and

397
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,920
cholesterol. But really you don't want to be consuming protein for energy. Right. I mean,

398
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,240
the only caveat I would say to that is that there might be reasons that people are

399
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,120
hypersensitive to carbohydrates where taking in more protein beyond what you might actually need

400
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,320
for protein metabolism might be a substitution for carb calories. And we can get into that

401
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,040
conversion and things like that. But, you know, I talk with people and they say, how well,

402
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,840
how much protein, what's your high end? And I sort of give them one number and I say, but, you know,

403
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,960
the caveat is you might want to take more if you're really trying to struggle with a carbohydrate

404
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,200
issue. So anyway, but you're right. So now let's talk about that measurement of what's actually

405
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,280
happening with those amino acids. Actually, only this question I want to ask you even before that.

406
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,200
Let's think about the normal. When people think of protein, they think of meat, right? That's going

407
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,760
to be a great source of protein. Obviously there's protein and most foods have some protein in them.

408
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,640
But if you if you were eating a piece of steak, how many of those 20 amino acids are in there? Are

409
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,160
they virtually all in there? If you're looking at animal source proteins, whether it's meat or eggs

410
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,520
or milk, basically all of the amino acids that a human would need are in those because they're

411
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,840
basically, you know, obviously a chicken's not a mammal, but the others are mammals and basically

412
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,720
we have the same amino acids, the same protein. So they're all there. Meat is a good example

413
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,400
because they're all pretty much in the right balances. But every protein has a little different

414
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,240
balance of essential amino acids. You can look at dairy proteins and dairy proteins are something

415
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,920
we can fractionate because they're all water soluble. So we know a lot about alpha-lactobumen

416
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:03,280
versus lactoferrin and lactoglobulin, etc., etc. So we know that a lot of differences about amino

417
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,800
acid compositions of individual proteins. And so going back to what you just said,

418
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,040
then animal protein, we typically think of as sort of meat, mammals, right? You know, beef,

419
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,760
pig, stuff like that. And then of course you've got sort of bird protein, mostly chicken for folks,

420
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,880
and then fish protein. And then you have eggs, dairy. We're saying based-

421
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,160
So the first three, the first three are exactly the same for protein. So whether it comes from a cow

422
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,760
or a pig or a chicken or a fish, muscle protein is still muscle protein.

423
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:48,560
And how do we think objectively about the quality of a protein? This is a topic that you've talked

424
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,480
about extensively. And there's a way, there's a numerical way to talk about that. Isn't there

425
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:03,440
an efficiency of that protein versus tofu versus soybean versus rice, all the way down to sort of

426
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,160
lower and lower protein density foods? Yeah. Protein quality is something that I think a lot

427
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,320
about. And I'm actually working with a group now to sort of reinvent how we think about that. But

428
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,840
I think you're referring to protein quality in a sense of PD-Cas or dia or something like that.

429
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,800
Basically we realized that when you look at a protein, there are two factors. One is what's

430
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,520
the composition of the, there's nine essential amino acids. And the other is what's its bio

431
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:45,360
availability? How well do we digest it and absorb it? With animal proteins and most isolated proteins,

432
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:52,800
even soy protein isolates, the digestion absorption is pretty close to a hundred. It's

433
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:01,440
usually 95% or higher for all animal proteins. For plant proteins though, it gets into, you need

434
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,720
to realize that in a plant, the protein is there for the purpose of the plant. And so a lot of it

435
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,680
is attached to fibers, it's a structures. Plants have proteins attached to the leaves and the stems

436
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:23,600
and the roots and the flowers and the seeds. And when you start to isolate that, if you just eat

437
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:31,280
it in a raw form, it may only be 60, 70% available because we can't digest the fiber.

438
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,720
So those are the two factors. We can put those two together and we can do that.

439
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,600
We can put those two together and get a protein quality score and we can determine that a whey

440
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:50,400
protein isolate because of its essential amino acids is 20% better than a soy protein isolate

441
00:47:50,400 --> 00:48:00,000
just because of the amino acids. Or we can compare a wheat protein, a wheat brand, and we realize that

442
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,040
it's only 40% available. So if you look at wheat brand on a cereal box and say it was a wheat

443
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,880
flower and it says there's four grams per serving, there's actually less than two that you can

444
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:23,360
actually absorb. And so that's how we look at it. In my opinion, some of the problems with those

445
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,480
right now is it's hard to compare across foods and it's hard to build a meal that way. We can say

446
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,120
that whey is better than soy. And so if you're only eating those two things, that's okay. But

447
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:39,680
what happens when you start putting them together? And so I am working with a group trying to build

448
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,800
a protein quality score that really based on three amino acids, lysine, methionine, and leucine,

449
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,720
which in my opinion are the key markers for adult health. And so we're trying to re-score it

450
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,720
differently. But that, again, long-winded story about protein quality, but that's how it's

451
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,080
measured. No, that's very interesting, Don. So what you're saying is, if I'm understanding you

452
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,800
correctly, you could brute force your way through life by looking at every single thing you eat

453
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,560
and trying to figure out the dias score for its protein. So, okay, I'm about to have a ribeye.

454
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:21,920
That's going to be about a 96% dias. I'm going to have my soybeans over here. That's about an 80%

455
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,040
dias. I'm going to have my whey isolate. That's a hundred percent dias. I'm going to have my

456
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,120
shredded wheats. That's a 40% dias. That's a tough way to go through life

457
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,240
because you can't just add up the protein. And they're not truly additive. You can't

458
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,520
really figure that out. And the average person doesn't even have that data. I mean, if you go

459
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:52,560
into the USDA database with whatever, 7,000 foods, there are 4,000 that actually have amino

460
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:59,840
acid scores. And of those, there's probably less than 300 that have dias scores. And so you can't

461
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,680
put it together. There's no way. And so we're trying to develop a system that allows people

462
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:12,560
to get better than that. If you look on a label on a package and you see, again, a wheat cereal

463
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,600
that says it has four grams of protein, well, again, that's a nitrogen analysis

464
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,880
times 6.25 for all the problems I've said. And then if you look over at another column,

465
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,680
it'll say daily value. Yeah, exactly. And there almost no label have daily values for protein

466
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,720
because that would require a PD cast or dias score and nobody has them. And so that four grams really

467
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
would translate into less than two, but nobody's being told that. That's right. And by the way,

468
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,200
just for folks who are hearing us use the term dias as digestible, indispensable amino

469
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,480
acid score, correct? Right. Okay. So, and I have a big problem that the digestibility is where a

470
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,360
lot of people have been focusing, but I have a big problem with the amino acid scores because

471
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:05,600
they're incredibly low. They're way too low. And so we have, they're established by the World Health

472
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Organization, by the FAO, which is really designed to prevent malnutrition in Africa,

473
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,960
where we know from our Institute of Medicine that the essential amino acid scores are much

474
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,240
higher than that should be. You mentioned stable isotopes, a little bettigo or tracers. We know

475
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:32,320
from stable isotope studies that all those FAO amino acid scores are too low. And so that's

476
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,720
part of the equation that we're not telling people either. I want to come right back to that,

477
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,320
but I'll finish this one point, which is what you're offering as an alternative to people

478
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,520
living in spreadsheets to calculate how much actual indispensable amino acid they're getting

479
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,800
is, hey, what if we make this easier and you focus on the actual content of three amino acids?

480
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,920
So we're going to take a subset of essential amino acids. And if I recall, I remember Lucene

481
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,600
was clearly one of them. Lysene was one of them. Was methionine the other one?

482
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,200
Methionine is the other one, yeah.

483
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,800
We're going to take methionine, leucine, lysine. And we just want you, Peter, to walk around

484
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,000
and make sure you get enough of those with each meal. And if you do that, the rest will take care

485
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,920
of itself. Is that effectively what you're saying? That's exactly what I'm saying. If you look at

486
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,560
dia scores right now, the amino acid is scoring, A, I've already said it's too low. But if you look

487
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,760
at how they're scored, they're not scoring apples and apples, they're scoring apples and oranges.

488
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:42,320
So if you look at the soy deficiency, all legumes like soy or pea are limiting or deficient in

489
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,800
methionine. And you score that against whey, what you end up is the limiting amino acid in whey is

490
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,720
considered histidine. And no one has ever shown histidine to actually be a limiting amino acid

491
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:01,200
in an adult. It's a limiting amino acid in children and babies. So now we're comparing

492
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,920
apples and oranges. They're not fair. So if you compare methionine to methionine,

493
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:16,480
it's not 20% higher. It's 250% better in soy comparing soy and whey. So we need to compare

494
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,080
apples and apples. We need to compare them across the three essential amino acids that are actually

495
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,680
likely to be limiting. Whereas histidine, phenylalanine, to my knowledge, no one has

496
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,760
ever shown those to be limiting in an adult. So why do we consider them limiting?

497
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,760
All right. So you've already mentioned the importance of leucine and listeners of this

498
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,520
podcast are no stranger to leucine because we've had David Sabatini on, we've had Matt

499
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,680
Caberlein on. I mean, we've gone deep in the weeds on mTOR. And in fact, it was one of David's post

500
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:54,480
docs that actually discovered the leucine sensor on mTOR. So we know now pretty unambiguously,

501
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,960
leucine is an amazing trigger for mTOR. Of course, there's going to be a subset of people

502
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,080
listening to this who are confused, but wait a minute, Peter, if rapamycin is good and rapamycin

503
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,560
inhibits mTOR, how can leucine be good if leucine turns it on? And of course, they're forgetting

504
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,160
the chronicity of the state. Sometimes you need mTOR off. Sometimes you want mTOR off. Sometimes

505
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,160
you want it on, sometimes you want it off. But when we're talking about eating, we want it on,

506
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,800
right? We want to be able to turn mTOR on for muscle protein synthesis, right?

507
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:31,680
So let's circle back to our earlier comment about how often you eat. So now we've got an issue of

508
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,760
mTOR and whether it needs to cycle on and off. And not only does leucine turn it on, but so does

509
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,920
insulin. And so probably the worst case scenario, and you can use a lot of animal studies to back

510
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,480
this up, would be people who eat a lot of small carbohydrate meals that continuously activate

511
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:58,320
mTOR. What we want to do is use specific meals with the right amount of insulin to activate

512
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:05,520
muscle-centric mTOR. mTOR is in every tissue. And what you don't want to do is continuously

513
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,960
activate it in liver or some other tissue. And so that's where the confusion gets into it,

514
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,720
is people ignore the fact that insulin is just the biggest trigger in other tissues,

515
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,200
where leucines are very unique trigger in muscle.

516
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,760
Yep. So now let's go back to the practical application of this. So we know why leucine

517
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,560
matters. Can you say a bit more about methionine and lysine and why raising them to the level of

518
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,320
leucine becomes a great proxy for overall protein load?

519
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:47,280
So if you look at limiting amino acids actually in food, lysine is always limiting in grains.

520
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,760
And that has been shown in animal science over the years. That's a major limitation

521
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:01,920
in how you feed, what the minimum amount. So that one is probably limiting for protein synthesis.

522
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,480
It's also in carnitine and some other things, but lysine is probably mostly for protein synthesis.

523
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:17,520
Methionine is one of the least... So if we look at the amounts we need, we need about 3.4 grams

524
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,360
of lysine per day. We need probably a little less than one gram of methionine. So they're not in

525
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,200
the same proportion either. But the methionine is what we call part of the one carbon pool.

526
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,720
And so basically for the body to make and repair DNA, to make and repair RNA, to make taurine

527
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:43,360
downstream, to make the non-essential amino acid cysteine, to make glutathione the oxidant,

528
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:50,880
methionine is the key to all of those pathways. And so methionine is one of the most limiting,

529
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,680
and it's limiting in all legumes. So we think of soy and pee and a lot of, you know, and

530
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,800
lentils and things of that nature is higher quality protein. They are, but they're still limiting in

531
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:11,200
methionine. What are some of the natural sources of food that are high in methionine?

532
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:19,920
The classic one of, quote, sulfur amino acids is eggs. Eggs, yeah. Eggs are quite high in the sulfur

533
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:28,240
amino acids, which are methionine and cysteine. But all animal products are adequate in them.

534
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,680
And basically all plant products are pretty low in them.

535
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:41,200
So, Don, you grew up on a farm, right? So, you know, we look at animals like cows,

536
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:49,120
which are quite muscular, eating basically just hay and grass. For them to be able to be as

537
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,760
catabolic as they are and produce so much muscle, does that just speak to the incredible volume of

538
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,200
that plant that they have to chew to make sure they're getting enough methionine, enough lysine,

539
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,720
and enough leucine? I think you meant anabolic, not catabolic. Yeah, sorry, sorry, anabolic.

540
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:13,920
In such an anabolic state. I mean, what volume of total protein in the form of grass and hay and

541
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,560
things like that, do they need to get a sufficient amount of those muscle building amino acids?

542
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,760
That sort of wanders us into a sustainability argument, which I really love to wade into. But

543
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,960
cattle, ruminant animals are a very important part of the food chain because of their stomach,

544
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:40,400
which is full of bacteria. One of the things to think about for essential amino acids

545
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:48,000
is really the only place they come from in life is bacteria. Nothing else can make them.

546
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:56,560
And so our primary source of them in nature is the bacteria on roots of plants.

547
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,160
So the bacteria on the roots will take the nitrogen. Why do we fertilize our garden?

548
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,960
Is nitrogen. The bacteria will take that inorganic nitrogen and form organic amines

549
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,360
with it. And those organic amines then can be made into proteins in the plants.

550
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,320
But as I said earlier, the problem with plants is that they don't have the same

551
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,200
balance as we need. They have the plants to make roots and tree, you know, limbs and

552
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:31,360
roots and flowers and things like that. The beauty of a ruminant is they can take that

553
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,640
plant and they can digest it. And the bacteria then will rebalance all of the amino acids.

554
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,960
They'll capture inorganic nitrogen and they make the essential amino acids that mammals need

555
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,440
and they concentrate it for us. So basically humans, one of the arguments is humans evolved

556
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,600
by being able to use more concentrated protein. You know, if we just ate, you know, if we just

557
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:05,520
ate plants, it's hard to get enough. But if the ruminant animal can actually digest all of that,

558
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:17,920
form it into appropriate amino acids. So basically for every 60 grams of protein an animal eat,

559
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,080
they'll make a hundred grams of essential amino acid, you know, balanced protein.

560
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,280
Wait a minute. Say that again.

561
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,240
So they're basically upside.

562
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,800
Yeah, say that again.

563
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:35,200
So for every 60 grams of plant-based proteins and nitrogen that they'll take in,

564
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:41,200
they can upcycle that to a hundred grams of amino acid balanced protein. So ruminants are

565
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:48,000
called upcyclers. So whether it's in dairy or meats or, you know, also, you know, goats and,

566
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,320
and sheep and, and, and deer, all of those ruminant animals upcycle by eating grasses,

567
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,600
they produce great quality protein. No other animal, no other animal can do that.

568
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,560
And just to make sure I understand the mass balance of that,

569
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:08,640
the bacteria are obviously the engine of that upcycle, but you can't make nitrogen out of

570
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,960
nothing. So you're saying the other four.

571
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,600
But they're making, they're making protein out of nitrogen.

572
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,200
That's right. That's what I was going to say. So they're getting the nitrogen from the fertilizer

573
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,480
that went into the grass.

574
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,720
Not quite. They're getting nitrogen that's inorganic in the plants, but it's not actually in

575
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:31,040
protein forms. And so it's in the fibers and other kinds of things. So they're able to upcycle that.

576
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,520
They're able to increase the value of non-amino acid nitrogen. Plus they capture all of those

577
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,480
other nitrogens.

578
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,360
So first of all, that's fine. I had no idea that was happening. I had,

579
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,040
I had never heard of that phenomenon. So that's incredibly fascinating.

580
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:58,240
Secondly, are they also disproportionately creating amino acids that weren't necessarily

581
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,720
there in the plant? So in other words, if you use the example you gave earlier,

582
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:07,680
which is, you know, you eat a hundred grams of cow protein, you're going to probably get

583
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,680
quite an amount of methionine, lysine and leucine. Is it true that that amount of amino

584
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,280
acid was not even present in the 60 grams of grass protein that they consumed?

585
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:25,600
Exactly. That's exactly what's happening. So the bacteria, if you look at the flora

586
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:34,240
in the cow, they have certain bacteria that will produce methionine or a lysine. So they can

587
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:41,600
basically take a non, you know, an amine nitrogen, or they can take glycine, a non-essential amino

588
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:49,280
acid, and they can make it into, into amino acids. One of the, one of the supplements that you can

589
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:57,360
actually feed a cow is urea. So a human waste product type of thing, we, we excrete nitrogen

590
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:04,800
waste as urea in the urine. You can actually feed urea, a nitrogen source to a cow, and they can

591
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:12,800
make it into methionine or leucine or lysine. Unbelievable. So the, it's an interesting argument,

592
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,080
because you, you know, this gets, now we're not, now we're, now we're venturing from nutrition

593
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:21,040
into religion, but right, there's certainly a group of people who would argue that we should

594
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,600
not be eating any animal protein whatsoever. We shouldn't eat, you know, we shouldn't eat meat,

595
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,800
we shouldn't eat eggs, we shouldn't eat dairy, et cetera. A counter argument to that would be,

596
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:38,000
it's awfully difficult without these animals to get adequate amino acids, especially if you stop

597
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,800
thinking of it in terms of an RDA and start thinking of it in terms of essential amino acids.

598
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,800
I try and stay away from the religious argument of it. That's a, that's a, you know, that's a

599
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,800
personal preference. As you said, I grew up on a farm where we raised cattle and pigs, we raised

600
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,520
corn and soybeans. And so, you know, I saw it as a life cycle type of thing. I think of it as a

601
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,400
biochemist, and there's just no question that ruminant animals play a very important role in

602
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:17,280
our food system. And one we can't really replace. We can't just idle millions of acres of grassland

603
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:25,440
and pretend that we can grow avocados on them or broccoli. You know, cattle basically spend a year

604
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:32,480
of their life on basically nothing but grass. And that is an amazing, you know, and that's an,

605
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,080
and sheep are, you know, sheep and goats the same, but those are amazing contributions to our food

606
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:47,120
system. Yeah. Again, I was completely unaware of this capacity to concentrate and, you know, almost

607
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:54,240
up produce, both in quantity and quality of amino acid. That's, that's a very interesting finding.

608
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,440
So where were we before we went down that path? Because I was just trying to understand how it

609
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:05,680
happened. So, so also didn't appreciate the role of the bacteria. I think we were about to get into,

610
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,200
oh, I know where we can go back to. You mentioned that you have spent some time studying the

611
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:19,040
difference between, call it 20 year olds and 60 year olds in terms of the efficiency of muscle

612
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:24,560
protein synthesis. So, and this is where you probably have to get into the isotopes, right?

613
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:31,920
Now you're getting into sort of nuanced stuff, but what do we know about a 20 year old versus

614
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:38,880
a 60 year old who's under, who puts their muscle under a progressive overload. So they're, they're

615
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,480
now asking, you know, they're, they're, they're doing resistance training. They're being provided

616
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,800
with adequate amino acids. And let's assume they're being provided with not just the right

617
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,920
quantity, but the right quality of amino acid. What do we know about the assimilation of that

618
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,520
amino acid into new muscle tissue across and pick any age you want. I just use 20 and 60,

619
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,160
but I, I know you've studied this at very specific age points.

620
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:11,280
Piece of background before we get into that is important to recognize that whether you're 16 or

621
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:20,320
65 year body needs to make nearly 300 grams of new protein per day. So there's a protein turnover.

622
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:27,360
Every, every tissue in the body is turning over. Some as fast as liver enzymes,

623
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:34,880
we replace every hour muscle proteins, we replace with half-lives of around 15 to 16 days. So

624
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,880
every 30 days, collagen turns over at about half-life of a hundred days, which is why if you

625
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:47,040
hurt your knee, it takes so long to repair it. But basically if you put that into thinking,

626
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:51,600
the body replaces literally every protein in it about four times a year.

627
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:59,760
That's a pretty remarkable number. And then if you think of we have to make 300 grams of new protein

628
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:09,040
per day, the average American intake is around 80 grams or less, women 70, men 90. That means that

629
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:15,920
there's a recycling thing going on. So of every new protein that's getting made in the body,

630
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:23,360
about six out of seven amino acids are getting recycled. All of that sort of feeds into this

631
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,680
process of protein synthesis, protein turnover. And what, remember I said what I was doing with

632
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:36,480
my master's degree, we were studying the age-related changes. What we now know is that as you get older,

633
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:43,760
the efficiency of that protein turnover goes down. So where a 16 year old, you give them a certain

634
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,240
amount of protein, they'll have a very good response. If 65 year old will have maybe no

635
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:58,960
response at all or 10% or something. But what we have learned sort of with the study of leucine and

636
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:06,400
initiation factors and all of that, is that if you give an enriched source of essential amino acids

637
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,600
more protein, you can actually make the adult look just like the 16 year old. So what we know

638
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:20,080
is that the efficiency goes down, but the capacity to respond doesn't. And so what we're

639
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:26,240
now thinking is that what we now know is that if you have a requirement, it's about twice the

640
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:35,120
minimum RDA. So instead of 0.8, it's 1.6 grams per kg. We can get the adult, the 65 year old,

641
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,840
to respond just the same as the 20 year old as far as muscle protein synthesis.

642
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,480
Now, you know, a moment ago, Don, we talked about how it's a slippery slope if you just focus on

643
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:53,600
total protein. So when you say 1.6 grams per kilogram, does this assume it's from a way like

644
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:59,520
product and an animal based product? And if that person says, hey, I'm 65 years old and I'm on a

645
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,280
plant based diet, are you going to say that number is going to need to be higher? So that's a great

646
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:12,800
question and a great way to ask it. What we know is that most people who go to a plant-based diet,

647
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:20,240
a vegetarian diet, decrease both the quantity and the quality. So your point is exactly right. If

648
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:26,080
you're on a plant-based diet, you'll need more protein and that means you'll have to have more

649
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:34,720
calories. But what's the threshold for that? What we would probably argue is that if you have 120

650
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:41,680
grams of protein per day, it probably doesn't matter the distribution between animal and plant

651
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:49,040
because you probably have enough to cover it. Okay. If you're only eating 50 grams of protein

652
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:55,040
per day, then it makes a big difference. You'll never catch up to your essential amino acid needs.

653
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,960
So somewhere between 50 and 120, it depends on what you choose, you know. So, you know, if you're

654
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:07,600
going to be plant-based, you know, have 125 grams of protein per day and you're probably fine.

655
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,640
But if you're going to be vegetarian and you think you're going to get along with 56 grams per day,

656
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,720
you're going to get in trouble. Going back to this difference earlier about the, you know, call it

657
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:24,960
anabolic resistance, right? Between the 65 year old and the 16 year old. The obvious thing that

658
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,200
comes to mind is there's a huge difference in androgen level between those two.

659
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:35,200
Right. What are the other things that might explain this anabolic resistance that I think,

660
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:40,000
by the way, I think it's very interesting that you can overcome that by a higher amount of protein. But

661
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,800
prior to that work around, what else do you think explains anabolic resistance?

662
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:53,360
Clearly the hormone issues are first and foremost. So, you know, I always make the comment that

663
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,760
when you're growing hormones are your friend, they're sort of driving it. And you look at

664
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:07,360
malnutrition in Africa and children will grow on really lousy diets. They may not grow as healthy,

665
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,800
they may not live as long, but there's a survival reproduction nature to that.

666
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,520
Now we switch to talking about healthy aging and I want to live to where my parents, you know,

667
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,200
I want to get to that century mark. Now we talk about healthy aging and now we sort of change the,

668
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,920
we change the criteria that we're looking for. Let's just think about mTOR for a second and

669
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:38,560
try and put that in framework. There are four different signals that regulate mTOR. We've

670
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:48,720
mentioned leucine. We also mentioned insulin. An enzyme, a factor known as AMP kinase, which is

671
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,120
carbohydrate sensitive, is energy sensitive. And then another molecule known as red one,

672
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,600
which is stress sensitive, particularly resistance exercise. So there are four different things,

673
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:08,880
the individual balances. When you're young and growing, insulin and IGF-1 dominates that. And

674
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,200
insulin first and foremost is a growth hormone. And when you stop growing at 25, it ceases to

675
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:20,240
have an effect on protein synthesis and muscle. And so now the shift, the whole thing shifts to

676
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:26,720
protein quality. Protein quality is not nearly as important when the system's dominated by hormones.

677
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,880
And so now what we know is as we get older, we can buffer that loss of the hormones

678
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:40,560
by higher quality protein, mostly leucine and resistance exercise. Those two factors will

679
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,880
balance out the growth issue that young people have, the benefit of the growth part. So that's

680
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,320
the way you have to think about the change in efficiency with aging.

681
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Speaking of aging, at the front end of what you just said, I want to go into that a little bit

682
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:01,440
more. And I think most people will recognize that this is an enormous problem in the developed world.

683
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,040
And we should talk about it through that lens, because I think that's where it's most stark.

684
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,400
But I'm curious as to whether or not you think this could become a problem or even plays a role

685
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:16,720
in childhood obesity rates. So let's talk about what happens to a child that is protein deficient

686
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,400
at the beginning of their life. What is the implication of that later in life?

687
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:33,760
So when I got into protein, John Waterlow and Joel Millward and Peter Garlic and Vernon Young

688
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:40,000
were sort of the godfathers out there that I learned from. And I got involved with some

689
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,840
international malnutrition with the US Agency for International Development USAID project in Morocco.

690
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,360
And so we looked at that, and that led us to doing some animal studies. And basically,

691
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,840
we used the animals to look at malnutrition and recovery. And what we found was that

692
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:07,920
malnutrition, starvation insults early in life would stunt muscle development, basically

693
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,640
limited the DNA development, limited the cellular development, and basically stunted lean mass in

694
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:22,160
the children and in the animals. And if that was stunted, basically what happened is the

695
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:29,600
individual as an adult was always predestined to have low lean body mass and high body fat.

696
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:37,680
Obesity. And that was really the origins of how we started thinking about muscle-centric health.

697
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,600
If muscle didn't develop right, if it wasn't metabolically correct, you were predestined to

698
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,960
some of these other things. And I mentioned Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, and that's sort of how we

699
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,960
put that concept together is muscle-centric health, we've got to have the correct development,

700
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,880
and we have to have the correct protection as adults, because that's kind of where

701
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,240
both your mobility and your metabolic health start.

702
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:09,760
Don, what's the mechanism? Do we have a sense of why, for example, maybe people are aware of this,

703
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:15,200
but when you look at children in places like Africa who are really malnourished,

704
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,680
at first glance, you almost pause and think, well, why are their bellies so big

705
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,880
if they're malnourished? And yet they don't realize that's an extreme, and I don't even

706
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,400
remember, was Quasi-Orcor, was that the name of the- Exactly. Yeah. And what's the pathophysiology

707
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,360
of that? Why does the extreme malnourishment lead to that protruded abdomen and things like that?

708
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,920
So there's sort of two terms, two directions that childhood malnutrition goes. One is called

709
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,760
marasmus, which is sort of the skin and bones look, and the other is Quasi-Orcor, which is that

710
01:15:51,760 --> 01:16:02,480
kind of inflated belly looking. The belief of those two differences is that in Quasi-Orcor,

711
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:09,600
there's disproportionately poor protein, and that leads to changes in water balance and edema.

712
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:17,200
People have argued, is it cortisol based? Is it stress based? But it appears to be an imbalance

713
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:24,880
in the protein to energy relationship, where in marasmus, they're just short of total calories and

714
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:33,920
total protein and everything, but in Quasi-Orcor, it appears that the quality of the protein,

715
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,600
they're eating these starchy porridges and things like that, totally deficient, probably in lysine

716
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:46,720
and methionine, and that leads to water imbalances and other things. And what is it about this

717
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:55,360
critical window of development where this protein deficiency makes it very difficult

718
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:01,120
for them to put on lean mass later in life and creates a propensity for adiposity?

719
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:08,720
So again, we actually did some of that original research, and this was stuff we did way back in

720
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:16,880
the late 70s, early 80s. Muscle is a very unique cell structure. We have what are called muscle

721
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:25,280
fibers, and unlike a liver cell, which has a DNA, a nucleus in each cell, muscle cells are

722
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:34,160
multinucleated. They have what are called satellite cells around them, and so as the original fiber

723
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:41,760
begins to develop, the satellite cells will put DNA, these nuclei into it, and what we determined

724
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:49,280
was that each DNA has a certain amount of protein it can handle, and so what the DNA ultimately

725
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:54,880
determines how big your muscle can get. And so what we determined was that late in pregnancy,

726
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:01,440
early in lactation, if the insult occurs during that, you stunt these satellite cells and you

727
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,400
don't develop enough DNA, so the muscle is always limited in its potential size.

728
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:15,840
Wow. I was aware of the propensity for adiposity later was not aware of the limitation in lean

729
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,560
growth, so this is really the double whammy, right? It's effectively lifetime sarcobesity.

730
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,400
Yeah, so basically you're decreasing your lean mass, you're decreasing your metabolically active

731
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,480
tissue, and so you're sort of stuck with minimal calories with deposit fat.

732
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,440
Now look, in the US it would be hard to imagine a child developing quasiorcor, but clearly there

733
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,520
are kids in the United States that are disadvantaged enough that they're not going to be exposed to high

734
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,600
enough protein in either quality or quantity. Do you think that there's to a lesser extent

735
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,880
some of this problem that's going to happen in developed nations like the US?

736
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:03,360
I think it's possible. Frankly, these are the kinds of things I worry about with the advocates

737
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:10,480
of plant-based diets. We're starting to see New York City taking animal proteins out of school

738
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,800
lunch. I mean, what is that really going to do? We're conducting a public health experiment

739
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:23,360
without actually having any knowledge of that. I think that's frightening, and the issue is

740
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:30,560
public school lunches, nursing homes, daycares, these are all under these federal guidelines

741
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,000
where we're diluting out the quantity and quality of protein at the same time with no knowledge of

742
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,640
what that's really going to mean. I think that's pretty frightening to be doing that kind of public

743
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,920
health experiment without knowledge of it. Yeah, I hadn't even considered it through that lens,

744
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:55,360
actually. Let's talk about something else that we alluded to briefly, but now I want to get back to,

745
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:07,600
which is maximum protein usability or assimilation in a given sitting. I'll tell you where I come at

746
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:15,520
this. One of the challenges that I've observed in taking care of patients is when they get into a

747
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:21,440
very heavy regimen of time-restricted feeding. You're probably aware of this, Don, but there

748
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:27,200
are ideas that say, look, if you can just limit the amount of time that you eat, but not place

749
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,080
any limits on what you eat or how much you eat or what you're eating from into this sort of intermittent

750
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:38,640
fasting window, it produces some health benefits. It's certainly an effective way to reduce calories.

751
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:45,360
If the goal of the exercise is to reduce total energy expenditure and you create a narrow enough

752
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:53,920
window, you will indeed do that. But what we've seen repeatedly is people who, after, say, six

753
01:20:53,920 --> 01:21:01,280
months of adopting a very narrow feeding window, say one meal a day, will lose weight, but

754
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:09,200
disproportionately will lose lean tissue. And so the diagnosis here is pretty straightforward,

755
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:15,520
they clearly reduced energy intake, but they probably reduced protein intake too much.

756
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,400
And so body composition actually got worse despite the fact that weight went down,

757
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,880
which then gets to a point, which is, well, can't you just eat all of your protein in one meal? So

758
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,520
if a person says, I'm just going to eat one meal a day, and let's just say this is a very active

759
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,200
person, so they're going to eat 3000 calories in one sitting, which I will raise my hand to saying,

760
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:46,640
I can do that quite easily, I'm quite a glutton. Even if I was able to eat 150 grams of protein in

761
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:54,080
one sitting, is it clear that my body will get the benefit from that, that it would if I ate 50

762
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:01,040
grams three times a day? Yeah, it's quite clear that you won't get a benefit, that there is a limit.

763
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:07,920
So now we need to think about the body as muscle versus everything else. So we're going back to the

764
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:15,360
muscle-centric view that I like. Yeah, you're probably sensing a theme with me at this point.

765
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:24,160
The muscle, there's a lot of data now that muscle can handle protein meals for an optimum

766
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:35,440
anabolic response between about 25 and maybe 60 grams. So then you start getting into distribution.

767
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:40,320
If you think you're going to have 150 grams per day, how should you distribute it?

768
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:51,360
One of my pet peeves in nutrition, I'm slightly getting off track here, is people refer to protein

769
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:57,680
as a percentage of calories. Protein is not a percentage of calories, protein is an absolute

770
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:02,560
number. You need to decide on what you're going to build your diet around. So right now we're

771
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:10,800
building it on 150. The issue with protein is being an absolute number, if your calories go down,

772
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:19,040
say you're now a 75-year-old woman and your calories per day is now 1200 calories, you still

773
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:26,800
have 100 grams per day protein requirement. So now your protein needs are 35 to 40% of your calories.

774
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:32,640
If people are doing weight loss, it's an absolute number. So people should never talk about

775
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:39,600
percentage of calories. That's basically people who don't think protein is important and say,

776
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:47,680
well, fat should be 30%, carbohydrates should be 50%, and that leaves 15%. I mean, you have to think

777
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:56,720
about protein first. So that was the issue. As far as distribution, from my research, one of the

778
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:02,080
things that we believe is that the most critical meal of the day is the first meal of the day.

779
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:10,160
When you have had an overnight fast, your protein synthesis is down and that mTOR signal molecule

780
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:16,800
is down regulated. It's inhibited. And until you have enough leucine around three grams,

781
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:24,480
which translates to about 30 grams of protein for most people, until you have a meal that has

782
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:30,800
30 or more grams of protein, your muscle stays catabolic. So you're continually breaking down

783
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:37,680
protein. We think that's a significant aspect of aging, that people have lower and lower protein,

784
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:43,680
they don't eat protein at breakfast. And we know the efficiency is going down in the first place.

785
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:51,040
So we want a front load protein in the day. So we want at least two meals that are well above 30

786
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:59,520
grams of protein. So I always have people shooting for 40, 45 at the first meal, another 45, 45 at

787
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:10,720
their last meal. And then in between, again, if we're talking with people who are, say, an elderly

788
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,800
woman trying to maintain minimal muscle, I'll concentrate on those two meals. If I'm talking

789
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,600
with somebody who's trying to do weight loss, I'll concentrate on three because I don't want

790
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:27,200
them getting hungry. If I'm talking with someone who's trying to be hypertrophy, a muscle builder,

791
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:34,720
I'll concentrate on four. So how many meals per day do I make anabolic and muscle? And by anabolic,

792
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,920
I'm thinking 35 grams or more. And the data that we know for absolute certain is the first and last

793
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:49,040
meal are absolutely important. The middle meal, I'd be hard pressed to show you a single study

794
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:55,520
that where anybody's ever looked at lunch. And so the reason that you're saying for the anabolic

795
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,560
person, we need four meals is we just simply need, we know we need it for positive nitrogen balance.

796
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,960
We're just going to have to get the, yeah. Right. So there's two, there's two aspects. There's one

797
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:11,280
is mTOR signaling muscle protein synthesis, leucine effects, and the other is total protein per day.

798
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:18,640
So those two lead say, well, if I need more protein and I max out at 50 grams, I need another meal.

799
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:25,840
And what about timing? So let's just talk about someone who's doing their strength training

800
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:31,280
in the morning. So let's say someone's going to do strength training from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.

801
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,720
Do you want them having that first bolus of protein before the workout?

802
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:45,120
There's some debate about that. You'll find some people and trainers who believe that. We did some

803
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:51,360
studies and most of them were with animals where we looked at different timing. And we find that

804
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:58,000
exhaustive exercise is catabolic no matter what. So having protein ahead of it doesn't make it.

805
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,840
So we find the benefit is after the exercise when the system is now finally tuned, we've

806
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:12,560
stimulated red, actually we've inhibited red one, the system mTOR is ready to go. So we find

807
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:18,720
the benefit is after exercise, not before. And just to be clear, what you're saying is, look,

808
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:24,000
you can take all those amino acids before, but it's not going to prevent you from becoming

809
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,280
catabolic during exercise because, again, exhaustive exercise is a catabolic activity.

810
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,320
So you are going to be breaking down muscle no matter how many amino acids are on board

811
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:40,880
while lifting. It's more important after the lift that you have a good meal.

812
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:48,080
You'll find some disagreement in that in the literature, but I strongly believe that what you

813
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:56,160
just said is correct. And my research supports that. And talk about the efficiency or the window

814
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:03,520
in time post a workout in which you want to make sure you're getting that first big meal of protein.

815
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:09,920
Is it one of those things? I'll tell you a funny story. So my youngest son, who's now five,

816
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,600
but when he was like three, I mean, I don't know, for whatever reason, he just fixated on protein,

817
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,000
probably because we kept telling him to eat this and eat that because there was protein in it.

818
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,120
Hey, eat your salmon. It's got protein. Eat this because it's got protein. And basically, he has

819
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:31,360
become the protein police of the preschool. So he just he walks around and he looks at kids' snacks

820
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:37,680
and he's like, that doesn't have protein. That granola bar does not have protein. That has protein.

821
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,120
And you can imagine what these people who work at the preschool say to my wife when she drops him

822
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:49,440
off and picks him up. She's like, are you a nutritionist? And she says, no. Oh, OK. It's just,

823
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:55,360
you know, your son really fixates on everybody's protein consumption. So we joke about how he's

824
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:00,640
going to be like that, like one of those bro protein guys who's just going to be all obsessed

825
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:06,480
with his protein and when he's eating it and stuff like that. So I've lost our train of thought here

826
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:11,440
for a minute. But just to focus on the children for a moment. So we're talking about

827
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,440
adult protein needs. And I don't want everybody to walk away thinking,

828
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:22,640
gee, I need to get 50 grams of protein in my kid. Children, children will be very efficient at

829
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:29,360
maintaining growth with small snacks of eight to 10 grams of protein where that will have virtually

830
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:37,520
no impact for an older adult. So, you know, a protein bar that had 10 grams of protein is

831
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:43,280
a perfectly legitimate snack for a child where essentially the only thing it would do is probably

832
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:49,040
increase liver enzymes at a 70 year old. So don't want all the mothers think that they're doing a

833
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:54,000
bad thing by giving their child a 10 gram protein snack. OK. I want to go into, I remember what we

834
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,360
were going to come back to. So I'll take us back there. But let's talk about that a bit more. So

835
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,040
because that's actually news to me. I didn't realize that there was

836
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:08,640
minimal benefit in smaller quantities of protein. So this is another argument for don't dribble out

837
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,840
your protein. Commit to it's binary. You eat it when you eat it and you don't when you don't.

838
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:23,440
Yeah. So again, children versus adults and the adult. If we have every meal of the day,

839
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:30,400
let's say we have 100 grams of protein, but we take it in and very small meals, 15 grams

840
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,560
trickled in all day long. You will never stimulate muscle protein synthesis, but your liver will be

841
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:42,880
perfectly fine. Your gut will respond to that amount of protein, your gut, your liver, your heart,

842
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:49,360
your kidney. All of those organs will respond to the net protein per day, no matter when you

843
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:56,240
ate it. But muscle doesn't. Muscle is specific. Muscle is such an energy. As you mentioned earlier,

844
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:02,720
there's so much mass to muscle muscle isn't triggered unless the diet is exactly right.

845
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:07,440
And we could get into teleological arguments about losing at this point,

846
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:14,880
branch chain amino acid. Why does the muscle sense that? But basically the muscle senses energy,

847
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,640
insulin, protein before it triggers. And if all of those aren't balanced, it won't trigger,

848
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:26,080
but your liver will. Yeah. I mean, I guess to your point, teleologically, you might make the case

849
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:33,840
that the liver has more concern for the brain than the skeletal muscle. And maybe it gets priority

850
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,400
over being happy because it has to maintain glucose homeostasis. And without glucose

851
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:45,040
homeostasis, the brain would literally die within 20 minutes. So yeah, I guess. Likewise,

852
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,520
you know, your liver, your heart, those have to function, you know, middle of the night, your

853
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,960
liver still has to be making protein, but your muscle doesn't. While you're laying there in bed,

854
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,480
your muscle is catabolic and it's supplying amino acids. So all those other organs work.

855
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:08,720
So while I argue about muscle centric health, the reality is moment, the moment it's organ based.

856
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:14,720
Yeah. But long term, your overall health is determined on keeping the muscle healthy

857
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,800
because it keeps everything else healthy. And just because I want to keep talking about this

858
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,720
before we go back to where we were before I distracted us, is the reason that it's okay

859
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,600
for kids to be, you know, eaten little bit, much smaller amounts of protein. Is it simply just the

860
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:36,800
mass that, you know, like, I mean, my youngest weighs 25 kilograms. So is it basically just saying,

861
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:43,200
look, he probably doesn't need more than 40 grams of protein a day. So for him to have a 10

862
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:47,920
grams serving is 25% of his protein. That's like me having 40 grams.

863
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:54,320
And plus his protein synthesis, as we mentioned earlier, is driven by hormones where yours isn't.

864
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:01,680
So his growth, his growth is highly efficient. It's driven by hormones and he he'll, he'll

865
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:07,360
accommodate it in small doses. And you're right. He probably only needs 45 for the day anyway.

866
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,000
So I'll take you back to where we were before I sidetracked us. It was now asking about

867
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:19,680
how big a window you have to refeed to maximize muscle growth.

868
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:28,240
So, so we actually did that first experiment in rats. So Josh Anthony and Tracy Anthony were in

869
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:35,440
my lab. Uh, I was just before Lane came. Uh, and what we were looking at was exhaustive exercise,

870
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:42,400
again, erodins. We were looking at this catabolic state. We were trying to look at how to muscle

871
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:49,440
regulated recovery. And so we were looking at what we're called initiation factors. And we discovered

872
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:56,960
the link between leucine and an initiation factor called EIF4. That is sort of the downstream

873
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:04,960
effect of mTOR. mTOR is a regulator and it stimulates EIF4 and S6 and other initiation

874
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:10,400
factors. And so what we found was that when you came out of an exhaustive exercise,

875
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:17,040
muscle is catabolic until you took in enough leucine to reverse it. And so we started looking

876
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,560
at feeding right after exercise and Stu Phillips and a number, you know, Doug Patton Jones and

877
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:29,280
Luke Van Lee, a lot of people sort of picked up on that. Um, okay. So now the caveats, um,

878
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,200
the biggest effect of feeding right afterwards is about a two hour window,

879
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:44,160
but that's in untrained individuals. Um, if you begin to look longer, you can have a ballot of

880
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:49,760
resistance exercise and you'll detect the difference. You'll begin to make them, you'll

881
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:56,160
start regulating that red one protein factor and you'll see an anabolic effect the next day,

882
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:01,920
24 hours, 36 hours later. So when does your protein effect, well, it makes it more effective

883
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:09,360
all the time. Um, the more trained you get, the less you're going to see a post exercise effect.

884
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:15,040
So if you're beginning training near in the first four weeks, post exercise protein probably makes

885
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:21,120
sense. If you're well trained, you basically training the same way and you've been doing it

886
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:27,520
for six months, I don't see any effect difference between having protein within two hours after

887
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,880
exercise versus just having your three or four meals per day. You won't see any difference in

888
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,160
either mass or strength. Yeah. I remember having this discussion with Lane as well and being very

889
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:43,200
surprised by that, right? Being pleasantly surprised by the way, because it says, Hey,

890
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,520
look, once you get to a point where you're well trained enough, you don't have to be so maniacal

891
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:54,880
about meal timing. You can just focus on the big picture, which is total protein, protein quality,

892
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:01,360
and spreading it out such that you don't exceed the metabolizable fraction of it at anyone sitting.

893
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:06,880
Right. Exactly. And people, you'll hear trainers take that last statement, metabolizable energy,

894
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,360
and you'll hear trainers say, well, you can't use more than 30 grams at a meal. You won't digest

895
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,320
it or whatever. That's not true. I mean, you'll digest and absorb a hundred grams of protein at

896
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:24,320
a meal, but muscle in particular only has a window of around 25 to 60, depending on protein

897
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:31,680
quality where it can use it. The liver will use all of it. I mean, it doesn't matter. We have what

898
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:37,120
is known as first pass metabolism of protein, which confuses the issue even more.

899
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:46,640
When you eat a meal of protein, approximately 50% of the protein is degraded to nitrogen and carbon

900
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:53,040
before it ever gets to the blood, almost 50%. The one exception, the exception of that are the

901
01:36:53,040 --> 01:37:00,640
branch chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and over almost 75, 80% of those get

902
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:06,240
into the blood. And we're back to that teleological argument. Why did muscle learn to sense that?

903
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:11,760
Because that basically shows up in the blood in direct proportion to the meal. And the muscle

904
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,080
learned to sense that as a meal quality. It says, oh wow, this meal has adequate quality for me to

905
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:25,120
trigger this very expensive process of protein synthesis, protein turnover. And until it sees

906
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:31,520
that signal, it won't do it. While we're on the topic of muscle done, another thing I've learned

907
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:40,640
somewhat recently that surprised me was the importance of leucine in fatty acid oxidation

908
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:46,640
by the muscle. So one of the things that is such an important pillar of our practice is

909
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:54,240
kind of low end aerobic training. We call it zone two. So zone two, mitochondrial efficiency. So this

910
01:37:54,240 --> 01:38:02,880
is basically pushing your muscles to the maximum point at which you can keep lactate below two

911
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,120
millimole. And in a very fit individual, that you can generate a lot of power while still keeping

912
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:14,800
lactate below two millimole. I mean, the best in the world can produce more than four watts per

913
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:22,240
kilo while still keeping lactate below two millimole. And they're doing so virtually exclusively with

914
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:29,840
fatty acid. So we will pair this type of analysis with CPET testing and we will look at fat oxidation

915
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:36,000
rates. And again, you will see the fittest of the fit have insanely high fat oxidation rates.

916
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,560
They're over a gram or roughly a gram per minute. So tell me, so another point of that is, look,

917
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:51,840
a really good muscle doesn't just rely on glucose. A really good muscle can oxidize fats

918
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:57,680
very effectively. What role does leucine play in that? That's a great question. And

919
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:05,520
I don't think it's been researched well enough, but there's no question. So leucine, I mentioned

920
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,640
earlier, we're talking about amino acids and every amino acid has a different side chain.

921
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:17,040
Well, leucine is one that's referred to as a branch chain amino acid and its side chain is purely

922
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,960
carbons. It's a carbon chain that looks a lot like a fatty acid. And so leucine is one of

923
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:32,080
really two amino acids that are ketogenic. It is metabolized as a fatty acid. And what we know

924
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:38,720
is that leucine will also activate the CPT-1 enzyme, the carnityl palmitin

925
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:45,120
transphrase enzyme, which is the link of bringing fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation.

926
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:53,600
So there's a benefit there. It gets even more complicated in that when you have higher leucine,

927
01:39:53,600 --> 01:40:05,200
it also begins to inhibit pyruvate from going into the mitochondria. So when you oxidize a leucine,

928
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:12,080
the nitrogen that comes off of it is put onto pyruvate generating an alanine. And so the body

929
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:18,880
begins to recycle glucose. So it becomes kind of steady state on glucose and emphasizes fat

930
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:25,520
oxidation. So back when you were talking about Schulman studies early, if you overload all of that,

931
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:32,160
basically you can make the leucine inhibit carbohydrate oxidation. So if you have huge

932
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:37,920
amounts of carbs coming in, and then you overload the system with leucine, you'll inhibit pyruvate

933
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,520
oxidation. And so that could look like insulin resistance. But if you look at the physiology

934
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:50,560
of how it's supposed to work under conditions where you'd be burning fat, like you just described,

935
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,880
leucine actually stimulates fat oxidation and spares glucose for the brain and other tissues.

936
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:04,480
So again, you really have to think about how the experiment's set up and what's getting inhibited

937
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:12,240
and what's getting pushed. Now you've recently actually taken an interest in weight loss, right?

938
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:16,880
So the dietary interventions that can be efficacious for weight loss and treating

939
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:22,480
things like metabolic syndrome. So let's build off this idea a little bit, but how do you incorporate

940
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:30,880
the strategy around reducing energy intake? Because this is sort of how I think about weight

941
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:36,160
loss, right? Like you got to reduce the intake, but I think of three broad ways that you can

942
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,400
approach that. So three strategies, right? One is you just reduce calories and that becomes the only

943
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:48,880
focus. So you pay attention to the total energy content of food without thinking about the timing

944
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:54,400
of food or the macro distribution of food. The next approach is you spend less time thinking

945
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,560
about the total number of calories, spend more time thinking about the macro nutrients, create,

946
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,800
I described it as sort of create a boogeyman in the diet, some things that you avoid

947
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,040
and the restriction of certain things becomes a roundabout way to restrict total energy.

948
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:17,360
And then we talked about time restriction as well as another strategy. So how do you think

949
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:24,800
about manipulating that middle bucket of changing macros to achieve energy deficit?

950
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:31,520
So I totally agree. Weight management is a calorie issue and it's not the same for every

951
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,160
individual. Everybody's got a little different efficiency. So we understand it's not,

952
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,760
you can't be an accountant and expect to just count calories all the time. But

953
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:50,880
let me build it as a story of how we thought about it. Back in the late 90s,

954
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,920
the keto, you know, Atkins and the keto diet were out there and Barry Sears and protein,

955
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:04,000
you know, the zone diet and Michael Eads and the protein power. And I was looking at all of those

956
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,720
things and we were doing those leucine experiments and we had discovered this effect of leucine on

957
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:18,400
muscle protein turnover and some of these metabolic things with fat metabolism. And I basically

958
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:24,240
took the leap of faith and said, you know, I think the underpinning of all of these diets is really

959
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:30,880
the protein carb ratio. And how can we manipulate that? And so I started thinking, well, you know,

960
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:37,200
if we're going to create diets, one, we know that from a satiety standpoint, protein is probably the

961
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:44,160
most satiating, you know, lures fat would be next carbohydrate, the least. We were concerned

962
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:50,720
about big insulin swings. So we wanted to sort of balance out our carbs per meal. We know that if

963
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:58,000
people are overweight, they tend to have big post-carb, post-meal carbohydrate and insulin swings

964
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,240
where they get two hours later, they'll have insulin low carbohydrate lows. And so we started

965
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:09,280
trying to think about that and we said, okay, so we think the first meal after an overnight fast

966
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:15,280
is critical. So we're going to correct that. So we basically started saying, how much protein do you

967
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:24,640
need 30, 40 grams of protein to get most satiety protein synthesis effects? We knew that protein

968
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:30,960
had a higher thermogenic effect, burns more calories, more heat than either carb or fat.

969
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,920
So we wanted to front load that effect. People have argued that, well, that's because protein

970
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:41,120
or the nitrogen, it's harder to digest and absorb. We don't think that's true at all. We think the

971
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:47,920
thermogenic effect is stimulating muscle protein synthesis. We know that that is a massive ATP

972
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:54,800
expenditure. And so what we want to do is maximize that at every meal. So our first meal, we wanted

973
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:00,800
to be 40 grams of protein. We wanted to have a carb level that would not overstimulate insulin.

974
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,960
We kept that under around 30 grams for what we created a carbohydrate threshold concept.

975
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:13,280
We could go into and then fat sort of around out the calories. And we basically developed three

976
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:23,120
meals a day to distribute like that. We basically increased the protein to about 1.6 grams per kg.

977
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:29,360
And we ran the study comparing it to the food guide pyramid with 0.8. So as far as we could tell,

978
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:34,960
we did three different studies. One, a total feeding study where we fed everyone. A second

979
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:40,560
study would diet and exercise that was four months. And a third study was multi-centered

980
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:47,120
with 120 subjects that lasted 16 months. And so we did three studies and what we saw-

981
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:53,200
The last two were free living where they were responsible for the food, but the first one,

982
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:53,840
they were fed?

983
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,800
The first one, we fed them in the lab so we knew exactly what they were eating.

984
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:04,880
The second one, we actually fed them for the first two weeks for a few meals so they really

985
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:10,640
saw what it would look like. And the last one was totally free living based on the diets and

986
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,800
manuals that we developed.

987
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:17,680
And each of these was two arms where the only difference was protein?

988
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:25,440
So in the first one, it was two arms, food guide pyramid, high carb, low protein versus

989
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:31,760
higher protein, low carb. The second one was two by two. So we basically had the diet treatment

990
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:40,080
and then we had a resistance exercise treatment. So high protein, low exercise, high protein,

991
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:47,920
et cetera. And then the last one was diet with a generic recommendation for exercise, but just

992
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,120
a two treatments.

993
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:52,160
So what did the first experiment show, the really well controlled one?

994
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:58,800
So the well controlled one, what we found was that with the higher protein and as far as we

995
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:04,960
could measure exactly the same calorie intake, the people on the higher protein, low carb,

996
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:12,160
lost more total weight, more total fat and less lean. And that stabilized their insulin and

997
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:17,440
glycemic regulations and lowered their triglycerides across the board.

998
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:25,280
And do you remember what the difference was in weight and fat mass? And was it all explained

999
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,520
by the thermodynamics of the Delt difference in protein?

1000
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:39,680
It was close. We found that based on, if you just, if you assume that body fat is

1001
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:48,960
3,500 calories and you can make that calculation, we figured out that the people on the higher

1002
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:55,120
protein diet were getting a better fit of, I think it was around 170 calories a day,

1003
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:00,560
eating the same calories. So that could be about the thermodynamic effect.

1004
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,680
So in other words, that amount spread out over the duration of the study explained the difference

1005
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,320
in weight loss.

1006
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,800
Right. So both groups lost weight. They were both on weight loss diets, but the protein people lost,

1007
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:22,400
and I didn't look those numbers up, but they lost around eight pounds more and almost all of,

1008
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,160
you know, something like, you know, six and a half of it was fat.

1009
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:32,560
And did they also complain less of hunger or was there a difference subjectively between the groups?

1010
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:40,560
Yeah. We did, we did a satiety check in that really just a,

1011
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:49,360
using an analog scale. We just asked them to rate how they felt and stuff. And one of the things that

1012
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:54,240
the dietitians who were running the study always came back as they said that the, the protein

1013
01:48:54,240 --> 01:49:00,720
people were never talking about food and snacks, but the people on the high carb diet were always

1014
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,760
talking about being hungry and snacking. And so yeah, there's definitely a different satiety

1015
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:14,480
and compliance issue to it. And the fat was longer in that study in the longer term studies in the

1016
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:19,760
first study, which was only 12 weeks, basically all subjects in both groups finished the study

1017
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:25,920
and the longer studies would got into four months and longer. We found much higher dropout rates in

1018
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,600
the high carb group too. So did the results of all three studies point in the same direction,

1019
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:37,120
which was a higher protein weight loss. So a protein sparing weight loss diet,

1020
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,560
which gets back to your point earlier, stop thinking about protein as a percent of total

1021
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,280
calories. Protein should always be absolute. And if you want to think about it that way,

1022
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,200
it's actually, it should, as, as you reduce calories, protein should increase the total

1023
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:57,680
fraction of calories. Right. Is going to preserve lean tissue better, maintain satiety better. And

1024
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:03,280
plus there's potentially this bonus of the thermogenic effect of protein. Right. It definitely

1025
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:09,680
partitions the weight loss toward fat, protects muscle, malign tissue, definitely has higher

1026
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:17,200
satiety. You know, and one of the things we know, and in fact, for a long time, there was a lot of

1027
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:22,640
debate whether people over 60 should ever try practice weight loss because they would lose too

1028
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:29,200
much muscle and they can't gain it back. Um, you know, they're Doug Patton Jones had the theory that

1029
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,840
sarcopenic aging isn't a gradual decline. It's a series of acute effects that you injure yourself.

1030
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,880
You're in bed. You're, you have a surgery, whatever you acutely lose lean mass and you

1031
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,840
can never gain it back. So we were concerned about that. We want, we want weight loss,

1032
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,880
but we don't want people to lose any lean mass, especially if they're adults. If you're a 20 year

1033
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,760
old, it probably doesn't matter so much. But if you're older, you know, if you're beyond 40,

1034
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,640
it does matter. It's a scary thought, Don, if you think about it, right? I mean,

1035
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:09,280
that 40 40 is not that old. And yet, um, you know, I recently had shoulder surgery. Uh, so as with

1036
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,120
the time that we're recording this, I'm probably about five months out from that shoulder surgery.

1037
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:20,800
And, um, I still have not gained back all of the, the, the muscle mass. Now I think I will gain it

1038
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:30,640
back. Um, but I look at how difficult it has been and how acutely I lost it. I mean, within three

1039
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:40,000
weeks, I was 10 pounds lighter. I lost 10 pounds of body weight. And it's obviously not just from

1040
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:45,280
the shoulder. It's when you don't have an arm, you can't squat, you can't deadlift, you can't

1041
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:50,800
do all of these other things. So I would bet that, you know, obviously some of that was water weight,

1042
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:56,640
but look, I think seven of those 10 pounds was lean tissue that I lost in, in a span of three weeks.

1043
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,640
There's some tremendous research by my colleague, Doug Patton Jones, who unfortunately passed away

1044
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:09,520
this last year, um, who did a lot of that kind of bed rest sort of study and looking at older adults

1045
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:16,080
versus younger. And in the same period of time, an older adult in bed rest will lose four times as

1046
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:22,080
much muscle as a younger adult. It's, it's frightening how fast you can lose it. And you

1047
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:27,360
know, to your point, if you're diligent and do weight training, you can begin to gain it back,

1048
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:33,360
but it's hard to ever get back to ground zero if you lose it in aging. And people will ask me, well,

1049
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,720
all this losing stuff, when does it really come into play? You know, is it as, it's not as important

1050
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:43,280
for a 20 year old as it is for 60, but where's the middle ground? You know, where does it change?

1051
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,200
And I think it's a little like bone health. I think once you're, once you're 40, you're sort of

1052
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:55,040
on the back end of that and you need to be much more careful. Doug and I ran a study, which,

1053
01:52:55,040 --> 01:53:00,480
you know, everybody quotes now where we took 90 grams of protein and looked at it distributed

1054
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:08,480
as three meals per day, 30, 30, 30 versus 10, 20, 60. Uh, and we found that with the same amount

1055
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:14,640
of protein, the same overall diet, uh, you would have higher net protein synthesis with the

1056
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:20,400
distribution to breakfast. So that's kind of where all the distribution data came from was that

1057
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:29,120
study. And, uh, we ran that study in 37 year olds. The average age was 37. So we think that by mid

1058
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:34,320
thirties, you can detect the distribution effects. And just to be clear, Don, do you think that the

1059
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:42,720
reason 30, 30, 30 was better than 10, 20, 60 because you started the day at 30 or because you

1060
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:48,720
had three meals where you cleared the hepatic threshold? That's a great question. And one that

1061
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:54,480
I wish the Twitter world would understand. I think the effect is moving at the breakfast,

1062
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:59,040
the first meal. I think that frankly, we'd have been better off if we ran this. You should have

1063
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,040
done it 60, 20, 10 as the other arm, right? That would be there. No, I think it should, I think it

1064
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:12,320
should have been, I think it should have been 40. What's the math? 40, 10, 40. I think the first

1065
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:17,920
and last meals are the key. Okay. The, and I'll give you the reason for that. We've done a number

1066
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:25,280
of studies in animals. Uh, other people, Mike Renee and, and, uh, Phil Atherton have done it in humans,

1067
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:32,720
but when you trigger mTOR at that first meal, we know that it's still stimulated five hours later.

1068
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:39,520
So why do you need lucine for mTOR at lunch? If it's still stimulated, you don't. So there's,

1069
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:45,120
nobody has actually studied that at this point. Unless you're the person who just is so big,

1070
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:49,760
you know, like your lane, right? Like if your lane and your weight, 200 pounds and you're a body

1071
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:55,760
builder. But the key to what you just said is now you're talking total protein per day, not a

1072
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:01,520
lucine effect. Yes, exactly. It's no, it's not a lucine and mTOR effect. It's total substrate.

1073
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:09,680
It's okay. Lane needs 250 grams of protein per day. He'd be better off putting that in four or

1074
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:15,840
five meals than putting it in two. So that's the difference that people need to understand is that

1075
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,120
distributing across all the meals, if it's for weight loss and appetite, that's great,

1076
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:28,320
but it's not an mTOR effect. So Don, this kind of brings me to sort of, you know, something we've

1077
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:33,200
talked about before, which is, you know, so much of this research that you've done has been funded

1078
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:38,960
by industry. And a lot of people are going to say, well, we're going to discount everything Don just

1079
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:45,200
said, because, you know, so give us the names of some of the organizations that have funded your

1080
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:53,600
work over the last four decades. So, so let me backdrop that for you. So I had the lucine concept

1081
01:55:53,600 --> 01:56:00,480
that lucine was going to be key to protein synthesis and muscle. We ran a study in the early 80s

1082
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:08,320
where we realized it was initiation effect. And so we then started to realize we started looking

1083
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:14,640
for what those initiation factors were going to be and it's EIF4. So we sent that as a proposal

1084
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:22,160
to NIH, National Institute of Health for 10 years. And basically it was continuously turned down

1085
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:28,560
and they said, well, we only study disease and we don't know of any deficiencies of protein. So it's

1086
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:36,880
not a priority to us. And so basically I was left with what turned out to be a revolutionary idea

1087
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:44,960
of reinventing protein that NIH wouldn't fund. And basically I finally went to Kraft Foods,

1088
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:52,560
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Dairy Association, the American Egg Board,

1089
01:56:54,160 --> 01:57:01,280
and some of the other groups who were inherently interested in protein and they fund and we had

1090
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:07,760
some from the USDA, I was at a land grant university. So those were the funding sources

1091
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:17,040
that basically unlocked all of this knowledge about protein for adults, lucine, mTOR, muscle

1092
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:22,560
centric health, all of that was unlocked simply because we could get funding from Kraft and Beef.

1093
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:31,360
And, you know, am I biased? You know, everybody who eats is biased in some way. And, you know, if you

1094
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:38,720
look at research, and I think maybe Lane said this with you, I never believe research when I read it

1095
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:45,280
until I see it in three more labs. So I don't mind if people look at my research and say, I don't

1096
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:51,680
believe it, but my research has been out there, very clear theories for 20 years now and every test

1097
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:57,600
makes it stronger. And so that's how you believe it. The fact that Kraft or Beef funded it's

1098
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:03,520
irrelevant. The issue is everybody who's ever run the study after me shows the exactly same thing.

1099
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:09,920
Do you think NIH has, or have you seen, I know you've been, you know, semi-retired now,

1100
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:14,400
you're kind of not really retired, but you're retired from the grant cycle.

1101
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,080
Exactly.

1102
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:21,440
But do you have colleagues that are still in it or do you see any evidence that NIH has taken a

1103
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:27,600
broader purview to health? If nothing else, they should be able to look at the fact that

1104
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:33,760
two thirds of Americans are, you know, have metabolic syndrome. And that should at least

1105
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:40,240
give pause to think we might need to revisit the way we're approaching nutrition. And therefore,

1106
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:45,280
maybe we should be funding, quote, unquote, non-diseased research in nutrition.

1107
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:51,840
I think they definitely have. Chris Lynch, who's director of nutrition at NIH now,

1108
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,320
that position didn't even exist.

1109
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,480
And where does that, within NIDDK, where does that sit?

1110
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:04,240
That's a great question. I think it's across multiple institutes. So which one actually funds

1111
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:13,840
the most? I think NIDDK might be the one. The Cancer Institute, I think his unit actually

1112
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:21,840
goes across multiple institutes. But again, that didn't exist back in the late 80s, early 90s.

1113
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:30,480
So, you know, I think it may be a little broader, but there is a general philosophy still at NIH

1114
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:39,760
that NIH does not do applied food research, that industry should fund it. So that becomes a cash 22.

1115
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:44,240
You know, if we're going to study the difference between whey and soy,

1116
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:50,880
unless you can say, well, that's going to cure heart disease, they're not going to fund it.

1117
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:57,920
And so you have to then go to the dairy council and say, I want to do this study. And then people

1118
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:02,480
say, well, you were funded by the dairy council, or I'd go to the soy board or whatever.

1119
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:08,880
So it's a catch 22. But basically the alternative is we put our head in the sand and we don't do the

1120
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:17,040
research. So basically, I look at people in nutrition right now. And literally, I don't know

1121
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:22,800
anybody in nutrition who doesn't get industry funding. I just simply how you have to get funded.

1122
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:30,560
Yeah. One of the things I would also point out in this whole issue of bias,

1123
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:37,920
it's important to recognize that the animal commodities are all under the USDA supervision

1124
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:44,960
because they are animal commodities and they have check off boards. So that means everything

1125
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:52,000
they say in advertising has to be screened, where the grain industry has big companies like Kellogg's

1126
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:58,240
and Pillsbury and Coke and Pepsi. And they can literally go out and say anything they want.

1127
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:07,200
And so you'll see a product out there that pretends to be an egg. And they'll claim that

1128
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:14,480
there's better than eggs, but egg can't come back and refute it. They can't say, so you've got two

1129
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:19,840
different playing fields, one that's highly restricted and supervised and the other which

1130
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:24,640
is fair game, you know, for, you know, First Amendment, I can say anything I want.

1131
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:31,040
On that topic, Don, how closely have you paid attention to kind of both the plant-based meat

1132
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:36,960
and the synthetic meats? I've paid a little bit of attention because obviously there's two companies

1133
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:42,480
that are pretty popular. I can never remember their names. I think it's Beyond Meat and Impossible

1134
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:47,680
Meat or something like that. Exactly. Got it. And they're plant-based meats, right? So they're making

1135
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:51,920
meat out of plant. And then you have a whole host of companies, none of whom I can remember the names

1136
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:57,600
of, that are actually trying to make synthetic meat. The little bit that I've read about that,

1137
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:03,280
which really amounts to reading like two scientific articles, left me with the impression that that

1138
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:10,960
will not be technically feasible. That just from an energetics cost, mass balance,

1139
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:18,480
sanitation, GMP standpoint, that's not going to happen. So that's my way of saying either I'll

1140
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:25,040
be proven wrong or that will turn out to be one of the biggest boondoggles of industry in some time.

1141
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:32,160
Do you have thoughts on either of those two, including kind of nutritional composition and

1142
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:39,280
how it feeds into an amino acid perspective? First, as an overview, I think that as the world

1143
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:46,160
continues to expand in population, we're probably going to need additional protein sources. We may

1144
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:54,320
be near our capacity for animal-based proteins. I mean, we may not be able, I don't think we can

1145
02:02:54,320 --> 02:03:00,400
double it again. So we may be near, so we're going to need other sources. So I accept that

1146
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:06,320
plant-based proteins are important to us. I totally agree with your comment about synthetic

1147
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:12,560
proteins. I don't think that will ever be economically or environmentally feasible.

1148
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:20,080
I don't think that's true. Then we get into sort of the popular versions of plant-based

1149
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:27,280
Beyond Burgers and things like that. And the reality is it looks like a flash in a pan. I

1150
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:34,480
mean, people tried it. And basically, if you go to a Burger King and look, basically, they had

1151
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:39,440
good sales for a few months. And basically, and you track that, it was all people who don't

1152
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:43,600
normally go to Burger King. It was people who were interested in a plant-based burger. They went

1153
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:50,000
and tried it once and never came back. So basically, we know the stock has fallen through

1154
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:59,920
the bottom now. We know that nobody's using it. The problem with it is, let's take Beyond Burger,

1155
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:05,840
basically, it's a P protein that's produced in Canada. It's shipped to China because we can't

1156
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,640
process it in the United States. There's no processing for the most part. They're beginning

1157
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:16,400
to develop it. But when it came out, there was none. Shipped to China. China processes protein,

1158
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:22,160
ships us back to the US. We know transportation is the number one cause of greenhouse gas in the

1159
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:28,480
world. And so now we've shipped it all over the country, comes back to the US and they process it

1160
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:36,720
into something with like 25 ingredients, probably five or six of them are not FDA approved.

1161
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:40,720
I wasn't aware of that. Why so?

1162
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:45,520
They have multiple products. They have multiple components and synthetics that have never really

1163
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:52,240
been studied and they're not FDA approved. So they're basically relying on safety without ever

1164
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:59,280
proving it. Will that ever come back to haunt them? I don't know. But in the spirit of having

1165
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:06,800
natural foods, there's certainly not anything natural about them. So anyway, I think that

1166
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:13,520
plant-based proteins have been around a long time. I think trying to pretend that it's meat

1167
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:23,600
or calling soy drink milk or almond drink milk, I think those are travesties. I think those are

1168
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:31,680
standards of identity. Almond milk has what? One gram of protein per eight ounces where

1169
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:36,480
cow's milk has eight. Calling that milk is pure deception.

1170
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:42,080
You know what my wife, I love cashew milk by the way. That's how I make all my soybeans and stuff.

1171
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:48,080
My wife calls it nut juice. She's like, you're going to have some of your nut juice.

1172
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:56,240
I mean, and I'm not against using them, but I think the nomenclature needs to be correct.

1173
02:05:56,240 --> 02:06:05,040
Right. I mean, if you look at one of the examples I like to use is that if you look at a wheat

1174
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:11,840
cereal, we won't pick any, but take a wheat cereal that has four grams of protein per serving. We

1175
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:18,640
always said that's only two probably on the label. It says you mix it with a three fourths of a cup

1176
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:24,560
of milk. So now we have 10 grams. And if you look at the lysine balance of that, it's exactly

1177
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:33,920
balanced. But if you go to soy milk, a soy milk only has six grams per eight ounce per cup instead

1178
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:39,920
of eight. So now you already have less protein and it's also deficient in lysine. So it takes

1179
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:46,880
almost a quart of milk. It takes almost 30 ounces of milk to balance that cereal. So if you're a

1180
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:52,080
mother feeding this to your child and thinking, well, I'm doing a plant based thing and I'm feeding

1181
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:59,680
them a totally deficient diet with, you know, six ounces of soy milk for breakfast. I'm feeding

1182
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:05,600
them a totally deficient diet. How many mothers know that? Yeah. Yeah. I look, if I don't know

1183
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:10,400
that, I'm guessing a lot of mothers don't know that. And so those are the kinds of things that

1184
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:16,080
we think need to come out about protein quality. We want a system where we can show people an

1185
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:21,920
additive value and that at the end of it, and I put that meal together and this, this is a company

1186
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:28,960
called wise code that I'm working with. We think that we can show with using QR codes and your

1187
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:34,720
phone will simply add them up and you can tell what your total meal looks like. Yeah. That would be

1188
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:40,320
incredibly helpful. I mean, I, again, as I alluded to earlier, still something I trouble, I have

1189
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:47,520
trouble with is, is, is doing it especially on days when I don't have access to as much meat. And

1190
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,320
what it comes down to for me is just how much did I have from leftovers the night before. So, you know,

1191
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:58,880
I've got a meat based meal, which is my dinner. You know, wild game is sort of our, our routine,

1192
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:03,760
right? So elk and venison and stuff like that. And if I'm smart enough and thoughtful enough to make

1193
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,800
a lot extra, then I get, I can basically have it for breakfast and lunch the next day, but sometimes

1194
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,760
I'm not. And then I'm, you know, I'm making protein shakes. I'm, I'm, you know, eating a venison bar

1195
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:21,200
here and there, but it gets a lot harder. And yeah, I've never even, I'm having a hard enough time

1196
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:27,200
just making sure I hit the total grams per day of protein. And it's, it's, there's no attention on my

1197
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:32,400
end going into, Hey, how much methionine is here? How much leucine is here? How much lysine is here?

1198
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:40,080
And if, you know, as I said a while ago, if, if you've got 125 grams of protein in your diet

1199
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:46,800
per day, chances are you'll hit those numbers. And where, where leucine is a meal to meal number,

1200
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:52,560
lysine is a daily number. It doesn't matter meal to meal. It's a total. And I guess for me,

1201
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:58,320
that's probably okay. But then I think about it for my wife or my female patients where it,

1202
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:03,040
I mean, it's like, it's hard to get them up to 120 grams per day.

1203
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:09,680
Yeah. We struggled with all of the adult women we had in our studies and, you know, we had whatever,

1204
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:16,720
three, 400. It's a real struggle to keep a female at a hundred grams of protein per day. It's just a

1205
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:24,800
struggle. And that then quality becomes an issue. And, you know, that's my, my concern with the whole

1206
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:31,760
plant-based movement is that do people have the resources to make that, you know, can you make

1207
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:38,080
that healthy? Sure you can, but you a need a lot of knowledge. You need a lot of food skills and

1208
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:43,440
you're going to have to eat synthetic products because you can't get it from eating, you know,

1209
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:49,360
be, you know, lentils and rice. You just can't eat enough of them. And so you're going to have

1210
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:56,320
to have shakes or supplements or something to get to that kind of level. Otherwise the track

1211
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:02,160
record says that vegetarians will end up around somewhere in the sixties for their protein per day.

1212
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:08,320
And quality does make a difference at that level. Well, Don, this has been really interesting. I'm,

1213
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:14,480
I'm so glad that we were introduced and I can talk about protein all day because it's an eternal

1214
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:19,600
interest of mine personally, but also in terms of helping as many of my patients as I can. I think

1215
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:25,520
this is perhaps the, you know, it's not the macronutrient that gets the most debated on Twitter.

1216
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:30,560
That's reserved for carbs and fat, but this is, this is the one that I think we need to be paying

1217
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:35,840
more attention to. So I'm grateful for the work you've done and for the attention you brought to

1218
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:42,480
it today in our discussion. Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity to do that. And I, you know,

1219
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:48,080
maybe one thought thought I'd leave you with that we haven't touched on is people talk about high

1220
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:53,280
protein. And I think it's important to try and come to grips with what that means. If you look

1221
02:10:53,280 --> 02:11:00,000
at all of the epidemiology, which I think is pretty bad science, the definition of high protein is

1222
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:08,960
about 1.2 grams per kg and low protein is actually below 0.8. And so a lot of them will express it as

1223
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:14,640
percentage of calories and they'll say less than 10%. And so when you look at the epidemiology,

1224
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:20,640
you need to realize they're talking about very narrow ranges of protein intake. And, and it

1225
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:25,360
really isn't the protein that's making a difference. It's the calories and the other things that are

1226
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:31,920
going with it. And I'll just, one last thought when I was for four years, I was director of research

1227
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:37,680
for the American egg board. So I funded all of the research that basically got the cholesterol

1228
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:46,560
direction eliminated from our guidelines. One of the things we funded though, was there was a lot

1229
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:52,240
of research suggesting that eggs had a high correlation with obesity and diabetes and heart

1230
02:11:52,240 --> 02:12:00,720
disease. And so we funded some research with, with Teresa Nichols and Vic Vergoni who are experts

1231
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:06,640
in the NHANES data. And what they looked at was that in the epidemiology, the difference between

1232
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:12,160
the first quartile and the last quartile for egg consumption was three to three and a half.

1233
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:17,440
So they were basically saying that a half an egg per week or per week, yeah, per day,

1234
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:23,920
I'm sorry, per week, half an egg per week was a difference in causing obesity, heart disease,

1235
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:29,520
and diabetes. And so what they did was they went into the NHANES data and they factored out all of

1236
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:35,120
the eggs that were eaten at fast food versus the eggs that were just eaten at home in a quote,

1237
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:40,240
good nutrition setting. And what they found is in every case, eggs now became a positive.

1238
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:46,320
They reduced obesity, they reduced. So basically it's not the egg, it's the egg in the company it

1239
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:53,360
keeps and you can make anything a bad diet. Yeah. And I think to your point, it's when we talk about

1240
02:12:53,360 --> 02:13:00,000
epidemiology pointing at high protein being a problem, you realize anybody who's tried to

1241
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:05,840
actually consume high protein realizes it ain't high protein, it's high calorie that's the problem.

1242
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:12,880
And the protein is along for the ride because again, 1.2 grams per kilo is actually kind of

1243
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:20,800
low protein in the context of a high calorie diet. If you look at epidemiology and you do any food

1244
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:27,840
surveys, what you realize right away is that the data for protein is pretty good. If I ask you how

1245
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:33,360
many eggs you ate yesterday, you'd give me the number. If I ask you how many ounces of milk or

1246
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:39,520
how many grams of meat, you'd give because we sell those by ounces and weights. But if I ask most

1247
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:47,760
people how many carbs they ate yesterday, they'd miss it by 200 grams. And so that's the problem

1248
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:57,040
with epidemiology is that the errors are not homogeneous. They're not equal. So anyway, I

1249
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:11,120
ramble on, but a great pleasure to chat with you, Peter. Thank you, Don. This was fantastic.
