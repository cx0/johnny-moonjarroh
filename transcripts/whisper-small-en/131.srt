1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey Beth, do you have any idea how exciting it is for me to do an in-person

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,940
podcast for like the first time since probably February? Yeah I'm sure it's kind

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,020
of weird right? It's been kind of interesting just to be around you for

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,280
the past like four weeks, five weeks. Yeah you were really stuck in the thick of it

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,540
you've been back here obviously in SoCal for as you said four or five

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,660
weeks but I think you were you were going crazy in New York for four months.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,060
Yeah it was it was a bit of an adventure you know with COVID and you know I'm

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,880
stuck in a very small one-bedroom SoHo walk-up which is beautiful when you're

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,900
just like sleeping there but when you're quarantined there it's a little more

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,140
interesting so yeah it was it was nice to get a little fresh air with my dogs

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,020
and you know just be. Yeah and you weren't just sort of quarantined there in

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,860
the normal way you had to basically lead 10 to 11 hours a day of workouts

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,740
remotely with your clients you were teaching a rowing class on your rowing

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,060
machine in your apartment I mean it was you got more out of 500 square feet than

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,100
anybody. More like 350 square feet if we're gonna be real but yeah I had to

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,180
completely revamp my work situation and I went from being on my feet 10 to 12

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,740
hours a day to being essentially a desk worker which was an interesting shift

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:30,180
but I learned a lot from it. You know Beth I've described you to people as

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,480
probably one of the most remarkable physical specimens I've ever met and you

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,540
just have a unique ability to you know kind of do what Bruce Lee did in

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,060
martial arts right not to put too much pressure on you. Great thing to say at

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:58,020
the beginning. Yeah which is basically be agnostic to form or to discipline but

23
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,020
in you know what Bruce Lee talked about when he created Jyukundo was to extract

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,340
what was useful discard what was useless from all disciplines into this agnostic

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,300
bucket that really served only one purpose was fight execution and

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,860
similarly your breadth of knowledge and at the same time your total lack of

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,820
being wed to one system in movement in training has led you to come up with

28
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,140
something that has no name and again Bruce Lee referred to Jyukundo as you

29
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,300
know the way of no way and without form and all these other different things in

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,820
many ways that's just sort of what you do and that makes it hard sometimes for

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,700
people like me who like to label things and say well wait does this fit in the

32
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,260
DNS bucket is this FRC is this PRI and you're like no no no it's just it's

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,020
what's gonna work right now. So how did we meet so Michael Strombsness

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:03,220
introduced us I don't know two almost two years ago. I think January of last year. Yeah yeah and the rest is history but

35
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,060
and I know your background but give people a sense of like where does this

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,620
where does this Southern Bell wind up in New York? It's interesting I never

37
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,380
wanted to live in New York but that's another story. I was an athlete as a kid

38
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,260
I was a gymnast I was a martial artist I played soccer I swam competitively and I

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,700
danced from the time I was six until I still think I danced but definitely

40
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:36,540
retired. I was also a musician I was a drum major of my high school band and I

41
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,820
wanted to dance. I actually was in school initially to be a secondary education

42
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,900
Spanish teacher believe it or not and I decided my junior year this was not a

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,700
good thing for me and all I wanted to do is dance and I had a guidance counselor

44
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,860
I was like you need to just dance so I transferred and changed my major my

45
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,820
junior year I have a BFA in dance performance from the University of

46
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:10,020
Georgia. I moved to Atlanta I started in fitness I worked at a gold's gym in like

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,780
rural Atlanta this little place called Carter'sville and I got hired with a

48
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,340
dance company that was based in Connecticut but basically New York and I

49
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,260
started touring internationally with this company and I did so for about four

50
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,300
years and then I decided it was time to get off the road I was actually in my

51
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,540
early 30s by then and just decided to make New York my home and it has been

52
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,940
for a while now. So for people like me frankly who don't know a lot about dance

53
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,100
when you say dance do you mean ballet? I don't mean that I am trained in ballet

54
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,500
but this is more it's all it's more physical theater the company's called

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,140
Pilobolus it was founded in the 70s basically these scientists from Dartmouth

56
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,380
made this dance technique up called weight sharing and it's it's very athletic

57
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,220
it's mostly a men's company actually traditionally six I'm sorry four men to

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,300
women in my particular company we created shadow work so it's it's physical

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,380
theater but it's very physical so a lot of acrobatics a lot of rolling around a

60
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,020
lot of partnering and it's actually quite similar to the way I teach to lift

61
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,420
weights it's about sharing the load and working with the weight it's a pretty

62
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,220
cool company definitely worth checking out so more contemporary more physical

63
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,980
theater and during this period of your life how much of your ability to do the

64
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,500
things you were doing were just based on natural ability obviously you're

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:55,260
naturally pretty gifted versus being quite astute and dialed in to the science

66
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,380
of what was going on because you know I remember certainly in my late 20s and

67
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,380
early 30s was when my immortality started to vanish you know I trained so

68
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,980
hard growing up and it just like I couldn't hurt myself like you just

69
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,860
couldn't be hurt in your teens and 20s no matter how dumb you were but by the

70
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,700
time in your late 20s and early 30s like if you're not doing things

71
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,420
correctly it catches up and I can only imagine with the stress of what you were

72
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,380
doing even all of your gifts couldn't protect you so what was the balance of

73
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,980
just raw athletic talent versus very specific you know well thought-out steps

74
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:43,020
it's interesting because with dance it's very in the moment and that company in

75
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,900
particular is an improv based company wait wait you mean you guys are

76
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,260
improving when you're doing your shows no not when we're doing shows but when

77
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,500
you're making work it's all based on improvisation so it's a lot of intuition

78
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,220
it's a lot of I mean there's definitely like a training time where you're

79
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,780
learning how to work with each other and basically not fight with each other to

80
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,380
make the movement happen but a lot of the the coolest stuff we came up with was

81
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:16,020
all based on improv Wow yeah so you're dancing how many hours a day at this

82
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,580
period of your life so when we were making so we created a work from the

83
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,460
ground up that's actually still touring so we were in the studio initially for

84
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,700
eight months eight hours a day five days a week yeah and then once we started

85
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,220
touring I actually found touring much harder because you were you know on an

86
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,180
international flight once a week and living in hotels and living on red wine

87
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,620
and chocolate and you know doing a show every night eight shows a week so it was

88
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,780
just you know it's a different stress it's a different challenge to your

89
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,500
system so I actually found touring much harder because I would wake up and I

90
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,740
would be like where am I I had no idea and that's kind of what got me out of it

91
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,180
I was like yeah tired of waking up not knowing where I am so explain to me what

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,700
your body looked like when you left that and started in New York were you totally

93
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,060
lean emaciated and wasted because you could barely keep weight on given how

94
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,620
much you were moving around or was that an environment where you actually had to

95
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,300
work to keep your weight down because of the you know strength to mass ratio that

96
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,060
was needed to do the acrobatics definitely had to keep my weight down

97
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,620
but I wasn't actually wasn't so fixated on it because you know number one I was

98
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,180
younger and just traveling all the time and dancing all the time you really

99
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,820
didn't have to worry about it too much I was definitely I had less mass I was

100
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:48,220
pretty skinny by the time I finished you know touring no butt no legs I mean

101
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,620
definitely stronger than most like aesthetically than most answers would

102
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,780
look like but pretty skinny compared to what I am now yeah yeah so you get to

103
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,660
New York do you have a sense of what you want to do other than not travel no clue

104
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,940
I was basically like oh maybe I'll try the Broadway thing I did a couple of

105
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,220
auditions like this is definitely not for me and I actually did like pretty

106
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,740
intensive yoga teacher training it was like a month long eight hours a day five

107
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,580
days a week very similar to what I can't come from and started looking for

108
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,060
training jobs because before I started touring I actually had a quite

109
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,340
successful business in Atlanta training and teaching group fitness and it just

110
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,060
kind of seemed like the natural fit to go back to that but it just I wasn't

111
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,700
content with the regular gym setting so I was definitely looking for something

112
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,820
so I started teaching once I finished the teacher training I was teaching 25

113
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:52,780
classes a week I was you know training a gajillion people a day working seven

114
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,620
days a week you know just trying to make it in New York yeah you're like the James

115
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,820
Brown of trainers you're like the hardest working woman in show business

116
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,100
it's crazy I love it number one you know and the hustle is real in New York you

117
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,780
have to you have to live that for a while and it's kind of hard to get out

118
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,180
of that a bit I get to have it we're working on it though yes I know this week

119
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,140
has been working I think I've had more downtime this week than I've ever had

120
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,980
it's good it's good so you you were basically are you sort of freelancing

121
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,500
for lack of a better word at that point or you sort of wed to one gym that

122
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,420
you're working out of I was wed to one gym and then I was working I was

123
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,060
teaching group fitness there and then I was teaching group fitness at a couple

124
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,620
of other studios that's kind of the group group acts way in New York like you

125
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,420
work all over the place that kind of came to a halt I got involved with the

126
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,780
rowing studio that was just openings called City Row so it's funny because

127
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,040
the only reason I really I knew nothing about rowing but it was right across the

128
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,540
street from my gym and all I could think was yes I can stop like running around

129
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:12,940
like a crazy person and just like walk across the street to teach class so that

130
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,300
was pretty much the end of my running around so it was that gym and then City

131
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,620
Row and that was it for a long time all right so at that point in time what is

132
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,700
your philosophy and and and how were you dividing your gym time you've got

133
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,660
obviously these group fitness classes and I assume that's like what people now

134
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,420
see in an Orange Theory fitness or a Barry's Boot Camp type thing right and

135
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,740
then how much of your gym time is that versus one-on-one with a person

136
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,820
strength training powerlifting etc I was probably doing eight nine sessions

137
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,780
a day privately and then teaching one to two classes a day okay yeah so what was

138
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,020
your when you're in as far as the private stuff what was your philosophy

139
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,860
at that point in time where were you you know what was your North Star how did

140
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,380
you guide people basically do no harm just try to keep people as safe as

141
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,700
possible and make it as pretty as possible you know try not to load people

142
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,780
too much and just keep them safe and how did what was your what was your

143
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,300
knowledge base at that point just general strength and conditioning you

144
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,980
know I I went to Exos which is it's a center they usually train a lot of

145
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,780
professional athletes they do a lot of combine training I did a lot of them I

146
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,980
did all of their mentorships actually so you know it basically it turned into

147
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,260
like basic movement prep a lift and then some sort of energy systems development

148
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,500
work pretty basic and just trying to keep people as safe as possible I mean

149
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,020
when I think back on my sort of strength training career is not the word I'm

150
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,300
looking for I think just trajectory is probably the right word I'm just I don't

151
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,860
know I'm surprised maybe at how unsophisticated it was I'm not I mean I

152
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,100
guess surprise is also the wrong word I'm amazed we don't get more hurt with

153
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,460
how unstructured it is in the way we teach people how to do things where you

154
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:29,500
can cause a lot of damage yeah right a back squat a deadlift an overhead press

155
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,020
you know these are things that frankly speak to the resilience of our species

156
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:42,700
that we just pretty much always do these things biometrically incorrect and then

157
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,060
we load ourselves repetitively repetitively repetitively for the most

158
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,540
part people kind of limp through it so where would you put yourself on the

159
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,820
scale of the average sort of trainer back at that stage of your or maybe maybe

160
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,060
a better way to think is what percentage of the person you've become

161
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,580
today were you at that point in time oh like 30% okay wow so which is probably

162
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,300
still pretty good right yeah yeah you know everyone got strong enough and and

163
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:19,420
they won't really get hurt yeah so what was sort of the first thing that began

164
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,460
you know or at least put you on the path to where you are now which again is you

165
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,700
know I've sort of built you up maybe in a way that you're uncomfortable with but

166
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,780
but you know having this sort of completely integrated systems approach

167
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,260
to wow there are all of these different philosophies that we've got to you know

168
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,580
start to integrate into how we get people to move and then how we load them

169
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:48,740
and right I think when I first started training I remember thinking I didn't

170
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,500
understand why people couldn't do what I could do like I didn't understand why

171
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,340
certain things were hard or impossible and that was something that kind of can

172
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,340
you give me an example like why can't someone squat like what is limiting them

173
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,980
from being able to squat because you've never not been able to squat perfectly

174
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,220
right not that I've never been able to squat perfectly but I've always been

175
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:17,180
very movable and good balance and relatively strong and I just didn't

176
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,060
understand and I wanted to understand what was limiting someone so I

177
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,780
you know would see all these accommodations and and compensations happening and

178
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,740
things that were just impossible and learning issues like why can't that

179
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,580
person learn what I'm telling them to do and my kind of frustration not with them

180
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,260
with me not being able to help them led me just to really diving into a lot of

181
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,020
continuing education so I actually left the gym that I was at and I went to

182
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,580
another gym which was more more of like a like a true strength and conditioning

183
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,020
setup the gym I was at prior was more of like a spa setup and I really I wanted

184
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,700
to learn more about lifting I wanted to learn more about Olympic lifting power

185
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,060
lifting had you done any Olympic or power lifting yourself until that point I

186
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,360
had a mentor that I worked with at my first gym who was really into power

187
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,020
lifting and he taught me a lot of the basic lifts and I was just kind of

188
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,620
naturally good at some of them but I wanted to know more so I started working

189
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,900
a gym called Soho strength lab downtown anything that has lab in it is gonna be

190
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,660
awesome right I agree there's this place here called swim labs in San Diego I'm

191
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,860
just gonna make a plug for them yeah freaking amazing yeah yeah best swim

192
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,780
school that's awesome I mean this was a it was a really good place for me at the

193
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,140
time I learned a lot from those guys they were you know very smart very you

194
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,700
know attuned to strength and conditioning some pretty talented

195
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,980
Olympic lifters coming out of there some just strong dudes and women actually so

196
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,660
it was good for me to be there but I also wanted to be kind of on the

197
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,120
physical therapy side of things so I started working one day a week in a

198
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,580
clinic and that's how I was introduced to functional range conditioning so went

199
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,600
to the cert was just like wow it opened up so many doors for me of like why some

200
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,840
things could be challenging you know how if we don't have a lot of

201
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,680
proprioception and awareness of where our body can go in space motor control

202
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:31,200
that it won't go there actually so that was kind of my first situation with

203
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,400
really diving into continuing education past just a regular strength and

204
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,080
conditioning cert well I definitely want to come back to FRC you know your

205
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,840
comment about squatting is an interesting one I started squatting when

206
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,320
I was about 13 you know I think I've told you the story you know I just kind

207
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,640
of got in with a bunch of older men like they seem like older men they're in

208
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
their 30s you know which when you're 13 they seem like they might as well be a hundred

209
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,560
who took me another wing and just you know got me power lifting and I think

210
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,720
when you start somebody that young and you're around these monsters who are

211
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,440
squatting six seven hundred pounds you just you grow and you do that thing but

212
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,400
I remember always being amazed like and feeling these I something you did which

213
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,120
is I would try to teach somebody to squat and I actually had no idea how to

214
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,880
do it in other words I could teach somebody who had the natural ability

215
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
which means I did they didn't need me in the first place but anybody who didn't

216
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,520
have either the ankle flexibility the hip flexibility the balance this stability

217
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,760
all these things I couldn't do anything I could never understand why and it's

218
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,800
funniest thing about two years ago when I met Michael maybe it was a little over

219
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,720
two years ago Michael Strom'sness he did something that it was like the biggest

220
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:51,400
aha moment I've ever had which is he said have you ever met a person who on

221
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,160
their back can't do a perfect squat yeah and I was like I that's so much easier

222
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,840
right like if you lay anybody on their back you can put them into a perfect

223
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,400
squatted position so why is it that everybody laying on their back can be in

224
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,920
a perfect squat right and I'm talking perfect where like you know hip

225
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,320
extension knee extension hip flexion knee flexion you know below like

226
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,080
everything is perfect but under the load of their own body weight very few people

227
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,320
can do that and you start to realize that's the stability piece if you can't

228
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,680
even stabilize the weight of your own body there's no way you're gonna be able

229
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:40,120
to load yourself and so for me that was like this moment of holy cow there's

230
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,200
there's a whole world here I've never considered understanding so what was the

231
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,440
first thing you saw in FRC which maybe we should take a step back and explain

232
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,560
what FRC is after you maybe explain the first thing you saw but I want to spend

233
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,720
some time understanding this because it's one of the many systems you now

234
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,960
bring into what you do and how you coach right I think the biggest thing

235
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,920
was like you can't go where you don't know right so if you're working on in

236
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,680
range joint control explain what that is so we like to live life in our mid-range

237
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,840
so it's very comfortable there we're very used to being there but if you

238
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,040
think of like overhead flexion like your in range would be way back here but you

239
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,960
probably have more than that depending on a lot of situations but if you're so

240
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,960
used to going just here over and over and over again and you're really able to

241
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,480
go here this is the area you don't know or the area you can't control and their

242
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,840
whole thing is like control yourself so it was interesting to me you don't think

243
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,040
about you don't if you don't use it you lose it so you know our assist our brain

244
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,920
our central nervous system is quite a lazy one and if you don't kind of remind

245
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,120
yourself where your end ranges are you'll stop going there digress for a

246
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,760
moment to tell a story about the first time you exposed me to this do you know

247
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,000
which story I'm gonna tell I have no idea it was doing a tricep kickback and

248
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,840
range and well you went you went to the dumbbell rack and you got a five pound

249
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,600
dumbbell and I remember you walking back to me and I was thinking I wonder

250
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,640
what she's gonna do with that other than like I yeah yeah like I it wouldn't even

251
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,120
hold the door open like what could you possibly be doing with a five pound

252
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,440
dumbbell and then you had me get down on my hands and knees and maybe we'll even

253
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,600
demonstrate this exercise afterwards because we're gonna this podcast will be

254
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,080
accompanied by a great video but you had me do basically what amounted to a

255
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,360
tricep kickback but at end range so full shoulder extension you know

256
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,920
accompanied with scapular retraction yeah and I think I got to seven reps

257
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,760
before my triceps seized and I couldn't do anything right right and I just I

258
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,920
just couldn't imagine that that muscle which you know ostensibly is strong in

259
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,400
its mid-range oh yeah could be so weak and deconditioned at its end range right

260
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,920
I mean you have to think you're like you're in maximum stretch on the

261
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,500
opposite side and you're having to control that length with the regressive

262
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,920
side the opposite side and it's your weakest at your in range yeah just show

263
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,840
people the position I'm in from a explain all the terms you just said so

264
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,320
we talked about the scapular position yeah retraction yeah and then depression

265
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,200
extension or yes shoulder extension and then you're adding load onto that with

266
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:57,360
elbow extension yeah and again with five pounds with five pounds most people I do

267
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
that body weight first and they're like I should feel pretty good about myself

268
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,560
yes totally thousand percent I was so annoyed by that and then the next day I

269
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,880
just went to the eight pounds and you were like you're such an idiot like now

270
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,720
you're doing it incorrectly you're caught you know right because when

271
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,080
you're working in range you have to actually hold in range if it drops out

272
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,240
of it then you've lost it and to really get in touch with the mechanoreceptors

273
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,000
like you have to be on in range it's a stimulus that your brain wants but it

274
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,360
won't it won't fire to it it won't pay attention to it unless you're actually

275
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,960
on in range so you know one of the things that you started talking about

276
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:49,240
the first day we ever met was you were very attuned to scapular mobility which

277
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:57,680
resonated with me because I have very as you like to put it gooey I just had the

278
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:04,120
gooeyest scapula if that's the plural word for it yeah when did you start to

279
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,680
recognize the importance of that scapular girdle because again I don't

280
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,960
think a lot of people walk around thinking about this and thinking about

281
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,280
the pathology that results when a person can't control it well the cool

282
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,120
thing about your scaps is they're super movable right and they sit right on the

283
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,320
back of your rib cage and they kind of guide where your shoulders should go and

284
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,080
they guide where your rib cage should go so when you are in scapular protraction

285
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,280
to show people what protraction would be a reach which we're all made to do so

286
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,840
we have these beautiful rounded ribs at the back you have these triangular bones

287
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,360
exactly sit over them and as you said they glide up and down but when you get that

288
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
good reach you get a nice retraction of the rib cage which allows air to go into

289
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,400
the back of your rib cage which I could talk about that relationship for hours

290
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,920
but it it gives you more of a three it helps with breathing it gives you more

291
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,200
of a three-dimensional or it can assist with the position in particular

292
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,120
breathing exercises I should say but it assists that three-dimensional breath

293
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,600
which is so incredibly important for for stability but also kind of guides where

294
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,520
your shoulders should go extension flexion all of it because your scaps

295
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,880
move accordingly so what muscles play a role in that and why do most people have

296
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,040
the inability to control it because one of the first things that you start

297
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,920
having people like me and others do are cars which we're gonna spend some time

298
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,120
talking about just as a way to start having people understand what that

299
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,800
mobility cycle is cars to kind of teach you where your scaps are like I the

300
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,720
step one is to know where they are and then you can kind of figure out what you

301
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,640
can do with them but a lot of people don't even realize because they can get

302
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,360
stuck for a lack of better words on the back of your rib cage and you can if

303
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,640
you don't use it you lose it so you can kind of lose a sense of awareness of how

304
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,880
they can move or even if they can move I don't think I ever thought about it I

305
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,440
mean and this is I'm someone who had I think above-average kinesthetic awareness

306
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,360
always played a sport that involved my upper body so it was either boxing or

307
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,400
swimming or you know something where you'd think I'd be attuned to that no

308
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,160
chance never gave it a thought right well it's as it can be a couple of things

309
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,560
it can be a stress response to hold them in retraction so they're kind of loaded

310
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,880
retraction elevation if you're if you don't have great load tolerance in your

311
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,000
hands and wrist these guys will always try to help you out and that kind of

312
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,160
becomes your new normal and it can it can impact breath it can impact gait it

313
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,600
can impact shoulder mobility all of it so there's I mean there's a couple things

314
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,800
that I always try to see cars number one I want them to know where their in

315
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,920
ranges are and what their scats can actually do with minimal accommodation

316
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,560
from head rib spine and then I want to show people a scapular car and tell

317
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,280
people what it stands for sure so cars stands for controlled articular rotations

318
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,680
that is a movement that you learn in functional range conditioning so

319
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,600
basically you're trying to make the biggest circle you can with minimal

320
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,840
accommodation so head trying to stay as still as possible ribs not going along

321
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,880
for the ride spine not going along for the ride and also for me it's

322
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,720
maintaining breath like if you're having to hold your breath or like

323
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,200
hyperventilate to do a scap car like we got some things to work on yeah and when

324
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,040
we started them we were doing them in squares because that the coordination

325
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,360
for me was so hard circles are hard you know and creating us because you'll see

326
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,120
sometimes when people don't have the ability to control it they'll go circle

327
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,720
jump circle jump they'll kind of skip over this I call it like a neurological

328
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,680
hiccup skip over a range that they're not used to being in because the brains

329
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,840
like uh-uh uh-uh yeah so I like to start in squares first because they're easy to

330
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,160
visualize and they're very easy to control so it's like step one step two

331
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,640
step three step four and then you're trying to get that circle to move

332
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:39,760
consistent and so it's elevation protraction depression and you will not

333
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,120
change one thing at a time nice and smooth coordinated and when that gets

334
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,160
easy we then do it under load which is really hard yeah so then you make it more

335
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,160
closed chain and closed chain meaning your hands aren't free anymore they're

336
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:06,640
more like the open chain is the hands with the feet are on air closed chain is

337
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,440
they're on the ground or on the wall or something I try to get people to close

338
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,320
chain as quickly as possible so I'll put them on the wall to be less load because

339
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,040
I want their fingers and their hands to be experiencing load because they should

340
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,720
all the time but it's tricky when you start adding load or adding speed your

341
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,880
bad habits your your I shouldn't say bad habits that's wrong your strategies show

342
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,600
up you know yeah so elbows start bending spine start moving head start moving

343
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,000
so now you're getting pretty deep into the FRC world and what are the what are

344
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,880
some of the other things you're bringing back into the gym from FRC and actually

345
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,160
before we do that give folks a bit of a background on FRC and its use application

346
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,640
I think that's the one that was formed by the Canadian chiropractor right Dr.

347
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,560
Andrea Spina yeah yeah he's a chiropractor was created they have a whole

348
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,520
system functional range system so they have a soft like a manual therapy part

349
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,720
of it and then kind of more of the the strength and the strength application of

350
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:23,800
it so the biggest thing was like using isometric input to remind your brain of

351
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,800
where you are or what you can control so they do they also do pales and rails

352
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,520
progressive angular isometric loading which basically means you're putting

353
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,200
isometric input into stretched stuff and then the regressive side is actually

354
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,840
owning what you've just kind of stretched essentially give a little bit more of an

355
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,200
explanation of those things so the way they set it up or the way the system

356
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,560
would set it up is you would hold a stretch let's say hip external rotation

357
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,680
you would find your in range of hip external rotation hold it for two

358
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,080
minutes get the system to kind of accept that you're holding the stretch

359
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,840
because you know when you're on an in range of a stretch initially you're like

360
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:15,000
no you have to kind of give yourself time to calm down and accept the stretch

361
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,280
from there you would do an isometric input at various intensities and then

362
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,800
you would do a isometric meaning force without movement exactly force without

363
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,080
movement so you would push into that stretch trying to and you actually feel

364
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,040
more sensation to the stretch so it's really great when you're working in that

365
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,440
capsule full of mechanoreceptors it's great for communicating to your brain

366
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,440
like okay I can actually be here and work here and own it right so be there

367
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,400
work there and then the rail regressive angular isometric loading would be

368
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,120
moving in the opposite direction to pull you into more stretch and if you're

369
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,800
truly on your in range it ain't moving at all so it can be quite frustrating

370
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,600
and it's it's hard to pull into your in range but it basically gives you the

371
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,720
opposite side tissue to own your stretch so let's also put each of each of these

372
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,240
down as things will demonstrate when we get into the gym I think I can certainly

373
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,720
remember a few times that you had me do these and they're they're hard you just

374
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,160
don't feel like you have strength and coordination when you're at that end

375
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,640
rage to them it's stressful it's super stressful absolutely and it's you do get

376
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:40,800
a temporary mobility gain after that but it has to be practiced for seems like

377
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,160
forever to make it happen just like with anything so I mean FRC is one of its

378
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,320
stated goals is is sort of developing greater movement obviously in mobility

379
00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:00,800
yes is it more of a PT slash rehab school of thinking or is it more of a

380
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,320
performance based school of thinking performance based I would say it's I

381
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,480
mean the functional range release the the manual therapy part of it is more of

382
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,640
obviously a PT I've actually taken a couple of those courses just audited to

383
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,960
check it out and it's basically the same kind of deal like you're holding the

384
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,320
input because all input is stress and you have people push into it and then

385
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,960
relax push it so you're you're basically teaching them where tissues are by

386
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:38,120
having them isometrically push which is it's pretty interesting it's it can be

387
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,120
insanely helpful for increasing proprioception so what did you see when

388
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:52,880
you started bringing FRC back to the weight room I mean clearly better like

389
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,600
controlled movements more coordination absolutely did you did you meet

390
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,280
resistance I mean from from people saying come on I just want to like do my

391
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,880
deadlifts and do my bench press oh yeah oh yeah a lot of tall-talking this whole

392
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:17,320
life talking convincing you don't do that with me I'm pretty accepting it for

393
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:28,080
sure you know at that point I'd been training my clients for so long that

394
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,880
they're like Beth did another thing and she's just trying stuff which was great

395
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,840
mostly mostly in this in the like weight room setting I was using cars and then

396
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,400
isometrics to you know get people to experience feels if you will before we

397
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,400
would lift doing some pails and rails at the end because it's not good to do

398
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,840
pails and rails before you lift because I tried to do that I tried to max out

399
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,400
once after doing pails and rails and I nearly died I was like goo essentially

400
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,760
just kind of neurologically fried because it's a lot it's a it's stressful

401
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,400
on the system but I didn't meet you know I'm really big into educating you know

402
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,560
why we're doing this trying to make it accessible so people were people were

403
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,400
doing it you know I had some people that were like man I'd be like well I'm not really

404
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:28,440
on train anymore you know but it went well it went really well actually so

405
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,400
another one of these sort of schools that you've integrated is something

406
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,440
called the postural restoration Institute PRI how did you come in contact

407
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,280
with PRI um you know same same idea working in the clinic and just kind of

408
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,800
doing a ton of research and I wanted to just went to a course and wanted to

409
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,800
check it out the first course I went to was actually a pelvic course which was

410
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,840
crazy because I had no no idea what they were talking about at all because it's

411
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,920
more designed for PTs and chiropractors a lot you know some strength and

412
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,960
condition coaches use it but it's mostly for in the clinic type things but I just

413
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,120
kept taking courses I've taken I think almost I've definitely taken all the

414
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,080
primary courses I've been to their advanced integration and a ton of

415
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:28,920
secondary courses actually yeah what's the overall philosophy of PRI so they

416
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:38,200
it's um how do I explain this they put people in patterns so they say you know

417
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,280
basically your liver is on your right side so you're gonna naturally have more

418
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,840
diaphragmatic compression on the right side so we're going to tend to kind of

419
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:56,600
spin towards that in times of stress and it creates different deviations in

420
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,960
movement so makes you quite asymmetrical and it can create pain and discomfort

421
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,080
yeah so basically that would be a left AIC pattern if you're really kicked to

422
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,520
the right so in a left AIC they would say that your left side of your pelvis

423
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,640
your left rib cage is kind of stuck in external rotation and your left side of

424
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,200
your pelvis would be in it would be an interior tilt right so if this is if I'm

425
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,520
looking at you and this is my right side the left side is tilted a little bit

426
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,440
more forward yeah which makes more makes your right leg more of a standing leg

427
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,040
and your left leg more of a swinging leg right and again part of that is that

428
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,840
we I so I always knew most people preferred to load the right leg if

429
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,960
they're standing anybody can try this at home just notice anytime you're standing

430
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,640
there you're gonna prefer and she'll want to stand on the right side I assumed

431
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,960
it was a dominance thing but when I met you I remember you saying it's probably

432
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,760
more to do with we get more compression from the liver on that side and I do see

433
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,360
it in most people I kind of assess I do see that they prefer their eyes I do and

434
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm a left-handed that's right you're a lefty and one of my kids is a lefty so

435
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns out but yeah it'll be interesting

436
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,560
all the lefties out there I'm curious as to whether when you catch yourself

437
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,840
you're your right side loading right so the whole the whole idea is because

438
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,280
you're on that right side a lot especially in times of stress that

439
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,040
you're gonna get more repetitive injury on the right and you know the left side

440
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,220
just becomes kind of weak and almost useless remember the day we met so

441
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:49,040
that's January of 2019 some miserly cold New York Day do you remember what my

442
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,760
only complaint was right SI right SI just and elbows right elbow yeah a little

443
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,080
but really it was that right SI that on some days didn't bother me and I could

444
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,960
deadlift like a beast and then on some days I just I couldn't deadlift as heavy

445
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,040
as I wanted to and that was sort of it and I really I thought other than that

446
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,000
everything was fine right and then we did your squat assessment yeah yeah should

447
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,520
we include the pre and post photos and the show notes please I think I have it

448
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:24,000
on my phone okay what did you see in your squat assessment I saw you standing

449
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,320
on your right side I saw actually a dent right above your elite crest like

450
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,000
from the compression on the right side I saw a left scapular hike and you were

451
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,080
spinning out slightly to the left which is remarkable to me given how quote-unquote

452
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,400
well I thought I could squat like I guess I could squat deep I had total

453
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,200
balance and control like I could mm-hmm but it's when you showed me the picture

454
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,240
from behind that I was shocked right I mean it was so clear how much I favored

455
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,080
my right side in that spot and you had later you talked about some right knee

456
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,960
pain but yeah it's pretty interesting to watch that spin out it was very clear on

457
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,840
you yeah yeah so tell me about the ribs cuz boy if there's another thing that

458
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:30,600
you just hammer into people it's the ribs yeah it's your center of mass you

459
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:38,040
know it's it it's respiration is one of our constant stresses because you do it

460
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,560
20,000 plus times a day and if you have the same strategy for dealing with

461
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,720
respiration whether it's a big vertical inhale or a big vertical inhale that's

462
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,600
asymmetrical or you know holding your breath it's it has an impact on you so

463
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,080
putting you in making sure that your breath can be wide and three-dimensional

464
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:10,720
and easy is is vital for creating good efficient coordinated movement now for

465
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,600
some people their first exposure to even the awareness of the breath is yoga or

466
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,600
maybe even Pilates if you meditate you know for example if you do Vipassana

467
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,840
meditation you know that we use the breath as a object of focus but it's not

468
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,120
taught I mean in other words it's not a forced breath it's just you're breathing

469
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,400
naturally but you know for me I think Pilates which I did a couple of classes

470
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,200
with my wife back in the day and actually found it quite interesting I

471
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,520
could just never make the time for it was sort of my problem but I distinctly

472
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,120
remember the the woman that was teaching me sort of putting her hands on

473
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:56,800
my back and just sort of having me breathe into her hands and you know

474
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,680
that sort of resonated years later when we started doing some of this stuff and

475
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,360
I was like oh okay that's that's interesting of course by that point I'd

476
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,240
already been really exposed to DNS which you know in and of itself was just you

477
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,200
know an incredible experience to be able to then learn how to breathe into my

478
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,040
pelvis but these things are not mutually exclusive you can breathe wide

479
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,360
and deep and create the right structure within the rib cage correct yes yes

480
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,160
because when you take a full inhale your diaphragm descends which you have two

481
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:36,000
diaphragms right and it they both descend so the more to reverse engineer

482
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,800
it the more productive your exhale is the more productive your inhale is going

483
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,040
to be because if you're if when you exhale your ribs should go into internal

484
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,880
rotation so inhale exhale but if you exhale and they stay put and you go to

485
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,920
inhale again that you just you only have one way to go and that's up and what does

486
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,440
that person look like how does that person show up to you pretty significant

487
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,120
not pretty significant it could be very subtle but usually an interior tilt a

488
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,600
bilateral rib flare retracted scapula sometimes the forward head and what type

489
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,320
of symptoms do they have what's their problem what are they where they struggle

490
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:27,360
plantar fasciitis knee pain hip flexor discomfort anxiety lower back pain

491
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:34,480
shoulder pain neck pain all the pains yeah I mean not all of them but one of

492
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,960
those or two of those or more it's it's kind of amazing how numb we can become

493
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,000
to certain chronic tensions right like the you know that that sort of

494
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,720
consistent nagging trap tightness that you almost forget is there until it's

495
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,080
finally under control right you can finally put your shoulders back down

496
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:07,000
yeah well they can unload yeah so another constant stress is gravity right

497
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:14,560
and how how are you working with or against gravity so if you know if you're

498
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,040
not breathing well for a lack of better words and if you're not dealing with

499
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,520
gravity well that has a high cost you're having to hold this and you're gonna have

500
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:32,600
that loading all of the time so what do you think is the root of that problem

501
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,320
like is there I don't know if we could I mean there's probably some anthropologist

502
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,040
who could speak to this but presumably our ancestors never did more than they

503
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,680
needed to right they would have conserved energy they didn't want to

504
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,440
fight gravity more than they needed to so presumably we evolved in an

505
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,440
environment that didn't promote the movement patterns we have today would

506
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:04,280
you buy that I think that external like stress has a big thing to do with it

507
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:11,520
like not sleeping well not sleeping I'll just say well staring at a screen

508
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,680
because your your eyes are always fixed on the screen so you're missing out a

509
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,400
lot of the peripheral parts of vision which is stressful because you don't

510
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,240
know what's going on around you you know a lot of people think that this just the

511
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,440
sitting part which the sitting part is rough it's never good to be in the same

512
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,480
position all the time but I think it's more of you know your eyes are always

513
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,680
fixed you're worried about meeting a deadline you're worried about money and

514
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,360
so that's interesting so you you know because I would have said oh look the

515
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,360
root cause of this is sitting you're saying it's probably that's just

516
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,680
probably one of the components of it it's sitting plus a lot of chronic

517
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,600
stress as opposed to acute stress because I suspect our ancestors had tons

518
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,240
of acute stress like tiger is there you know this guy's gonna kill me you know

519
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,640
to whatever but but probably not a lot of worry about as you said mortgage

520
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:15,400
payments and divorce and and footwear I'm guessing too has played a pretty

521
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,240
harsh role in this is I got I got to think that going from a minimalist

522
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,600
pattern to a heavily supported pattern has altered our attachment to the ground

523
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,560
well yeah it goes back to that whole thing if you don't use it you lose it

524
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,400
right so if we're never experiencing load through the toes and the forefoot

525
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,160
and you're never it you know feeling your feet so to speak you're gonna lose

526
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,280
that and you're gonna you know with those squishy heels you're gonna kick

527
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,520
back and stop I mean I've literally seen people just standing there and

528
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,040
their toes are just popped up because they don't even know their toes exist

529
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,000
yeah we're what what gave you the evil idea to start doing that toe yoga

530
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,040
actually I got that from FRC actually oh it's a part of their morning routine and

531
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,800
it's funny cuz I it is so hard and I assist a lot of FRC certifications and

532
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,040
to watch these people try it for the first time their brains are about to

533
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,920
explode and they're like holding their breath and squeezing their fingers and I

534
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,680
mean it's a it's basically how well is your brain able to communicate with what

535
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:30,760
your feet can do so was I like in the top 10 worst initial I wasn't great like

536
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,040
was I how bad was I most people trying it for the first time that have never

537
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,360
really tried it aren't great yeah maybe just using your hand as though your hand

538
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,960
is your foot and assuming your thumb is the great toe yes go through the

539
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,520
assessment the whole idea is you want to keep all four bases of support if this

540
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,600
would be my heel and then lifting all five of them up and can they can they

541
00:47:52,600 --> 00:48:01,480
abduct that's huge because a lot of people are like so can they abduct number

542
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,180
one and can you without changing that these guys so no curling can the great

543
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,940
toe go down and then also can the lateral fore go down in the big guy up

544
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:18,740
without with minimal ankle movement just to see if they can dissociate and and

545
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,380
something as simple as that you could make the case that if you're not doing

546
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,340
that your feet aren't fully connected to the ground I mean it shows like how well

547
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,740
your mapping is like if they don't if they can't move if they can't dissociate

548
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:38,700
you probably aren't using them when you walk and that is they're just like

549
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:44,060
fingers they they dampen stress they dampen force and you know you've got

550
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:49,100
people that are you know when you're walking your that force is one time your

551
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,420
body weight but as you start running that increases and as you run faster

552
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:00,220
that increases more so it's just a bunch of just pounding yeah I think I'll never

553
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:05,900
look back I mean I don't own a single pair of non minimalist shoes now for

554
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,860
exercise if not for anything and I just can't imagine not exercising barefoot or

555
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,700
with a minimalist shoe right and making that transition a couple of years ago

556
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:24,340
what a difference it's made to be able to really start to experience my feet I

557
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,900
mean I took it to a whole level for a while I was using toe spacers 24 7 I had

558
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,340
the toe spacers you could wear during exercise I had the ones that you would

559
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:39,580
use to stretch out your toes when you were just sitting around and I mean it

560
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,940
was really a it was a big transition for me I mean I don't know why I don't know

561
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,180
again if that's just a normal pattern for someone who's now crammed their feet

562
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,460
into shoes for so long tight shoes or a big I see that Morton's neuroma just a

563
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,140
tight squeeze and you just you're not using them anymore so your brains like

564
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,620
cool I don't need to think about them anymore yeah and you sort of I don't

565
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,620
know I'm thinking you may have made the example it's like imagine you had a

566
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,820
glove on your whole life and then you took it off but you really had no

567
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,860
ability to move your thumb in a different way from your fingers right how

568
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,060
limited you'd be and your ability to like transmit force to the outside world

569
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,820
and and resist force right and you know people don't think about their toes and

570
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,460
their feet until there's a problem but I mean you have to there are above your

571
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,500
waist is two-thirds of your mass they're basically supporting that mass all the

572
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:43,420
time and pushing you through space so and then actually the way we met was

573
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,780
through Michael which I alluded to and Michael met you through DNS yeah I was

574
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,420
at I think exercise to I met him January right before like a couple weeks

575
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,540
before I met you actually so talk to me about then your foray into dynamic

576
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:07,500
neuro muscular stabilization you know I didn't I never super like did a deep

577
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:14,780
dive into DNS I thought it the positions were great I love you know how you use

578
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,420
your developmental patterns from three months to walking I love kind of reverse

579
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,540
engineering that and putting people in some of those positions I think it's

580
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:32,540
great I love the the talk about developmental you know just skills and

581
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:40,540
how we lose them as we start moving around this um you know I have three kids

582
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:48,220
and my youngest is three and I'm sure my other two did the same thing but I

583
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,420
didn't have an eye for it but now that I've been into DNS for two years

584
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,300
watching my three-year-old move is like being at a DNS seminar with the world's

585
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,980
best teacher right he is like a little prodigy he's little like it's like a

586
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:11,020
little Prague school prodigy and I just can't believe it I just can't believe how

587
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:18,700
innately these kids load perfectly and move perfectly and do so efficiently

588
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:25,020
right like you watch him get up from a from a position without using his hands

589
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:30,900
just rolling his load from the greater trochanter down the femur over to the

590
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,420
knee and boom he's up and it's like he didn't even miss a beat yeah and you just

591
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:43,100
think that the fact that we are born with that neuromuscular control is so

592
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:48,020
humbling is so remarkable is such a testament to evolution right and to

593
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,020
think we flush it down the toilet by the time a kid is six years old right yeah

594
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,180
because they're not they're missing out on the chance to roll around on the floor

595
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:04,340
anymore after they go to school yeah yeah it's I mean that's what we're

596
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:10,140
designed to do move around efficiently and then once you stop it's it stops

597
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:15,900
it's amazing when you look at people as adults and think how did we possibly

598
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,020
come from kids like that and and I guess for people who don't know much about DNS

599
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:24,700
and you know at some point I will absolutely be doing a dedicated podcast

600
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,980
to that as well but basically it you know it came from a school in Prague

601
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,260
that initially I believe was interested in understanding how kids with cerebral

602
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,860
palsy cerebral palsy could be trained right or retrained to move by going back

603
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,900
and teaching them developmental steps that they missed based on what kids

604
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:50,140
without CP learned so it started out as really a PT school that said hey kids

605
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:56,020
with CP missed this step from it from it from a neurologic standpoint and

606
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,820
that's what's completely impaired their movement pattern as adults what if we

607
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:05,980
can as kids train them to do the the non-seat you know to do the kids without

608
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,700
CP do and from there of course it then morphed into wait we could this is a

609
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,900
school of thinking that can help people without CP and so through that lens I've

610
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:22,820
you know I found it to be just you know remarkable but again going back to the

611
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:28,860
way I sort of introduced you most people I interact with are practitioners of one

612
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,540
discipline right they are very steeped in X very steeped in Y or very steeped in

613
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:40,940
Z you don't claim to be the world's expert in any of these things but you

614
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:45,620
like to borrow from all of them including many we won't get to so now

615
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:51,340
let's talk you know fast forward to where we are now which is you know

616
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,820
you're the interloper who's taken from these systems you know and you and I

617
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,940
have had many discussions and maybe you're you'd like to share there are

618
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,580
aspects of each of these systems you actually don't find particularly helpful

619
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,660
is there any that stand out that you're like you know for the work I do I don't

620
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:15,860
think this aspect of PRI or FRC or DNS is helpful I don't think you're gonna

621
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:22,060
offend anyone I know you're worried about I think that I like to look at the

622
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,620
human that I'm working with and you know sometimes doing cards is not what they

623
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:34,500
need you know what I mean so they might need more distal control more distal

624
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,260
load tolerance they might need just to control their rib cage so then and

625
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:44,380
they're hyper stress and I call them hot with anxiety they might need to just lay

626
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:49,580
down and breathe to kind of tap into that parasympathetic side that PRI

627
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,820
would give you sometimes people need to be up regulated so doing a higher

628
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:59,660
intensity pale and rail would be great but nothing's a one-size-fits-all

629
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:05,660
because we're all so different yeah I remember you once talking about I

630
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,420
remember what the example was but it was a great one I wish I wrote it down about

631
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:17,020
oh I remember most people are of the mindset that a knee

632
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,820
valgus is a no-no and we want to do everything we can to avoid it maybe

633
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:26,740
explain to folks what a knee valgus is so when you're doing a lunge for example

634
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:31,940
the knee would cave in towards your midline right and I think for most part

635
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:37,420
people would agree we'd like to minimize that yeah but you don't take a purist

636
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:43,860
view of that your view is not that you know knee valgus is evil no I say train

637
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,740
you because it happens sometimes and if you have someone with a chronic knee

638
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:55,020
problem or discomfort or pain let's put them in that position and teach them how

639
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:59,340
to own it because that might be part of it you know what I mean your brain's

640
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,820
number one job is to keep you safe to protect you if every time you go into

641
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:07,940
valgus it doesn't feel comfortable that could be a part of the problem so train

642
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,060
knee valgus because it's going to happen in life you're going to bend down to

643
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,340
pick something off the floor and your knee is not going to be perfectly in

644
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:21,060
line with your hip and your second toe it's going to happen so if every time

645
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,540
that happens there's pain or discomfort let's figure out why and see if we train

646
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:31,300
it if it's less discomfort now does that mean you would let somebody deadlift

647
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:39,380
heavy with a valgus not necessarily well it depends I'm not having a lot of

648
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,660
people max out let's be real and things get ugly when you max out but if you're

649
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:51,540
lifting at 65 70 75% I think they should be pretty yeah I really do it that is a

650
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:57,020
deadlifting is a sport and I think that unless you're a power lifter and most of

651
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,060
the people I'm working with or not like when I maxed out my debt my heaviest

652
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:07,900
deadlift it was not like it was ugly and I trained for things to be pretty but if

653
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,300
you're just training someone in the gym and they want a deadlift like keep it

654
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:16,020
keep it to a dull roar keep it conscious pay attention and keep the

655
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:22,380
tech as technically sound as you can so how much of movement do you think is

656
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,940
kind of or should be conscious versus should be subconscious like how do you

657
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:34,300
and I guess let's start with two types of movement let's start with basic

658
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,260
movement walking you know grabbing something out of the cupboard etc and

659
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,340
then let's talk about something very advanced like a deadlift or you know

660
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:48,500
pick your favorite sport right I think that movement everyday life should be as

661
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:54,020
subconscious as possible I think you know a lot of people that are in pain or

662
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:58,140
discomfort or worried about hurting themselves have this really big but

663
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,860
bracing strategy in their trunk and that doesn't leave a lot of space for things

664
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,060
to go wrong things going wrong meaning like your dog running in front of you or

665
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:12,100
lights turning out that could be very broad but to create a person who is

666
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,100
reactive and adaptive and resilient so to speak they have to be able to respond

667
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,140
to different changes in their environment so if you're so fixated on

668
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:29,460
making things so conscious that space is out the window so opening a cabinet and

669
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,860
grabbing a cup should be pretty subconscious you should have enough trust

670
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:40,180
in your limbs for your midline to reflexively load so your nervous

671
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:43,820
system doesn't have to think about that so much now most people when they do

672
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:49,100
that are doing it subconsciously but what if as you evaluate them doing these

673
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:54,740
things you realize their movement pattern is unsafe and is going to be you

674
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,100
know leave them susceptible to injury how do you take them from

675
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,460
subconsciously doing something incorrectly to subconsciously doing it

676
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:08,780
correctly being very cautious about it so if if there are muscles around their

677
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,260
spine are quite loaded like meaning they're an extension I would have them

678
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,300
work in a way to unload them to give them a little more space because this

679
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:27,500
has a high cost things are working yeah my posture isn't the best I've always

680
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,580
noticed this what is it about posture and what does it tell us there's no bad

681
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:39,020
posture that's my biggest pet peeve actually and every person that I do an

682
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,300
assessment on the first thing is like what's wrong with your posture there's

683
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,300
nothing wrong with your posture I know I love how you love this thing all right

684
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:54,300
let's talk about posture okay the only time it's bad posture is when you don't

685
01:00:54,300 --> 01:01:00,460
have another option like if this is your only option that ain't great if

686
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:05,020
this is your only option that ain't great you should be able to move all

687
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:10,100
sorts of ways and have options because that's when things go wrong when life

688
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:15,140
presents you something and you don't have that tool so training people in

689
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,580
different postures is very important exposing them to different postures

690
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:28,740
allowing their you know midline stability to be reflexive and not brace

691
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,260
and not brace on one side being able to load and unload accordingly so how does

692
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:42,500
one translate that to something like okay I'm sitting at a desk and I'm gonna

693
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:49,660
be typing for a while is the idea that one should vary their position from you

694
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:57,220
know I'm here I'm here you know move it around like what's the what's the sin is

695
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:02,460
the sin staying in one position for as long as possible I think yes I think get

696
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:07,140
up and move because I even find I do more computer work now than I ever have

697
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,380
especially since Covid and I'll find myself because you your no

698
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,660
perception just kind of turns off like you forget that you're supposed to

699
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:23,940
actually move so it goes back to that whole thing if you don't use it you but

700
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:29,540
what about certain things like you know for example we don't we know that too

701
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:37,540
much looking down is going to create unbelievable cervical you know strain I

702
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:42,020
don't know if I can answer that I don't I honestly don't know if I can answer

703
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,860
that because you know there has been studies where no you know there's it's

704
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,580
just like saying if you're deadlifting with a flex fine all the time there has

705
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,860
been studies that it doesn't create any problems but you know I would have to

706
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,100
you would have to do an assessment to see the full picture of the human to see

707
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:06,060
so what's going on what do you think makes that difference because I agree

708
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:10,060
with you that there are two people that can have the exact same movement

709
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:14,580
patterns and yet one gets injured and one doesn't and what do you attribute

710
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:21,900
that to or what what could explain those differences how they tolerate load and

711
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,700
is that genetic or is it a function of these other stressors in their lives I

712
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,020
guess it could I guess it could be genetic but I would probably say more

713
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:35,500
environmental I don't know if I can answer that a hundred percent but I

714
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:40,340
would definitely if I had to like make a guess I would say more environmental

715
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:47,140
stress how how are they tolerating load you know someone might be able to really

716
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:52,620
tolerate load well like this for whatever reason so how do you then

717
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:58,420
incorporate that into what you do so when you see somebody and you assess them

718
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:08,300
how do you know if what you're seeing is a problem versus an adaptation there's

719
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,820
no way to answer that like it's kind of one of those things which came first the

720
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:18,180
chicken or the egg all I can do is address what I see so if I see them

721
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:24,780
standing there and their response to gravity is to be here then I would want

722
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,820
to give them a different option for that this is not bad but it could be

723
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,740
causing them discomfort so let's see if we give them a different option if that

724
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:40,620
gets them out of discomfort and makes them more adaptable you know I also do a

725
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:46,860
lot of like visual and vestibular testing just to see I obviously too much

726
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,580
of that is out of my scope of practice but if they have a glaring vestibular

727
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:58,860
issue I'm gonna train head movements to make them more responsive and I guess

728
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,340
part of it could also be what they're presenting with symptomatically I mean it

729
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,740
so it so I when I showed up and met you I was complaining of right SI joint pain

730
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:14,640
and then my movement pattern matched why I would have that pain right if I had

731
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,500
shown up with the exact same movement pattern but no pain whatsoever would you

732
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:27,460
have taken me down the same path of correction probably to some degree

733
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:33,820
because you had less stretch ability or mobility on the right side of your rib

734
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:39,900
cage so I would want to give you that option yeah what do you remember sort of

735
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:45,380
the general path you took me down how did how did we sort of address that

736
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:51,200
issue plus the scapular gooeyness probably my two biggest issues right we

737
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,760
did a lot of breathing work with you in the beginning a lot of still do a lot

738
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,860
of compressive work because you were presenting with a pretty significant

739
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:06,560
bilateral rib flare like that was your strategy for deadlifting for life for

740
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,400
walking down the street and I like how you say it that way I like how you

741
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,260
describe it as a strategy to me that's it's funny too it's making light of it

742
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,140
like because you know how much I love talking about objective and strategy and

743
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:25,740
tactics so it's like I have a strategy everyone I'm going to flare the hell out

744
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:31,680
of my ribs not just on one side on both sides make it real hard that is how I'm

745
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:38,340
gonna get through the day mm-hmm and what so when I flare those ribs I'm gonna go

746
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:44,220
into much more lumbar extension right you're pretty and you have a history of

747
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:50,620
you know with your surgery and and that could be you know maybe part of the

748
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:56,620
reason yeah you know an apprehension thing you're afraid maybe to let those

749
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:02,980
unload so so my QL's which are these they are big muscles in the lower part of

750
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:10,340
your back loaded they're locked and loaded 24 7 ready for anything and

751
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,580
that's not uncommon there's a lot of people that go through life locked and

752
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,380
loaded in the QL's ribs flared mm-hmm interior tilt of the pelvis yeah high

753
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:27,300
cost limits variability yeah it makes it's so interesting to me because to go

754
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:32,100
back to my favorite the scaps it it impacts your gate you can't swing your

755
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:36,900
arms anymore when you're like that so then you can't move the rib cage to load

756
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:44,020
the leg and it it has it changes a lot of things how long does it take to

757
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:50,460
typically unwind that type of a pattern in somebody long time and it's it can

758
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,420
make it a hard sell because people will feel better once they start to learn how

759
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:01,540
to either load things that need to be loaded or unload things that need to be

760
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:06,820
unloaded they'll feel better but it takes a while to kind of stick so to

761
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,860
speak and it can be it can be frustrating for sure because it's a

762
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:18,700
process so how do you motivate someone to do this I mean you've worked with many

763
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,100
of my patients I want to have you working with many more of them and

764
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,100
you're right it's a hard sell there are a lot of people who are like that's not

765
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:35,660
for me I got my trainer we we do we do really fun stuff with you know boxing

766
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:41,380
mitts and yeah body weight stuff and TRX and we do our thing three times a week

767
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,900
I don't need to meet Beth and do her silly exercises yeah it feels good to

768
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:52,300
crush it I mean it feels good when I crush it like I I love it the jumping

769
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:57,940
around heart rate going through the roof like that feels good but if that's all

770
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,900
you do you're limiting your options and you're not efficient while you're doing

771
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:09,020
it and when things have a high cost they either break or it just makes it much

772
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:16,300
harder so what is your strategy then for communicating to people the importance

773
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:21,220
of this or do you not do that and just say look you're not in the in the you're

774
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,340
not in the position of trying to explain to people the value of this it's either

775
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,740
they're gonna see it or they're not and the ones who see it you're gonna guide

776
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,100
them and the ones who don't they have to wait until they get to that point in

777
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:37,460
time I mean I educate the best I can I try to I'm very real when why is it

778
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,020
happening I mean I don't want to use anybody's names including those people

779
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,820
who have spoken publicly about you but but what do you think it is that's there

780
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,820
are some people who the moment I introduce you to them it's like love at

781
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:54,300
first sight there's an immediate connection and they immediately respond

782
01:09:54,380 --> 01:10:03,980
to what seems like a reduction of pace what seems like 25 steps backwards what

783
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,260
what do you think are the traits common to people and I would put myself in that

784
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:13,740
category I mean I basically stopped doing any bilateral hip hinging for six

785
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:18,460
months I didn't do a deadlift I didn't do a squat you had me doing only very

786
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:24,340
light split leg movement for six months yeah I mean it was kind of infuriating

787
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:32,340
I remember so pissed but I believed you that there's something I don't know what

788
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:38,020
it is I think I just believed it's I think there's just little you can see

789
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:43,500
little improvements like oh my feet don't hurt quite as bad as they used to

790
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:49,020
or I could you know I'm always I'm always reassessing like I want people

791
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:55,140
and taking photos of everyone I want people to see and even if it's this much

792
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,180
I'm like but we're going in the right direction and it's going if it's done

793
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:04,620
right it's gonna be this much at a time if you see vast improvements it's just

794
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:10,100
it's not gonna stick that's just not the way we work so I'm always taking pictures

795
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,740
of people I'm always you know it's very subjective like my feet feel better and

796
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:20,820
I ran another an extra half a mile and I had no you know pain that's a win like

797
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:26,700
you have to point out the wins yeah I'm trying to think back I mean I think at

798
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,500
some point clearly my right SI joint stop hurting in fact it's been so long

799
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,980
I it's hard to even remember what it felt like that's a that's a huge win but

800
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:40,940
I'm trying to think what it what it took to get there I remember for me one of

801
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:45,540
the wins and this will be hard to explain but it's the first time you had

802
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:52,580
me lay on my back so knees are up feet are flat okay so we had this was you

803
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,700
trying to get me to contract my left hamstring do you remember this yeah I

804
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:03,260
think so so it's basically so knees up right and it's contract push and pull

805
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:08,540
push and pull with a pelvic tilt without losing the tilt without losing

806
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:14,540
the pelvic tilt and I couldn't do that you would want to fire abs to make it

807
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:22,340
happen yes and then my pelvis would flip the wrong way and it's like why can't I

808
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:30,060
control this left hamstring mm-hmm and that was really weird and I was like oh

809
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,580
I'll never be able to do this like this is you might as well ask me to grow an

810
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:41,380
extra foot and then one day it just happened like I don't it might have not

811
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,540
been that long it might have been like a month later it was like oh my god this

812
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:50,540
is so easy now because I think when we first started doing it there was an aid

813
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:57,660
I forget what the aid you put me on a block right and now it's like oh my god

814
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:02,380
like I can do that totally I can do that blindfolded on the flat ground it's

815
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:09,340
it's so easy to find as you like to put it to find my hamstrings to me those

816
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,540
were kind of some of those those were some of the things that said oh my god

817
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:16,060
these really little things they start to work I mean the people that are

818
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:23,900
successful like you pay attention when they practice and that's it's hard to

819
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,460
pay attention especially to the same thing all the time when for the longest

820
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:31,780
time it it will turn on and turn off and turn on and turn off and it can be

821
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:38,000
so frustrating for sure but having that control over your body you have to pay

822
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,100
attention to control it well I definitely am looking forward to to

823
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:49,260
working on you know kind of creating a cool curriculum around how to teach some

824
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:54,700
of this stuff with you because as you know this centenarian Olympics is sort

825
01:13:54,700 --> 01:14:01,260
of my obsession and I think honestly unless you're you know training for the

826
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,860
Olympics or your professional athlete whose livelihood depends on what you do

827
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,900
here and now everybody should be training for the centenarian Olympics

828
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,660
what other sport matters that's why you should exercise yeah then being the best

829
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:20,020
person who's in their 90s who can crush everything and everything should be an

830
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,860
extrapolation backwards from that and it kind of begins with all of these

831
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:30,980
things around strength stability movement control all of these systems I

832
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:36,140
think one of the things that you've discovered through COVID is you can do a

833
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:43,140
lot of this remotely I can and it's so funny because I have so many requests on

834
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:49,100
social media for online training I was like no way uh-uh and then COVID hit and

835
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:55,700
I basically I was like sorry guys I'm shut it's shut down and I started doing

836
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,380
you know 10 12 virtual sessions a day and it was such a learning curve and it

837
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,940
was so challenging so what did you learn like what what is it that has enabled

838
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,700
you to become about as good as anybody out there virtually training you gotta

839
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:13,060
you have to be very clear with your words and it's you know it was for me it

840
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:18,220
was practice paying attention and practicing you just you have to be very

841
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,820
clear where you want them to be and what you want them to do and you know

842
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:27,540
demonstrate and now do you find it so I remember the very first time we did a

843
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,980
virtual session which was probably in March actually it might have been April

844
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:35,660
because I remember thinking I don't want to do it it's gonna suck it's gonna be

845
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:40,020
a waste of time and I was but I was just also like in Beth withdrawal and I was

846
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:46,820
like okay fine I'll do it and I was like so pleasantly surprised at like how

847
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:51,860
efficient it was it felt like 90% of what we had done in person do you think

848
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:56,500
that's only because we had already worked in person and you knew me enough

849
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,780
actually no I have so many patients now that I've never met in real life it's

850
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:08,300
it's interesting like so many probably now more than I've never met in real

851
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,220
life that I actually have worked with and put my hands on and that might be

852
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:20,500
increasing so and and and do you find that it's just a vocabulary issue that

853
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,740
the patients need to understand like I'm trying to imagine how hard it would be to

854
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:31,340
explain to somebody for the first time what protraction with depression of the

855
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:35,900
scapula is like at least I had the luxury of always knowing what those words

856
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,820
meant just from medicine but that's that's hard stuff for normal people

857
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:46,420
don't who don't have the lingo training what I found because we have a pretty

858
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:51,500
extensive exercise library now is they'll get the first kind of introduction

859
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:56,900
with me as I'm doing our assessment and then they can see the video and I think

860
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,500
it actually makes for better learning because they've been exposed to it they

861
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,660
can kind of review the video and then feel it out for themselves and then

862
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,940
we'll check in in a couple weeks and it's like wow that's really cleaned up I

863
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,780
think it makes for better learning because you have to have more

864
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:17,700
responsibility to do it on your own you know yeah now the other part of this is

865
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,020
you know someone listening to this might think well I mean do you actually do any

866
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:26,180
real training with these patients like yeah and and then that's it my favorite

867
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,220
story is the guy who what did he decide he was gonna pay you a thousand dollars

868
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:35,020
for every inch you put on his butt he did and he did pay you he did pay me

869
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,540
three thousand dollars today actually too I'm working on another too yeah

870
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:43,940
you're gonna get it you're gonna get a couple thousand more dollars I love that

871
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:49,060
I love that bet that was the best one ever totally no we I like to lift I

872
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,660
totally like to lift I'm a meat-headed heart so what are some lifts that you

873
01:17:53,660 --> 01:18:00,020
just think everybody male female thick thin should be doing like what is I mean

874
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,180
you're a huge deadlift fanatic like oh yeah we trap bar and straight bar every

875
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,340
single week is there anybody who you don't like putting through deadlifts a

876
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:15,580
lot of people yeah is it because they can't do it yet or I just for me I love

877
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,420
split leg work I mean I personally hate split leg work and I make myself do it

878
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:24,740
but it's so applicable to real life so tell people like what is when you say

879
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,820
split leg work tell people what you mean split squats walking lunges single leg

880
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:34,780
guardiels you know I you just get so much bang for your buck as far as like

881
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:40,500
hip stability and you know just kind of owning your movements as opposed to

882
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,740
bilateral work which you could kind of wriggle yourself around I think part of

883
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:50,100
the single leg tragedy I use tragedy kind of lightly is it exposed it's like

884
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,300
the it's like the tide going out and seeing who's doesn't have their bathing

885
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:59,660
suit on you really understand what's wrong right right absolutely because

886
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,260
you're you know you're only as good on two legs as you are on one I think yeah

887
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,300
so so is it your goal to get everybody to be able to do a deadlift at some

888
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:16,140
point if they want to yes I think but I to be a successful you're saying you can

889
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:21,020
get somebody you with a bunch of split leg work you can you can functionally

890
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:26,960
get them to do the same stuff yes okay yes and you know the whole thing is is

891
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,240
like how well can they do their work without you know holding their breath

892
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,880
and how well do they actually own that work how much of their legs actually

893
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,840
working because you can wriggle yourself around and use you know anti-gravity

894
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:47,000
stuff and just like you do walking through life so I want to see how with

895
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,480
how much integrity can you do that are things coordinating well together is it

896
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:56,640
efficient can you actually breathe because that's important so what are

897
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,200
some of the things I mean you've seen my list I think of 20 activities I want

898
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:07,600
to do be able to do in my 90s and maybe not talking about what your specific

899
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,800
events are in your centenarian Olympics what are some of the principles of your

900
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:17,200
centenarian Olympics in other words what is a 95 year old Beth either want to be

901
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,600
able to do specifically or conceptually I want to be able to be independent okay

902
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,360
yeah like I want to be able to walk to the grocery store and carry it all back

903
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,160
just like I do now you know I want to be able to walk upstairs you know I

904
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,800
personally want to still be able to do a pull-up and a push-up just one at least

905
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,040
and you know dance is such a big part of my life I want to be able to keep up

906
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,760
like it's not gonna be as pretty as it was when I'm now but let's talk about

907
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,520
dance because that's I mean there's so much going on there like and we have

908
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,520
patients that you take care of for whom dances their life they're in their 60s

909
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:03,840
there you know and they couldn't be in better hands because to be working with

910
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,240
someone who knows the discipline and then knows what challenges lie ahead

911
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:12,120
what does it mean to be able to dance into your 90s because that's a whole new

912
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,760
level of coordination balance from just walking right it totally it's just

913
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,520
there's more variables but I think just being able to recall what you've just

914
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:26,800
learned cognitively it's so good for you to be able to put your body in

915
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:32,560
different positions and have those options I think is wonderful I think

916
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,080
every you know I have a couple actually have an 80 year old and I make him

917
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,880
recall choreography very simple like it's nothing fancy or flary but it's

918
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,360
like a jazz box step touch and I'll do it in different orders and make him

919
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,960
recall it because I want him to think I want him to pay attention do you make

920
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,040
him do that thing I do with the little colored little things I have to hit I

921
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:59,520
brought the blaze pods no but I do play other like the switched on game that I

922
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:04,360
played with you just you know I want to know that he can respond and if he trips

923
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,120
great he's learning how to not fall and then he has to recover from the trip

924
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:15,360
actually it's you know I'll have him do step like tap-ups on a short box and

925
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,720
then I'll call out a different number he's got to change movements and like

926
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,760
not miss a beat making him be reactive and pay attention and multitask can can

927
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:35,160
balance be trained yes so you can take a person whose balance is oh so so and

928
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,720
make it better yes and preserve it presumably yes it's a top-down and a

929
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:44,280
bottom-up approach but yes so say more about how you would do that after an

930
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,320
assessment I you know they might have a vestibular discrepancy and they need to

931
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,080
be exposed to loading their vestibular system because a lot of time balance is

932
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,560
basically how are you dealing with gravity how well are you dealing with

933
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,960
gravity so or as you would like to say what's your strategy for dealing with

934
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:09,280
gravity a great strategy you know I would do I would do basic vestibular

935
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,400
training with them you know just is that some of the stuff you have me do where

936
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:16,600
my eyes are closed yeah well I would have them do yeah eyes closed to work

937
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,400
proprioception of the lower leg because you need for your lower legs to be

938
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,560
adaptive and reflexive because I've always felt I don't have good balance

939
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,520
right and I feel like I feel like it's improved yeah and I just feel like ever

940
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,840
since I mean when I was young when I was in my teens I badly sprained both of my

941
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,680
ankles like probably it's a miracle I didn't tear all the ligaments but I feel

942
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,720
like they got stretched to the point where like my ability to everton invert

943
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:51,960
my foot now is comical the laxity of those and I feel like from that point

944
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,420
forward my balance just yeah I mean never was the same with injury chronic

945
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:01,960
pain surgeries that can disrupt mapping yeah so it can really impact your

946
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,560
proprioception but part of my centenarian olympics goals like one of my centenarian

947
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:13,120
goals is a balance goal right because I realize things that we can all do now

948
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,120
you you just take for granted now boy when you're 90 like no way I mean

949
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,000
everything naturally declines anyway so I mean that's and that's what I tell my

950
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,680
40 and 50 something I'm like yeah you're great now but that's not gonna stay

951
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:32,240
great and the more you ignore it the worse it's gonna get I'm not saying we

952
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,480
should all like you know be standing there with our eyes closed for a whole

953
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:41,080
session but it's okay to check in oh yeah I mean I'm as you know I'm pretty

954
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:48,640
hard-nosed about this stuff because my view is the decline is nonlinear and I

955
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:53,800
don't think the average person especially if they don't have a great

956
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,880
facility with numbers and mathematics you know most people don't comprehend

957
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,640
nonlinearity we're pretty good at understanding linearity mm-hmm well

958
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,440
between the ages of 20 and 30 this thing went up by you know this amount yeah it's

959
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,760
gonna go up the same amount from 30 to 40 we can we can comprehend that but when

960
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,240
you think about the physical decline a person experiences from 20 to 30 and

961
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:24,440
then 30 to 40 and then 40 to 50 most people are like yeah I kind of got a

962
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,720
handle on that and what they don't realize is that the rate of decline is

963
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:33,760
going much it's just it's accelerating so dramatically and what you do from 50

964
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,920
to 60 to 70 is amazing now again people who have you know been able to watch

965
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,600
their parents age or have spent enough time around people who are elderly will

966
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,560
realize that if you don't put an astronomical amount of work into it the

967
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,040
decline that occurs between 60 and 70 and 80 is from another world yeah it's

968
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,760
interesting because I have a client named Barry I'm just I'm in love with

969
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,280
very 80 year old Barry oh my god I post them on my social media all the time he

970
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,760
can do six trick push-ups now like he's he's a badass but when I met Barry I

971
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,200
guess three years ago now he couldn't get up and down off the floor without

972
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,480
assistance he was in so much discomfort walking around because he spent 50 years

973
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:25,080
just working like you know very successful making money doing his thing

974
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:33,360
but trading health for wealth but Barry is an animal like I have to tell Barry

975
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:41,440
to stop going to the gym twice a day so much attention into it and he does all

976
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:46,280
my little like weird coordination things and balances with his eyes closed but

977
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:53,320
Barry is incredible and he I mean he's 80 doing like I call it the Barry get up

978
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,800
like his get up variation and he can get off the floor from his back only

979
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,000
using one hand touching the floor that is so important right and let's talk

980
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,280
about that for a second because if you're a 40 year old and you can't do

981
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:12,320
that there's a problem so every 40 year old can do that but that becomes so hard

982
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,600
when you're 80 yeah I mean it's yeah and and and it's important to also

983
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,680
understand what the implication of not being able to do that is right there's a

984
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,240
safety part of this right if you can't get up all and if you fall and you can't

985
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,720
get up without someone assisting you there's an enormous safety problem if

986
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,320
you live alone or something like that let's put that aside for a moment and

987
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,520
just talk quality of life a big part of the centenarian Olympics as we do this

988
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:45,520
with our patients is getting them to you know literally do the exercise right so

989
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:52,760
you 47 years old now your kids are 12 6 and 3 and now map forward add you know

990
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,080
45 years to where you are add it to the kids extrapolate how old the grandkids

991
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,720
are going to be and maybe the great grandkids and it all kind of works back

992
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:08,480
to this thing that says when you're that age what's going to matter well I know

993
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,640
that when I'm that age it's not going to be podcasting it's not going to be

994
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:16,560
working it's not going to be you know it's it's basically going to be yeah it's

995
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,280
gonna be enjoying what's left of time with friends family and doing activities

996
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:25,240
that I like and nothing else and a big part of that because I still have the

997
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:32,600
luxury of having young kids is kids play low like kids play down they're on the

998
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:40,280
ground and you can basically be stuck in a rocking chair sitting back in the room

999
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:45,280
and not being a participant with them or you can get with the get the doll

1000
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,480
play in the dollhouse get the Lego get the trucks and get on the floor and if

1001
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:55,320
you could get up off that floor using your own you support that's a huge

1002
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,400
difference from because you're more likely to do it than if you can't get on

1003
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,560
the ground and get up because if you can't get up on your own I just think

1004
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,360
you're gonna be less likely to do it and I think if you're less likely to do it

1005
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:10,120
you're gonna start to pull back and distance yourself from those activities

1006
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:17,240
it's a whole like spirit thing too right yeah so what do you think about these

1007
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:24,200
guys these muscles here your abs my abs your six pack yours in particular no no no just in general

1008
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:29,680
I mean they're a thing if you're a bodybuilder they're a thing it's not a

1009
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:35,600
big deal yeah I noticed like there's no abs like I'm not doing crunches and I'm

1010
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,440
not doing a lot of you know hanging knee raises and stuff like that and I'm

1011
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,440
not paying we're not paying any attention to my six-pack yeah I mean do

1012
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:50,560
you need quick flexion or your gymnast no no yeah and you know that rigidity can

1013
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,080
impact your ability to be adaptable and reflexive I've actually been doing a lot

1014
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:00,600
of study with I can integrated kinetic neurology which they do they have a big

1015
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:06,360
like top-down bottom-up approach and their whole thing is is like you know

1016
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:12,840
to make a resilient robust human how reflexive can you be that's the whole

1017
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,200
thing because inevitably you know something's gonna go wrong and you have

1018
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:22,840
to be able to respond and if you have a bracing strategy you can't you lose

1019
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:26,520
variability things can't go wrong because you can't handle it and then

1020
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,960
that lessens your options this is something that I think probably only in

1021
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,200
the last three months have I really started to be more aware of and maybe

1022
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:41,520
it's just that you're doing more pointing it out to me which is how often

1023
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:47,280
I do revert to bracing my rectus abdominis muscles for pretty much

1024
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:53,120
everything we've made some huge strides in your deadlift the past like four or

1025
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,400
five weeks because of that just teaching you like you don't need to

1026
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:02,800
brace like you're picking up a car it's only 275 only you know yeah yeah when

1027
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:07,600
we're doing relatively light stuff yeah I'm hindering myself by overdoing it

1028
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:13,560
totally totally and you know when you have that much attention on your bracing

1029
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:19,280
you can't think about your legs but even this the simpler stuff we should probably

1030
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,160
do a demonstration when we get into the gym later today of the the breathing

1031
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:29,840
exercises where my heels are up on the block you know the difference of being

1032
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,440
able to do that posterior tilt with your hamstrings yeah to use the hamstring

1033
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:41,760
versus the rectus abdominis to tilt the pelvis is everything yeah and not saying

1034
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,240
that that's the only way that you would do that but that's a different option

1035
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:50,520
most people don't have that you know so I want them to have that every time you

1036
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,480
take a step and have to use your hamstring you should not have to tip

1037
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:59,880
into an anterior tilt or you shouldn't have to brace you know I mean you are so

1038
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,760
obsessed with the posterior chain it's really it's just such a beautiful thing

1039
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:10,080
one of my favorite exercises that I've never done until I met you is kneeling

1040
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,960
curls so why do we do our curls kneeling as opposed to standing because I

1041
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,280
want to get a lot of bang for your buck at that bicep curl I want you to have to

1042
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,680
use your hamstrings to keep you from falling forward because you're loaded in

1043
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:29,360
the front and if you're playing with scapular protraction as well you're

1044
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,560
getting a lot of like reflexive ab tone you should feel abs and hamstrings

1045
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,080
they're like I love it yeah in fact I kind of do it as a hamstring exercise

1046
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,760
that makes me feel so good I actually taught you something no it really does

1047
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:49,320
like I I do it as part of my hamstring loop right it's great because I don't

1048
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,920
find doing biceps all that exciting it's like one of those things it's kind of a

1049
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,080
chore for me you laugh at my little skinny arms but I it's such a great

1050
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:03,080
hamstring exercise yeah I mean like I'm not and I love a bicep curl I have

1051
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:07,360
people do it you know it can really assist with loading tolerance to help

1052
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,520
with shoulder pain and all of it but if you're gonna do it you might as well be

1053
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:18,360
in a good position good position yeah to get more out of it any other sort of

1054
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,760
general principle so again I'm trying to think of all my Beth isms there's so

1055
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,520
many but but your your obsession with hamstrings is is is sort of comical well

1056
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:33,200
they help hold your pelvis in place is that I'm just trying to figure out how

1057
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,480
much of that was just specific to my pathology or is that something that is

1058
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,680
generally a theme for most people because it took me a while to

1059
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:44,120
understand the why right which is and again if it took me a while I think it's

1060
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,440
gonna take the average person a while because the anatomy I mean I could at

1061
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,840
least picture the anatomy of the pelvis here the Istio tuberosities the

1062
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:58,680
attachments of the hamstrings and if you have no control over those guys pelvis

1063
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:04,200
is all the way over here you've got and so how do you do this well again this is

1064
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,760
a great way to explain it Peter strategy is flex the muscle in front

1065
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:15,240
shorten the muscle in front and you lift up from the symphysis pubis right so

1066
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,760
you've got the pelvis wraps around here you've got the symphysis pubis is the

1067
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:23,640
attachment of the rectus abdominis so one strategy to pick this thing up is

1068
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,400
shorten this muscle that's flexing your abs that's always been my strategy oh

1069
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:32,480
yeah but that makes it impossible to get a good exhale exactly because where's

1070
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,800
the other attachment it's to my xiphoid which is in the middle of this rib cage

1071
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:41,480
so that strategy sucks and then people are like you have great posture though

1072
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:47,520
yeah and you have nice abs right fabulous but how do you feel right and

1073
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:53,640
so and I always thought well my hamstrings are totally strong but I had

1074
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,960
no control over them that's the and that that was a fundamental difference I

1075
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,200
don't think I had weak hamstrings I could never I couldn't on-demand get

1076
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,000
them right and therefore I was never accessing them when I needed to and it's

1077
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,800
funny like when we met my deadlifts were basically quad dominant movements

1078
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:17,360
right you would kind of slip your knees forward and scoot under it yeah which is

1079
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,280
it's a good strategy if you're trying to use your quads and you don't care that

1080
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:27,760
much about your back right totally yeah hamstrings hamstrings hamstrings hamstrings

1081
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,240
toes it's a thing yeah how many people that you work with are in sort of

1082
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:37,280
chronic real pain because I don't think that my you know right SI joint was

1083
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,240
constituted chronic pain but but do you have people that come to you that are

1084
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:47,840
really suffering from something significant I have in the past and a lot

1085
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,960
of it is just kind of down regulating to kind of if you don't you have to make

1086
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:58,440
space for them to make change and if you're really hot like I like to call

1087
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,800
it you have to let them down regulate a bit so just totally like neurologically

1088
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:08,040
yeah like those are the people I'll have you know put your feet on the wall it's

1089
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:14,760
just our breathing hmm yeah you mentioned rowing at the outset so you

1090
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,960
started teaching at City Row I guess it's been them now three months you've

1091
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:25,960
had me rowing that's funny I rode for you know a year in college and I used to

1092
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:31,160
do a lot of work on an erg I think every human should row but the funny thing is

1093
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:35,920
I was clearly never my technique was obviously not very good I was getting by

1094
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:43,320
on a lot of brute force and now that you've got me doing it correctly it's

1095
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:48,720
it's much more difficult I mean it's difficult maybe the wrong word it's much

1096
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,360
more involved is the right word it's much more involved what what stemmed your

1097
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,320
obsession with rowing aside from the fact that you know City Row was across

1098
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:02,360
the street from you when you started well you know I had to do a lot of

1099
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:09,560
research for them to kind of help develop a program so I tried to make like

1100
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,320
an Apple version of rowing like very you know easy to follow but the more I would

1101
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:21,040
practice I was like wow this is really getting me to move backwards and you

1102
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,000
know a lot of people don't move backwards so they lose a sense of back

1103
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,720
space and that puts you in a great position to breathe in your back space

1104
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:36,280
to reach with your shoulder blades to actually use your legs to push and it's

1105
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:41,920
like I've a lot of people that were in a pretty high amount of back pain I put

1106
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,840
them on a rower and a lot of things cleaned up which again is very

1107
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,240
counterintuitive yeah you would normally say someone with lower back pain should

1108
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:59,040
never be rowing just like they should never be deadlifting right yeah and maybe

1109
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,240
we should even do a little bit of that when we're in the gym later today which

1110
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:08,600
is what is it about teaching somebody the correct sequence of events on a

1111
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,760
rowing machine you want to walk us through what a perfect stroke looks like

1112
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,440
in recovery so a lot of it's about finesse like when do you grip when do you

1113
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:21,560
relax you have to let yourself relax and most of the stroke is actually relaxed

1114
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:26,320
so coming from catch position the in it's like you're at the very front it's

1115
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:32,520
like a wedge on a deadlift explain the wedge I love the wedge not just a good

1116
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:38,320
salad so it's basically the position that you've that you get in before you

1117
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:43,400
stand up with the weight so you want to wedge into the floor so you so the wedge

1118
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:52,040
has tension it's the preload is what the way I think of it yes yes you starting

1119
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:56,480
catch position you have the wedge you drive back through your legs you have a

1120
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,040
nice tight grip because you have to connect yourself to the machine that's

1121
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,200
what makes rowing so different from the like deadlifting is it's kind of a loose

1122
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:07,680
situation so you have to really grab then so rowing would be easier if there

1123
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:11,680
was more resistance at the front exactly because you'd feel it'd be easier

1124
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,880
to connect to the thing that you're tensing up against exactly that's what a

1125
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,200
lot of people have a hard time with and the catch is feeling that tension and a

1126
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,440
lot of times because they're losing segmentation of the mid spine and there

1127
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,480
you know it's it's hard to create tension when you don't have anything to

1128
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:31,480
push against it's challenging yes from there you drive back once your hands get

1129
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,560
right so who's doing the work right now which muscles legs legs legs so it's 60

1130
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:40,520
percent legs okay once you get about to your knees you have to start when you

1131
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,040
say to your knees you mean once your hands pass your knees you have to start

1132
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:50,960
to relax the grip the drive is the most finesse part once you start to get a

1133
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,640
little further back behind your knees you start to open up the hips and the

1134
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,120
hips is another 30 percent so it's like when you stand up from a deadlift at

1135
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:03,200
that point you actually have to really relax because a lot of people want to go

1136
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:07,080
here and they're missing the hip extension because you go into actual hip

1137
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:12,280
flexion there so you have to relax bring the bar in the bar is the biggest

1138
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:17,360
mistake because people want to rip the chain it's literally 10% it's nothing it

1139
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:21,880
should feel like nothing and then the hardest part is letting it relax and you

1140
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:29,320
following it in for me the hardest part is actually keeping the abs relaxed and

1141
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,840
keeping the ribs down it goes back to that over bracing thing it's my strategy

1142
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:42,000
I know all about the rectus baby I know hang on tight yeah for dear life but

1143
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,240
that's what causes back pain yeah and it's funny I remember when you had me

1144
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:54,120
start rowing my qls would seize up after like 10 minutes dying yeah like my qls

1145
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:59,120
are fried and again it wasn't back pain and a sort of this is like pathologic but

1146
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,840
I was like this doesn't feel good I don't I feel like it doesn't feel like I

1147
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,520
feel like I'm on my bike I feel great but on the rowing machine I just felt

1148
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:13,600
like crap and I think the barefoot rowing strapless rowing yeah oh yeah yeah

1149
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:20,920
sorry strapless rowing and learning to relax my hands when I crossed my knees

1150
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,640
right that was the that was the game change with respect to that at that point

1151
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:29,560
the ql pain vanished right so when you actually can relax the grip this stuff

1152
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,920
can relax easier because your arms and rib cage have a direct correlation so if

1153
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:39,640
you're hanging on for dear life this stuff is like just so tight so you can't

1154
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,120
relax if you're hanging on for dear life and that's what makes it counterintuitive

1155
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:48,200
because people just want to hang on so tight especially when it's new and I see

1156
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,760
so many people they just pop on the machine and go 35 strokes per minute as

1157
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,600
crazy as possible and they're like my back hurts I'm like well yeah I bet you

1158
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:01,360
know I mean I remember when I used to row I feel like I was always trying to

1159
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:05,280
like you know fatigue my upper body at the end of each stroke like trying to

1160
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:09,600
basically gas my lower body and upper body as much as was humanly possible on

1161
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,880
each stroke which almost undoubtedly meant because really you should be

1162
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:17,960
gassing your lower your lower body should be fried when you row our body and abs

1163
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:22,960
actually like when you're doing heavy heavy like almost power poles I feel my

1164
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:28,800
abs more than anything it's because they are bracing your torso yeah because all

1165
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,600
that it has to fire more because it's more force so these are your breaks yeah

1166
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:38,560
so your breaks have to work harder because there's more force back from the

1167
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:45,600
catch so do you use rowing as like short like you know do you use it as a form of

1168
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,480
high-intensity training with people do you like to do it as more I'll substitute

1169
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:55,000
it for deadlifting a lot huh yeah and what would be a typical workout so I

1170
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,360
would ten strokes at a time like once once I have people so like I'm working

1171
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:05,120
with Jill right now teaching her how to row and it's you know we're working on

1172
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:09,800
just speeds like nothing faster than 24 let's see if you can stay coordinated

1173
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:14,480
from there like that would be step one like you have to be able to keep that

1174
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:18,440
coordination because as soon as you add speed and power things are gonna start

1175
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:23,360
getting yeah I can't go anything faster than about 25 26 yeah it's really

1176
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:30,200
frustrating but right right after that I'll start adding a little bit of weight

1177
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:35,760
to the stroke so we'll start looking more at like watts or split time see if

1178
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,360
you can keep your speed kind of low but see if you can you know have a higher

1179
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,600
wattage but I don't usually start working higher speeds for a while

1180
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,320
because coordination kind of goes out the window and I want them to stay

1181
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:53,240
coordinated again because we're not doing like 2k time trials and we have

1182
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:56,760
like one client that's doing that you know I know and then you told you told

1183
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,100
me his time and then I was like I kind of want to do a 2k test as well oh he

1184
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:05,840
sent me his 5k today what did he go I can't remember his total time but he

1185
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:11,840
kept a 149 the whole time it's pretty impressive because his 2k he was about

1186
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:22,800
141 140 654 was his total time yeah yeah but like I'll have I have people do a

1187
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,840
lot of single leg rowing too mm-hmm I love that yeah it's great I mean you can

1188
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,460
use it for so many that's what I love about it so much cuz like I'll do my

1189
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:37,580
zone to I'll stay on a rower for 60 plus minutes but you can also work on

1190
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,020
like strength and power development which is so great I mean if you can zone

1191
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,580
to on a rowing machine you're very efficient yeah but I've been rowing every

1192
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,720
day of my life for the past seven years I have a rower here I have a rower in New

1193
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:54,860
York in my apartment you know I was teaching multiple rowing classes a week

1194
01:44:54,860 --> 01:45:01,060
I'm just always on it yeah you're you're you've got me you've got me doing it now

1195
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:04,980
it'll never be as fun as a bike for me I don't think but that's cool it's just a

1196
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:10,140
different situation yeah yeah I think it's it for runners though because it

1197
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:13,700
takes a you know it why yeah why do you think it's a good augment for a runner

1198
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:18,740
less load less impact on the lower leg just give them a little bit of a break

1199
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:26,900
but also really you know work the hips yeah let's talk a little bit about

1200
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:31,260
concentric versus eccentric strength within a muscle I want to do a little I

1201
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,900
want to demonstrate a little of this when we get into the gym because it's

1202
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:38,900
also another fixation of mine you know obviously you know archery and hunting

1203
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:42,420
or something I'm really interested in and one of the things I've paid a lot of

1204
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:46,700
attention to in the field because I'm always sort of thinking about I'm out

1205
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:50,740
there and I'm doing something what do I need to bring back into my training to

1206
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:57,940
make this a better experience and the two most obvious things are scapular

1207
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:02,540
protraction is everything so so when you're on your on your on the arm

1208
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:07,260
that's holding the bow out the difference between the good archer and

1209
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:11,860
the great archer is the great archer is always able to maintain protraction so

1210
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:18,420
when this hand is back here they can keep a relaxed arm with a protracted

1211
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:22,900
scapula now why is that important because when you're pulling back to

1212
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:30,100
release you have to have no slide back of the bow in other words you want the

1213
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:37,700
only thing that's being pulled is the release on the D loop now if the arrow

1214
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:44,300
is sliding back in the bow by definition it means the entire bow is slacking

1215
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:51,500
right so what that means is your scapula are coming back your shoulder is

1216
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:58,220
going up and so it was realizing oh my god once you start to break down in your

1217
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:01,940
shot sequence once you start to get tired you've lost the ability to keep

1218
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:07,060
that scapula all the way forward and that's a whole other issue the second

1219
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:11,500
thing that I brought back is and this is not just true of hunting frankly this is

1220
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:16,580
true of any sport I think especially if you like hiking and being outdoors or if

1221
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:21,340
you like being in an environment where it's not perfectly predictable is

1222
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:28,820
eccentric strength matters exactly if you can't stop yourself you're hosed and

1223
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:33,540
we focus so much on accelerating and on the explosion which is the concentric

1224
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:38,860
right the you know the strength as the muscle gets shorter right but very little

1225
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:42,100
about what happened what type of strength is necessary as the muscle

1226
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:45,460
elongate right I always kind of equate it to like a sports car with no brakes

1227
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:51,100
goes super fast but that's not great if you can't stop yourself so like I'll see

1228
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:55,900
it a lot with like big strong dudes they'll do a bodyweight split squat and

1229
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:59,820
just crash to the ground because they have no eccentric control that's a body

1230
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:05,460
control thing to just being able to control that descent is it okay so I was

1231
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:13,460
gonna ask you that if you have if you are strong concentrically is it really

1232
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:16,900
just a neurologic issue that prevents you from being eccentrically strong or

1233
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:20,740
is that a different I mean because I now very deliberately train eccentric

1234
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:24,900
strength well so you have to think about what eccentric says it's a loaded

1235
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:29,220
stretch right so if you don't have that stretch ability I mean that's gonna be a

1236
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:32,660
big part of the issue too this is one of your tests you typically will have

1237
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:38,420
somebody do bodyweight bodyweight split squats where they take five seconds to

1238
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:44,300
go down pause at the bottom and then they come up at normal speed yeah so how

1239
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:52,340
many normal like 50 year olds can pass that test mmm not many that's a stark

1240
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:57,380
stark statement let's read let's repeat what that is usually okay yeah explain

1241
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:00,900
again exactly what you're asking them to do starting in a split stance a lot of people can't

1242
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:08,100
even stand in a split stance without falling over or over bracing like it's your bodyweight

1243
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:14,660
you're not picking up a car you should be able to stand there yeah and then the the stretch

1244
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:20,100
required to lower you'll see a lot of people tip into a tilt because they they want to avoid that

1245
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:24,820
stretch or they don't have it and then to load it with your body weight it's a lot so they usually

1246
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:32,500
just end up crashing down to the floor and that's I want to see how much midline you know

1247
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:36,580
adaptability they have how much stretch they can get can you get your pelvis in a position

1248
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:42,660
you know or are you locked and loaded do you have to hike your arms up to make the movement happen

1249
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:48,340
or using momentum or can you push down with your legs and actually own it and stand up and lower

1250
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:53,780
down with control and I have some people that I've worked with that couldn't even be in a half

1251
01:49:53,780 --> 01:50:01,780
kneeling position without falling over but the good news is everybody can fix them this is all

1252
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:07,860
fixable stuff yeah it takes time but it's definitely you know for most people fixable it just takes a

1253
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:15,460
lot of attention and a lot of time um any other thoughts on sort of longevity when you think

1254
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:21,940
through like essential movements again my you know I think about eccentric strength being so important

1255
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:27,460
balance being important um where does flexibility fit into this for you like you take somebody like

1256
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:33,300
me who's really quote unquote inflexible right like I you know it's not like I can do the splits or

1257
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:38,580
right do anything outstanding but but I've seen a lot of people that can do the splits that can't

1258
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:44,980
control it yeah so how does flexibility fit into your world view around the centenarian olympics

1259
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:50,180
I think if they can control what they're doing I think flexibility is relative

1260
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:57,140
so you view control as a much higher premium control and load tolerance absolutely

1261
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:05,060
so you're not disappointed with my lack of hamstring flexibility no what I get more like

1262
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:09,540
if you're doing a toe touch assessment I'm more looking at higher spine segments which we're going

1263
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:14,100
to do that today I think because that's a great example I think that people should be able to touch

1264
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:19,620
their toes and and really I mean this is one thing I both you and Michael have independently

1265
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:26,260
showed me and it blew my mind you can touch your toes without barely requiring anything

1266
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:31,140
of your hamstrings if you know how to get correct if you know how to access your spine you should

1267
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:35,860
actually feel your hamstrings kind of working when you touch your toes and you know for years

1268
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:41,540
when I was dancing like you know I would just kind of kick back into my hips and you know hang out

1269
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:47,700
in my heels that's the only time I've ever had like back discomfort in my whole life like even

1270
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:54,740
deadlifting over 300 pounds my back never hurt like hurt or was achy but it was more you know

1271
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:59,540
from just kind of hanging back on myself and never felt a hamstring stretch I never felt work

1272
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:05,940
until I figured you know I got a little more control of my spine and a little more control

1273
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:13,460
and once and once you really learn what what how to get good lumbar and lower thoracic flexion

1274
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:18,820
you don't actually need very flexible loosey-goosey hamstrings to be able to touch your toes.

1275
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,820
I actually prefer you don't. Yeah you know.

1276
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:28,900
How big a how big a role does hit play in your in your world?

1277
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:38,180
Hit. I think that it should be done but like 20% of the time. That much. I just don't I think that

1278
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:45,940
zone two as far as like you know aerobic work we definitely need more zone two we don't do enough

1279
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:53,300
of that and a lot of it's an attention thing it's sometimes even for me and I can sit and do stuff

1280
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,940
forever but some days are so much harder than others and like I don't want to do this for an

1281
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:04,740
hour or more or whatever and it's hard to sit with yourself for an hour doing the same thing

1282
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:11,700
and it you don't experience those feels and whenever you do hit work it's like exciting and

1283
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:18,260
new and you know you feel like you're gonna die low level and that's exciting but I think that it

1284
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:25,300
can kind of enable that stress cycle that we have to crush it all the time and I don't think that we

1285
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:30,340
necessarily need to crush it. I tell a lot of my clients and patients that you should rarely feel

1286
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:36,180
like death like it's just not what it's about you know if you're if you're a power lifter like when

1287
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:43,860
I was training for that I would feel like death a lot. And you're you when you power lifted you were

1288
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:50,500
you were a good squatter. No I'm a terrible squatter. It's in my brain. So your deadlift is

1289
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:57,940
your lift? How was your bench? Not superb. So you were your your deadlift was best then bench? Yeah

1290
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:04,260
and like my deadlift was so just beyond everything. I think I just felt more comfortable because if

1291
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:09,620
it wasn't gonna work you just drop it you know it's like gonna squish you. Why do you think your

1292
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:16,580
squat was because you certainly have the biomechanics to squat? I do. I think it's a mental thing. I

1293
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:20,580
would get over a certain amount of weight and just like it wouldn't happen. I would just give up.

1294
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:27,380
Yeah. What's your take on sort of the difference between

1295
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:33,620
what we do which is mostly training versus going out and playing sports?

1296
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:41,220
I think sports are fun but I think they don't replace training. I think you know it's a lot of

1297
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:46,980
people be like oh I went and played tennis today. I worked out. I'm like no you played a sport which

1298
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:52,900
is fine but you're not you have to be so reactive and so stressful when you're playing a sport that

1299
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:59,140
you're not learning anything. For me training is about learning. Paying attention and learning

1300
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:04,820
and that learning will actually help you in your sport but your sport is not you know it's also

1301
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:10,420
usually your heart rate is so high you're not getting that good aerobic foundation from it.

1302
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:16,980
It's stress which is great and we need stress in our lives but that's not training.

1303
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:24,900
I think about this a lot. I don't know why because I'll never be able to do it but I'd love to

1304
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:32,340
fantasize about it which is like if you could revamp kind of the physical curriculum for kids

1305
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:39,620
you know you could go into schools when kids enter pre-k and what would you do different? Like how

1306
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:46,740
would you change the way we teach kids how to move? Have them play more. You think it's simply

1307
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:53,620
and it's just as it's just get them away from desks. Have them play more. That's how we learn.

1308
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:59,060
You make a decision it either works or it doesn't and then you learn from that and you either

1309
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:06,340
try a different way and or it's successful and you learn something and then you repeat it. I think

1310
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:11,220
it's the same thing with play and working on movement options. Like I played all the time as

1311
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:17,300
a kid outside. Now let's get back to this genetic issue. You're obviously just sort of genetically

1312
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:23,460
predisposed to being athletic, having this great sense of kinesthetic awareness.

1313
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:32,660
Do you have a sense of how much you could take somebody who's less

1314
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:41,380
genetically capable and just leave them in a natural environment by presumably keeping them

1315
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:45,380
away from some of the things that you know limit that like screens and sitting and such

1316
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:52,100
and have that be sufficient? I think once they're past a certain age they would need training

1317
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:57,860
I would think. Because you were kind of a hyper kid right? Oh yeah my parents would be like

1318
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:04,100
go run around the house five times and then come back in because I would just bounce and it was

1319
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:09,140
just constant. And you know I grew up in the country middle of nowhere so I was always on a

1320
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:14,740
bike or swimming or climbing a tree and I was lucky to have that. You know my parents kind of

1321
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:21,380
limited how much TV we could have. I think we got like one hour a day or something. So I had the

1322
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:27,140
opportunity to play. And then I also played sports. I wanted to be involved in everything.

1323
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:31,860
And my parents would be like okay but you have to finish the season and if you don't you know even

1324
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:35,860
if you don't like it you have to finish the season. The problem was I liked everything so I ended up

1325
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:43,220
just playing that's what I did a lot. So which was great. But a lot of people don't have the

1326
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:47,460
that background or options. That's actually one of the questions I ask in history like

1327
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,660
when I'm taking someone's history I'm like did you play sports as a kid?

1328
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:56,020
Because that can tell you a lot about you know what kind of learner they're going to be.

1329
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:01,540
Interesting so you're saying someone who's got a really strong athletic pedigree

1330
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:08,100
might actually pick some of the things up quicker that you're talking about simply because they have

1331
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:14,660
the reps on learning new skills. I find that people that played multiple sports and just played as a

1332
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:22,900
kid usually people that are specialized it can be almost harder because their patterns are so

1333
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:28,500
wired. They live like they're playing their sport. Like I worked with a golfer and he looks like he's

1334
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:35,540
swinging a golf club. Like that's how that's his strategy actually. That was something actually

1335
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:44,100
Michael also I remember explaining when we started working together was my scapular

1336
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:52,180
issues were going to be harder to unwind because of how many thousands of repetitions they had

1337
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:59,540
in the various movements that I'd done. So how many times I'd taken a stroke and swimming just

1338
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:06,340
slightly incorrectly without the perfect scapular control. And so he's like look it's almost easier

1339
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:11,460
to take in somebody who's been a bump on a log their whole life. Yeah because yeah they've got

1340
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:15,700
a bunch of problems but they don't have a whole bunch of ingrained movement patterns. Right they

1341
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:23,540
would have more like coordination issues and you know obviously midline stability issues just

1342
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:29,220
because they've never used it. But someone who's like especially repetitive sports I see it in

1343
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:34,980
runners a lot. Yeah running, cycling, swimming. Yeah just anytime you're doing the same thing

1344
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:42,260
over and over you're going to develop that strategy for lack of better words. And that's how you live

1345
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:52,500
life but that decreases options. Well Beth it's been pretty awesome having you in SoCal this summer.

1346
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:59,220
It's been great. I guess you're heading back to New York soon and we'll get back to the hard work

1347
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:03,460
of getting everybody ready for the Centenary Olympics. Yeah for sure. Thank you. All right well

1348
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:09,940
let's go ahead into the gym and try to do some of the things we've talked about here so that people
