1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, everyone, welcome to the drive podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,360
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,640
Hey, Peter, it's really great to have you back again.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,760
Every time you and I sit down, whether it's on the podcast or just on the

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,520
phone, I get the sense we could go on for hours.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,640
Um, I want to really talk about a bunch of things today, but I want to start our

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,840
discussion with a broader topic than just Corona virus or SARS-CoV-2, COVID,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,200
things like that, which I know is a topic you are still front lines on.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,320
And, uh, I don't think a day goes by that you're not being, uh, sought

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,120
after for your opinion on things.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,480
And we will certainly get to many of those things later today.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,920
But I, but again, I want to start with a topic that was near and dear to your

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,120
heart long before the Corona virus emerged in this fashion, which is the

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,040
topic of vaccines and vaccine safety.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,800
Now, recently I had Brian Deere on the podcast and I think for many people,

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,200
it was an illuminating discussion.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,560
Um, because, you know, Brian himself is not particularly a vaccine advocate.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,720
He's very clear about that.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
He's just an advocate for good science.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,920
And I think his, his work, uh, uncovering the web of lies and, uh, deceit surrounding

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,400
the work of, uh, Andrew Wakefield is, is really unparalleled, especially when one

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,240
considers the depths to which it was scrutinized both scientifically and even

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,480
in the court of law.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,800
Um, so I think the first thing I really want to understand Peter is why is it

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,520
that after the complete, um, debunking of everything that Andrew Wakefield did

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,000
said published, et cetera, why is this still an issue?

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,240
Why is it that in a post Andrew Wakefield world, most polls would suggest

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,000
somewhere on the neighborhood, correct me if I'm wrong, 20% of, uh, Americans

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
still believe there's a relationship between vaccines and autism.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,640
Yeah, I think what, what's happened, and it's actually a very profound question.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,880
And I agree, Brian's work was extremely important and, and then the scientific

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,920
community came in in a big way, debunking all of the assertions.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,360
And one of the things about the anti-vaccine lobby that it spawned or that

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,640
it ignited, at least in the modern sense is that they kept from then on, they kept

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
on moving the goalposts.

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,400
So it began in its modern form, uh, in 1998 with the Wakefield paper asserting

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,920
that measles, mumps, rubella vaccine causes autism by repli- the live virus

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,480
vaccine replicating in the colon.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,240
The scientific community respond in a very vigorous, robust way, publishing

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,040
multiple papers, large cohort studies showing that kids who were autistic, and I

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,120
got involved in it cause I have a daughter with autism and, you know, kids who are autistic

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,560
are no more likely to have gotten the MMR vaccine than kids who were not.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
And similarly, kids who get the MMR vaccines are no more likely to become

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,440
autistic than kids who don't and really sound epidemiologic studies, but then they

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
switched, they flipped, they said, okay, well, it's not really MMR.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,640
Vaccine, they had Robert F.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Kennedy and a group of people saying it's the thimerosal preservative in vaccine.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
And then it switched again to spacing vaccines too close together.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Then switched again to alumin vaccines.

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,400
And now what you're starting to see is even shifting away a bit from autism saying

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,160
that vaccines cause something called chronic illness or looking at the HPV vaccine for

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,960
cervical cancer and other cancers.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,800
And then seeing it causes infertility or miscarriages.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,040
And each time the scientific community responds.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,320
And what they do is to maintain momentum, to reenergize, they keep on shifting.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,000
And the concern for me now is they're not even looking at this from a pseudoscience

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,560
point of view.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
What they're now focusing on is the politicization of it.

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,120
So with this, and we'll talk more about it, but it's starting around 2014, 2015, they

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,560
managed to glom onto the Republican Tea Party and to make it a politicized movement around

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,880
these concepts of health freedom and medical freedom.

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
And that's what we're dealing with today now.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,600
And that's why you've got all the craziness on Fox News the last four or five nights with

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,120
Tucker Carlson going on this rant against vaccines and Laura Ingraham going on this rant

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,600
against me and Tony Fauci.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,920
And so this is a problem in that they have this adaptability and they create these versions

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,320
1.0, 2.0, 3.0 of the anti-vaccine movement.

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
But the autism piece never entirely left.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,680
That's still its legacy fake assertion that still haunts us today.

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, I mean, I think given how deep Brian went into the discussion specifically of MMR

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,240
and autism, that relationship, I don't think anything else needs to be said on that topic.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
And obviously for anybody who's listening to this that still has questions around that,

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,600
I would highly recommend that they go back and watch that video, listen to that podcast,

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:34,160
read the book and truthfully, and I don't say this to be, I don't know how to say this

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,160
delicately, but I think if after assimilating all of that work, you still believe that there's

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,360
a relationship between that vaccine and autism, there's probably nothing that can be said

77
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
that can dissuade you from that.

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,200
And I would just leave it at that and agree to disagree.

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,800
But let's focus on some of the other things that you've brought up.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you have a preference for where you'd like to begin?

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Would you like to start with thimerosal?

82
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,400
Yeah, I mean, you can, but it always comes down to the same few things.

83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,360
I mean, what happens is each time the scientific, and in the case of both Brian Deere and the

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,440
MMR, in addition to the scientific community refuting it on the basis of large cohort studies

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,080
and prospective studies, what he was able to do was show nefarious intent, which was

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,160
extremely helpful because knowing that what's happened since then is the anti-vaccine movement

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,920
has grown so much larger than Wakefield.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,960
Now you've got dedicated anti-vaccine groups, national anti-vaccine groups like Children's

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
Health Defense and ICANN and those kinds of things.

90
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:48,120
But then you also have local political action committees, PACs, that are linked to far right

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
wing extremism.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,400
So it's become this very complicated ecosystem or web, and now it's even gone beyond the

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
United States.

94
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,520
So yeah, I mean, we could go into why thimerosal is not linked to autism, and then we could

95
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,140
go into why spacing vaccines is not related to autism or what autism is and how it begins

96
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,400
in early fetal brain development.

97
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,040
But it won't stop the momentum of the anti-vaccine movement because they light a fire, they cause

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,680
damage and then they move on, and that's their modus operandi.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,760
Yeah, I don't disagree with that, Peter.

100
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,160
I guess the way I think about the role I'd like us to play in this discussion is I don't

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,920
think we're here to stop the anti-vaccine movement.

102
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,000
What I'd like to do is help parents who frankly are inundated with information and can't distinguish

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,600
between signal and noise, at least come to a place where we can have an honest discussion

104
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
about it.

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,540
Because I really do want to have that discussion, and I think the order in which you actually

106
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,040
just went through them is a very elegant way to talk about this, right?

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,520
Which is let's spend a few minutes on thimerosal, let's spend a few minutes on some of these

108
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,400
other claims, and then let's actually talk about autism because there is no denying the

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,880
fact that the incidence and prevalence of autism are increasing.

110
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,720
And we should talk about what some of the plausible reasons for that are and why the

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,160
scientific community has been able to rule out these claims that are being put forth.

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,040
Because again, I have great empathy for the parent who's listening to this, who is confused.

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,120
And that doesn't necessarily mean just the parents of children with autism, but that's

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,080
the parent who's trying to decide, what am I supposed to do here?

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
Am I supposed to get my kid vaccinated?

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
And am I supposed to get them vaccinated at this pace?

117
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,800
Does my kid really need 3H or hep C, pardon me, hep B vaccines in the span of six months?

118
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,780
And so I think just having an open, honest discussion about that is by no means going

119
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:57,440
to dissuade the 20% of people who are clearly in the camp that says vaccines are evil.

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,000
But I do believe that there's a very confused group of people in the middle, and I hope

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,040
we can talk about that.

122
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,080
So is it safe to say that post Wakefield, because I'm trying to go back and remember

123
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,160
the timeline, it was around 2007, 2008, that every claim of Wakefield had been pretty

124
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,440
much debunked, correct?

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,600
And to your point, it wasn't just debunked scientifically, but it had been made clear

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,680
that he had lied and he had manipulated data, as had O'Leary, and this was one big house

127
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
of cards.

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah, the Lancet paper was retracted, I think, in 2010.

129
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Okay, 2010.

130
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,880
Although I think there was an expression of concern put out by the Lancet a few years

131
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,560
before the maybe 2004, I can't remember exactly.

132
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,320
And the basis for the retraction is, they didn't really spell it out that much.

133
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
They basically said the results are no longer valid.

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,940
I don't think the retraction letter issued by the Lancet went into all of the investigation

135
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,740
that the medical counsel had done and for Wakefield to be struck off the register.

136
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,060
I don't think the retraction mentioned anything about the Brian Deer paper.

137
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,860
Yeah, I think it was Deer's reporting.

138
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,820
And frankly, the most damning evidence was the lawsuits, right?

139
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,020
It was the complete inability of Wakefield to maintain any legal argument against the

140
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,660
people who were accusing him of fraud.

141
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,460
And so let's put that aside and let's move forward.

142
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,900
Let's start by telling people what thimerosal is and what is it doing in a vaccine?

143
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,300
Well first of all, thimerosal is really not in childhood vaccines anymore.

144
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,980
No, but what was it?

145
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,900
There is a flu vaccine.

146
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,740
So what happens is if you're giving vaccines in multiple, if you have a multidose vial

147
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,340
of vaccines whereby you've got a vial of vaccine that could be given to six or seven or 20

148
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,420
people, each time you're introducing a needle into that vial through a rubber stopper, potentially

149
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,540
you're introducing bacteria.

150
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,380
And the worry is that if you do that enough that there could be some bacterial growth

151
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,540
or overgrowth into the vial.

152
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,940
So you need to put some preservative in to that's non-toxic that could be, that will

153
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,740
kill the bacteria.

154
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,460
And when thimerosal was discovered, it was considered quite an advance in terms of allowing

155
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,020
you to vaccinate large populations.

156
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,380
And the bottom line was it was taken out, the manufacturers took it out of the vials

157
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,380
just because of all the bad publicity swarming around it.

158
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,140
There was never evidence to show that it was a problem, but I think the thinking was that

159
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
we don't really need it.

160
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,780
We can give single dose vials instead.

161
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,540
Let's just take it off the table.

162
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,420
And in fact, that was done there still.

163
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:01,020
Some of the flu vaccines still have thimerosal in the US, but I think that that's about,

164
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,780
not all of them, you can still get a single dose vial for flu vaccine and take that as

165
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
well.

166
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:14,940
But there was never ever any shown association between thimerosal and any untoward effect

167
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,620
in terms, certainly in terms of autism.

168
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:28,020
Thimerosal was one of the big push, one of the big pushes from Bobby Kennedy Jr., correct?

169
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Wasn't this really his initial cause and his initial fight?

170
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
I think so.

171
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:42,380
I think he got into it because he's an environmental law attorney and looks at toxic waste.

172
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:50,100
And I think when he saw the mercury word, he probably got a link to Minamata disease,

173
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,980
which is remember back in Japan several decades ago, there was a lot of mercury exposure in

174
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,140
fish and young kids who were exposed to what's called methylmercury, either during pregnancy,

175
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,460
I think it was during pregnancy, the kids that were born were born with intellectual

176
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,460
deficits.

177
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,900
And that was a syndrome associated with it, was called Minamata disease.

178
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,740
And so I think probably people in his camp put two and two together and they said, well,

179
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,420
probably autism must be some form of Minamata disease, even though it's not the same, maybe

180
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,020
there's enough there that it could be due to thimerosal.

181
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,420
But again, the large cohort studies showed absolutely no linkage with autism.

182
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,580
And ultimately we know why is because we know autism is associated with prenatal events

183
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,180
that it's just we have, well, we could talk about it.

184
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,740
Yeah, we'll come to that.

185
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,580
But that's the, that's how he got involved.

186
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,260
And there were books about it.

187
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,140
There were a couple of books making these assertions.

188
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,060
And it also, and then once again, it started gaining a lot of momentum, very much like

189
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,340
the way Wakefield did a decade before.

190
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,180
And I think the first publication, which I write about in my book, Vaccines Did Not

191
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,900
Cause Rachel's Autism, kind of points that out.

192
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,060
I should get the book in front of me.

193
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,060
I could read it right to you.

194
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,780
Hold on.

195
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,380
This is the book, the last, not this book I published, but the last one.

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,940
It's called Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism.

197
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,540
And I go into it a bit.

198
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,780
And while you're looking for that, Peter, I'll just clarify for listeners the difference

199
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,260
between methyl mercury, organic mercury, inorganic mercury, because you made the point

200
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,260
that thimerosal is a form, it's an organic mercury.

201
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,180
And there's sort of a difference between organic and inorganic mercury, right?

202
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
That's correct.

203
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,860
And most of the toxicity that we see when people are over consuming fish that are high

204
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,100
on the food chain, such as large tuna, swordfish, shark, is organic mercury.

205
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,340
It is methyl mercury, not inorganic mercury.

206
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Right.

207
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:12,180
So Minamata disease, which was named after a city in Japan, it resulted from a chemical

208
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,540
plants industrial release of methyl mercury, which is different from thimerosal, which

209
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,260
is a totally different compound.

210
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,260
It's ethyl mercury.

211
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,980
And it was in wastewater, and it accumulated in a bay where fish and shellfish lived and

212
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,780
were consumed as seafood.

213
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,980
And large scale methyl mercury ingestions in pregnant mothers caused a congenital syndrome

214
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,420
causing neurologic disease in the form of gait motor disturbances, in some cases even

215
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,700
coma and death.

216
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,380
And so there was a paper that was published at that time in a journal called Medical Hypotheses

217
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:56,140
that first proposed that maybe autism could be related to thimerosal, because even though

218
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,060
it's not methyl mercury, maybe it's ethyl mercury doing this.

219
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:11,620
And that was in 2001 that the paper got published, so three years after the Wakefield assertion.

220
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,140
And so this was a pretty common preservative, but then it was subsequently taken out.

221
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,180
And what was interesting is even after it was taken out, the rates of autism never went

222
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,260
down.

223
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
That's pretty clear.

224
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:33,140
And there were again, large cohort studies showing absolutely no link with thimerosal.

225
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:40,500
And all of that said, Peter, I certainly wouldn't want to suggest that the paper in 2001 and

226
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,580
even the work that followed was anything but reasonable.

227
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,740
I mean, that's the purpose of medicine, right?

228
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:52,380
I mean, you see something like autism, you look for plausible associations, and you see

229
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,940
a neurologic disease that is associated with mercury.

230
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,100
It's entirely reasonable to formulate a hypothesis that says this other thing that looks kind

231
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,500
of like it could be it.

232
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Yeah.

233
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,100
And the paper was published in a journal called Medical Hypotheses.

234
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Exactly.

235
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
I mean, it's completely reasonable.

236
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,180
It's the stuff that follows that's challenging, right?

237
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,860
It's after the scientific community goes to great lengths and great attempts to seek the

238
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,040
truth and publishes paper after paper after paper and mainstream scientific journals,

239
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:36,060
that the anti-vaccine groups refuse to acknowledge its cling to their debunked hypothesis.

240
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,340
And their only response is, well, the scientists must be paid off by the pharma companies or

241
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,900
the journals must be paid off by the pharma companies or the editors must be paid off

242
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,100
by the pharma companies.

243
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,020
And so they resort to conspiracies rather than, okay, I get it.

244
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Let's move on.

245
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,620
Let's try to figure out what really causes autism.

246
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:06,860
And they've never shown that intellectual curiosity about what really does cause autism,

247
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,460
and they continually discount the massive amount of scientific work that's gone into

248
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,780
really uncovering what autism is.

249
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,100
Or we get into kind of the deeper why, because that's a big part of what I want to understand.

250
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,980
And there's two deep whys here, run around autism and one around this sort of latent

251
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,900
distrust and the path that any two individuals can, you know, there's a fork in the road,

252
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,900
right, where one person can be very influenced by data.

253
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,420
They can think sort of probabilistically, they can think in terms of uncertainty, they

254
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,220
can accept and reason their way through these things.

255
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,540
And then there's another person who's going to cling to a belief in the presence of emerging

256
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,260
data that refute that hypothesis and they'll continue to come up with an excuse.

257
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,860
And I really want to try hard not to pass a moral judgment in either case, but there's

258
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:11,860
clearly an anti-science sentiment that is growing and that is fostering this.

259
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,900
Before we get to that, let's go to the next point, which is, Thimerosal I believe was

260
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,220
electively removed in about two, like very early in the 2000s, right?

261
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
It was-

262
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,900
I think it was actually removed two years before the medical hypothesis paper.

263
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:37,220
I think it was removed in 1999 actually, or at least it was, that process was started.

264
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,340
So it had already been underway.

265
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,060
So what was the next position of the goalpost after Thimerosal?

266
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,700
So then it was this concept of greening our vaccines or making them more, I don't know

267
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,740
why they use the word green, I guess, making them more eco-friendly.

268
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:04,180
And that the third major hypothesis was that kids were becoming autistic because of antigen

269
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,400
overload, that somehow they were getting too many vaccines at once.

270
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,900
This was overwhelming the immune system and somehow that led to autism, which again, never

271
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,660
made a lot of sense to me how something, because in an- and they say it's leading to inflammation.

272
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:29,880
And I always would point out that we've seen what the brains of kids on the autism spectrum

273
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
looks like.

274
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,800
I've seen my own daughters, CT and MRI scans in her workup of autism.

275
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,320
And we know what inflammation looks like.

276
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,680
You can see inflammation on a- or evidence of inflammation or at least blood on a CT

277
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,120
or MRI.

278
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,960
And we know what herpes encephalitis looks like and autism doesn't do that.

279
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,920
It's not an inflammatory state of the brain.

280
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,280
And so that one never made any sense either.

281
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,200
And then there were several other people who came into this, people like the pediatrician,

282
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,160
Dr. Bob Seer started writing books about how we have to space vaccines further apart and

283
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,280
had written a number of books about that as well.

284
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,640
But again, it- well, first it never had plausibility and- but that's still out there today.

285
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,800
And if you go on amazon.com and look at books on vaccinations, I think those books are still

286
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
top sellers.

287
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,360
Now, in the case of thimerosal, at least there was a plausible explanation that was put forth

288
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,600
as a hypothesis.

289
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,080
When the hypothesis for spacing was put forth, was there some epidemiologic data that suggested

290
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
this?

291
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm not aware of it.

292
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:54,200
And the problem was, we didn't have clinical trial data to support the spacing of the vaccines.

293
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:03,320
The protocol, the current vaccine regimen, the schedule, is based on years and years

294
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,240
of studies confirming immunogenicity and protection.

295
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,200
It's also based on years and years of studies showing that there's no immunological interference.

296
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
In other words, if you give a pair of two vaccines together, that one doesn't interfere

297
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
with the other.

298
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,720
So, you're very carefully orchestrated dance.

299
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,800
And then these guys come in with these WACO schedules without any scientific basis.

300
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,280
And then, you know, it forces the scientific community to try to reevaluate whether you're

301
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,560
still getting the same immunogenicity or not, and also the immunological interference.

302
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,920
So in addition, so it's not just a matter of saying, well, what difference does it make

303
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,740
because kids are getting the same vaccines.

304
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:56,020
It's unclear whether they're going to be just as effective or safe as the, as that

305
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,580
very carefully orchestrated dance that was developed jointly by the FDA and CDC.

306
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,700
That's a very interesting point, Peter, and frankly, not one I'd ever considered.

307
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:13,300
I get asked not infrequently by patients about vaccinating their children on the schedule.

308
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,340
And these are not people who think vaccines are causing autism, but they do have some

309
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:24,540
concern presumably just based on things that they've read, heard, et cetera, that say,

310
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,860
hey, does my kid really need to have all of these shots in the first nine months of life?

311
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,260
And their belief, which is not unreasonable, is isn't this just a way to ensure kids get

312
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
their vaccines?

313
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,620
Because during the first year of life, the parent is so much more likely to come in for

314
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,500
well baby checks and, you know, they're going to have much more frequent contact with their

315
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,860
pediatrician and that that's the reason that this schedule is being imposed on us as opposed

316
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,380
to any really biologically necessary.

317
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,500
Again, I use the example of Hep B, which, you know, most kids are really not at risk

318
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,820
of Hep B, right?

319
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
Unless they're, you know.

320
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,180
Well, let me give you a different H disease as an example.

321
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:13,020
So Haemophilus influenza type B, it's a bacterial cause of meningitis.

322
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,860
Back in the Pleistocene era when I was a house officer, I was a pediatric house officer

323
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:25,280
at Mass General, in 87, 88, I would be admitting a kid with Haemophilus influenza type B meningitis

324
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,420
to my service every couple of weeks.

325
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,460
And Mass General was one of the oldest pediatric residencies.

326
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,340
They called it the children's service.

327
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,340
And back then, you know, the house officer did everything.

328
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,020
You had to do the lumbar puncture.

329
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,100
You had to look at the cerebral spinal fluid.

330
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,340
Under the microscope, you had to do the Gram stain and eventually sent to the lab, but

331
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
to confirm it.

332
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,100
But you would basically make the diagnosis right then and there.

333
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,540
And when you did it, your heart sank because you knew that there was a high likelihood

334
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,420
that kid was going to have permanent neurologic injury or might not even survive.

335
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,100
And it took a big emotional toll on me and my fellow house staff to have these young,

336
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,580
you know, healthy infants now get Haemophilus influenza type B meningitis.

337
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,780
And at that time, we didn't have a vaccine that worked in infants.

338
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,220
There was the capsule of the Haemophilus influenza type B, the polyribophosphate capsule, but

339
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
it was shown that it wasn't immunogenic in infants.

340
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,820
So it was still licensed as a vaccine for older kids to catch the few older kids that

341
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,540
could still make an immune response, but it didn't work in infants.

342
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,980
Why is that, by the way?

343
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,500
Because you needed, it turns out, you need to haptenize it onto protein.

344
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,120
And that's what John Robinson, Rachel Schneerson did at the National Institute of Child Health

345
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,760
and Development, NIH, they figured that out and developed a conjugate vaccine that now

346
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,240
worked in infants, which now you could start vaccinating.

347
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,840
But until at that time, you didn't have anything that worked in young infants.

348
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,640
So all you could do at that time is take a prophylactic antibiotic called rifampicin,

349
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,120
which had the unpleasant effect of turning your urine orange and reddish orange.

350
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,360
And and at that time, I had my first son born Matthew and we were living right across

351
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,440
the street from Mass General.

352
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,640
And I was terrified that I was going to bring Haemophilus influenza type B home.

353
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,560
So I took rifampicin all the time and I peed orange for two years practically to the point

354
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,920
where one of the first and only fights I've ever had with Anne was my wife was permanent.

355
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,880
And she accused me of permanently staining the toilet bowl orange because I was taking

356
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,560
that antimicrobial.

357
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,600
And then this miracle occurred.

358
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,480
The miracle was, you know, John Robinson, Rachelle Schneerson, also David Smith and

359
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,360
Porter Anderson in Rochester figured out that if they attach that polyribophosphate capsule

360
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,720
to protein and haptenize it, now you get T cell responses in infants and it works.

361
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,680
And that happened.

362
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:03,080
That vaccine was licensed in 1989 as I was finishing my house off-retro training for

363
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,240
infants, for young infants.

364
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,680
And now it's part of that early vaccination schedule.

365
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:13,560
By the time I finished my, then I went to Yale for my pediatric infectious disease fellowship.

366
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,440
I had a lab there and then I was a junior attending at Yale Children's Hospital.

367
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,760
By the time I started rounding as an attending two years later, the disease was gone.

368
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,240
It basically, I taught the house staff about it purely for historical interest, just like

369
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,640
the old guys at Mass General taught me about diphtheria and tetanus.

370
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,080
That's how dramatic it was because we added it to the infant schedule.

371
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,480
And I think that's a good example of, you know, these infant vaccines.

372
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,960
You know, to get a vaccine through, to be licensed by the FDA, you know, to file that

373
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,720
biologics license application for those very expensive.

374
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,480
Second, it's a hot, lots of review.

375
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,440
It has to go through the biologic license process of the FDA.

376
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,080
It's got to go through the VRPAC committee of the FDA for review.

377
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,760
It then goes to the Centers for Disease Control and the ICIP, the Advisory Committee and Immunization

378
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Practices.

379
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,560
There's a lot of smart people that are looking at all of this to say, do we really need this?

380
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,400
What's the cost effectiveness?

381
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,100
What's the benefit to society?

382
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,920
What's the benefit to child health?

383
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,840
So these are not decisions that are made lightly or, you know, these are things which are carefully

384
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
thought out.

385
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:44,360
So you don't think that there's some consideration given to this is a window in which the probability

386
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,200
of vaccination is greater just due to exposure.

387
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,700
Again, I bring up Hep B just because, you know, you and I didn't get our Hep B vaccines

388
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,560
until we were adults, right?

389
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,080
And of course, I don't know when you got yours, but for me, I think I got it in medical school.

390
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,800
It was just in time given our exposure to Hep B is enormous once you're in the medical

391
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,080
system because it's, you know, it's transmitted just like HIV.

392
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,040
And depending on where you trained, you might be in a population.

393
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:19,600
I think I first got mine when I was, we were keeping 11 Shanghai in China for parasitic

394
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
diseases.

395
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,400
And I think going off to China frequently, there's a lot of Hepatitis B, I think that

396
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
may have been when I got mine.

397
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,600
But you're right.

398
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,640
Back then, you know, we weren't giving it to infants.

399
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,760
And so I guess my question is, and again, I'm just saying this to try to take the side

400
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,000
of the parent, right?

401
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the parent who says this is too much.

402
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,720
And again, to be clear, this is not the parent who says vaccines are evil.

403
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,080
My kid will never get vaccinated.

404
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,280
This is the parent who's saying, is this a little too much too soon?

405
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,340
Does a child really need a Hep B vaccine as an infant?

406
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,400
What is the probability that a child will be exposed to Hepatitis B?

407
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,120
The only example I can think of is a child whose parent is in the healthcare system or

408
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,600
frankly in the, you know, is an IV drug user who is, who is themselves a high risk for

409
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,760
Hep B and who is not vaccinated.

410
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,280
But outside of that, you could certainly make the case that a person does not need a Hep

411
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,400
B vaccine until they're, you know, an adolescent or at least a, you know, a youngster in school,

412
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
correct?

413
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Right.

414
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
But let's take a step back.

415
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,760
Let's look at that example of the homophilus influenza type B. No doubt, no question in

416
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,000
your mind that that's what we needed to do.

417
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Absolutely.

418
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,560
Especially given the risk is highest to that patient.

419
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,000
I mean, that's an amazing example of that, right?

420
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Right.

421
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,040
So, so the vast majority of vaccines are not given for trivial reasons or no vaccine is

422
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,200
given for a trivial reason.

423
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
No, no.

424
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
And Hep B would not be trivial.

425
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,480
The need is, the need is more apparent for some than the others.

426
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,280
The exact reason why Hepatitis B was selected for young infants, you know, I wasn't, I wasn't

427
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,800
at the table when that decision was made.

428
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,960
It may be that there was enough at risk populations that it's very hard to cherry pick individuals

429
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,600
when there's so many people who absolutely need it, that, that it just becomes easier

430
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,440
to vaccinate the whole population rather than say, okay, well, you're in a specific at risk

431
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,720
ethnic group or you're in a specific at risk occupational hazard.

432
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,800
On the other hand, when you look at what that vaccine is, it, you know, it's, it's a, about

433
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,880
as low risk of vaccine as you can imagine.

434
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
It's a recombinant.

435
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,480
And we, we make vaccines like this all the time.

436
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,160
It's a recombinant protein vaccine produced in yeast.

437
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,880
It's been around almost four decades.

438
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,600
It's been given the hundreds of millions of children with a really fabulous safety record.

439
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,560
So you know, is, are you, what are you losing?

440
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,280
I guess is the, is the other way to put it.

441
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Right.

442
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,720
Let's talk a little bit about HPV.

443
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,640
This is some people hailed this vaccine as a miracle given the relationship between the

444
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,400
human papilloma virus, at least three strains of the human papilloma virus and cervical

445
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
cancer.

446
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,480
This is not an insignificant cancer for women.

447
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Sadly, many of us know women who have either died as a result of this disease or have been

448
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,400
who have lost their reproductive capacity as a result of this disease.

449
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,840
So and furthermore, I think many men might even know the anxiety that a, that a pap smear

450
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,760
has caused their partner if it has shown one of the high risk strains, you know, 16, 18,

451
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
a number of these things.

452
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,600
So I, I, I think for many of us when the HP vaccine came along, it was a really big deal.

453
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,920
I mean, this was, this was fantastic news.

454
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,480
Can you talk through some of the controversy surrounding it both from a scientific standpoint,

455
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,400
but also from a moral, ethical, religious, political standpoint?

456
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Cause I think that to me, HPV might be one of the best examples of the intersection of

457
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
all of those forces.

458
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah.

459
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,080
So it came, you know, it was, it was about preventing this.

460
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:21,120
So HPV induced cancers like cervical cancer, laryngeal cancers are predominantly sexually

461
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,000
transmitted cancers there.

462
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,120
So if you look at infectious causes of cancer, roughly about 16% of all cancers are caused

463
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,080
by infectious disease agents like hepatitis B, like, like HPV.

464
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,960
And the numbers go up all the time because we get better and better at discovering infectious

465
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,080
agents that cause cancer.

466
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,360
So in Africa, about a third of the cancers are of infectious origin.

467
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,400
And this was developed by a group at the National Cancer Institute, including someone who's

468
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,880
very dear to me, Doug Lowry.

469
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:08,320
And they were able to show that vaccinating against this virus would, can prevent infection

470
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,680
of the virus and therefore will likely prevent cancer.

471
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,080
And now new studies have shown indeed it's born out that indeed it does prevent cervical

472
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
cancer.

473
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,680
And on a daily basis, the Australian government has now launched a program where they think

474
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,360
they can eliminate cervical cancer from the continent of Australia by 2030.

475
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:34,080
So that's really exciting to actually eliminate a cancer through, through the vaccination

476
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,400
process.

477
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,920
The issue has come up, you have to vaccinate originally, it was mainly focused on cervical

478
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,540
cancers rather than the cancers and that would develop in males.

479
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:53,040
And so the recommendation was you want to have those girls vaccinated before their sexual

480
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,380
debut before they start having intercourse as they get to be teenagers or young adults.

481
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,660
And so you want to get them when they're nine or 10 year old little girls in time to make

482
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,380
certain that everybody gets, gets vaccinated.

483
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:16,180
And I think that, that did not go over well with a lot of people because they now realized,

484
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,740
you know, they're, they're a nice little nine, 10 year old girl is one day going to be a

485
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,980
woman who is sexually active.

486
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,340
And I think that was, that was hard for some people.

487
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,220
But in fact, it has a remarkable ability of saving lives and, and preventing cervical

488
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
cancer.

489
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,220
And that's why Australia has been implementing that in the US.

490
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:43,180
In contrast, what's happened is we've allowed we have, we have, well, we have a couple of

491
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
problems.

492
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,860
First of all, we're a big country.

493
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,980
The the access to the vaccine is not everything we'd like in rural areas.

494
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,620
It's not everything we'd like, especially among underrepresented minorities.

495
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,100
And so there's a, there's an access issue.

496
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:08,140
But the other big thing is this has been targeted now by the anti-vaccine lobby.

497
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,260
And they have tried to come up with fake assertion after fake assertion that's not supported

498
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,820
by the scientific data.

499
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,940
So they claimed it was causing autoimmunity.

500
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,100
They claimed it's causing mis- they linked a lot of it to female reproductive health

501
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
issues.

502
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,580
They said it was causing infertility.

503
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,340
It was causing miscarriage.

504
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,460
And again, one by one, the scientific community had to do those big cohort studies to refute

505
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,220
all of those links.

506
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,540
I guess this is as good a time as any, Peter, to ask the first of several meta questions,

507
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
which is why.

508
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,200
Wait, you didn't give me feedback.

509
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,020
So was that convincing or, or, or were you still unimpressed?

510
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,700
I mean, I mean, what do you think the issue is?

511
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,340
No, I, I, I think that's a great point.

512
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,700
And I say that as a father of a 12 year old, right?

513
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:03,380
A 12 year old girl, which again, I, I, I was just sort of joking with my mom this morning.

514
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,260
I, I, you know how your iPhone will give you, it'll give you like a flashback picture or

515
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,220
video from some time in the past.

516
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:18,420
And so this, this morning it sent me a video of my daughter when she was, well, she would

517
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,140
have been seven and her brother, her young, her, the next guy would have been one.

518
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,740
So seven year old and one year old and there was the beach playing.

519
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,620
And it's like the cutest thing on the face of the earth.

520
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,980
And I probably watched the video like seven times and then I sent it to my mom and I said,

521
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,500
I'll remember when she was this little, you know, my mom made some comment like, yeah,

522
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
enjoy it now.

523
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,700
Cause you know, five, six years she's going to be in college and blah, blah, blah.

524
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
So I get that.

525
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:54,340
There is nothing to me that is both simultaneously amazing and sad as the, the, the, the natural

526
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,620
loss of a game of tug of war that goes on between a parent and a child, right?

527
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,780
As my friend Rick Elias described it, you're, you're playing tug of war and you have to

528
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,700
lose by the time the kid's about 18.

529
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,340
It's slow, but you got to, you know, so, so I can see that like I, I have, I, I, again,

530
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the person who thinks this doesn't make sense.

531
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,180
And I think there's an argument that they would make that would say, well, I don't want

532
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
my child.

533
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
I don't want my daughter.

534
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,860
Let's just, again, I think this, this is an important issue that we should explain why

535
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,280
both male and female, it's relevant to both.

536
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,480
But if we're just taking it through the lens that I think it first came through, which

537
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,020
is my daughter is 12, I do not want her to be sexually active until she is, when I come

538
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,420
up with some arbitrary age, like 18.

539
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,800
Or I am not going to have her vaccinated until she's 18.

540
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,600
Another point of view is in an ideal world, I would prefer she's not sexually active until

541
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,100
she's mature enough to handle that.

542
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,740
I don't know when that is, but it sure as hell isn't 12.

543
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,860
Therefore I don't want her to get, I don't want her to have this vaccine at 12, but the

544
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:03,300
downside of, of not vaccinating her in time is she could be cursed with a lifetime of,

545
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
of asymmetry, right?

546
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:12,320
There's an asymmetric bet here and it's, it's, it's, I just, I can understand why some parents

547
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,020
might struggle with that, even though I tend to think in terms of risk and probabilities,

548
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,620
maybe more than the average person.

549
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Right, right.

550
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,580
I totally agree with everything you've said.

551
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,300
I think the problem now is that you've got these anti-vaccine groups specifically targeting

552
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:33,780
HPV, including I think now you've got children's, I forget which it is, whether it's Kennedy

553
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:40,540
or this organization is now, I saw it on his Twitter, he's filing some big class action

554
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:46,620
suit against Merck and company for the HPV vaccine.

555
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,180
What's the claim?

556
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,940
I don't remember, but you know, again, this is, this is what's going on right now.

557
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,540
And with, you know, I'm not aware of any evidence to support all of these things like infertility

558
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,340
or miscarriages or autoimmunity.

559
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:10,420
What's really interesting also is the anti-vaccine groups have now copy pasted those assertions

560
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,460
onto the COVID-19 vaccine.

561
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,620
So they could be pretty lazy.

562
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,940
So they're just basically saying the same thing they did with, because I guess it works

563
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,540
for them that in that Pyrrhic way.

564
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:27,500
So but, but as a result of that are, and like I said, it's not the only thing because we

565
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,140
have access and rural and underrepresented minority groups.

566
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,020
But you know, we're going the wrong way with HPV vaccine.

567
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:42,140
We're not even close to thinking about creating a cervical cancer elimination strategy.

568
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,980
You mentioned laryngeal cancer as well.

569
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,060
I don't think enough people understand the threat of that.

570
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,260
Frankly, all upper airway cancer, right?

571
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,980
I mean, you're talking about cancers of the soft palate.

572
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,380
You're talking about lots of head and neck cancers are on the rise.

573
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:06,340
I can't remember exactly the stat, but I want to say like the second or third largest

574
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:13,500
growing cancer in young men is head and neck cancer on account of sexually transmitted

575
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
disease.

576
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Yeah.

577
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,380
And if you talk to, you know, the head and neck surgeons, we're right next to MD Anderson

578
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,180
Cancer Center and within this Texas Medical Center, it's devastating.

579
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,860
The very aggressive surgeries that you have to do.

580
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
It's really heartbreaking.

581
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,660
By the way, we never finished the one thing about the autism, which was you made the statement

582
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,180
autism is on the rise.

583
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,260
I think it's important to clarify that.

584
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,180
I think we're clearly getting better at diagnosing autism.

585
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,140
I'm not convinced that the incidence of autism is truly increasing.

586
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Yeah.

587
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,940
And we're going to, we'll talk about it in detail.

588
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,980
I've got, yeah, there's a lot of when I come back to an autism, we're not abandoning that.

589
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,820
But thank you for clarifying that.

590
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,980
So yeah, coming back to this point I wanted to make, which is meta question number one.

591
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:12,300
Why do call it 20% of the population and an entire cottage industry of lobbies, you know,

592
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:20,100
lobbying groups, packs, et cetera, come out so hard against this one class of drug, whereas

593
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,140
we don't see it for antibiotics, right?

594
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:32,580
Where are the 20% of people who think penicillin is evil and the companies that make Zofran

595
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,500
or you're not Zofran, but you know, pick your favorite.

596
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Yeah.

597
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,700
Or similarly, like where are the companies that are coming out against insulin, exogenous

598
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,420
insulin that all these diabetics are using?

599
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,940
Because look, I'm going to be a skeptic for a moment.

600
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:54,220
I don't think there's a greater mismatch between drug companies doing wrong and profiting

601
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,580
and overcharging patients for a medication than insulin.

602
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:05,380
Like I think the economics of insulin are an embarrassment to how pharma works.

603
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Where's the rage?

604
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,420
Like where are the 20% of Americans that aren't losing their mind over what Novo Nordisk is

605
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
doing?

606
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
Yeah.

607
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:20,020
What is it about vaccines in particular that brings out so much ire, so much skepticism

608
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,980
and so much anti-science rhetoric?

609
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,820
I think, well, I don't know that I have all the answers, but I think part of it is the

610
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:36,260
fact that you're giving vaccines to, not for all, not in all cases, but in most cases,

611
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,980
you're giving vaccines to well individuals to prevent them from getting sick.

612
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:50,500
So you're giving something that's not always intuitively obvious that they need because

613
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,460
as opposed to insulin, as opposed to penicillin, somebody is sick and somebody needs a treatment.

614
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:02,380
So this is being so that you understand, but for a vaccine, you're preventing somebody

615
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,660
from getting sick.

616
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,300
And I think that simple feature is a big component of it.

617
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:14,660
I think the other is the fact that so many vaccines are mandatory for school entry.

618
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:21,740
So there's that kind of loss of choice that you feel it's being imposed on you.

619
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,340
And so those two things become pretty easy to exploit.

620
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:33,220
Unless you've got really strong vaccine advocacy activities in your community, it's pretty

621
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,900
easy for an anti-vaccine group to cherry pick those two things.

622
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:44,820
And then when you have conditions like autism and people want to understand how did this

623
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:52,420
happen, particularly the regressive form where kids seem to be developing normally and have

624
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:59,700
normal milestones and then regress, this is easy pickings for an anti-vaccine group to

625
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
come along.

626
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,460
So as an example, if...

627
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,580
So for instance, back in the 1900s in the UK, they started anti-compulsory vaccination

628
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:13,260
leaks and this extended to the US.

629
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:20,980
So I think it's a combination of the fact that they're preventative, not therapeutic,

630
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,780
and the mandate component.

631
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:29,020
And I think those two are a toxic mix that get people...

632
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,540
Some people upset about vaccines, particularly in this environment, which now dominates the

633
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,540
internet.

634
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:40,500
I mean, in the past when you had an anti-compulsory vaccination leak, you could go to your physician,

635
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,180
the physician would explain why that's all nonsense and why you should get vaccinated.

636
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,900
Now we've got something called the internet.

637
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,940
Now we've got something called social media that dominates our lives.

638
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,940
And you've got Amazon now as the single largest promoter of fake anti-vaccine COVID conspiracy

639
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,100
books.

640
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:03,060
So most of the information you're getting now on a daily basis is actually anti-vaccine,

641
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,500
anti-science information.

642
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,540
But again, I'm still trying to understand why the disdain for science is so prevalent.

643
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,660
So hear me out on another thought experiment.

644
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:23,140
If the president says, I want to...

645
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,820
I'm using this because it's the current example.

646
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:30,380
If the president says, I have a legislative agenda that's going to propose a multi-trillion

647
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,140
dollar infrastructure bill, you may not think that's the best idea.

648
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,900
Well, you're going to oppose that through legislative action.

649
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,020
You're going to oppose that through lobbying.

650
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,220
Maybe that's not a great example.

651
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,540
I guess what I'm trying to get at is why...

652
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:55,380
If you're opposed to vaccines, I can at least understand the argument around medical freedom

653
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,380
because you could at least stand up and say, look, I'm opposed to being told I have to

654
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,060
take a drug to prevent an illness I don't have.

655
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,020
And then you could at least argue the merits of the individual versus society.

656
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,700
To me, that's a more palatable argument.

657
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,320
But the complete anti-science part, maybe because I'm a scientist, is just harder for

658
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,060
me to empathize with.

659
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,520
It's harder for me to put myself in those footsteps because I can't think that way.

660
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,940
But I want to because I think it's important to be able to think that way and not be dismissive

661
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,940
of it if that makes sense.

662
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,940
Yeah.

663
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:36,820
So here's what I think happened, which is I think maybe because of my activities and

664
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,020
I'm not alone.

665
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,100
Others were involved in this.

666
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:47,060
There was a lot of effort to debunk the links between vaccines and autism and HPV vaccine

667
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,260
and all the craziness that they asserted it caused.

668
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,340
And I think it was taking some steam out of the anti-vaccine movement.

669
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:01,100
But you still had enough parents in places like Orange County that were scared about

670
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:07,980
vaccines causing autism that it allowed a measles epidemic to erupt.

671
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:15,860
And it was a pretty bad epidemic in Orange County end of 2014, 2015.

672
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:21,740
It was linked, I think the origins may have been Disneyland where the epidemic came from.

673
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,340
What happened was the California legislature responded appropriately, I think, and said,

674
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,340
you know what?

675
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,660
We're allowing these vaccine exemptions, but it's getting out of hand.

676
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,700
And now it's causing a measles epidemic.

677
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,540
And measles is a bad actor, right?

678
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:42,260
It's got a significant mortality and permanent disability, deafness and other things.

679
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,780
And they shut down the vaccine exemption.

680
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:52,420
And I think that helped re-energize the anti-vaccine movement because I think they were losing

681
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,020
some steam around autism.

682
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,980
And they saw this as an opportunity to rebuild, to reinvent themselves.

683
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,660
And they reinvented themselves as a political movement around health freedom, medical freedom.

684
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,340
And that's, and it really amplified in Texas.

685
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,740
So where I am, and it took off with, they created political action committees like Texans

686
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,700
for Vaccine Choice.

687
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,580
It started getting, and the PACs started getting other PAC money and they, the PACs were giving

688
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,540
PACs the other PACs money.

689
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,380
And so there was a lot of money flowing and it was very powerful.

690
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,300
And they were able to convince the Republican Tea Party in Texas, which is a very powerful

691
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,700
group to adopt this issue as a platform issue.

692
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,660
And that's when it really started to accelerate.

693
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,460
And you started to see PACs form not only in Texas, but also in Oklahoma, other Western

694
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,780
States as well.

695
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,780
So it was more of a Western state phenomenon than anywhere else.

696
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:59,500
And so your political allegiance, your identity actually became tied to not vaccinating your

697
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,180
kid or to be skeptical of vaccines.

698
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:09,260
And then it all really blew up last year because those same anti-vaccine groups then

699
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:16,460
started going up against masks and social distancing again under this health freedom,

700
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,620
medical freedom banner.

701
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,980
And now it became a full on anti-science movement.

702
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,180
And you really saw this happen starting in around last summer when the epidemic moved

703
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:34,260
into the Southern States and people showed their political allegiance to the Republican

704
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,060
Party by defying masks and social distancing.

705
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,900
And then it went up in the upper Midwest as well.

706
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:47,500
And you had that story, that awful story of the ICU nurse in tears being interviewed,

707
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:54,340
talking about one of her ICU patients who's dying, words were COVID-19 is a hoax.

708
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:01,260
So that's when you started to see this kind of mainstreaming of what was a fringe group

709
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,940
around health freedom, medical freedom in 2015, and now become a major platform of the

710
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,860
Republican Party going up against science.

711
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,420
And then you saw the targeting of scientists.

712
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:20,660
That's when they began really going after Tony, Dr. Fauci, they began going after Bill

713
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,660
Gates.

714
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,100
They started going after me quite a bit.

715
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,820
And now this thing is steamrolling.

716
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:36,700
You had Tucker Carlson last week going on this whole rant about vaccines and questioning

717
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:42,340
vaccines and Laura Ingraham at Fox News went after me a couple of nights ago.

718
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,500
Specifically saying what, you have to forgive me if I don't follow this stuff too closely.

719
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,220
Yeah, well, it's pretty unpalatable stuff.

720
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:56,220
They would say that we misled the public, that we got it wrong, that we didn't understand

721
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:04,400
the epidemic, and then they would parade out all the great Barrington stuff about no lockdowns.

722
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,380
Even though none of us ever said lockdowns, they create these straw men that say we're

723
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,700
trying to lock everybody down and we're hurting our economy.

724
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:19,740
And along with that, they're saying that what's going on with these vaccines?

725
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:29,180
And so tying, and again, this is a throwback to 2015 when it was first linked to political

726
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,580
extremism on the far right.

727
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:37,340
So what was started out as an anti-vaccine movement is now a movement against any kind

728
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:45,140
of public health intervention and demonizing scientists and basically calling us the boogeyman

729
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,420
in that.

730
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,820
And it's continuing now.

731
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,980
This was exported last summer to Europe.

732
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:59,380
You had these anti-mask, anti-vaccine protests, which for the first time used that same American

733
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,660
language in Berlin and Paris and Trafalgar Square in London.

734
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:11,140
You had the New York Times reporting how it's linked to QAnon and other far right wing extremist

735
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,140
groups.

736
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,260
And so this really concerns me.

737
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:19,020
And then of course, to make it all the more complicated is the fact that now you've got

738
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:24,040
the US and British intelligence talking about Putin's government has been lobbying this

739
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,300
whole program of what's being called weaponized health communication on our internet in order

740
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,260
to destabilize the country and destabilize other democracies.

741
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:41,260
And so what was kind of a fringe group arising out of the Tea Party in Texas is now, I don't

742
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:47,140
know what you want to call it, whether it's an anti-science empire or confederacy that

743
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,300
has lots of moving parts to it.

744
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,180
But I'm concerned about the direction that continues to and the fact that it continues

745
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,180
to build.

746
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:04,220
Do you think this is just a sort of very vocal part of the Republican Party or do you think

747
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,860
this actually represents an entire political party?

748
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,900
I mean, it seems hard to me that this could represent an entire political party given

749
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,620
the heterogeneity of beliefs that would exist across that from fiscal conservatives, social

750
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,540
conservatives, I mean, all of these things.

751
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,540
Yeah.

752
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,340
And the fact that the Republican Party historically has not been anti-science, right?

753
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:31,180
I mean, the National Academy of Sciences was started in the Lincoln administration.

754
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,740
Eisenhower launched NASA.

755
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,740
George W. Bush launched PEPFAR.

756
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,900
So this seems new to me.

757
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:46,820
And I don't know how much it's pervasive in the Republican Party.

758
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,340
Certainly it's become now a major component of Fox News in the evening.

759
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:57,020
And as recently as last year, I was going on Fox News almost every day on a pretty regular

760
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,140
basis.

761
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:06,140
And I didn't see it until the disinformation campaign came out of the Trump White House.

762
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,880
When they said COVID was around a year ago, last year, when they said COVID was a hoax

763
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,660
or the flu and attributed the COVID deaths to other causes or you had Kayleigh McEnany

764
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:23,940
say the hospitalizations were all elective, catch up in elective surgeries and discrediting

765
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,940
masks.

766
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,180
And then later on in the summer, they brought out Scott Atlas.

767
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:36,120
So there was no question about it, this very deliberate disinformation campaign coming

768
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,780
out of the Trump White House.

769
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,300
And I was one of the first to call it out, not because I'm so brilliant, but because

770
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:47,460
I've been going up against these anti-vaccine guys for years and they've become, unfortunately,

771
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,940
by default an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns and can recognize it.

772
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:59,420
I see it accelerating and I can't say whether it's across the whole Republican party, but

773
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,740
it's a lot more pervasive now among Republicans than it's ever been.

774
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,940
And then what's the evidence?

775
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:15,700
Well, the evidence is now the PBS NewsHour teamed up with NPR and Marist and they've

776
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:21,540
now found that if you look at the single most vaccine hesitant group in the United States,

777
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,660
this was just last week, it's what's called white Republicans.

778
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:32,600
So it's around, I think it was 41% of white, a significant percentage of white Republicans

779
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,340
are saying they're not going to get vaccinated.

780
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,820
And that's not the first poll.

781
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,860
I mean, we did one with a group of Texas A&M, I'm not a social scientist, but we teamed

782
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,640
up with a group of social scientists at Texas A&M led by Tim Callahan in the School of

783
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,260
Public Health, found the same thing.

784
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:54,060
I think we call them Trump voters and Kaiser Family Foundation also found the same thing

785
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,460
twice that it's, so this is the number one vaccine.

786
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:04,380
Now I've seen another poll that suggested, and it didn't slice the data by race and party,

787
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,740
it sliced it by race and party separately.

788
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:12,600
And it found the greatest predictor was indeed Republican party association, but the second

789
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,180
was African American.

790
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,180
Right.

791
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,540
What's the best explanation for that?

792
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,460
And what's more now it's coming down.

793
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,200
So whereas it's still staying, so what's happened that you're absolutely right.

794
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,740
So about two, three months ago, African American groups and white Republicans were sort of

795
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,500
neck and neck and who was the most vaccine hesitant.

796
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,960
And it stayed up among Republicans, but it's been coming down among the African American

797
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
groups.

798
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,700
And one of the things I've been going on, lots of podcasts and radio shows that reach

799
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,200
black and brown audiences.

800
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,180
And I was on one last night with a Baptist church in Richmond, Virginia, and I asked

801
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,940
the pastor, I said, are you seeing less of it now?

802
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,220
He goes, definitely it's coming down.

803
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,740
And I said, what do you think is happening?

804
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,240
Well, he goes, well, doc, I think part of it is people like you, you know, reaching

805
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,700
out to black and brown communities.

806
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:12,460
But the other is a lot of the clergy have created a sort of an informal network now.

807
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,100
And we're really hitting hard on the need to get vaccinated.

808
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,540
So I think that that may be part of it.

809
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,520
But initially it was quite high.

810
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,020
And I think part of, you know, what the reasons were, I don't entirely understand, you know,

811
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,740
what's often said is it's around structural and historic racism and that horrible legacy

812
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,740
of Tuskegee.

813
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,460
I think the other thing that I've seen now is deliberate targeting of African American

814
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,940
groups by the anti vaccine lobby.

815
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,860
And now I just saw on the internet, there's a new quote, documentary where I, you know,

816
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,220
clicked on the trailer and it's got people getting the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that it

817
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,860
switches right away to Tuskegee experimentation.

818
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,820
So by it's kind of making that that links, I think it could do a lot of damage.

819
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:04,540
So but it seems to be somewhat resolving, but it's still really high among the those

820
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,180
group of Republicans.

821
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:13,460
And you saw it, you know, when COVID-19 accelerated in the summer in the southern states and in

822
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,060
upper Midwest in the fall.

823
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,860
So what's going on?

824
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:27,340
And I'm worried that now you've got, again, people tying their allegiance to the Republican

825
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:34,220
Party or their identity to being against scientists and science.

826
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,980
And this is not good for the country.

827
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,020
Yeah, there are a few things I want to say.

828
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:43,780
And one thing to add, the thing that we haven't mentioned yet that I think is worth mentioning

829
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:49,740
is the enormous measles outbreak in Minnesota that occurred in the Somali community.

830
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,940
But I think that story doesn't get enough attention because I guess it's now been enough

831
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,940
years.

832
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:59,660
But I've always found that to be an unbelievably sad story in some ways more sad than the Orange

833
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:05,540
County outbreak, because this was this was really a deliberate targeting of a community

834
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:10,860
of immigrants, you know, not facile with the language.

835
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,500
And the measles outbreak was terrible there.

836
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,380
And I guess that's the thing I've always struggled with.

837
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:22,460
If you just put your common sense hat on every time a community gets targeted to stop taking,

838
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,140
in this case, the MMR vaccine, a measles outbreak shows up.

839
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
Yeah.

840
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:33,340
And that was sort of the, Paul Offit always calls it the canary in the coal mine.

841
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
And I think he's right.

842
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,060
It's because it's got such a high reproductive number of 12 to 18.

843
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,060
Yeah, it's crazy.

844
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:45,900
I mean, as soon as the vaccination coverage goes down, measles finds it.

845
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,640
And that was really, that was the first time I think that you saw the anti-vaccine groups

846
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,100
targeting specific ethnic groups.

847
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:02,020
So Lena Sun at the Washington Post back in 2017 reported that Wakefield, who had kind

848
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,380
of disappeared for a while, was at town hall meetings.

849
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:10,020
I don't know if he organized them or if the Smalley immigrant community organized them.

850
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:17,740
But you know, there he was piling on and brought down vaccine coverage from over 90%.

851
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,700
Washington Post reported to 40%.

852
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,700
Guess what's going to happen?

853
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,640
It was, and I think it was 21 kids that landed in the hospital.

854
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,520
And then it happened again in 2018, 2019, they began targeting Orthodox Jewish groups

855
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,400
in New York and New Jersey.

856
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,040
And what they did was just so offensive.

857
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:42,820
They started parading around in these phony yellow Jewish stars, like the Holocaust, with

858
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,760
the word Vax written in it.

859
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,160
And Vax was written like Hebrew letters and started comparing vaccines to the Holocaust.

860
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:57,720
And that caused this massive measles epidemic across, both in Muncie, New York by the Tamponsie

861
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,880
Bridge and then in Brooklyn.

862
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:05,520
And I think there were 18 people in the ICU because of that 50 hospitalizations.

863
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,280
So this has become the new modus opera.

864
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:14,080
And then in 2019, you saw these series of Harlem vaccine forums that they organized

865
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:20,800
and even held one in the Riverside Church, which is on the Upper West Side in New York,

866
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,800
near Columbia University.

867
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,120
It's one of the iconic churches in the history of the civil rights movement, the Reverend

868
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,900
Sloan Coffin, and somehow got access there and held a rally there.

869
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,680
So all of that has caused a lot of damage.

870
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,600
Now this new quote documentary that's coming out.

871
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,880
So I'm very concerned.

872
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,440
So you've got these, as I say, these multiple facets.

873
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,000
You've got the health freedom component expanding now across the Republican Party, now into

874
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,520
Western Europe.

875
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:59,080
You've got the Russians fueling this with their systematic weaponized health communication.

876
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:05,000
And now you've got the specific targeting of racial and ethnic groups and causing a

877
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,880
lot of damage.

878
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,700
And the problem is it takes time to explain, right?

879
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,700
I can't give you a 30 second UNICEF commercial about this.

880
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,260
How long have we been talking a full hour now?

881
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,780
You kind of get it now, but it takes time to unfold and explain.

882
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,580
And the problem is it makes people very uncomfortable.

883
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,740
It made me uncomfortable, right?

884
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:39,860
When I was going on CNN and MSNBC in last year at this time, I didn't want to call out

885
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,220
the White House for their disinformation campaign.

886
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,540
What we're told as scientists is, hey, Peter, just stick to the science.

887
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,740
You're not a political guy.

888
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:56,660
You're not an expert in White House Washington politics.

889
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,660
What are you doing?

890
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,100
You can't do that.

891
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:08,700
But being an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns by being targeted by these guys,

892
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:14,180
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls me on his Instagram, called me the OG villain, the original gangster

893
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,180
villain.

894
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,580
So that's who you're talking to today.

895
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,860
I had a look up what OG meant.

896
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:27,020
So I unfortunately became a bit of an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns.

897
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,220
I could smell them on a mile away and I saw this.

898
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,700
I said, I know what this is.

899
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,980
You saw Peter Navarro out there with all the Chinese conspiracies.

900
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:39,740
I said, we're being gaslighted here.

901
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,340
I said to Anne, my wife, I said, I don't know what to do.

902
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
This is taking me to a very dark place.

903
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,140
I'm supposed to only talk about the science.

904
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,260
She saw upset I was getting.

905
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:55,500
She said, Peter, if you don't say anything and you find out all this massive loss of

906
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,540
life from COVID and didn't do all you can to stop it, you're going to hate yourself.

907
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,700
That's all I needed to hear.

908
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:06,260
And then I really went after it and it took me to a very dark place.

909
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:10,300
In part because at that time you weren't getting a lot of backing.

910
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,380
I didn't get a lot of backing from the academic and professional societies because that's

911
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,900
not what they do.

912
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,540
So I really felt out there alone.

913
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:27,660
Later on, I think when it became safe, other people came to my support.

914
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,500
But in the beginning it was a very lonely kind of thing to do.

915
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,620
I'm glad I did it, but it took emotionally, it really knocked the crap out of me.

916
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:44,020
It was very tough to do that because the truth is I'm not that ideologically driven politically.

917
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:48,860
I was in Washington for 10 years and as chair of microbiology at GW and one thing I learned

918
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,500
in Washington, if you want to get anything done, you reach across the aisle.

919
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,980
So we got a lot of neglected tropical disease legislation passed and I would think nothing

920
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,460
of going to Sam Brownback who is now he's the governor of Kansas.

921
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,060
Back then he was a very conservative senator from Kansas.

922
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:09,380
He would hold a prayer breakfast meeting and I'd go to that and I would speak and then

923
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:14,900
I'd go across the way and talk to Senator Leahy's people who's this very liberal senator

924
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,940
from Vermont.

925
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:23,580
Back then nobody thought twice about those kinds of things, but it's not happening anymore.

926
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:30,580
So to be able to have to tear into what was going on with the Trump White House and it

927
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:38,320
was often perceived as I was just being somebody in the Democratic camp, which wasn't the case,

928
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,380
but I understand why it was perceived that way.

929
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:47,580
And now what's interesting is whenever I have something with the Biden administration,

930
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:54,620
I think is not quite right, then I get beat up a lot from my colleagues on the left and

931
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:57,940
there's a lot more of those who say, you know, what are you doing after a while?

932
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,980
We've been through, how can you criticize the Biden White House?

933
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,980
I'm really criticizing.

934
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,220
I think they're doing a good job, but there are things that need to be changed as well.

935
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:13,300
So it's very tough to, it's very tough not, it's very tough to, if your focus is only

936
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:18,460
on saving lives and doing whatever you can to save lives, that's very tough.

937
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,260
Because it means if you're sincere about that, you go on Newsmax and you go on Fox

938
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:30,020
News, which I've been doing, or, and you go on a radio podcast and that reach black and

939
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,140
brown audiences.

940
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,140
That's what I've been doing.

941
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:39,300
So, and hopefully at the end of it all, I'll be okay, but it's not easy doing this.

942
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:47,300
Peter, is there a historical precedent for such a distrust of science?

943
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:53,740
I mean, that, you know, given that the scientific method has only been around for, call it 400

944
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,580
years, that doesn't give us a great opportunity to look for such things.

945
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:04,100
But even in the last century or two, have we ever seen such massive distrust for the

946
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,740
establishment of science?

947
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,740
I haven't seen this distrust systematically.

948
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:15,900
Certainly there's been a lot of pushback or anger around certain things scientists have

949
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,900
said.

950
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:27,420
Like, for instance, with, during colonial times, when Cotton Mather tried to vaccinate

951
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:33,420
the Massachusetts colony against smallpox, people were very aggressive with him and they

952
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:39,420
actually threw a firebomb into his window around that particular issue.

953
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:47,980
So yeah, that's gone up and down in American history, but I've just not seen this systematic

954
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:54,460
distrust of science and scientists and the targeting of scientists and the mainstreaming

955
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,580
of anti-science.

956
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,580
That's kind of worrisome.

957
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:04,660
And of course, a lot of this is because now we have this new era of the internet and social

958
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:10,380
media and Amazon and all those kinds of things doing a lot of damage.

959
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:16,180
So kind of want to pivot a little bit to something very personal for you.

960
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:17,660
How old is Rachel now?

961
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,620
Now she's 28.

962
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,620
28.

963
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,140
So let's go back in time, 28 years.

964
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:28,820
Tell me what you remember about her birth and the first few years of her life.

965
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,260
So when she was, so by the time Rachel was born, I had already had two other kids.

966
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:39,300
And I remember Ann saying, always feeling that something was off, that she wasn't as

967
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:45,780
huggy or clingy as the other kids were, but didn't really come to medical attention till

968
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:49,220
around 19 months of age.

969
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:56,740
That's when the pediatrician clearly saw developmental delays and referred us to special

970
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:02,020
services and ultimately I was at Yale, which is, I was an assistant professor then running

971
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:07,020
a lab and that was hard for me because I was going off to China and keeping a lab in China.

972
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:13,940
And now having a child with a medical issue was really tough.

973
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:19,620
We had to give up going to China and reconfigure our program.

974
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:26,180
But at Yale, that's also the home of the Yale Child Study Center, which is one of the big

975
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,700
thought leader places for autism.

976
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:33,720
And she was referred eventually to the Yale Child Study Center where the world's experts

977
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:42,260
on autism, people like Fred Volkmar and Donald Cohen and Linda Mays.

978
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:48,260
There was a child psychiatry fellow in Wendy Levine who really looked into this very carefully

979
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:53,180
and she was clear that she was on the autism spectrum.

980
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:57,380
And it's a little tougher to diagnose for girls than boys because girls tend to be more

981
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,420
verbal.

982
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,860
So oftentimes boys- Was she verbal at 19 months?

983
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,340
Was she appropriately verbal?

984
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,740
Well, she wasn't always appropriate, but she was always verbal.

985
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:15,660
She would repeat, there's a lot of echolalia, she would repeat things, but she had reason-

986
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,740
To this day, she's got reasonably normal language skills.

987
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:23,180
It's just her performance IQ is really, really low.

988
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:28,020
And so that's one of the big issues with Rachel.

989
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:34,060
It's the intellectual disabilities that go with autism, in her case that go with autism.

990
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:41,180
And in fact, that's a very interesting side story about Rachel is the whole ecosystem

991
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:46,220
of girls and women on the autism spectrum because the older literature says it was 10

992
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,340
to one boys to girls.

993
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:53,260
And that's because boys are so floored in their presentation and symptoms.

994
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:59,180
Girls can camouflage it better, they can mask it better, they are often verbal, but they

995
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:06,260
have very high rates of comorbidities like obsessive compulsive disorder or ADHD, attention

996
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:13,140
deficit hyperactivity disorder, or even a lot of the teenage girls with bulimia and

997
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,300
eating disorders.

998
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,580
Now many of them may be on the autism spectrum, so we're getting better at it.

999
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,780
So it used to be 10 to one.

1000
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:25,420
Now I think it's moving closer to three to one boys to girls and some say it may even

1001
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,820
approach parity or something close to parity, like 1.5.

1002
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,100
But it's way underdiagnosed.

1003
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:37,740
And Alison Singer has the Autism Science Foundation has been supporting efforts to

1004
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:42,780
really call great, because she has a daughter on the autism spectrum, to look at this in

1005
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,460
more detail because it is so underdiagnosed.

1006
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:51,780
But in Rachel's case, it finally came to diagnosis at 19 months of age.

1007
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:59,860
I got very interested in that because when you look back then at the CDC definition of autism,

1008
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:07,300
it's I don't think it's on the website anymore, but I guess a couple of years ago, it was still

1009
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:12,940
there. It said most kids on the autism spectrum were diagnosed 18 or 24 months of age.

1010
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:18,420
And I got very interested in that because there was a research group at the University of North

1011
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:26,100
Carolina Chapel Hill run by this guy named Piven, P-I-V-E-N, who was able to show that that

1012
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:32,500
clinical expression of autism coincided with a big increase in brain volume expansion.

1013
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,100
So you could actually follow this on serial MRI.

1014
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:44,460
And that's important because a lot of parents will remember when their kid was diagnosed with

1015
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,860
autism, especially the regressive form, because that's so true, not just all slowing of milestones,

1016
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,220
but actually loss of milestones.

1017
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:57,940
They'll remember that their kid got vaccinated, maybe with measles or something else around that

1018
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:00,380
time and want to link the two.

1019
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:07,620
But now this group at UNC Chapel Hill can go back much earlier, back to infancy and show that

1020
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:11,300
there's already those changes happening in the brain.

1021
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,460
And now, of course, we can show prenatally.

1022
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:22,220
So Eric Korczewski's group at UCSD and multiple groups now the Broad Institute at Harvard MIT has identified about

1023
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:29,420
100 genes linked to autism spectrum disorder all involved in early fetal brain development.

1024
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,900
Many of them involved in neuronal communication.

1025
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,180
So a lot of neuronal cytoskeleton genes, for instance.

1026
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:41,060
So we did whole exome sequencing on Rachel and Ann and I at Baylor Genetics.

1027
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:49,220
And identified a neuronal cytoskeleton gene, a non-red cell spectrum, a neuronal spectrum, which makes a lot more sense in

1028
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,940
terms of understanding neuronal communications and that sort of thing.

1029
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:59,180
So I think what happens is you see the activation of genes in early fetal brain development.

1030
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,620
And that sets into motion a progression.

1031
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:07,820
But that full clinical expression of it doesn't happen till around 18, 19 months of age often.

1032
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:12,300
And that's not unusual for neuropsychiatric conditions.

1033
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:19,580
I mean, look at schizophrenia, for instance, which oftentimes, you know, kids with schizophrenia are not diagnosed to

1034
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,580
adolescents or even young adults.

1035
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,540
And so this is how the brain works.

1036
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:28,900
I think I'm not a neuroscientist, but that's that's my take on this.

1037
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:38,060
What I mean, just on a personal level, how how did you cope with this realization?

1038
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:44,660
And did it ever cause you to question anything that you were doing or was it very clear?

1039
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:52,660
Like, were you able to sort of distance it or think about it through kind of a scientific lens, even though it was something very

1040
01:15:52,660 --> 01:16:00,340
personal and it, you know, it became it went from being, you know, this is the scientific literature in its entirety to this is my

1041
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,340
daughter.

1042
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:09,220
Yeah, well, back in the 90s, we knew a lot less about autism than we know now and all the things that I told you about a lot of it has only

1043
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,700
come to light in the last few years.

1044
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,660
And then the Wakefield paper came out.

1045
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:18,620
And I remember that because I think Rachel was about five years old at the time.

1046
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,780
And, you know, and it was all over the papers.

1047
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,780
And of course, Anne was asking me about it.

1048
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,700
And to me, it never made sense.

1049
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:36,380
It said, how can it be that I mean, I mean, they called it pervasive developmental disorder back then for a reason, because it was indeed

1050
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:43,420
pervasive. And and you could see that, you know, that a lot of these kids were macrocephalic.

1051
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,300
They have enlarged heads.

1052
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:54,380
And so this was clearly a neuro anatomical condition.

1053
01:16:54,380 --> 01:17:04,860
I mean, you knew that there were shifts in Purkinje fibers and and and there were structural alterations in the brain of kids with

1054
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:11,620
autism. How can it be that a vaccine you give it one year of age would would cause that?

1055
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,620
It just never made any sense to me.

1056
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,660
There was never. And so for me, there was never the plausibility.

1057
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:22,060
But the full weight of scientific evidence wasn't there.

1058
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:25,140
I mean, that was my opinion more than any.

1059
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,140
And it turns out more or less to be true.

1060
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:35,380
And and but so that's why I was one of the early adopters of saying there is no way in hell it's going to be M.M.R.

1061
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:39,780
vaccine. And and it just doesn't make any sense.

1062
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:46,420
It's going to sound like a strange question, but was there a part of you that almost wished it was so that you might be able to say this would be

1063
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,780
amazing if we knew this?

1064
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,860
Because again, at the time, Wakefield proposed this.

1065
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,020
He wasn't even saying that all vaccination was bad.

1066
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,940
He was simply saying they should be separate vaccines.

1067
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,580
Don't put measles, mumps, rubella in one shot.

1068
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,620
Give them separately.

1069
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,180
This was his first thesis.

1070
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:09,740
And so even wearing your hat as an infectious disease physician, if if if you could have

1071
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,940
believed that the answer was M.M.R.

1072
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,580
combined causes autism.

1073
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:25,900
And while it won't save my daughter to know that I could spare every other parent, because clearly, you know, you you you you exude the ethos of wanting to help everyone.

1074
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,780
All we have to do is separate these vaccines and we could solve it.

1075
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:33,900
I mean, was there was there a part of you that just wanted this to be true?

1076
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,980
Not necessarily.

1077
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:41,020
I mean, I you know, if if it made sense to me and and.

1078
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:59,260
If if there was a logical explanation and yeah, if we knew there was a simple intervention, sure, but it was just so outrageous at the time that it wasn't even on my on on my radar screen at that time to think in that way.

1079
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:04,820
I just knew that it had to be genetic or maybe an epigenetic basis.

1080
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:11,700
And and by the way, that's a real treat trying to explain epigenetics to lay audiences.

1081
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:17,860
Start talking about micro RNAs and histone deacetylation.

1082
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,180
That one I'm still working on.

1083
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:23,940
But, you know, so the epigenetic component is another one that's important.

1084
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,220
But again, all of that had to be prenatal.

1085
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:39,460
And and I remember having some conversations with some of the anti vaccine people and then saying it had to be prenatal.

1086
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:46,660
And then they said and I said, yes, we do give some prenatal vaccines like flu vaccine.

1087
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,220
And then they the immediate response was aha.

1088
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:57,140
And I said, no, I mean, you know, again, I don't see how an immunization during pregnancy could be linked to that.

1089
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,620
And now the scientific data supports shows there's no link.

1090
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:07,020
So let's let's talk a little bit about the autism is still such a complicated thing in terms of people even understanding what it means.

1091
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,620
So the definition has has morphed a little bit.

1092
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,180
So today we talk about ASD being a spectrum.

1093
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:21,820
Right. And and it's gotten a very complicated because, you know, there's this whole concept out there of neurodiversity.

1094
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:34,380
And so there are many in the autism community who bristle if you even try to describe it as a pathologic condition, they say, no, this is just an example of neurodiversity.

1095
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,900
People are are different. And and and I understand that.

1096
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:48,300
And so the what I try to emphasize with Rachel, it's it's the not the autism per se that's incapacitating.

1097
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:57,300
It's it's it's the in her case, you know, she's got clear and profound intellectual disability.

1098
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:02,340
She can barely read. She can't count numbers. She can't do simple math.

1099
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:13,900
She can't you know, when she goes to the store to buy something, she will hand them a fistful of single dollar bills and say here because she doesn't know how to count the money.

1100
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:19,380
She no matter how hard we've tried to train her to do that, she doesn't understand the value of things.

1101
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:25,740
And so she depends on the goodness of the merchants in our local Montrose neighborhood have been great.

1102
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:30,100
You know, they kind of know Rachel.

1103
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:42,500
So it's in her case, it's the intellectual, profound intellectual disabilities that make it tough and make us worry because, you know, the other piece to this is now she's an adult with autism and intellectual disabilities.

1104
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:50,780
And the special services and all that kind of stuff really falls off the radar screen because we have no plan for her right now.

1105
01:21:50,780 --> 01:22:02,500
We don't know, you know, we've tried to have her in a residential facility, which, you know, I think did an OK job, but she was just too her.

1106
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,380
Her behavior was too uncooperative.

1107
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,540
And finally, they had to kind of kick her out.

1108
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:17,140
And so now she's with us. And what worries me is I don't know what is going to happen after, you know, and are no are no longer here.

1109
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:23,260
We don't there's no roadmap for what you do with an adult with this with intellectual disabilities.

1110
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,100
And that that really worries me, especially in Texas.

1111
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:30,180
It's just not strong with services of those kind.

1112
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,420
And maybe it's better up in the Northeast and we've heard New York and Massachusetts.

1113
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:39,980
But trying to work that as a huge, huge heavy burden on us.

1114
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,740
How is the diagnosis made today?

1115
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:59,740
So if if a parent today or a pediatrician today suspects that something is not normal, you know, whether it be language delay, you know, changes in behavior, emotional regulation, eye contact, all the things that would, you know, flag someone.

1116
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,540
What is the actual process by which a diagnosis is made?

1117
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:05,460
And what does this something that shows up in the DSM?

1118
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,340
I mean, how what is the what is the criteria for diagnosis?

1119
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,700
It's still in the DSM.

1120
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:16,460
The DSM is still not as strong as it could be, especially for girls, especially for little girls.

1121
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:27,580
But presumably, presumably it you get the child gets referred to something called birth to three, which is an early intervention program.

1122
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:35,620
And at some point, they get medical attention typically to a behavioral pediatrician, maybe a child psychiatrist.

1123
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,940
Only there are only about six of them left on the planet.

1124
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:44,140
There's a huge need for more child psychiatrists.

1125
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,460
I tell my medical students to go into child psychiatry with the hope that one of them goes goes into it.

1126
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:53,980
There's a it's a that's a real crisis as well.

1127
01:23:53,980 --> 01:24:07,300
But and and then the diagnosis is made along along the way of limited social interactions, in some cases, lack of speech, although again with girls and women, it's different.

1128
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,620
So there are a list of criteria that you can look at.

1129
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,540
What's on the differential diagnosis?

1130
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:21,060
Like, what are what are they trying to is it a diagnosis of exclusion where they're just basically saying, here are a bunch of things that could present with this pattern and we're going to rule them all out.

1131
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:33,220
And that which remains is ASD or or, you know, because when you think about so many things like it's not like Down syndrome where there's such a clear phenotype and genotype, right?

1132
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,140
Like it's unmistakable.

1133
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,940
This is much more nuanced.

1134
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:51,020
Well, I think in in our ears and future years, you know, we'll make whole exome sequencing so much more available that I think any time you have a child like that, you'll get a whole exome sequencing and we'll actually be able

1135
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,940
to potentially target it to a specific gene.

1136
01:24:53,940 --> 01:25:08,340
In some cases, that may be useful because there's could be pharmacological intervention in case there's something that is impairing abilities and can be targeted.

1137
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,660
Can you explain why that's important?

1138
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,740
Why whole exome sequencing is relevant versus just, quote unquote, a genetic sequence?

1139
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:23,020
Well, because with whole exome sequencing, you're getting the gene of every you're getting the full sequence of every expressed gene.

1140
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:33,140
And what that does for you is identifies rare mutations that you wouldn't pick up just by looking at at chromosomes.

1141
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:36,020
And so it's a very powerful technology.

1142
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:40,980
At this point, it only picks up around 40 percent of.

1143
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:53,900
So if you have autism and you do whole exome sequencing, my understanding is you only see a mutation maybe 30, 40 percent of the time because there's other things going on, including the non expressed genes.

1144
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,620
So exome sequencing just looks at the express genes.

1145
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:02,220
But if you do the whole genome, potentially you could pick up additional additional ones as well.

1146
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,780
So we're still in the early stages of that.

1147
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:22,540
And what's very interesting in that was some children's hospitals are looking at the possibility of doing whole exome sequencing and every child they admit for whatever cause, because we're learning so much about the genetics and epigenetics, not only of autism, but but so many other conditions.

1148
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:29,660
Right now, you're left with what I consider to be a somewhat rudimentary list of criteria from the DSM.

1149
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:50,980
And I'll never forget, Peter, I once had a lecture from a from a child psychiatrist and when I was in medical school at Cornell and and I remember him saying, you know, we're going to look upon the DSM is such a anachronistic or out of touch document for child psychiatry.

1150
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,780
It just doesn't cut.

1151
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:57,100
It's just really falls down for child psychiatric disorders.

1152
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,660
And that was, you know, in the 1980s, you know, maybe it's moved on since then.

1153
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:08,580
I'd be curious to hear from a child psychiatrist today what they think about the SM, but I'll never forget that that comment.

1154
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:17,140
And and when you look at the DSM criteria, they're just not really robust for so many childhood conditions.

1155
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:23,460
And again, this whole concept of neurodiversity is not reflected in the DSM like like it needs to be.

1156
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,460
It'll get refined.

1157
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:43,460
And I think that combining with whole exome sequencing and that combining with all the developments in neuropsychiatric medications, I think this things will look very different 10 years from now and then 10 years again from from then.

1158
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:47,660
Do you have a sense, ballpark, how many children that are born today?

1159
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:55,420
What what will be the incidence of autism in the cohort of kids born in 2021?

1160
01:27:55,420 --> 01:28:02,340
Well, I think one is, you know, the the number that's thrown out there now, what is it, one in 62?

1161
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,660
I can't remember the latest surprise.

1162
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,380
Yeah, I mean, it's it's it seems remarkably high.

1163
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:14,660
Well, remember, it could come close to doubling because we're not we're way undercounting all the girls with girls and women with autism.

1164
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:19,020
So it wouldn't surprise me that it would go down to something like one in 30 or now.

1165
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:22,140
What do we think that was in 1980, for example?

1166
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:35,100
Yeah, I don't even know, but very rare because, you know, the criteria change, you know, before there was a very strict criteria about nonverbal boys with certain repetitive behaviors.

1167
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,140
And we've enlarged so much and then it's going to get very murky.

1168
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:52,860
Right. Because we're going to go, you know, now with this whole picture of neurodiversity, at what point is it a condition that warrants criteria under the under DSM?

1169
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,500
And what is it just being neurodiverse?

1170
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,820
And and and I don't know that there's going to be a cutoff, right?

1171
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:02,940
It's always going to be that that gray zone.

1172
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,020
So I talked to my my my oldest daughter a lot who's an assistant professor at UCLA.

1173
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,060
She has a P.M.M.M.M.M.I.

1174
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:14,340
She's got a PhD in developmental psychology and works at the Center for Disabilities.

1175
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:20,620
And this is this is a real struggle and and difficult to get your arms around.

1176
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:25,580
But I think we still need a lot of brilliance around the around these points.

1177
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:29,380
At what point is it something that you diagnose in the DSM?

1178
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,140
And at what point is it not?

1179
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:34,540
And and I don't have the answers to that right now.

1180
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:46,500
When you consider something like Alzheimer's disease and you look at the change in prevalence over the last 50 years, it's you know, there are many factors involved.

1181
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,980
Right. People are living longer.

1182
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:50,540
The diagnosis is much more.

1183
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:53,940
We have many more tools to make the diagnosis.

1184
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:59,740
And then there are also factors that many of us, myself included, believe are actually increasing the incidence.

1185
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:04,020
So the prevalence is higher because people live longer because we diagnose more.

1186
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,860
But because the true incidence is increasing.

1187
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,860
And why do you think and by that, I'm just curious.

1188
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:11,140
Why do you why do you think that is?

1189
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:15,180
Because I think many of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are increasing dramatically.

1190
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:21,220
So vascular disease, metabolic disease being the two among obesity.

1191
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:28,340
Yeah. Yeah. As we see insulin resistance increase, as we see a dyslipidemia increase and all of the things that accompany it,

1192
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,980
I think we're actually creating more neuropathology.

1193
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,860
We're actually working with a group at Baylor because, you know, we make vaccines.

1194
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:51,500
There's a group at Baylor College of Medicine run by David Corey, who also has a collaboration with Europeans that have shown some evidence of fungal involvement, even Canada,

1195
01:30:51,500 --> 01:31:01,140
because there are some of the plaques that you see in the beta amyloid has got fungal sequences as well.

1196
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:08,700
And so, you know, what is the role of aspergillus and yeast forming fungi in this is getting very interesting.

1197
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:17,340
Yeah, I think that Alzheimer's disease is probably the for lack of a better word, the final common pathway of many.

1198
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,460
There are many roads to it.

1199
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,100
Many different.

1200
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:28,500
Yeah. Yeah. Right. And I do think that there's absolutely a sort of toxic version of it as well that may actually include infectious agents or environmental toxins and things like that.

1201
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,740
So well, the hope, you know, with fungal disease, you could do something about that.

1202
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,940
You could vaccinate, for instance, get fungal disease.

1203
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:43,060
Could would that could a fungal vaccine become a, you know, help with reducing neurodegenerative disease?

1204
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:45,260
So that's one of the things that we're starting to look at.

1205
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:51,620
So using that as a model for thought, how do you now think about autism?

1206
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:55,380
Right. Is it that, hey, we're clearly more attuned to this.

1207
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,500
So we're making we're making the diagnosis more.

1208
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,820
But do you also think there's an increase in the incidence?

1209
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:10,620
In other words, is there an environmental trigger that is either triggering this with or without manipulating the genome?

1210
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,820
So now we're going to have to talk about what epigenetics means.

1211
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:20,700
So people understand that you can have an environmental trigger that comes along, triggers a condition for which there's a genetic susceptibility

1212
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:26,300
that does not alter the genome or one that does so and alters the genome.

1213
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:32,380
So what do you think is actually happening and what are some of the plausible explanations?

1214
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:39,980
Well, before I answer that, let me just say just because this isn't complicated enough to make it even more complicated,

1215
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:52,260
there's a there's a group at Geisinger in Pennsylvania that's been looking at a number of psychiatric conditions

1216
01:32:52,260 --> 01:33:02,020
and they've identified groups of people who families that have the same genetic mutation.

1217
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:10,420
Yet one individual has been diagnosed with autism and other schizophrenia and another some other condition.

1218
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,220
I forget it was addictive behavior or something along those lines.

1219
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,700
So so you're right.

1220
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:25,700
It you know, the genetics is dominant, but I think there are epigenetic factors that that could have some influencing role.

1221
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,380
And most likely it's going on in pregnancy.

1222
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:36,980
So so when you talk about epigenetics, that doesn't discount entirely environmental factors.

1223
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:42,340
But but if it is, it's environmental factors happening in pregnancy.

1224
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:50,780
So explain why it has to be an environmental factor in pregnancy versus an environmental factor post utero.

1225
01:33:50,780 --> 01:34:03,060
Because I think and and again, I'm not a neuroscientist, but I think the structural changes in the brain and and is already well underway by the time the baby's born.

1226
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:12,100
So that there are processes that are set into when you look at all the work coming out of, you know, Eric or Chesney's lab and other labs there.

1227
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:21,060
It's clearly showing that this is going on pretty early fetal early on in fetal brain development, maybe as late as the second trimester.

1228
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:24,460
But but but happening in utero.

1229
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:35,460
And that's where all the action is occurring so that if it is an environmental if there is environmental influences, it's most likely something happening in pregnancy.

1230
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,260
So if if if you're a parent or a soon to be parent and you're listening to this, you're terrified.

1231
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:49,860
Right. I mean, it's terrifying enough to think that during the first six months of your pregnancy, the first and second trimester, so many things can go wrong.

1232
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:55,580
I mean, obviously, during the first trimester, you're mostly just thinking about not miscarrying.

1233
01:34:55,580 --> 01:35:06,340
And then once you sort of get through, call it week eight, nine, ten, and you're thinking, OK, well, we're almost halfway to the point of knowing we're not going to be confident we're not going to miscarry.

1234
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,860
Then you start to think about big structural stuff.

1235
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:15,060
Is the heart OK? Does this thing have four chambers? Is the brain of normal size?

1236
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:27,780
You know, to think that there's some environmental trigger that could take a genetically susceptible fetus and render them autistic.

1237
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:34,540
I can't imagine how that doesn't produce an incredible amount of speculation and consternation.

1238
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,580
Right. But but but I think you have to be careful with your language.

1239
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,300
So it's not just genetically susceptible. The genes are there and they're.

1240
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:46,780
Are these deterministic? They're causing autism.

1241
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:52,700
There might be some environmental influences that could that could affect expression through epigenetics.

1242
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:57,860
But it's not so simple as to say genetic susceptibility.

1243
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,940
I don't think it's it's quite I don't think it's quite that straightforward.

1244
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:03,180
How deterministic do we think these genes are, then?

1245
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:06,580
I can't I can't give you us. I can't give I know you're what you're looking for.

1246
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:10,340
You're looking for an 80 20 90 10 70 30.

1247
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,940
And I don't I don't think I don't think we know that.

1248
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:17,620
I mean, it's polygenic, presumably. What do we think here?

1249
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:21,900
Well, in Rachel's case, it seemed to be so far as what we know, it's a single gene.

1250
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,860
And I think that's true. But but they're not all the same gene.

1251
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:32,380
So the point is the Broad Institute, Harvard, MIT paper, which I think was in cell identified about 100 genes.

1252
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:39,660
But the common denominator was they seem to be all involved in early fetal brain development,

1253
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:52,980
all and all except for one in the cortex of the brain, most involved in early excitatory and inhibitory neurons and a lot of them in neuronal cytoskeleton.

1254
01:36:52,980 --> 01:37:00,060
So so there's a lot there there. I mean, it's clearly the genes are dominant.

1255
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:12,340
Whether or not there's some epigenetic influences that can affect, you know, whether it's full on expression of autism or whether there's schizophrenic components to it.

1256
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:23,260
I think that that that may be likely as well, but it's not as simple as saying just genetic susceptibility and it's overwhelmingly the environmental factor.

1257
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:28,900
I think it's the other way around. I think it's overwhelmingly the genetics is the dominant factor.

1258
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:33,940
And yes, deterministic. And maybe there are some epigenetic influences.

1259
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:43,660
So if that's the case, then there would be really two reasonable explanations for the for an increase in the incidence of autism.

1260
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:50,340
I mean, do you believe that there has been an increase in the incidence of autism over the last 40 or 50 years, a true increase in incidence, not diagnosis?

1261
01:37:50,340 --> 01:38:04,020
No, I've not seen any evidence for that. But I can, you know, I concede it's it's tough to prove given, you know, you know, and I and I get different.

1262
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:10,420
Some of the things I ask are teachers, you know, are you seeing more autism and most teachers will say, yeah, I'm seeing a lot more autism.

1263
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:14,740
But I think a lot of that is due to more awareness.

1264
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:20,900
I think a lot of things that we now call call autism.

1265
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:28,460
We didn't call autism back then. I mean, we use the R word a lot right there, mentally retarded or this or that.

1266
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,860
And now we realize they're on the autism spectrum.

1267
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:40,540
There's also this component and some teachers have told me, you've said, well, if you want to get special services for your kid, you have to label it as autism.

1268
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:43,660
Otherwise, they're not eligible for special services.

1269
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:48,020
And how much of that is going on is hard for me to know either.

1270
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:58,460
But I think overall, and again, as I point out, as we get better with diagnosing girls and women with autism, those numbers are going to go through the roof yet again.

1271
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:02,660
So how how how heritable do you believe the transmission of this is?

1272
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:16,100
Is this something where, you know, it's sort of like eye color where a child can be born with green eyes to a parent of blue and brown eyes?

1273
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,340
How how do the genes transmit?

1274
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,100
What's the best guess? Yeah, again, not an expert.

1275
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,860
I mean, in some cases, I think just spontaneous mutations.

1276
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:36,700
I think others, you know, when Rachel was diagnosed with autism, you know, and said, you know, clearly, it's your side of the family.

1277
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:40,020
And I said, what do you mean? What about your what about your uncle?

1278
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:44,100
So and so. And so there was those kinds of discussions.

1279
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:56,020
So, yeah, hard to know. I mean, I think I think clearly you see autism in in parents of kids with autism.

1280
01:39:56,020 --> 01:40:01,620
And it may not be fully diagnosed, but you definitely see that a lot of times.

1281
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:11,780
And I think that that's quite common. And has a theory that autism is more common among people of intellectual accomplishment.

1282
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:15,180
And and maybe there's some truth to that.

1283
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:24,980
But I think it's just bias on the basis of people that, you know, I've been at a university my whole life and is always running into academics.

1284
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:29,540
So I can understand why she thinks that. But I don't think that's been well established.

1285
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:37,020
That's really interesting, Peter. I actually took it as I guess I took it as a given that there was a true increase in the incidence of autism,

1286
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:49,220
though not as significant as what the perception is, because this was also the perception is also being driven by, as you say, just a tremendous increase in awareness,

1287
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:54,220
diagnostic criteria becoming broader, more things being included.

1288
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,260
Right. So, for example, what used to be called Asperger's is now technically a part of ASD.

1289
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,420
Right. Right. But I guess the question is, how would you ever sort it out?

1290
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:12,260
That's the that's the other problem. I think it's, you know, I guess what you could look if you had specific genetic markers that you could look at.

1291
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:19,340
That would be something you can hang on to and say, is the increase in certain genetic markers going up?

1292
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:31,060
And but that's not trivial to look at either. But I've always felt that there's been no true increase, but there may be some evidence for it.

1293
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:36,820
So let's pivot to a little bit of the current around Covid.

1294
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:48,700
As we stand here today, Peter, we're well on the path to most Americans who want to be vaccinated are getting pretty close to being vaccinated.

1295
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:53,940
By the way, what's the latest on the vaccination of children?

1296
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:58,740
Where is the CDC on that? What do we know about the vaccine?

1297
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:02,420
How many of the current vaccines as we stand here today?

1298
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:05,460
Really, there are three that are used in the US, correct?

1299
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:09,300
I think the AstraZeneca one is not used in the United States.

1300
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,660
That's right. It hasn't gone through emergency.

1301
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,740
They haven't applied for emergency use authorization.

1302
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:16,460
I'm worried about that vaccine for reasons that we can talk about.

1303
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:20,060
But then there's the Novavax vaccine.

1304
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:25,940
So and there could be as many as five by the spring.

1305
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:35,980
The in terms of kids, Pfizer just released data showing high levels of efficacy and adolescence, 12 to 15.

1306
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:42,260
But there were small numbers. There was around twelve hundred in the vaccine group, twelve hundred in the control group.

1307
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:47,740
And there were 18 cases of Covid in the in the control group, none in the vaccinated group.

1308
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:51,580
And on that basis, in their press release, they said 100 percent efficacy.

1309
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:54,940
I'm sure that won't hold up. I mean, it's too small a number.

1310
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:59,820
One of the interesting things about the about the kids, though, in those those adolescents,

1311
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:06,340
the virus neutralizing antibody titers are really high, like twelve hundred, so higher than older adults.

1312
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:09,140
So that may be a factor as well.

1313
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:20,780
And we're now starting to get our arms around correlates of protection that really high levels of virus neutralizing antibody seem roughly to correlate with efficacy.

1314
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:27,220
Is that consistent with your belief, Peter, that this would be more B cell mediated than T cell mediated?

1315
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:28,780
Well, I think T cells have a role.

1316
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:33,380
I mean, I think in virus neutralizing antibody may not be everything,

1317
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:38,740
but if you don't have high levels of virus neutralizing antibody, you're not going to get protection.

1318
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:45,900
And the problem with comparing those virus neutralizing antibodies is.

1319
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:50,140
Is when you look at the actual papers.

1320
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:55,540
They compare it with convalescent serum titers and they're all over the map.

1321
01:43:55,540 --> 01:44:00,700
And so so now there's a paper up on Med Archive that does something very simple,

1322
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:06,380
which is rather than just give the absolute value for the geometric mean titers,

1323
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:16,540
whether it's against pseudo virus or whether it's whether it's against plaque reduction neutralization titers,

1324
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:27,380
what they do is they do a ratio of the virus neutralizing antibody titers against the vaccine versus the virus neutralizing antibody titers on the convalescent to kind of normalize it.

1325
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:32,660
And there's this very nice curve that's been generated that shows you need to get it,

1326
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:44,940
that the level of virus neutralizing antibodies has to be at least as high as the convalescent and preferably about one point five or two to get really high levels of protection.

1327
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,340
And I think that's probably what we're looking at.

1328
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,940
So it's not quite a true correlate of protection, but I think we're moving in that direction.

1329
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:55,980
And the adolescents get really high levels of virus neutralizing the antibody.

1330
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:59,620
And did that Pfizer study give two shots or one?

1331
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,100
I think it was two. OK, it's two.

1332
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:11,860
So now that we're out of the gate and millions of people have been vaccinated, do you have any preference or concern over any of the vaccines?

1333
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:16,380
You obviously mentioned AstraZeneca, which I want to hear about, but let's start with the U.S. vaccines.

1334
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:20,060
Any reason to believe that one is better than the other?

1335
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:25,900
In fact, I'll share with you something that I found very interesting, which was the J and J vaccine, which is a single vaccine.

1336
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:33,060
And that that vaccine, well, the headline is lower efficacy.

1337
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:43,460
If you actually look at the absolute risk reduction as opposed to the relative risk reduction is at least as efficacious as Pfizer and Moderna.

1338
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,700
I found that to be very interesting.

1339
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:48,100
And I'm surprised how that was sort of omitted from all the press.

1340
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:54,140
Yeah. And I and I also think it's hard to compare because it's a single dose.

1341
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:57,540
It's being given a single dose versus the two doses.

1342
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:08,780
And I'm and it wouldn't surprise me if that J and J vaccine ultimately becomes a two dose vaccine down the line because you may want to give a booster for one of the variants as well.

1343
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:14,220
And in two doses, the virus neutralizing antibody titers is really, really high.

1344
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:20,220
And it'll be as good or in terms of protection as as Pfizer and Moderna.

1345
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:26,220
Certainly, I think the single to me, the single dose J and J looks better than the single dose Pfizer and Moderna.

1346
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:30,060
Not by much. The bottom line is they're all good. They're all good vaccines.

1347
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:36,580
And I also think don't be surprised if later on we're going to need a boost for all of them.

1348
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:42,060
So there'll be a third dose of the Moderna Pfizer vaccine or a second dose of the J and J.

1349
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:48,540
And what that will do is it'll elevate virus neutralizing antibody titers higher.

1350
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:52,780
It'll create more durability of protection, I think.

1351
01:46:52,780 --> 01:47:04,420
And that boost will be reconfigured for the South African or the and the Brazilian variant, which are not here in a big way in the U.S.,

1352
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:07,300
but may become a bigger problem down the line right now.

1353
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,900
It's the U.K. variant, the B.1.1.7 variant that's accelerating.

1354
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:14,820
All of the operational warp speed vaccines work really well against the U.K. variant.

1355
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:20,100
That's because that variant has not mutated through its spike protein.

1356
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:33,100
Well, it has. So the U.K. variant has a single amino acid substitution in in in an aromatic amino out creating an aromatic amino acid.

1357
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,620
And that seems to reduce the level of virus neutralizing antibody.

1358
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,740
I don't know if I have a mechanism to show you pictures.

1359
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:41,180
Yeah. Do you know how to share a screen on Zoom?

1360
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:44,460
Yeah, I have a really cool graphic.

1361
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,380
It's a little bit of molecular biology, but not but not much.

1362
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:55,500
I I just showed this at a at a pediatric Grand Rounds at Columbia this morning.

1363
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,540
And to me, it it it helps people understand it.

1364
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:02,780
But it's as I often like to say, it's not a 30 second UNICEF commercial.

1365
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:11,260
So this is a paper that's up in BioArchive, a preprint server and looking at the B.1.1.7 variant.

1366
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:20,540
And so looking and what in the spike protein, what there is, there's an amino acid substitution in the 501 position.

1367
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:27,140
What went from a nespera gene to a tyrosine and a tyrosine is an aromatic amino acid.

1368
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:34,300
It has a ring to it and they're able to show model it with the receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme.

1369
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,300
It's got a nice strong bond there.

1370
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,500
Yeah, there's a ring ring interaction.

1371
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:46,300
So it's these pi pi, these pi electrons that circulate in aromatic rings that are interacting with each other.

1372
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:48,860
In addition, there's a hydrogen bond.

1373
01:48:48,860 --> 01:49:02,980
And the reason I love this so much is, you know, all of all we're talking about with this big acceleration of cases going up in Michigan and affecting younger people and higher mortality and morbidity.

1374
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:05,660
It's a bit of a simplification, but then again, it's not.

1375
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:18,380
It's all coming down to pi pi interactions between between two aromatic rings in in in two tyrosines.

1376
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:23,300
Right. It's actually kind of let's just make sure people understand this because not everybody understands biochemistry, right?

1377
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:30,900
Each amino acid is coded for by it.

1378
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:31,900
There's a code, right?

1379
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:36,980
So you have three nucleotides that code for an amino acid.

1380
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:44,140
And if you know, so it sounds like one of those gets changed and it changed the amino acid.

1381
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:47,020
And I can't remember. Did you say it started at three anneine or which?

1382
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:50,420
Yeah, it was. So this is the wild type or the original lineages.

1383
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:52,220
Now it's switching over to a tyrosine.

1384
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,020
It's basically.

1385
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:56,140
Yeah. So it went from from three anneine to tyrosine.

1386
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:06,580
And then all of a sudden that changes, literally changes the shape, but also creates kind of an electrochemical attraction that wasn't there before.

1387
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:16,940
And so all of a sudden the spike protein has a greater basically a greater attraction to the ACE2.

1388
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,300
Receptor.

1389
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:26,380
Right. Which which was presumably translates into better virus entry and maybe more virus replication.

1390
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:28,740
And that's why you're getting more severe disease.

1391
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:33,700
And and it's affecting younger younger people are getting sicker as well.

1392
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:43,180
The good news is the virus neutralizing antibodies to the original spike protein seems to still work well against this B1 1 7 variant.

1393
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:46,100
So we're going to take this picture now and zoom out a bit.

1394
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:50,340
So now this is this is the spike protein, which is a trimer.

1395
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:54,060
Actually, let me show you a real picture of it so you so you can see what it looks like.

1396
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,940
This is what this is the trimeric spike protein.

1397
01:50:57,180 --> 01:51:01,620
So these are these little purple pink flowers on top.

1398
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,620
Each one is a trimeric spike protein.

1399
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,260
And now we're going to show it again here.

1400
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:10,620
And they've got each one has its own receptor binding domain.

1401
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:20,020
And now what's going to happen is only one of the receptor binding domains flips up and binds to the receptor to the ACE2 receptor.

1402
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:26,300
And here's that one amino acid substitution again that I blew up on on the previous slide.

1403
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:32,700
And so if you had the wild type on here, Peter, it would show it would look the same, but it would look the same.

1404
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,460
You would just have a lower affinity there.

1405
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,020
Yeah. And you wouldn't see this.

1406
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,660
This wouldn't be marked as having this mutation.

1407
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:45,660
But the point is the antibodies to all of the original lineages from the vaccines seem to work just as well.

1408
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:48,060
It could still neutralize this interaction.

1409
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:59,500
The problem comes in now with the other variants that are coming up from South Africa and in Brazil, the P1 variant from Brazil and the B1351.

1410
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:07,420
That's got a second amino acid substitution over here, which is going which is creating a lysine.

1411
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,820
And that I think is creating extra levels of electrostatic interaction.

1412
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,500
So the binding potentially is even tighter.

1413
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:20,460
And this now is interfering with the ability of antibodies to neutralize.

1414
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:27,500
So the virus neutralizing antibody titer goes down and that translates to decreased inefficacy.

1415
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:35,940
So when you look at the published numbers, these are some of the numbers here of the level of efficacy against the original.

1416
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:43,220
I'll call that original slash UK, which is probably roughly about the same versus the South African variant.

1417
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,700
And that's why you see it going down.

1418
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:47,540
Wow. So this is interesting.

1419
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:48,980
Let's digest this for a second.

1420
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:55,300
So Pfizer and Moderna take an enormous reduction against that variant.

1421
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:57,340
Well, no, no, let's let's be careful.

1422
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:02,580
So the so the Novavax and J&J, that's actual efficacy, published efficacy data.

1423
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:05,500
OK. In the case of Pfizer and Moderna,

1424
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:12,140
what you're looking at here is declines in levels of virus neutralizing antibody in vitro.

1425
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,940
Thanks for clarifying that.

1426
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:18,700
So these are in vitro studies and and that, yeah, that's very important.

1427
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:23,700
And it's still because the level of virus neutralizing antibodies so high to begin with,

1428
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:28,060
there's enough residual that it's just still getting good protection.

1429
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:31,020
And I but we don't yet have the clinical data to see.

1430
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:37,020
Well, now Pfizer issued a press release yesterday saying they think in a very small set,

1431
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:40,620
it seems to work really well against the South African variant.

1432
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:47,020
And which makes sense given the high levels of virus neutralizing antibody to begin with.

1433
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:52,500
Tell me why you think the AstraZeneca takes the biggest hit here then.

1434
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:59,420
Yeah, so the AstraZeneca started out with, you know, in some cases, not as high levels of virus neutralizing antibody.

1435
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:06,900
And a study was done in South Africa showing only 10 percent basically ineffective against the South African variant.

1436
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:17,860
But, you know, talking to the Oxford people, one of the things they say is it's a little unfair because they only tested it against moderate and mild disease.

1437
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:24,460
And they feel that if you were to test against severe illness, it would still be very effective.

1438
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:29,580
And they counter that the J&J results were mostly looking at severe illness.

1439
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:36,740
And if they had if they if if they like J&J had looked at severe illness, they would have come up with similar numbers.

1440
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,020
But, you know, I guess we have to wait and see what what happens with that.

1441
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:50,580
The bigger issue with the AstraZeneca vaccine is is just public perception around the cerebral thrombosis that is being reported out of Europe.

1442
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:55,140
And I think that's causing a lot of a lot of damage.

1443
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,940
You know, and it's in it and it goes back and forth.

1444
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:10,020
You know, the German government through their Paul Ehrlich Institute pointed out you had six, I think, was six cases of of sinus venous thrombosis,

1445
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:13,660
which is a rare condition in the vaccinated group, and they suspended it.

1446
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:15,860
And then several other European countries did.

1447
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:20,140
And that had big ramifications, especially for Africa.

1448
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:25,260
You know, Francophone Africa listens to what's going on in France and et cetera.

1449
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:32,860
And I was going on a number of podcasts, not podcasts, but zoom conferences with groups in Africa.

1450
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:40,100
And they were very concerned about the AstraZeneca because that was supposed to be a workhorse vaccine for low and low and middle income countries.

1451
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:44,100
The European medicine agencies came along and said, no, no, it looks OK.

1452
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:49,820
It's, you know, it's we think, you know, this is not related to the vaccine.

1453
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:58,660
But then in Science magazine, two excellent science journals, Gretchen Vogel and Kai Kupperschmitt, looked at this and, you know,

1454
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:05,260
have identified about, you know, they wrote about 31 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis.

1455
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:12,220
And, you know, clearly, you know, more clearly showing it could be linked to the vaccine is a very rare event.

1456
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:24,460
But but still that that can really alter public perception, especially in light of all of the very aggressive anti vaccine activities that are happening.

1457
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,900
So I don't know what the US is going to do at this point.

1458
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:34,380
I hope they do authorize it for emergency release, even if they never use it in the US.

1459
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:41,860
And the reason is, if the US declines or if that derails, I think you could have a chilling effect on Latin America and Africa,

1460
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:48,500
because we don't have a lot of vaccines out there. That's that's why we came along with our recombinant protein vaccine,

1461
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:54,060
because they're not a lot of options. The big issue is for the Astra.

1462
01:56:54,060 --> 01:57:00,700
You know, if you look at what's going to be made for low and middle income countries, there are not a lot of choices out there.

1463
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:04,540
I mean, the two mRNA vaccines, it's still a new technology.

1464
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:09,300
We're not going to be able to scale it up in a big way for Africa and Latin America.

1465
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:14,820
Yes, I mean, it's great. They, you know, Pfizer donated two hundred and thirty thousand doses to Rwanda.

1466
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:22,740
It was fantastic. But look at the numbers. There's one point one billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, six hundred and fifty million people in Latin America.

1467
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:25,860
We're going to need four billion doses of vaccines.

1468
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:28,940
Where's that going to come from? It's not going to come from the mRNA vaccines.

1469
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:31,460
Is the refrigeration also a problem?

1470
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:38,900
Yeah, the fact that you have the that onerous freezer requirement and then, you know, the J and J is having, you know, some issues in scaling up production.

1471
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:46,900
You know, part of the problem was when the science policymakers were looking at this, they went so heavy on the innovation.

1472
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:52,260
And they wound up producing a lot of really cool vaccines that are highly effective.

1473
01:57:52,260 --> 01:58:04,940
But in terms of durability for scale up to make four billion doses, I don't think that was high enough on their radar screen and didn't realize that when you use a brand new technology, it's really hard to move to four billion doses.

1474
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:15,580
And that's why I'm hoping our vaccine comes along, you know, which is, you know, in part, you know, a couple of donors came to me after your after one of the podcasts I did with you.

1475
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:30,540
And that was game changing for us because it allowed us to adapt our coronavirus program for vaccines who are making for SARS and mares to this recombinant protein vaccine for covid-19.

1476
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,180
What's the what's the vehicle?

1477
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:36,740
It's recombinant protein in yeast, just like the hepatitis B vaccine.

1478
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,700
And you could produce a ton of it.

1479
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:44,900
They could they have capacity for producing 100 million doses a day, a month.

1480
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:50,060
And it's looking really good in clinical trials and in non-human primate trials.

1481
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:53,300
I can't talk about it yet, but it should be out soon.

1482
01:58:54,460 --> 01:59:02,100
And hopefully that will come in and make a big difference, because I'm really scared that we have nothing for Africa and Latin America.

1483
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:07,060
I mean, what's amazing is how I had to, you know, struggle for funding.

1484
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:20,220
I mean, I was spending a good part of last year just trying to keep the program going because it was so hard to get funds for what was so obviously needed, which is a low cost, unfussy, durable vaccine for low and middle income countries.

1485
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:23,820
And, you know, because of your podcast groups like, you know, the

1486
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:29,380
the Tita's vodka came through with some funding.

1487
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:34,820
They're based in Austin and an anonymous donor and a couple of others.

1488
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:38,100
So now the Claybrook Foundation is helping us in a big way.

1489
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:43,500
There are Texas Foundation and in the J.P.B. Foundation and a few others.

1490
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,100
So that that was game changing.

1491
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:52,900
So, Peter, based on everything you're saying, it sounds like the biggest concern right now would have to be Brazil followed by Africa.

1492
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:55,940
You didn't unless I missed it.

1493
01:59:55,940 --> 02:00:05,340
Did you explain the mutation in Brazil and the efficacy that any of the current vaccines would have against it notwithstanding the scale up limitations?

1494
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:07,100
Yeah, a couple of things.

1495
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:13,300
So the P1 variant in Brazil has those same two amino acid changes in the South African.

1496
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:17,900
So I kind of think of them as brother sister issues.

1497
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:26,460
So we're going to have so dealing with South Africa will also have will will hopefully take care of Brazil as well.

1498
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:34,700
One other thing I wanted to mention is, you know, the the global policymakers did a good job of creating this COVAX sharing facility.

1499
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:37,620
It's really quite brilliant in its design.

1500
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:41,260
I think that's not the issue, you know, because they were really worried about equity.

1501
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:51,140
The equity issue, I think, was more of the fact that we didn't ensure there was enough vaccine available for the COVAX sharing facility.

1502
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:54,100
And that's that's really the problem right now.

1503
02:00:54,100 --> 02:01:08,100
And hopefully we can come in and address it and and and and take care of this, because if we don't figure out a way to vaccinate the rest of the world, if we only vaccinate North America and Europe, it's going to be a catastrophe.

1504
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:21,340
This virus is going to continue to circulate and cause tremendous humanitarian destruction, but also who knows what other variants could evolve as well as a consequence of allowing that to go unfettered.

1505
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,900
What what drives the evolutionary pressure here of this of these mutations?

1506
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:37,300
Is it just standard Darwinian behavior where enough mutations occur and they're escaping because these mutations like how does the mutagenicity of this virus

1507
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:41,300
compare to influenza? It seems far less than influenza. Is that safe?

1508
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,220
Yeah. So a lot of us were surprised by by the variants.

1509
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:50,460
We thought that we hadn't really seen this as much in coronaviruses.

1510
02:01:50,460 --> 02:02:06,260
What some people speculate is it happened because of an immunocompromised individual who, you know, had a lot more virus replication in their system and that combining even possibly

1511
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:12,300
with receiving plasma convalescent therapy that put some kind of selective pressure on it.

1512
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:16,900
And that's kind of a hypothesis that's out there, but, you know, it's not strong.

1513
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:20,620
I don't think we really know that for certain at this point.

1514
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:29,580
The good news is the way I see it is a lot of the viruses are converging to the same mutations.

1515
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:43,340
So my hope and it's only a hope and there's I know many consensus in the scientific community is that if we make a booster to this South African slash P1 Brazil variant,

1516
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:51,220
we might be done at that point that there won't be this continual evolution for totally something different.

1517
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:54,460
But but I don't think we know that for certain.

1518
02:02:54,460 --> 02:03:04,140
So the good news also is it looks like our vaccine seems to give pretty good levels of virus neutralizing antibody to the South African variant as well.

1519
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:08,460
So we're making the booster for it for the South African just in case, but we may not need it.

1520
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:12,140
We'll see. And we don't know how often we would need the booster.

1521
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:14,860
It could be every six months, every 12 months, every 18 months.

1522
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:19,860
It's too soon to tell, obviously, until we have longitudinal data looking at the neutralizing antibodies.

1523
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:32,260
Yeah, I mean, my dream situation is we give this one boost beyond the original vaccine series later this year, next year, and then we're done that it won't have to be every year.

1524
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:35,300
But like anything else, we'll just have to monitor and follow it.

1525
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:39,220
But, you know, people say it's going to be like flu where you have to vaccinate every year.

1526
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:41,500
And at this point, I don't think so.

1527
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:49,700
But I can't say for certain because in the case of the flu, that's driven more by the mutagenicity than the lack of BESOL response, isn't it?

1528
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:54,900
Well, in the case of the flu, you're getting these wholesale antigenic shifts.

1529
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:57,540
So it's really like a totally different virus.

1530
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:14,460
And there's this carefully orchestrated dance where you that we have in place to monitor flu virus strains, you know, maybe coming out of Asia and then quickly transmitting the message to the pharmaceutical manufacturers who make a whole different vaccine every year.

1531
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:15,780
It's really quite extraordinary.

1532
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:20,500
I don't think we're going to need to do that for coronavirus vaccines.

1533
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:24,460
That's at least that's my hope. But we'll see how this unfolds.

1534
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:31,620
But one thing's for certain, if you look at the if you look at what's available for Africa and Latin America right now, it's it's not good.

1535
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:40,500
And so I've been talking to a colleague, Patrick Shung Shin, who's in Los Angeles.

1536
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:49,420
And he's really interested to see, can we build out vaccine development capacity in Africa or maybe Latin America?

1537
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:59,780
Because right now there's no vaccines made on the African continent and very not enough in Latin, not nearly enough in Latin America, not much in the Middle East.

1538
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:09,900
And we've learned that if you only rely on the multinational companies, even with that great Covax sharing facility, they're they're not going to make.

1539
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:13,780
They're not going to make new vaccines for the world, at least in rapid time frame.

1540
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:16,540
I mean, they still it's amazing. They do what they do.

1541
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:22,380
I mean, Gavi, the Gavi Alliance for Vaccine in the World's Children depends heavily on the multinational companies.

1542
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:34,260
They do a great job. But we we need parallel mechanisms in place like new vaccine development production facilities in locally in Africa and Latin America.

1543
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:41,980
And that's something I'm very that we've been working a lot in this concept of vaccine diplomacy and building that out.

1544
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:51,060
Well, Peter, I know that we have a real hard stop in time because you've got another obligation, but I'm really happy that we were able to spend a couple hours together.

1545
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:54,900
We covered a lot of ground and we actually got through half of what I wanted to talk about.

1546
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:58,100
So I consider that a win. It was an only half.

1547
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:06,140
OK, well, I'm always happy to come back. You know, I love I love being on your podcast one because I learned so much from you.

1548
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:14,260
And and the thing I really appreciate is you you ask questions that I just never would have thought of on my own.

1549
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:18,140
And, you know, after you ask it, I say, why don't I know that I should have?

1550
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:22,700
I mean, that's so obvious that's that I should know that because it's the right question to ask.

1551
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:26,380
So you have this amazing talent for asking the right questions.

1552
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:29,460
I appreciate that. All right. Well, thanks very much again for everything, Peter.

1553
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:34,900
And I'm sure we will be talking again soon. OK, thanks so much.
