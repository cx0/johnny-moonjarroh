00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,560
today's episode. I guess this week is John Arnold. John is probably the guy that'll go down in history

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,680
as the most successful natural gas trader of all time. And we spend the first part of this episode

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,240
explaining that story. And you might think, well, what does that have to do with anything? Well,

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,880
it's only by understanding how John came to amass a fortune of billions of dollars trading natural

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,760
gas. Can you understand the second part of this discussion, which is how at the age of about 37

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,560
or 38, he shut it all down and turned all of his attention to the full-time craft slash business

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,400
slash art of philanthropy. John's philanthropy is as serious as his natural gas trading. And his

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,440
foundation, Arnold Ventures, which he is the co-chair of along with his wife, Laura, focuses on really

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,480
the hardest social problems imaginable. And in this episode, John discusses at great length where

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,680
philanthropy fits into the broader picture of the nonprofit sector, differentiating it from charity

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,360
and how that fits into even the broader umbrella of public or government spending and even private

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,400
spending. And it's only by understanding that lens that you can really understand how someone like

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,440
John thinks about deploying the types of resources they do, which are legion to be clear. The foundation

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:20,080
currently spends about $400 million a year in grants. And John's goal is to basically spend

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,960
their entire fortune in their lifetime solving very hard problems, problems like criminal justice

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,920
reform, health policy reform, K through 12 reform, public finance, things like that. We obviously

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,680
don't go nearly as deep as I would love to go into all of these topics. And yet somehow this podcast

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,880
managed to be probably two and a half hours, if not slightly more, which certainly leaves ample

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,840
room for a part two of this at some point in time. I guess one thing I would say about this is I'm

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,400
obviously fascinated by this topic and could sit here and talk about natural gas trading forever.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,920
If that subject matter isn't that interesting to you, what I would suggest is paying close

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
attention to the timestamps in your podcast player. You'll probably want to listen to the

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
first part of this because it's, I think John's background and growing up and his card trading

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,960
business, his baseball card trading business. I think that stuff is really important to kind

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,400
of understand John's mentality. You may actually want to skip his career where he goes from college

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,040
to work at Enron and don't worry, he's one of the good guys at Enron. And then you may want to

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,400
sort of skip to the part where he decides to shut his own hedge fund down and instead focus on

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
philanthropy. Again, I'll leave it up to you, but I guess the point I want to make is I wouldn't be

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,120
put off by the fact that if you're not interested in natural gas, you won't find this episode

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,400
interesting. I think this episode is interesting start to finish, but there may be some people who

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
only find one part in a string or another. So just pay attention to where that is. So without

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:53,080
further delay, please enjoy my conversation with John Arnold. Hey John, awesome to sit down with

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,640
you. I'm bummed we are not able to do this in person because anytime we sit down in person,

42
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,040
it is a long and fruitful discussion where I just feel like I'm learning at a geometric rate. But

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,600
nevertheless, I'm excited that we're finally getting to sit down and talk because there's so

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,400
many things on my mind. Now, a lot of people listening to this podcast will not really know

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,880
who you are. And I've struggled to think about the best way to introduce you. So I thought one of the

46
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,800
funniest ways to introduce you is to do so through the tweet that you have pinned at the top of your

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,000
page. So remind me your handle on Twitter is, is it John Arnold Foundation? John Arnold Foundation.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Okay. And what is it that you have pinned at the very top of that?

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,920
So it's essentially that I've been called the next Koch brother by the far left. And I've been

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,200
labeled the next George Soros for by the far right. And I think I write that I'm an equal

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,360
opportunity special interest pot stirrer. And I think it does label me a couple of ways versus

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,920
our actions at the foundation, which has been in his current form for about 10 years, have led to

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,040
getting into a lot of squabbles with both the left and the right. And at times it's been

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,280
frustrating at times it's been liberating. But it has brought a lot of conflict, which one doesn't

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,280
normally think about when you think about philanthropy and a philanthropist about having

56
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,600
conflict and fights and battles with a lot of these issues. And that's generally been a component

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,560
of our work, not by design, but by necessity. And then I think the second part of it that I like is

58
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,640
that we don't approach all problems with the same ideology. I think problems are different,

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,520
problems are complex. And the type of solution for each problem is different. So we don't say

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,040
that the free market is the right answer for everything. Don't say government is the right

61
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,160
answer for everything. But it depends on the makeup of the problem, the actors, the market

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,200
failures, et cetera, as to what the right solution is. And therefore, over the years, I've managed to

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,840
make mad both the left and the right, and sometimes simultaneously.

64
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,240
And by extension, I think there are many times that the right and the left also think you are

65
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,800
doing the greatest work on earth. I mean, I think that's the corollary of that, which is there are

66
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
times when you were in lockstep agreement with both sides as well, correct?

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes, although whenever... Not simultaneously.

68
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,480
They tend to be louder whenever you're in conflict with them than when they're showing appreciation.

69
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,440
Yeah. I think part of how we've chosen issues to work on is we're looking for

70
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,520
these system problems that have a lot of impact in people's lives, where the two sides, the left

71
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,960
and the right, have historically been divided for some reason, and that they're starting to come

72
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,760
together. There's a reason why there can be a solution that's viable today that wasn't viable

73
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,200
five years ago or 10 years ago. And that ends up being a component of almost every issue we work on,

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,280
is that the left and the right are coming together. And so we need to be able to work with both sides.

75
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,280
And so we've tried to tamp down the politics, both personally and professionally, over the years,

76
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,680
and try to see in the Venn diagram of things the left will support and the things the right will

77
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,800
support, even if it's for different reasons or different motivations. Let's explore those

78
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,920
territories and see what can be done. And I think we're going to explore one of those in greater

79
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,920
detail perhaps than others, which will be criminal justice. But currently, the foundation, I know,

80
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,640
focuses very heavily on health policy, public finance platforms, and criminal justice. And I

81
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,280
think at least one of those, and I don't know why I just personally find criminal justice to be such

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,880
an important one, maybe we'll come back to it, because it is one where I think

83
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,600
maybe the left and right have a different ultimate motivation for establishing it. But

84
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,120
the solutions can certainly benefit society on both sides. Let's take a step back, because to

85
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,280
put the magnitude of your philanthropy in scale, the foundation is deploying what type of assets

86
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,640
per year. Can you put some numbers to this for people? We give about 400 million a year. The

87
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,960
assets in the foundation are a little over 2 billion. And then we have a couple other giving

88
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,800
vehicles, specifically a DAF. We contribute money every year as well. So we have a high

89
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,640
spend rate, but our philanthropic intent is to give away the vast majority of our money

90
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,320
during our lifetimes. Yeah. And you're very young, John. You're in your mid-40s. You and your wife,

91
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,800
Laura, have been at this, as you said, since you were in your 30s. And yeah, you're sort of on a

92
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,920
mission to spend this enormous sum of money during your lifetime. That's something I want to come

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,280
back to, because it's also not a typical path to philanthropy. Many people are thinking about

94
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,680
serious philanthropy at a slightly later stage of their life. Let's start with the first half of the

95
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,200
story, which is where did this money come from? You didn't have a trust fund to my recollection,

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,520
right? I did not. I did not. So where did you grow up? I grew up in Dallas and a very boring,

97
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,960
great upper middle class lifestyle in Dallas, went to Dallas public schools, ended up going to

98
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:05,000
Vanderbilt. Let's go before Vanderbilt. What was your first business? First business. So probably

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,560
mowing lawns. I was sitting around one summer and said, I want to make some money. So what can a

100
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:19,000
12-year-old do to try to make a dollar? Not much. And so went knocking on every neighbor's door and

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,360
tried to find a lawn to mow and realized that everybody either cut it themselves or had a lawn

102
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,280
service already set up. And so that wasn't going to be my path to riches. And then kind of around

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:38,920
age 14, I ended up getting into the baseball card business pretty actively. So this was right around

104
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,960
1988, 89, 90, when the sports card business was taking off. And I had a small collection at the

105
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,280
time, but I always thought of it more as an asset rather than a collectible that I wanted to put

106
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,120
on my desk and look at every day. And so the first experience was just renting a table at a

107
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,520
local trade show for $30 and putting a lot of the collection on the table and trying to sell it. And

108
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,840
again, the sports card business was booming. And so came home with maybe $100 from the $30

109
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,880
investment. Now, of course, the cost of goods sold didn't really factor that in. Maybe that was a sunk

110
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,200
cost at the time. But it started getting me interested in this as a potential business. And

111
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,680
I kind of quickly figured out I didn't want to be spending my weekends sitting at the local trade

112
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,000
fair and couldn't I played highly competitive soccer. So I had things to do on the weekend.

113
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,320
But there was a wholesale market that didn't require as much time. And so this is really kind

114
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,640
of the, again, during the start of the bulletin boards of ways where people would transact. And

115
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,320
there was a small bulletin board of baseball card dealers where they would do the wholesale trading.

116
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,680
And the market was so volatile at the time. If a particular player went on a good streak for two

117
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,320
weeks, that card would get hot, especially in the region he played. And you'd start seeing

118
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,960
number one volatility in prices and second and a geographic differentiation in prices. So the

119
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,360
market for hockey cards was very strong in the Northeast and in Canada, a little in Michigan.

120
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,400
They would sell them across the nation. Now, the guys that bought them in Texas, there wasn't much

121
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,800
of a local market. So I could go buy the hockey cards there, ship them up to a dealer in New York,

122
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,240
and make a few dollars. And that few dollars, I would then reinvest and do it more.

123
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Then the sports card business was going parabolic at the time. And so kind of one thing led to

124
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,760
another, and I ended up spending a couple summers just finding full time on this baseball card,

125
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,720
really geographic arbitrage and information arbitrage, that I would have a sense of who the

126
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,360
best buyer was for every product, wherever they were in the United States, or even into Canada,

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,760
and would go around and try to find any bargains I could in the Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana,

128
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,200
Tri-State area, kind of do day trips down to Houston and go to the big fairs down here. It

129
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,040
would go canvas all the dealers. And that was really my first business.

130
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,920
And how were you able to drive around so young? This was pretty unusual for a kid your age to be

131
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,600
able to track that circle of geography, right? It was. I got my driver's license at a young age.

132
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,360
I think it was at 14. My father at the time was going through an illness. He had Crohn's disease.

133
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,320
Through his life and kind of a chronic condition that especially in my teen years became a bit

134
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,160
debilitating for him. And so I was able to get, I forget what the name of that particular license

135
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,600
was, but because there was a kind of family hurdle, family handicap that I was able to

136
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,880
start driving when I was 14. Did you know what the word arbitrage actually meant when you were

137
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,040
conducting it? Great question. And I don't remember. Can you explain to people, I mean,

138
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,000
you've effectively explained it in concept because it's such a big part of your ultimate business.

139
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Can you explain it more formally and technically to people? I would describe arbitrage as taking

140
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:30,280
advantage of price differences with little to no risk. I think true arbitrage is no risk where you

141
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,560
bought it for one and you've sold it at two and you've taken no risk in doing so. In reality,

142
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,400
there's always a little bit of risk. And so by knowing that the market in New York

143
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,040
valued something at $20 and it was trading in Texas at $15, I could take advantage of what I

144
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,480
call geographic arbitrage there, that the market in Texas was different from the market in New York.

145
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,960
Now, of course, today with the internet, a lot of those arbitrages and inefficiencies,

146
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,880
pricing inefficiencies have gone away or have been, we call them the trade, arbed out. And so

147
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,960
now you see the high frequency traders trying to make a hundredth of a penny on a share of stock

148
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,080
and have huge incentive to do so and do so at massive volume. But it's like buying and selling

149
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,640
same item with little to no risk. Which is a theme we'll obviously come back to at length. So

150
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,200
you go to Vanderbilt, you studied, if I recall, economics, yes?

151
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Econ and math. Did you have a sense of what you wanted to do when you were finished college?

152
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,200
I remember reading Liars Poker and I think Barbarians at the Gate, both

153
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:43,960
classic books about Wall Street. And although growing up in Dallas with my mom as a accountant,

154
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,320
my dad as a corporate lawyer, I didn't have a sense as to what Wall Street was except through

155
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,520
these books, except by reading Wall Street Journal every day. And it seemed like that was the biggest

156
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:02,120
game around. I got drawn to that game or the desire to enter that game. And so my goal

157
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,360
throughout college was to get the job and the classic post college analyst job at a big Wall

158
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,240
Street bank. So then how did that pan out? And I also recall from our discussions that you

159
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,200
blazed through college. I think you got your degree in three years by taking summer classes

160
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,240
and just being kind of maniacally focused on your degree. Is that right? Yeah, take 18 hours

161
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,920
every semester, did summer school one summer, came in with some credits. And I was the guy that

162
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,920
was trying to get out of there and into the game as quickly as possible. Every day I was at college

163
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,000
was one less day that I had to be in the game. And I think my grades probably reflected that.

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,240
I was not academically focused, either in high school or in college. I think academics came

165
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,680
relatively easy to me. So it didn't instill a great work ethic at school, but I just wanted

166
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,560
to move on. It was a task to complete to get me to the next stage. So do you start interviewing

167
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,160
for a bunch of Wall Street firms when you're in your senior year or junior year, I guess?

168
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,960
I did. So at the time Vanderbilt was probably a tier lower than it's considered today as a school.

169
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,280
And the investment banks didn't do much recruiting there. So there was maybe one or two and some of

170
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,480
the regional banks. And then I was able to talk my way into a couple of interviews,

171
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,600
but I didn't get those jobs. So I was a bit crushed. Here's what I want to do. And I got

172
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,880
things that were close to that working at the regional investment bank. And then one of the

173
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,680
jobs I got, which I thought was closest to what I wanted to do to being in that game,

174
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,560
was at the company Enron. And Enron at the time was in this transformation, trying to become

175
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,840
essentially an investment bank to the energy industry and specifically the natural gas and

176
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:54,440
electricity industry. What year was that? So I started at that job in 1995. So at 95,

177
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,520
nobody knows Enron. They're a pretty unsexy company, right? Correct. They're basically doing

178
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,480
disintermediation, like their market making on energy. And that's about it. They're not this

179
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,560
darling of Wall Street that they would become before their fall. Is that, do I have my era right?

180
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,720
Right. It was historically a pipeline company. And over the decades, natural gas, which went

181
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,000
from a highly regulated business and all the troubles associated with trying to regulate a

182
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,240
commodity, right? That you end up having these huge booms and busts, way too much supply or way too

183
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,320
little supply was deregulated. And that deregulation ended in 1992. And that was really the emergence

184
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,200
of Enron as it became the late stage company, was that previous to then you had the pipeline was

185
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,520
responsible for providing the merchant services to the buyer and seller. So the producer of gas

186
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,360
would sell to the pipeline and then the pipeline would transport the gas and sell it to the customer.

187
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,280
It was viewed that this was negative because pipelines are natural monopolies frequently.

188
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,000
And so the services and the costs of those services were too high. And so

189
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
1992, they deregulate and here's Enron as the gas merchant.

190
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,840
Only because they become relevant later in this story. So was Ken Lay the CEO at that time of

191
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,680
deregulation? And when you came on board, or was Jeff Skilling there at that point in time? Not that

192
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,160
you would have had any interaction with those guys as a lowly first year guy.

193
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:31,080
So Ken Lay was chairman CEO shortly after I joined. I joined, I think May of 95. There had been

194
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,760
two aspects of the company. It had the historical pipeline business. And then it had these new,

195
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:44,360
it's called investment bank side. And there was what I later came to realize was the great

196
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,880
decision point for the company was who was going to be the number two at Enron? Was it going to be

197
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,760
the head of the pipeline business? Or was it going to be Jeff Skilling, who was the head of the energy

198
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,280
bank? And so shortly after I joined, Jeff was promoted up and Rich Kinder ended up leaving

199
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,080
and starting Kinder Morgan. And obviously that promotion was based just as much on perhaps who

200
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,240
they were as the direction that the company was going to go in. Right. I think this was a trend

201
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,520
in corporate America then was go asset light. So get rid of your big assets. Coca-Cola spins off

202
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,760
its bottling business. They just become the seller of the syrup because that's lighter on assets,

203
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,640
but your return on equity is higher if you have fewer assets. And so that was the direction

204
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,360
of corporate America generally and the one that Enron took. So I love that you show up in May of

205
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,880
95, not even taking a month off like any other kid would. And what is your first job at Enron?

206
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Where do they stick you? It's very rare for someone at Enron and even someone at an investment bank

207
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,200
to be put on the trading floor. There's just mistakes are expensive on the trading floor.

208
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,320
And so they don't want the kid that's a few days out of college. That would be the equivalent of

209
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,800
we're going to take kids out of medical school and you're going to get to start operating even

210
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,600
simple operations without supervision. That would be catastrophic. Organ transplant is your first

211
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,800
thing. Right. But I had expressed interest on the trading side when I went through the interview

212
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:20,280
process and they called me in April and said a couple of people recently left our oil trading

213
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,120
group. If you can start immediately, you can start in trading. And I said, well, I graduate

214
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,040
in 10 days. How about 12 days from now I'll be there. And so I literally graduated, drove

215
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,120
from Nashville to Houston that weekend. And that Monday show up at work in the oil trading group

216
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,960
at Enron. So what did that mean? What did an oil trader do without as much supervision

217
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,400
or experience as maybe you would ideally want of a trader? Right. So I certainly was not trading.

218
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I was kind of an assistant on the desk, which meant doing a lot of spreadsheets of running

219
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,200
analytical studies and correlation studies, building models, getting lunch,

220
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,280
doing all the things that first years do, trying to learn the business.

221
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:12,360
And at what point did your bosses there start to realize that this kid that just came out of

222
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,960
Vanderbilt, a year younger than everybody else has a knack for this game? Or maybe asked another

223
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,360
way, when did you first realize you had a knack for it? Quickly. I look back at all the good timings

224
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,840
and kind of good decisions that went into my career. And one of them was, I found the perfect

225
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:39,720
job from my skillset as my first job. And I think that's pretty rare. And it happened by accident,

226
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,280
could have very easily ended up a mergers and acquisition investment banker at Merrill Lynch.

227
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,280
But I ended up trading commodities at a relative upstart of a company. That was just the perfect

228
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,440
spot for my skillset. So tell me a little bit more about that. So oil is a very complicated

229
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:03,800
thing. Gas, perhaps less so, at least at the time, were those two viewed as the same trading desk at

230
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,320
Enron? Or did you shuttle back and forth between them and find yourself eventually at gas?

231
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,560
Enron by its nature was always a gas company. It was gas focused. The oil group was small. It was

232
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,600
kind of the redheaded stepchild. It didn't make much money. It was necessary because some customers

233
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,240
wanted to transact on oil with the same company that they were doing their gas transactions with.

234
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,080
But it was always a small group. So then how did you work up the ranks in natural gas trading? And

235
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,800
when did you actually start to go from modeling to actually making some trades and by extension,

236
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,520
then earning Enron some money? So early 1996, I was supposed to be on a

237
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,960
formal rotation, six months on one desk, six months on a different business within Enron,

238
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,280
and kind of rotate four rotations over the two years and then go back to business school.

239
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,520
And after six months, I think the team there liked me and I liked being there and kind of got made to

240
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,280
be an exception. So I didn't have to rotate. But kind of shortly thereafter, one of the traders,

241
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,280
I was speaking earlier about mistakes are costly in the trading side. And there was an older gentleman

242
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,600
who kind of made a mistake, kind of did a trade that ended up going bad. And they reorganized the

243
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,000
whole group. And the new boss came up and I worked for him for a couple months. And one day he pulls

244
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,560
me aside and says, I have to blow up this group. I like you. It's not going to be good for your

245
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,800
career to be here. You need to find a different group. And he gave me two options. One was,

246
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,920
go to London and work in the oil group there, or go downstairs and work in the natural gas trading

247
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:48,600
group. And as a 21 year old getting offered an expat package to go to UK, it was extraordinarily

248
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,680
tempting, because I'm thinking of going back to business school anyway. It was a hard decision,

249
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,720
but I realized the core of this company is natural gas. That's where I need to be that I need to learn

250
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,920
that. And so I went downstairs and started natural gas. And that was on its own, just very

251
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,640
fortuitous timing. I spoke about in 1992 was when the full deregulation happened. The winter

252
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:19,000
of 1996 was the first time that natural gas prices really blew out. It was extremely cold winter.

253
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:28,280
And all the historical relationships that gas had just completely changed. And so going down there,

254
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,640
I knew nothing about gas, but people who had spent their career in gas, wasn't sure if they

255
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,680
knew anything about gas either. They knew I had the fundamentals about the physical molecules.

256
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,440
But what the historical pricing relationships were, it was a whole new game. So I went down there

257
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,840
knowing nothing, but it felt like the whole industry was trying to figure out what does

258
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,360
the world of natural gas look like today going forward, given everything's changed.

259
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,760
How did you rise through those ranks there? Because that's a pretty interesting situation where

260
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,440
it's not necessarily the person with the most historical knowledge that's going to bring the

261
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,840
most value. It's probably the person who can learn the quickest spot patterns, the quickest,

262
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,080
and basically morph to a new environment. Right. So my first job in the Nat Gas Division was

263
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,040
they put me as an assistant trader with a gentleman who had expertise on the physical

264
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,920
side of the business. Didn't know anything about trading, but he knew natural gas. And I knew

265
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,280
nothing about natural gas, but knew something about trading and was good with numbers. And

266
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,000
they essentially put the two of us together and said, you guys go figure this out, work together,

267
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,280
and run this book. And so that was my first real trading job where, although I was an assistant

268
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,160
trader on the book, but where I was involved in the trading at this time, Enron started to become

269
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,000
a darling. And it was certainly within the energy side and within the pipeline business had become

270
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,360
this darling. Its stock was higher than all other stocks. So every other company was trying to figure

271
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,280
out how do I be more like Enron? So what's the easy way to be more like Enron is go higher,

272
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,920
Enron people, go hire someone kind of mid-level, give them a promotion and a raise and have them

273
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,240
come over to your company. And so that was happening all the time, which was great for the young guy

274
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,240
at Enron because the guy above you was leaving to go get a better job. And so it was an environment

275
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:32,280
where if you could prove that you were responsible and that you were smart, you could rise much faster

276
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,600
than you could at a mature company or in a mature industry. And so that next four years for me was

277
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,520
really the roller coaster where every nine months or so I would get a promotion again, like much

278
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,600
faster than I would have gotten had I been at a more mature company and ended up by the time I was

279
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:00,040
25, I was the head natural gas trader at the largest natural gas trading company in the industry.

280
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,040
It's almost hard to believe that that's possible, especially now when I looked

281
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,280
what I was doing when I was 25. Right, right. It is almost hard to believe. It was a company that

282
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,480
was very merit focused, I think, by giving out that responsibility. It was fantastic to work

283
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,440
at a place like that. I think it ended up being the downfall of the company as well as there just

284
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,400
wasn't the controls on people who were given too much responsibility, too much of the company's

285
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,720
balance sheet to use without their adequate controls on it. What was the stress like that

286
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,160
you felt just in a self-imposed manner? I mean, were you, if you're 25 years old and just give

287
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,600
me a sense of as a head trader at Enron with the largest gas trading company, we're talking in the

288
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,200
billions of dollars worth of potential profits and losses here, correct? In a given day, I was

289
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,960
trading billions of dollars of notional value of gas. A lot of it was trying to buy it, $2,

290
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,040
trying to sell it at $2.50 for enormous volumes. Enron was the largest market maker, was the largest

291
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,520
speculative trader of gas. It had the most customer business coming through it. Being at the center

292
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,640
of that, being the head trader there, it was just from the moment you sat down in the morning until

293
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,840
about three, four o'clock, it was just nonstop trading. Someone would bring food and put it in

294
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,920
front of me, run to the bathroom and run back. Internet trading was starting to take off then,

295
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,960
so there was still the trading in the pit on the trading floor, like trading places style. So there

296
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,200
was that, there was trading that was happening on the internet, there was trading that was happening

297
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,000
with other people within the company that they had customers or somebody needed to put a hedge on

298
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,120
because of another deal that they did. And so it was just nonstop action. And the stress level

299
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,960
was intense. I think I'm very good at handling stress. The stress level was intense to a point

300
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,800
of not being healthy. And I think this is true of many trading floors, especially back in those

301
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,080
days. I think it's why traders generally have short lives, trading lives, trading careers.

302
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:20,120
It's hard for the body to handle that level of stress for decades and decades.

303
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,720
Were you seeing this creep out into other areas of your life? Did you have difficulty sleeping?

304
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,200
Were you able to exercise in the periods of time, presumably in the evenings would be your only

305
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,160
window to exercise? Were you eating like crap? I mean, you're a very fit, healthy guy today.

306
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,760
Is this what John Arnold looked like when he was the head of trading?

307
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:45,000
No, I didn't realize it. Looking back, probably after I eventually lost the weight that I gained

308
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,680
during those years and cut down on some of the drinking, started exercising a lot more.

309
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,080
Looking back at the health of my life, it was a bit telling, even going and putting on some of the

310
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,760
clothes that I used to wear, seeing how so differently built today than I was back then,

311
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,880
you had to find some method to relieve stress.

312
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,360
And unfortunately for a lot of traders, that's pretty negative behaviors, right? It's more

313
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,840
drinking, more partying, more gambling or whatever.

314
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,400
Exactly, exactly. It is not a healthy lifestyle. As I grew up, I learned how to handle the stress

315
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,560
better. I got tired of the drinking and partying and gambling, especially as I got into my 30s,

316
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,880
as I got married, as I had kids, that all starts changing. But it also can be a reason why

317
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,960
people start to get repulsed by that career, is the lifestyle that doesn't necessarily go

318
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,160
along with it, but oftentimes does. I want to go back to just something before we leave this topic,

319
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,600
which is, did you get a sense of an addiction to trading? Because I've spoken with many friends of

320
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:55,480
mine who have at some point in their life been in that field. And for some of them, the addiction,

321
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,080
the high, the physiologic response that they get to a good trade is easily on par with what the

322
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,480
most indebted gambler feels when they're sitting at a blackjack table or with the drive that

323
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,960
someone has to drink who is so disproportionately dysregulated by alcohol. I mean, did you personally

324
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,760
get that or was it more of an intellectual exercise for you? How much of this was just purely

325
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,000
limbic system, dopamine surging versus more of a calculus?

326
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,680
So I've definitely seen traders where they had that dopamine aspect to their trading personality.

327
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,240
I've gotten the question many times, why were you a good trader? Why were you considered one of the

328
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,440
best traders in the market? And it's always been hard for me to answer. I think part of it is,

329
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,080
I had this emotional detachment from the business. So if I was having one of my best days or having

330
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:01,400
one of my worst days, if you walked by me, you couldn't tell. It was just 100% focus on executing

331
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,800
the process. So my views would change, but the process of how you look at the market can easily

332
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,720
get swayed by emotions whenever, and there's the phrase, fear and greed, that drives a lot of

333
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,960
price trends in financial assets. You're either greedy or you're fearful and that's driving your

334
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,280
behavior. And to the extent, I think that you can eliminate those two emotions from the trading and

335
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,760
from the process, you get better. And you know me well enough, you wouldn't describe me as an

336
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,000
emotional guy. So does that mean it was natural for you, John, that this superpower, because that is

337
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,240
probably a trading superpower. Is that something you had to cultivate or spend any energy training

338
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,480
in yourself? Was it the product or byproduct of something in your childhood or was it simply as

339
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,600
innate to you as your hair color and height? I think it was just innate. I think this is how I was

340
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:05,480
born, that detachment from the emotions that doesn't affect my decision making process. And so I think

341
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,680
that's one of the two superpowers, superpowers that I had. I think I also fell perfectly on

342
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,280
the confidence spectrum. And I say that it takes a certain amount of arrogance to be a trader,

343
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,920
because the market's usually right. And to be a trader, you have to say, I think I'm smarter than

344
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,960
the market here. I think the market is wrong. I think I am right. So it takes that arrogance in

345
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,800
order to be willing to put on a trade. And I've seen people just get paralyzed where they just say,

346
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,480
they're so concerned about the downside and of being wrong that they can't do anything.

347
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,160
So you have to be arrogant, but you can be too arrogant. And that's been the destroyer of many

348
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:54,520
trading careers is if you stick with it, I am right, the market is wrong, then you're going to

349
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,240
blow up. And so it's how do you have the right level where it's like, I'm confident in my view on

350
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,080
this, but I know I might be wrong. That's amazing. When we get to talking about the second half of

351
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,200
your career professionally, which is now your full time work in philanthropy, especially the type of

352
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,160
bets that you make and the scope and magnitude of problems that you go after, I think those two

353
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,000
traits that made you, I think most people would argue the greatest natural gas trader of all time,

354
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,080
probably serve you just as well in your philanthropy. Would you agree?

355
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,760
I think you said that well, the notion of going in saying, I think we're right about this,

356
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,960
but it might not work. Or we might be wrong. It's kind of write down our theory and test it along

357
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,000
the way and see if it's playing out the way it should and not get wedded to this theory that

358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,800
everything we're doing in the foundation is evidence based, but the evidence is never perfect.

359
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,600
So we're taking the best available information and saying, how much risk

360
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,560
should society be willing to take to test a different idea?

361
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,600
So bringing the Enron chapter of your career to a close, help me understand how you and your

362
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:20,920
colleagues under your direction are making so much money and yet by 2001, Enron is going bankrupt.

363
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,240
How are those things happening simultaneously? I don't have the right answer for that. I knew

364
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,840
things in the company and other divisions. I had friends that worked in other divisions. We would

365
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,440
go to have a beer after work. I would hear their stories about some crazy deal that their division

366
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:44,040
was doing that they thought was stupid. I would hear stories about this, but our day-to-day in the

367
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,480
trading group was just so focused on the one activity that we didn't have firsthand knowledge

368
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,400
of any of that. It was always kind of hearsay, but the trading group was making so much money

369
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,480
that there was a thought, I think, that we could actually see this whenever earnings were getting

370
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,360
released that the trading group could support the other divisions until they stopped making the

371
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,560
dumb mistakes and became profitable on their own. I can't speak exactly about why the trading group

372
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,280
was making so much money. There were some really dumb ideas in retrospect when you look at the

373
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,080
documentaries. I remember reading the book, The Smartest Guys in the Room in 2006 or whenever it

374
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,920
came out and being completely fixated on this thing, but the whole broadband water idea, the

375
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,360
Indian power plant that didn't seem to make any sense. There were a lot of ideas that, and again,

376
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,520
I'm not saying this like I would have known at the time these were dumb ideas. I'm sure I wouldn't

377
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,680
have. So hindsight, of course, offers that luxury, but I mean, these were really, really half-baked

378
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,880
at best, right? It's always easy in retrospect. I think the disintermediation, which not only

379
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:59,560
Enron was doing but was a broad theme in the business world at the time, was real and the

380
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,560
investment community was valuing companies who were disintermediating in the same way that they do

381
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,920
today in the tech sector. There's a lot of value to be created if you can disintermediate a business

382
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,920
chain. I think Enron, trying to approach it from the commodity side and trying to do it with water,

383
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:26,520
trying to do it with electricity, doing it globally in places where the quality of law

384
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,320
and of intellectual protections isn't what it was in America, and then having the culture of never

385
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:40,200
being able to admit failure that existed not only in Enron, but again, in many other companies at the

386
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,680
time as well, meant that whenever mistakes were made, there wasn't the admittance to Wall Street

387
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:54,760
that this was a mistake and we're going to change. It was swept under the rug and Enron,

388
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,360
the process of bankruptcy happened so quickly because all these financial businesses, which

389
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,880
at the time, Enron had morphed into a financial business, is completely contingent upon having

390
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,800
the faith of your creditors, having the faith of Wall Street. Once Wall Street loses faith in you

391
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,520
and refuses to fund you on a day, the business is toast and that's what happened.

392
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,680
It happened, as you said, precipitously. I could certainly sit here for another four hours and

393
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,080
talk to you about mark to market and all of that, but I think we'll let the listeners who are really

394
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,320
interested in that go back and either read the books, watch the documentaries, or go deeper on

395
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:37,080
that. Let's bring it back to you, which is at what point do you realize your career at Enron is going

396
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,600
to be cut short? Despite the fact that you've had your head down, I think you could make the

397
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,600
case the single most profitable human at that company. If the company goes under, you're out

398
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,480
of a job. When was that apparent to you and then what were your next moves and how did you consider

399
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,200
the decisions you had to make? It happened so quickly that there was a damage control that I

400
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,160
could see from my perspective in the company. Again, my perspective was sitting at a desk with

401
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,640
two phones in my ear for most of the day. I didn't get much of a sense of what was going on

402
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:17,240
outside of what natural gas prices were ticking up. It happened so quickly that there wasn't much

403
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,560
to be done from the trading side perspective. All those decisions end up in the finance side,

404
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:31,560
the CFO's office of how do we raise money? When it finally, November of 2001

405
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,040
was shortly after 9-11 and that caused some havoc in the financial markets. Then that's when

406
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,280
Wall Street was not going to give you a second chance in that environment. Enron arguably didn't

407
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,600
deserve one. It all happened so fast that whenever Enron lost credit worthiness in the business,

408
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:57,800
then it was over. There was some time spent trying to find a credit worthy JV partner

409
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,400
to come in and would contribute the intellectual assets and someone would contribute new money

410
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,160
and keep the trading operation going because it had been so profitable. If it was just swept away

411
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,840
in bankruptcy, it was a loss of a lot of potential value to what was then the estate of Enron,

412
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,040
the creditors of Enron. There was a lot of focus on trying to cut that deal. A deal was eventually

413
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,920
cut with the New York bank. I looked around and I looked at the deal and for the first time stepped

414
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,120
back and started thinking, what do I want to do with my life? That's where the decision was,

415
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,560
I don't want to go with this entity. I have different views on how this business should

416
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,880
proceed in the future and I want to go try it somewhere else. You take your bonus check,

417
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,520
you take some money from a few other folks and you set up your own hedge fund in early 2002, right?

418
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,840
Yeah, mid-2002. Again, you're the perfect guy to do it because you're not too stressed about it.

419
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,880
You've got a proven track record. I guess you're somewhat toxic because even though

420
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,600
you come from the part of Enron that is fully legitimate, you still have that name on your

421
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,880
back. Did that hurt you? Were you trying to raise capital? How did that factor into your hedge fund?

422
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,480
It was an interesting time to say the least. Right after Enron declared the first quarter of 2002,

423
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,080
I was getting calls by a lot of people, people I didn't know, saying,

424
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,720
if you are going to do your own thing, I have interest in investing with you.

425
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:35,240
My intent was to try to raise $50 million of day one capital and just start there and let it grow

426
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,000
organically and increase over time. I thought I'd be cutting people back. I thought fundraising

427
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,640
would be very easy. There was going to be $200 million of interest and I was going to cut

428
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,960
everybody. You can invest 25% of what you want to. Second quarter of 2002, dramatic change. This is

429
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,680
when a lot of the investigations into Enron start to bear fruit, if you will, and the headlines come

430
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:07,880
out. Every week, there's a new scandal that's coming out. Now, the people who had called me,

431
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,040
one, they don't know if the profits that were posted in the New York Times, whether those are

432
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:22,920
real or not, whether I was going to jail or not, all these questions. Everybody who was banging on

433
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,800
my door to invest pulls back. Meanwhile, I've rented office space. I've hired employees. I've

434
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,520
bought computers and telecom systems. I've got to move forward. I have almost no money to do this

435
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,240
now. I ended up starting in August of 2002 with $8 million of capital, some of which was mine,

436
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,960
and I had two outside investors. Talk about pressure. $8 million of assets under management

437
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,440
is not exactly what you had in mind. As far as you know, basically, the only way you're going to grow

438
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,480
your fund at this point is by organic returns. You're going to have to return your way into more

439
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,240
money. You're not going to be out there fundraising. One of the things after N11 Bankrupt is Wall Street

440
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:10,280
started looking at all the copycat Enrons, all the other pipeline companies and electric utilities

441
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,800
who had started out these merchant businesses or trading businesses. Wall Street essentially says,

442
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,000
we're not funding those businesses anymore. There's too much risk. What happened was that

443
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,600
there is great need for risk intermediation and for risk warehousing in the business.

444
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:35,080
Half of the largest players are out of that business over the first six months of 2002.

445
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,920
And so the market became incredibly inefficient and was willing to pay for the task of

446
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,200
intermediation at a very high rate. And so just by setting up the computer, there was,

447
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,000
going back to the arbitrage, it was very low risk or arbitrage type trades that shouldn't exist in

448
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,360
a normal functioning market that existed for that next year just because the market players had been

449
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:12,040
so decimated. So the first month, it was up 36%. On a percentage basis is high, on an actual dollar

450
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,360
basis, it made $3 million. But also to put a point on what you just said a second ago, you're up 36%

451
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,960
in a month at a very low risk. So it's not just the value, it's the value at risk here that matters.

452
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,400
Exactly. Value at risk, I like the term. Well, I was a McKinsey guy, I remember. I was in the risk

453
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,720
practice, right? So we think a lot about VAR as well. So then second month, I'm up 33%, third

454
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,160
month, I'm up 38%. And I'm sending the notes out, the investor notes out to everybody that was in

455
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,560
my Rolodex that expressed interest. And now all of a sudden, three months in, I'm up, what's the

456
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,080
compound rate? Probably 150% in three months. And so some of the people will start calling me back

457
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:58,600
and saying, hey, maybe I'll send you some money. And so those first few years, it was doing a lot

458
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:05,400
of the low risk trading to create the base and this upward trend in profitability, and then layering

459
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:12,120
on some speculative trading on top of that. And I was able to play bigger than my asset size,

460
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:19,160
because I had this upward trend in profitability. If I was wrong, on my market call, I wouldn't be

461
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,880
decimated because I was still making money on the market making arbitrage side of the business.

462
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,720
Your spec market initially was actually quite small. You switched those 10 years later,

463
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,600
you were basically doing the opposite. But at the beginning, it was an amazing, you described it to

464
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,520
me in the past as I think the perfect time to be a natural gas. Yes. Based on that inefficiency.

465
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,360
Yeah, there was just risk reward. It was don't even bother about taking risk. Yeah, there's so

466
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,080
much free money in the market by providing that service, just do that. You can think about the

467
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,320
business as a bundled product. One was the market making, providing liquidity and getting paid for

468
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:03,480
that service, warehousing some risk. And the second was trying to make a call on where natural

469
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,520
gas prices were going next. There's some synergy of having those together. There's a lot of synergy

470
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,640
in having those together, but that's the two strands of the business. And most people, myself

471
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,000
included, when they think about gas trading, are only thinking about the speculative business,

472
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,880
which is my former countryman, Brian Hunter, very, very famously blew up in the fall of 2006,

473
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,320
a hedge fund called Amorith at the time was probably one of the biggest blowups in all of

474
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,560
energy. We'll come to that because you were on the other side of that trade, if I recall. But it's

475
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,000
those stories that get most people thinking about that's how you make or lose money in natural gas

476
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,920
trading. But you were doing something, I always talk about risk to people. I sort of explain it

477
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,400
as a two by two. Are you picking up Bitcoins or are you picking up pennies? And are you doing it

478
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,720
in front of a bulldozer or are you doing it in front of a tricycle? You want to think through

479
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,680
that two by two very clearly. It might be worth picking up a Bitcoin in front of a bulldozer,

480
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,840
but it is not worth picking up a penny in front of a bulldozer or a bullet train or something like

481
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,520
that. And so you sort of have to understand that's this idea of risk and return. So at what point,

482
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:14,680
I mean, I just want to kind of go back to John the guy who's on this ride that seems hard to believe,

483
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,520
but anybody who's made the type of money you've made in life goes from being, I mean, I guess

484
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,160
I'm asking this question in a weird way. Is there a moment at which you realize you're not going to

485
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,520
have to worry about money anymore? I don't know what that dollar amount is. And I'm guessing for

486
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,960
different people, it's a different amount. I've had people tell me that this is going to sound

487
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,520
ridiculous too. But I've had people explain to me that until you have $600 million in your bank,

488
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,720
you will never feel totally secure, which I find that ridiculous. And I disagree with that idea,

489
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,440
though I will never have $600 million in my bank. But there must be some number at which you realize,

490
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,200
oh, my life and the life of my family is going to be very different. Do you remember that occurring

491
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:01,080
for you? Yeah. So that first year was remarkable for many reasons. But one of the things that

492
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,760
happened was that the gas market ended up being very tight, that demand was high and supply wasn't

493
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:16,200
keeping up. And so the outright level of inventories was okay. But the trend was that

494
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,320
we were drawing inventories or not putting gas in the ground, like we should have been doing.

495
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,160
And again, had the market been more efficient than I think other traders, other traders did notice

496
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,800
this and others put it on. But there were some trades that were I thought were very

497
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:38,200
misvalued from a risk-reward perspective. And that was that if we were to have a cold winter,

498
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,600
that first one, 2002, 2003, if that winter was cold, the gas market could experience some

499
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,440
significant shortages and the price spikes that would correspond to those shortages.

500
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,960
Now, the weather event was maybe a one out of five probability. But I think the

501
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:04,520
bets were pricing them that it was one out of 50. And so as I'm making money on market making and

502
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,680
providing liquidity, I was putting on some of these trades, just putting a little bit of money

503
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,200
into this trade at various points. And that winter ended up being the one in five weather event.

504
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,640
And there was the two day stretch in late February. February, oh, three, right? That's like one of

505
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,600
the three. Yeah, one of the three highest gas prices we've had in the last 20 years, right?

506
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,720
I think so. Yeah, it all starts to blur together now. But you had this massive spike in price of

507
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:37,960
gas, I think, approximately doubled in two days. And that was the day the fund also had more than

508
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,240
doubled in those two days in terms of assets. And that was the day when I was like, I feel rich for

509
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:52,600
the first time. I am set for life today. Did you call anybody? I remember calling my mom, pretty

510
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,280
much saying those words that we're set, we have financial security now forever, regardless of what

511
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:06,120
happens. So doing the math, you're in your late 20s at this point. Did you have any sense at that

512
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:13,640
moment that you were going to be out of the game in 10 years and full time working as a philanthropist?

513
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:20,440
Or was that not a clear part of your vision yet? I always recognized the limited social value

514
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,720
of trading. I think there is a need for someone to provide risk warehousing and liquidity to markets.

515
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:35,720
But trying to tell the story about how I was adding value or contributing to society was hard.

516
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:41,720
And that always bothered me. So when I first started getting my first $100,000 bonus back

517
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:48,680
when I was at Enron, I shortly thereafter was at a supermarket. And I see a magazine that says,

518
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,880
top 50 nonprofits in America. And I pick it up and throw it into my grocery basket and take it home

519
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:03,400
and immediately turn to the education section. I think a lot of younger philanthropists, a lot of

520
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,280
people from the finance industry get drawn to K-12 education. One of the organizations was based in

521
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,880
Houston. It was KIPP, KIPP charter schools. And so I called them up and got scheduled to go do a tour,

522
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,600
went did a tour. They had no idea who I was at the time. I wasn't a rich guy back then,

523
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,440
but I came home and wrote them a five-figure check. And I get a call from the founder who I had

524
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,840
not met on that original tour a couple of days later. And this was back when five figures was

525
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,920
really significant to the organization. And he said, thank you. And who are you? And I need to

526
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,920
cultivate this relationship. And that was the start of my very long journey thinking about K-12

527
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:51,960
education in the country. And so in this time, 2002, 2003, I was getting more interested in it.

528
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,000
My check size was going up, but it was something I thought about 1% of the time.

529
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:05,480
So as your hedge fund is growing and growing and growing, at what point are you now

530
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:12,920
getting the attention of basically everybody who wants to come in and you're doing the opposite?

531
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,480
You're probably starting to force distributions at some point.

532
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:23,880
There was a trading magazine that came up with a list of highest paid traders. And that was

533
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,480
from specifically from the hedge fund world where most of the highest paid traders existed.

534
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:35,240
And it was not only what was the return on your investment in the fund, but what was your

535
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,680
incentive fees and kind of trying to estimate that. And they would create these lists of top 100

536
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:47,240
for the year. And I don't remember what year it was, but somehow they got a hold of my returns

537
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:54,440
and started doing the math on it and figured out that I was not only on the top 100, but I think

538
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:02,360
top five that year. And that was the first time in a broadcast to the world that I was making

539
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,400
big money, but also was a broadcast to the rest of the industry that something's going on in natural

540
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:18,120
gas and all the other hedge funds should... It was a signal to them, go figure out what's going on

541
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,560
over there. How is he making this much money and see if there's something for us to do?

542
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,840
So during that time, as will happen in any market, whenever there's kind of above market returns

543
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,120
going on in a field, new entrants come in. And that's certainly what happened during that time.

544
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:40,520
It made a very deliberate decision that I was going to keep the focus of the business narrow,

545
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,880
which I wanted to be the best in the world at North American natural gas and power trading.

546
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,080
That was the business. Didn't want to trade oil, didn't want to trade natural gas stocks

547
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,000
or natural gas bonds. Didn't want to trade agriculture. Stick to our expertise.

548
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:06,040
Don't try to build an empire here. Just do this one thing. And I think by doing so, I think it...

549
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,920
By keeping focus, it allowed us to achieve that mission of being the best in the field.

550
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,880
I think it also started... It put a natural limit as to the amount of assets that we could manage.

551
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,720
So we just couldn't be too big relative to the market. And the amount of money that we were

552
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,240
making was significant. And so we started sending back money to investors.

553
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,400
What was the greatest you allowed your AUM to swell to, to allow yourself to stay so

554
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,440
narrowly focused? At the peak, it got to about $6 billion.

555
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:43,160
That's a staggering sum of money. There are lots of hedge funds that have ballooned to $20 and $30

556
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,800
billion in assets under management. And your point is, yeah, that sounds great. And you're

557
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,040
going to collect a lot of fees on that if you're the fund manager, but you may be spreading

558
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,840
yourself too thin into areas that you don't have the deepest, deepest domain expertise.

559
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,800
Right. Very shortly after I started, I was the largest investor in the fund. And I was in it for

560
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,080
the return on my money. That's how I managed the fund. And that's how we would pitch it to

561
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:17,480
central investors was, I think this is a great investment opportunity. This is where I want my

562
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,600
money. This is the risk, where I am on the risk spectrum for my money. And if you want to join

563
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:31,800
on that journey, I'd be happy to have you. But I'm going to run a risky business. And you have

564
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,040
to be prepared for that going on because I wasn't in it to make the management fees. That's not how

565
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:43,240
I wanted to. That wasn't my business. Right. If you're more than 50% of the AUM,

566
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,600
you can't make money on yourself. You can't make fees on your own money.

567
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:52,200
Right. Right. So it was always driven by, how do I want my money managed? What do I think is a good

568
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,440
investment for me? And then if other people want to put money alongside, that's great.

569
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,760
So by the way, I want to go back to one thing. Talk to me about the 06 Amaranth trade. Explain

570
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,440
for people that given the historical significance of that was pretty significant and the fallout of

571
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,360
that has reverberated for many years as far as the amount of money that was lost in things.

572
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,440
Who was Brian Hunter? What did he do so well in 2005? How did that speculation sort of go the

573
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,520
other way in 06? 2005, I hope I get all these facts right. My memory gets a little bit cloudy

574
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:29,000
from those days, but 2005 was Hurricane Katrina. It came in and caused significant damage on

575
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,920
the offshore natural gas production as well as the natural gas processing facilities that were

576
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:41,400
onshore Louisiana. And because of that, the price of gas spiked significantly. People were

577
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,880
short supplies. I looked this up yesterday, John, that is both unadjusted and adjusted for inflation,

578
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,600
the greatest peak in natural gas pricing of the last, I think, 30 years. That's September 05,

579
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,520
right after Katrina. Yeah. And after that time, I think two things happened. First was as ocean

580
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,200
temperatures were rising, there started to be a belief that number of hurricanes and the intensity

581
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,080
of hurricanes, and thus the damage from hurricanes to the energy sector and natural gas sector

582
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:19,240
was structurally increasing. And second, that there would be a great fear amongst any trader to

583
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,360
be short during that time period, the hurricane season, and of August and September, peak hurricane

584
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:35,000
season. So he had done very well in 2005. This is Brian Hunter. Brian Hunter in 2005. He was long

585
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,320
during that time and made a lot of money for his fund. And at the time he worked for a fund

586
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,520
Amaranth Advisors, which was a macro hedge fund, meaning they do everything. They trade stocks,

587
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:50,440
they trade bonds. Brian Hunter was the natural gas trader for them. Now in 2005, as I understand it,

588
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:57,240
he was by far the most profitable trading desk and trader at a large hedge fund. And so he was

589
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,960
given a lot more position size or capital to trade with. And I think he had the belief that

590
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,720
something similar would happen or at least a big scare would happen next year and would cause the

591
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,880
same type of move. The difference was partially in reaction to the spike in prices that we saw in 2005,

592
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,600
it sent the signal to every producer to increase supplies. So every producer gets that price

593
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,960
signal, every producer puts more money into drilling for gas. You start to see that in 2006

594
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:35,480
that supplies are ramping up. And talked about earlier that the supply demand was tight in 2002,

595
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,160
supply demand got very loose in 2006. And so the market was just oversupplied. It was a very

596
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:48,840
bearish market, but Brian Hunter kept this trade on, this very bullish trade on, and kept the prices

597
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,960
supported even though the fundamental picture was deteriorating by continuing to buy more and more

598
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:01,160
and more of this one product. And I'll put it a long story short, he distorted the relative values

599
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:08,920
in that market so much. It gets told now that the trade was me versus him. And that's very not much

600
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,400
the case. It was the whole market versus him because he was such a large position in this as

601
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,600
started to get into the first, the very early part of hurricane season and there was no hurricane

602
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,120
and then prices were starting to collapse and he couldn't hold it anymore. So he kind of single

603
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:32,760
handled that position, bankrupted this macro hedge fund. And I did well during that trade. I think I

604
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:39,320
may have had on 25% of the opposing position. I was very cognizant that it is possible that a

605
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,480
hurricane comes and has a short term price spike and I don't want to blow up if and when that

606
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,080
happens. So I need to size this appropriately. I don't think he had sized it appropriately given

607
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,480
the alternative scenario. And that's an interesting thing because it wasn't just that you guys were

608
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,160
betting against each other in terms of climate or weather for which I would say three months out,

609
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,360
that becomes an unwinnable bet. Nobody can have more or better information on that.

610
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:12,680
It's the second order bet that's interesting to me, which is, okay, he's taking a position on

611
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,640
climate or weather, but it's really you're taking a position on the more important question, which

612
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:24,840
is supply. And you're saying even if we are hit with a demand shock, I believe the market is better

613
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:30,040
able to bear this now than it was in 2005. And ultimately that's really what the bet comes down

614
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,320
to. It's true, a hurricane didn't hit that year and the price collapsed. But it's also possible

615
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,880
that if a more mild hurricane than Katrina had come, we probably wouldn't have seen the price

616
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,920
shock we saw in 2005. Right, right. The market was so scared. And so people were hesitant. People

617
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,480
were only going to put on that short trade if they thought the market had already priced that in.

618
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,680
And I used to think about it as you have this unknown weather event. How cold is the winter

619
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,920
going to be? What's the hurricane situation going to be? And you can think about it, you

620
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,680
had this probability distribution function of the possible outcomes. And then think about, okay,

621
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,320
under each outcome, how would I think about what fair value is of the commodity at that time? And

622
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,240
then did you do your simple math and come to expected value? And that really simplifies

623
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,720
the process down much too simplistically. But that was the type of thought process that would

624
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:32,200
go in is, okay, if it's 80th percentile hurricane damage, what is that? If it's 90th percentile,

625
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,800
it's 99th percentile. What if it's 10th percentile? And think about all these and then how's the

626
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:43,160
market price today? Certainly at that time, there were people who weren't allowed to be short. There

627
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,840
were people who were only going to be short if it was way mispriced relative to expected value.

628
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,240
And I think that's what got him was that it was already so mispriced to expected value

629
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,080
that even had you had this supply shock happen, what's the upside now? We're already priced for

630
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:07,560
that. Yep. When you explain it that way, it's a much sadder story than just two guys betting

631
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,280
against weather and one guy's got to be right and one guy's got to be wrong. You realize that it was

632
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,160
probably a bit more of an error and hubris as well, which goes back to your point about maybe

633
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:23,400
being a little too confident in your ability to predict what's going to happen. You spent a lot

634
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,640
of your time doing research. I mean, again, we've already talked about you having two superpowers,

635
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,280
but having known you for a while, I would add to that list maybe a third superpower, which I

636
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:39,400
believe also has come to serve you very well in your philanthropy, which is you have an insatiable

637
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:45,960
bordering on pathological obsession for knowing everything. And I say that in the kindest way as

638
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,360
someone who shares part of that affliction. And I remember once you explaining to me some of the

639
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:55,160
details you would study about natural gas pipelines, it's like, look, if I'm going to be

640
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,520
the best trader in this commodity, I have to know everything. I have to know exactly what this

641
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,720
pipeline looks like. How does it cross this type of part of the country? What type of bolt are they

642
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,640
using in it here? And what happens to it during this type of weather? I mean, how much of your

643
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:16,760
time went into understanding every piece of the minutia of how this system worked that you were

644
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,840
basically going to dominate in terms of arbitrage and speculation.

645
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:28,040
So by being a hedge fund structure and not being in the physical business, not dealing with customers

646
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:33,960
and dealing with pipelines, we were at an information disadvantage going in. When we were

647
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:41,320
thinking, think about whenever I trade against a counterparty and they're putting on the opposite

648
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:48,440
trade I am, what are they thinking? What do they know? Can I replicate as best I can the knowledge

649
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,840
that they have so that I can make an educated and confident decision, do I want to be on the other

650
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:02,120
side of this bet? And to do so, we were at an information handicap just in terms of BP had

651
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:08,920
more information that would come through their shop than we did. So we had to make it up by

652
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:16,200
having better analysis and knowing where to get third party information and how to analyze that

653
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:23,160
information, how to craft better models that described what the past was and thus what the

654
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:30,360
future is going to be, and then try to overlay some good smart trading and structuring of trades

655
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:36,440
on top of that to get the above average returns. But I think we were always fundamentally focused.

656
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:41,720
And this came from the days at Enron, which was the largest physical mover shipper of gas,

657
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:48,520
was count the molecules. Try to count as many molecules as you can. Where did it come from?

658
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:54,040
Where did it travel? How was it consumed? And so you can build a molecule about, if you know how

659
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:00,040
every molecule behaved yesterday, you can model how those molecules are going to behave tomorrow

660
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:04,280
and how those molecules are going to behave in six months. Now, your confidence level is not as

661
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,680
good in the six month model, but you can start doing that and then you can start doing the

662
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:14,760
speculative trading on top of it. And so I think we probably had the biggest fundamental research

663
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:21,320
department of any competitor in the space at Centaurus. And that was really what I thought

664
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:27,480
our advantage was, was that we're going to invest in the fundamentals more than anybody else is,

665
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,120
and then overlay that with some good trading. You just alluded to something which I guess I

666
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,800
hadn't picked up on before, which, or at least it just occurred to me now when you said that.

667
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,480
Earlier, you said natural gas was easier than oil. When you just gave that explanation,

668
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,840
you talked about being able to count every molecule of gas. I suspect that that's what

669
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:52,840
allows an island like North America to be easier to trade gas than oil, because we have more insight

670
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:59,400
into where gas is coming from. LNG was not a big part of gas. So gas was being locally produced

671
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:05,000
and consumed. It's not like with oil where, my God, it's coming from everywhere and it's

672
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,520
going everywhere, right? Is that a fundamental difference between natural gas and oil trading,

673
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,480
at least at that time? I mean, I know natural gas is more complicated now with shale, with

674
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,600
liquefied natural gas that can go offshore, but is that part of why you made that statement earlier?

675
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:24,200
Yeah, I think there's three main differences that made natural gas a great product to trade. One was,

676
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,160
it was this closed system that you described that the molecules for the most part were just

677
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:34,040
stayed in North America. There was a little bit of LNG business. It was mostly baseload, so it was

678
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:38,680
easy to predict what those flows were going to be in the future. That wasn't a big variable that

679
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:45,320
was going to cause price moves in the future. And because it was this closed system, you can model

680
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:52,440
it with much better accuracy. Second was that the deregulation that got the pipelines out of

681
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,160
the business and the pipelines had to be third parties that couldn't take ownership of the gas.

682
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:02,840
The only service that they could provide was transportation. And by doing so, they didn't have

683
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:08,840
the pipelines which had the most fundamental information about where the gas came from and

684
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,520
where it was going. They had to publish all this information in a way that was publicly accessible,

685
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,240
and they couldn't trade on it. So there had to be the Chinese wall between the trading group.

686
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:26,040
And when you compare that versus oil, Exxon can own the oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico to get

687
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:33,080
in on an Exxon ship, take it to an Exxon-owned refinery and put it in Exxon gas stations.

688
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:38,760
And so as an outsider trying to figure out and track those molecules, it's impossible. And that's

689
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:45,160
why the best and most profitable oil traders have to be in the physical business, have to be moving

690
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:51,160
molecules. And the third is that natural gas, because it was a seasonal product, you store it

691
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:58,280
during the summer, getting ready for the peak winter demand, that there was a window of storage

692
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:06,520
that the industry almost required when you go into the winter. And there was a window of what it

693
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:13,080
should be when you exit the winter. And so twice a year, there was a mechanism to get you back

694
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:20,040
close to fair value. And if you compare that to a tech stock today, I have always debates about

695
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:26,200
some stock, there's nothing that necessarily has to get that tech stock back to one's belief of fair

696
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:32,920
value. There's not that forcing mechanism. And if you're talking about gold, there's no forcing

697
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:38,920
mechanism in gold. If you have a surplus of gold, you can stick it in a safe someplace. But with

698
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,880
limited storage in natural gas, and the need to have a certain amount of storage when you enter

699
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:50,360
the winter, it caused that forcing mechanism, which got you back to fair value. So while price

700
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:57,560
could deviate from fundamental value for parts of the time of the year, twice a year, it kind of had

701
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,920
to go back to that, which was great as a fundamental trader. There's a lot of commodities where they

702
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:09,000
don't necessarily have to go back to that fair value. So the country is entering a recession,

703
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:18,520
2008, 2009. You are still staggeringly profitable. Where at this point in time is your head with

704
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:24,360
respect to philanthropy? So we've established the fact that when you were making $100,000 bonus

705
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,840
as an early trader at Enron, even before you became head trader, you're already spending 1%

706
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,760
of your energy thinking about how you want to utilize your wealth down the line. But now let's

707
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:41,880
talk 2009, 2010. You're almost a decade into running your own fund, which will probably go

708
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,200
down in time as one of the most profitable hedge funds of all time, certainly in this space.

709
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,640
Are you, what are you 10% now thinking about philanthropy? I mean, how are you now thinking

710
01:09:51,640 --> 01:10:01,240
about chapter two of your career? Yeah, so I met my wife in early 2006. And she had moved to Houston,

711
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:06,280
she was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer and had moved to Houston to help start an energy company.

712
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:13,960
And I've spent, I forget exactly how long, but call it 18 months on that job. She and I had

713
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,880
started in the meantime, we'd gotten married. And we're starting to think about what should we do

714
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:25,000
with our lives now? This momentous event of marriage, what does she want to be doing? What

715
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,720
do I want to be doing? We have the financial resources to do what we want with our time.

716
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:35,240
And so she answered that question by saying, I don't want to work at the energy company anymore.

717
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,440
I want to focus on our philanthropic activities, which we had both been doing a little bit on the

718
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:49,800
side. At this point, call it 2006, I was spending maybe 3% of my energy on philanthropy. And she the

719
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:58,280
same. And by 2008, she had gone full time with our nascent foundation. And we started hiring a few

720
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:07,480
people. And I was starting to spend more of my energy, call it 10%, 15% of my energy on the

721
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:14,840
foundation, which became troubling a little bit because it's obviously markets are efficient in

722
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:20,680
the long term, the markets are smart, the competitors are smart, competitors entered,

723
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:27,560
you had to keep finding new ways to stay above the competition. And one of those was, you have to be

724
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:35,160
100% focused on this job. It's too competitive to not be 100% focused. And when I went 90%, then it

725
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:42,680
got harder. As the preceding years happened, and I started thinking more about giving the money away

726
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:47,960
than making more of it, that was really the signal to me that I want to be spending my time on the

727
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:54,920
other side of the table. And I'm physically and mentally emotionally exhausted with trading

728
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:00,200
natural gas is the only thing I had done as a professional again from a few days after graduating

729
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:07,000
college. And here I am 17 years later, still doing pretty much the same thing. And I want to do

730
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,280
something else with my life. And so that was 2012. And that's when I decided it's time to shut this

731
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,320
down. I'm guessing that I mean, I've spoken with some of the greatest scientists in the world. And

732
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:23,960
not everybody says this, but there are some that do that they say, they can't stop thinking about

733
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:30,200
what it is they're working on. Anytime they get to a stoplight, that's where their mind wanders.

734
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:34,920
When they're in the shower, that's where their mind wanders is to the problem, is to the questions

735
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,240
that they're trying to ask, is the problem they're trying to solve. Is it safe to say that you

736
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:46,120
probably felt the same way until you hit that inflection point? Absolutely. It was spent more

737
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:51,880
than a decade living, breathing, after work, go out with other people in the industry and talk about

738
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,160
natural gas, dream about natural gas. I would wake up in the morning, first thing you do is

739
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,720
check the prices, get in the shower, think about it, what could go wrong? What do I want to do today?

740
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:06,280
What's the plan? And it was just all encompassing in life. I think to be successful in these

741
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:14,600
competitive fields, whether it's in health research or in trading, you have to give it that 100% focus.

742
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,840
And if you don't, you're going to see it in the results. It's just too competitive.

743
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:25,800
So was it a hard decision for you then to shut your fund down, return the capital to people,

744
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,760
and become a full-time philanthropist? Or was it actually quite easy once you accepted,

745
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,480
I'm no longer giving 100% of my brain power to this other thing?

746
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:43,720
It was hard. That's who I was as certainly a professional and who I was largely defined

747
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:50,600
as a person as well was as a natural gas trader. Had been the place where I'd had the most success

748
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:56,200
of anything I had tried to do in my life. And so starting in about 2010, I knew this was the

749
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:02,680
decision I needed to make. It was hard. It was a hard decision to make. It got easier because

750
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:09,800
things had changed in the market. So if you look at the graph of natural gas prices, you see them

751
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:16,120
peaking about July of 2008, maybe late June 2008, and just being on a steady decline and the

752
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:22,920
volatility starts to change as well. The Shell revolution took the market from one that was

753
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,520
ever increasing demand and harder and harder to get the next molecule of gas out of the ground.

754
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,960
So having to try to balance that through price, which becomes very volatile and leads to booms

755
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,080
and busts, to one that was in perpetual oversupply and kind of bouncing around marginal cost to

756
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:45,400
produce. And so the opportunity had changed. And so I'd given back $3 billion back to investors.

757
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:51,640
And it was at the point where by 2012, I was at, I need to give back another 50% down to a billion

758
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,040
and a half, just the market opportunity is not there. And it's hard when you've been playing

759
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:02,280
in Vegas with the $25 table to go back down to the $5 table. It's just not as emotionally

760
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:09,480
interesting. And so that happened. I got married, we had kids, the regulation in the business

761
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:15,480
partially, in fact, maybe largely due to the Brian Hunter episodes that had when the price

762
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:21,640
distortions that wasn't good for the market had just become harder. And I had just lost the focus

763
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,720
in my interest in the foundation side. And so all these things came together. And it still took me

764
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:32,840
two years to really figure out, to make that call, that it's time. It's time to close us up and go

765
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:39,720
find happiness somewhere else. And I think part of that struggle was I had seen many other people

766
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:45,560
in the industry who had similar thoughts along the years, that they want to go do something else.

767
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:53,400
And a lot of times those people left and couldn't find what to do or couldn't find satisfaction

768
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,840
with their lives doing something else. And so even though that they were unhappy in the trading

769
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,560
business, they ended up back in the trading business because they were even more unhappy

770
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,080
the other thing that they had tried to go do. And so that was my fear, was that a year from

771
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:15,160
when I close up, I'm going to miss it and I'm not going to find satisfaction in this other thing.

772
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,960
And then what? What do I do then? Am I really going to go start it up again? It took me those

773
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,040
24 months to really get the confidence to say, I can find happiness here. I can find other things

774
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:35,240
to do and to close it down. So talk me through some of those early days then. Laura has obviously

775
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:41,480
been well up and running. She's been on this full time for several years now. You both have

776
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:47,960
a great number of interests at the time. How do you begin to make that transformation? We've

777
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,640
already talked a little bit about what the skills are that you brought to bear. And again,

778
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:58,040
I'd reiterate them as kind of an emotional temperament for it to not let your feelings

779
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:02,840
get in the way of what you're doing. The second one being kind of the right amount of confidence

780
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,840
to say, yeah, this is a huge and hard problem, but we should go after it. But maybe not too

781
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,480
much confidence to say, we're going to solve this problem no matter what. And then I think the third

782
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,320
one being probably one that gets overlooked a bit, but basically an ability to become an expert in

783
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:21,320
something in a relatively short period of time. I mean, I think people who are familiar with Bill

784
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,760
Gates just watched a documentary about him and not read much about him. You'll realize he's not just

785
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,280
a guy that revolutionized the computer industry. But when you look at the voracious appetite with

786
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,400
which he has explored other topics, I mean, I've only met Bill in person once. And I'll share that

787
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:42,120
the subject matter that we were speaking on, which was something in my wheelhouse and not his,

788
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:49,000
it only took me about 10 minutes to realize I was talking to someone who knew as much about this

789
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,320
topic as almost anyone I had spoken with. And that's saying something because this is not

790
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,200
something you would assume that a person would know a lot about. I mean, this was at the beginning

791
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,520
of the discussion, I'm using terms that I would use with a lay person. And he's like, yep, yep,

792
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:07,240
yep, yep. He's like, no, no, no, you just go straight to shorthand for me. And I was like,

793
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,800
but he wasn't doing it from a place that was anything other than totally genuine. You knew

794
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,320
that this is a guy who really knew the subject matter. Again, you share that trait, which is,

795
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,360
I don't know, that's, that allows people, I think, to have a bigger impact in their philanthropy.

796
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:28,440
I appreciate the comparison, but it's not close. I agree with, I've gotten to know

797
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:36,200
Bill over the years and agree with your assessment of him that his breadth and depth of knowledge

798
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,120
is something that I have never seen in somebody else. And it incredibly impressive in that he

799
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:50,680
knows the background and knows the issues of almost anything you can think of in a way that is scary.

800
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:57,640
And I am certainly not that way. Well, I will agree to disagree on that, John. So talk to me

801
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:04,280
about the first problem that you decided to turn your attention to once you became a full-time

802
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:12,040
philanthropist. As I said, I'd gotten my start in giving with K-12 education and kind of over the

803
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:18,600
years, I've just gotten deeper and deeper into those questions of why does one school have

804
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,560
different results from a school down the street serving the very similar population of kids?

805
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:30,760
What's the theory of change in K-12? It is such a massive system that's broken down at the school

806
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:38,200
level. And how can we as a country try to get results that we're happier with knowing all the

807
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:46,120
hurdles that go into that and all the factors that go into education and behavior? So how does that

808
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:54,920
scale? How does those small gems that you see, how can you scale that? And this is a question I think

809
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:01,560
the educational reform movement has been struggling with for decades and I watched that

810
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,160
journey and was on the journey along with many other philanthropists of is it small schools? Is

811
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:13,880
it better principals? Is it better teachers? Is it the curriculum? Is it technology? All these things

812
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:20,040
kind of bouncing from one idea to the next trying to find what's the idea that scales and creates

813
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:26,600
structural change. And so we're still involved in K-12. I think it's just the most fundamental

814
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:35,240
issue facing long-term health and viability of this country. And when you talk to almost any

815
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:44,200
social service provider, they always refer back to education. And so I think it's one that we've

816
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,520
spent a lot of time thinking about and happy to get into that if you want. But it was the first

817
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,560
and it continues to be a major effort of the foundation. And I know that you've worked with,

818
01:20:53,560 --> 01:21:00,200
as you said, others. I think Citi Fund has sort of largely, a lot of your efforts have morphed

819
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:06,520
into that, correct? Right. So I guess I'll give you the theory of change that drives our work of

820
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:14,280
late in K-12. And that's that strong and robust systems of any kind have the attributes of

821
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,800
biological evolution, right? And so in living organisms, that's the phenotypic variation.

822
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:26,360
You have variance amongst the organisms. The differential fitness, is there a different

823
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:32,280
rate of survival and reproduction? And then the heritability of fitness. And I think this is true

824
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:37,960
of any organization. It's true of businesses. It's true of any system. And it's true of the

825
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,040
healthcare system, the criminal justice system. And it's true of the school system. So you need

826
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,600
to have a strong, robust system that's getting better over time. You need those three traits.

827
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,920
And the traditional public school system does not have them. So if you think of a school district

828
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:02,120
that is a monopoly in its area, it doesn't have much variance. It might have a school that's

829
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,160
Spanish emerging. It might have a school that's for the talent and gifted. It might have another

830
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:13,080
school that's a magnet or something. But generally, it's same curriculum, the same process,

831
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:19,000
the same way of hiring, of training, of trying to develop teachers, how your principal development

832
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,880
is, right? You don't have that variation. The differential fitness of do things that are working,

833
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:30,440
do they grow, or do they go away? Yeah, there's no pressure. The good stuff in public education,

834
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,480
there's no natural mechanism for them to grow, for that to grow. And there's no mechanism that

835
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:40,120
really works in the public school system for it to go away, for the things that aren't working

836
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:49,320
to stop. And then the readability of traits, you need the learning organization aspect of it,

837
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:57,080
which I will tell you, a school system is not good at, and any government monopoly is not good at

838
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:04,520
quality control. It's not good at innovation to provide that variance. And so the theory with

839
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:09,240
Citi Fund and the theory of our K-12 work is that the school system needs to become a system

840
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:15,400
of schools, that the natural role for government is not to be the service provider. The natural role

841
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:21,160
should be the regulator. And right now, those two functions are bundled together into one,

842
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:27,720
and no system can regulate itself. And too often today, I think those systems are structured to

843
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,240
regulate themselves. And so you don't get that innovation, you don't get the quality control.

844
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,680
And so the vision is, and what we saw in New Orleans after Katrina, was this change of

845
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:46,200
going from the school system to the system of third-party nonprofit operators that are given

846
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,040
the chance to have the resources and responsibility to educate kids,

847
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:57,720
K-12 kids. And the theory, again, if it works well, that the parents, the kids have real choice,

848
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:03,160
get to choose what type of model they want, whether it is a immersion program, whether they

849
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:09,400
want high discipline or regular discipline, whether they want an art school, et cetera.

850
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,360
That demand, if you're given real choice to the kids, to the parents, that that's the best quality

851
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:20,600
control that can happen. And then the government as the regulator needs to make sure that all kids

852
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,840
are served, because we need to make sure that ideal, that every kid is properly served,

853
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,000
but is largely out of the business of providing the service of education.

854
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,760
So let's put some numbers to this, John, more broadly. So maybe think of it in terms of GDP,

855
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:40,120
how much is private, how much is public slash government, how much is nonprofit? What's the

856
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:46,200
approximate breakdown of the dollars that get allocated in the world or in the country, I'm

857
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,880
sorry, along those three divisions? Of the total economy, the private sector is approximately 60%.

858
01:24:51,880 --> 01:25:00,200
Government's approximately 40%. The philanthropic sector is about 2%. Now, when you take out giving

859
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:05,720
to museums, to religious organizations, to the arts in general and religious organizations,

860
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:11,400
you get down to about 1% of the economy is philanthropy for social services or social

861
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:16,520
goods. Okay. So you're stripping out basically what I used to call maybe erroneously brick

862
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:22,680
and mortar philanthropy. And you're saying 50% of it, the 50% that remains is this type of

863
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,160
philanthropy that people like you work on, people like Bill Gates works on. No, it's not just the

864
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,600
brick and mortar. No, no. So I'm including gifts to food banks, gifts to the hospital system to

865
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:38,440
build a building. Oh, okay. Okay. This is about 1% of the economy. So one of the things we've

866
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:46,120
thought about is what's the role of philanthropy? Because the government is giving a benefit to

867
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,960
people who give money to nonprofits. There's a tax deduction. And so there is a stake, there is

868
01:25:53,160 --> 01:26:00,200
some type of tie that I think exists between the donor and what that money should be going for.

869
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:06,760
And so we've thought about how should that 1% of philanthropic funds, what's the best use of that?

870
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:14,680
And you can think about, or we think about, it can either supplement government services. So by

871
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:19,880
providing more money to the homeless shelter, a service that the government already provides,

872
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,240
but you can supplement that with more resources. And that's typically described as charity, trying

873
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,760
to solve today's problems. And then there's the, what some would describe as strategic philanthropy

874
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:36,120
of trying to get at the core roots of issues to prevent those problems from developing tomorrow.

875
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:42,680
Both are really important. There's not a priority or hierarchy between those two. We give some

876
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,840
charitable dollars. You give money to the food bank. We give money to the homeless shelter in

877
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:52,920
town. You do have to meet those needs. But there is a role for how does the philanthropic money

878
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:59,000
complement government services to make them better? What is the market failure as to why government

879
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:05,320
is not working as well as many people believe it should? How can the school system be better?

880
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,560
Well, the school system now is so focused on, is already budget constrained. It's so focused on

881
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:17,800
just providing the day-to-day activities. And the same of all these nonprofit social providers is

882
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:26,680
that they're so focused on the day-to-day job that they don't get to experiment like they should.

883
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:31,080
And so there is this role for strategic philanthropy to come in and say, how can these

884
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:37,400
actors and these systems perform better? And I think that's where we've largely focused on

885
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:43,960
our giving is looking at systems change. It's structural and it's scalable to a way that just

886
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:49,240
providing another dollar for a program largely is not. There's different roles for different types

887
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,800
of givers. Anybody can write the check to the food bank. And again, we write the check to the food

888
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,120
bank, but the smallest giver can also write the check to the food bank. Looking at the strategic

889
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:06,200
side, which requires a lot of manpower and expertise and hiring experts and getting access

890
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,520
to experts and thinking about here are the ideas that have been tried in the past, what's worked,

891
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:15,560
what hasn't. Here are the current ideas, what's the theoretical framework for those ideas and why

892
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:21,800
they could work. What are the potential second order effects of those and making those decisions.

893
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,280
It's really, it's hard for the small donor to do that. It's really geared towards the large

894
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,720
national foundations. And so that's really where we see our role.

895
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,480
Were you humbled by how difficult that is, how difficult it is to someone could easily

896
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:39,080
listen to this and say, how hard is it to give away $400 million a year? You're just,

897
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,320
you're writing big checks, but the way you just described that actually, it sounds very difficult

898
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,360
to give away a lot of money if it's trying to mostly be philanthropic and not charity driven.

899
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:53,320
Because as you said, the philanthropic one is the one that's strategic. It's the one that you're

900
01:28:53,320 --> 01:29:00,840
trying to scale and be maximally leveraged in the silo of another agent, for example, in the case of

901
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,360
what the government's already doing or what the private sector is already doing. I mean, it just

902
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,920
strikes me as very difficult. How long did it take? A, do you agree with that? And then B,

903
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,800
how long did it take you to come to that realization that your second career is

904
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:17,560
probably harder than your first? We have about 120 employees of the foundation today. We had

905
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:26,920
no desire or interest to have 120 employees 10 years ago. That was not by design. We thought

906
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:34,280
giving would be easy. I remember very specifically thinking, or giving was going to be find the

907
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:41,880
highest social return projects for organizations. And just write those five big checks every year,

908
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:47,720
make it easy, make it fairly passive. We started down this route and I started pulling the research.

909
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:52,840
I had a conometrics background and college, like smart enough to read the papers. I could figure

910
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:58,280
out what they were saying. And so start with a topic like preschool. You see three papers that say

911
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:03,480
preschool is amazing. It generates all these outcomes later in life. And then you see one

912
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,600
evaluation of the Head Start program that shows it doesn't really have an effect. And then as you

913
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:18,520
dig deeper in, start seeing there's huge battles within this research sector about what the evidence

914
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:24,360
really shows, what it demonstrates, and the quality of the evidence that's going into all these claims

915
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,960
about success. And I think in every area that we thought of, look at work training programs.

916
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:39,560
The first scan through, everything works. It's all great. Writing checks there is a great way

917
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,600
to invest money. And then you dig deeper and start getting into, okay, the problems with

918
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,760
those research that organizations are holding up saying, here's our evidence that we're successful.

919
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,160
And it got very frustrating because the more we would study, the less we knew

920
01:30:53,720 --> 01:31:00,440
about what worked, what didn't. One of the learnings was very few programs worked,

921
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:07,960
or new programs. So the things that work are generally already part of the fabric of society,

922
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:15,080
like K-12 education. We know that works, what works. These programs that have clear evidence

923
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,240
of successor are generally already funded by government, already part of fabric of society.

924
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,080
So what's our role? Are we just going to supplement with a few extra dollars on the side?

925
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:28,760
And I didn't want to do that. So where could our dollars go the best? And that really led us down

926
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:34,920
this issue of how do you change and improve the system and the incentives and the rules of a

927
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,920
system rather than what's the next program we can fund? Because the frustration of trying to find

928
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:47,080
that program just became immense. So speaking of a system that I think almost anybody who spent

929
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:51,640
any length of time thinking about it will pretty quickly come to the conclusion is broken, is the

930
01:31:51,640 --> 01:32:00,280
criminal justice system. When did that system come to your and Laura's radar? Laura really drove

931
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,480
us entering this field. She was a lawyer by training, although on the corporate side, I think

932
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:11,160
she was just from having the legal background, you see the world in a different way. And one of the

933
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:15,240
first organizations that we started sending some checks to was the Innocence Project. And we had

934
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,440
met the head of the Innocence Project, Barry Schecht, at some event and start hearing the stories

935
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:28,040
that will just tear at your heart someone who's been wrongfully convicted and was going to die

936
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:35,000
except for the actions of the Innocence Project. And we started funding that just because it was

937
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,440
the right thing to do. It was a way to help save a life that was going to be terminated without that.

938
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,280
I have great respect for the Innocence Project because as they started building up

939
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:53,400
dozens and into hundreds of examples of people that they got off death row or out of prison for

940
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:58,600
wrongful convictions, they started looking at the policy angle as well. So it wasn't just about the

941
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:04,760
one person or the 100 people that they were saving, although massively important. They started

942
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:09,880
thinking more strategically about how do we change the system so that the wrongful convictions don't

943
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:15,720
happen in the first place. Right, because you have to believe that for the amount of effort it takes

944
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:23,240
to take one person off death row, one wrongly convicted person off death row, having followed

945
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:31,320
a few of these cases, it can take decades. And I mean, it can consume the effort of tens of people,

946
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:37,880
tens of thousands of hours. And you would say, well, it's wonderful that we've saved that life.

947
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:43,320
What if we put an equal amount of resources on the other side of the equation, which is getting

948
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:47,880
few of these people into the system? In other words, you start to think about where's the

949
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:54,120
asymmetry on this one. And it seems a lot of it's on the front end, right? I mean, you could have

950
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:59,080
a hundred Innocence Projects, you will still never fully be able to rectify the situation,

951
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,680
notwithstanding the fact that you can't undo retroactively all the harm that is done by the time

952
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:11,080
the person is set free. Exactly. A couple of examples like that really led us again to,

953
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:17,400
okay, the systems change, the policy focus is where we want to spend the time that there's

954
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:26,440
higher potential reward, it is harder work, the chance of success is lower. But the impact,

955
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:32,680
if successful, is so much higher, if you can improve how the system works. And so we started

956
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:37,560
looking at kind of a number of areas of the criminal justice system, where I guess first,

957
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:43,880
we spent a year, hired someone to lead that work, we spent a year just thinking about all the ways

958
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:48,920
the inefficiencies in the system that lead to bad outcomes that don't promote public safety,

959
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:54,920
that destroy neighborhoods that aren't fair and equitable for those that are charged or convicted

960
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:00,360
of a crime, et cetera. And where could we as a foundation, where could we be effective?

961
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,520
Let's pause on that for a moment. Because again, I think that's just a very interesting

962
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:09,320
approach that is a bit counterintuitive. You decide this is something you're passionate about,

963
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,800
but you don't go right into it, both guns blazing, there's a humility that says,

964
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:20,760
why don't we bring an internal team in that we'll hire, that'll spend a year helping us get up to

965
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:29,080
speed on this and identify the specific targets that we can focus on. Do you find that to be a

966
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:36,200
period of impatience for you? Or do you find that to be a period of great enjoyment as you are on the

967
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:43,480
upswing of another learning curve? It's certainly impatience. We have all this money sitting in the

968
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:50,440
account. The goal is to do good with it. And we'd rather figure out how to do the most good today,

969
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:54,840
rather than waiting until tomorrow. So there was this natural impatience, but I think we've been

970
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:02,440
smart enough to realize that it's smarter to invest wisely tomorrow than do something that's

971
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,720
unlikely to have impact today. And so that's just kind of a necessary function of it is

972
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,840
bringing in some experts, but really study where is the leverage that a foundation can have on

973
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:16,680
the problem. It's very different from the other actors that are already in the system. It's

974
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:22,840
different from what politicians can do or government policy makers or judges or police,

975
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:31,240
everybody has a role. And the question is, how can a philanthropy or foundation that is not a

976
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:37,000
natural actor in the system, but has a checkbook, how can that create some leverage to try to steer

977
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:43,560
the system and improve it? Now, in your first version of the foundation, there were two versions,

978
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,520
right? There was a C3 and a C4. And I believe currently the entire foundation is a C3. Is that

979
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:56,280
correct? We've always realized that the goal is not to just do research or just do idea generation.

980
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:04,120
The goal is to have real positive policy change. And policy change requires some advocacy,

981
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:10,680
political action, it just does. And so we used to have those, the C4, which is the advocacy arm,

982
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:17,240
is a separate tax vehicle. And there had to be a Chinese wall between the C3 and C4.

983
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:24,360
With the C3 being the traditional philanthropic vehicle. And we realized was that having that

984
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:31,480
Chinese wall really was harming our ability to have positive impact. And so we combined the two

985
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:39,160
entities into an LLC, so that the same employee who was the expert in fines and fees and the options

986
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:44,200
on how to change fines and fees to make them more equitable and just could also go sit there and

987
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:51,320
talk to a legislator about why the problem existed and what the optimal solutions were.

988
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:56,840
So what were some of the things that you and the team learned when it came to understanding how

989
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:02,040
the criminal justice system could be so broken? And I say that again, not knowing much about it,

990
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:08,200
but knowing a little bit about it, right? Which is there seems to be an enormous racial disparity

991
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:15,320
that exists. There also certainly by state, certainly seems to be great difficulties in

992
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,000
appealing even in the presence of evidence that the first trial may not have been a great trial.

993
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,040
The amount of coercion that goes into convictions that turn out to be, I mean, there's so you could

994
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,760
just rattle off. You don't have to know anything as clearly I don't to still rattle off five or

995
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:37,080
six structural problems. How did you decide which ones were the most important and or which were

996
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:42,280
the ones that you could have the greatest impact in? I think it was important to figure out how we

997
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:51,400
got to the current system. And in this world of real partisanship was a bipartisan response to

998
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:58,120
the growing violent crime that was happening starting post World War II. And then really

999
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:07,400
peaked late 80s, early 90s that got everybody, all politicians concerned and scared and they felt

1000
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:13,000
they were being elected based upon crime rates, based upon the amount of violent crime and trying

1001
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,840
to get a handle on that. So the violent crime was also destroying communities. And so you had

1002
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:25,960
Democrats, Republicans, whites, Blacks, Hispanics, all come together and start this tough on crime

1003
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:32,280
mantra, which was we're going to jack up our number of police, we're going to jack up the

1004
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:40,200
penalties for any criminal act, have it severely intensify the war on drugs, and then all the

1005
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:46,280
second and third order effects that came with it happened. Now, crime ended up peaking in the early

1006
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:52,040
90s. And some of it was because of some of the policies passed, but a lot of it wasn't. So you

1007
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:58,120
can see different areas that adopted policies at different times. And it seems like the drop in

1008
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:06,680
crime was relatively independent of when communities both across America as well as globally, adopted

1009
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:14,520
some of these policies. So why did crime go down over the past 30 years is still a mystery to some,

1010
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,640
they have some great researchers have looked at this and tried to figure it out. And it's a lot

1011
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:22,520
of like, okay, a small piece of it's this small piece of it's this, etc. But the times have

1012
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:29,560
changed. So we still had on the books, the reaction from an environment that was very different. And

1013
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:36,760
the question is, we've seen what those policies did to neighborhoods. And we've seen the financial

1014
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:42,360
costs of those policies, and the trade offs associated with some of those policies. And I

1015
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:47,560
think you saw both Republicans and Democrats come together trying to rethink what's the right way

1016
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:53,240
to structure the criminal justice system, all aspects from policing and courts and prisons and

1017
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:58,200
reentry. What's the right way that we should do given the environment that we're in right now?

1018
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:05,080
Now, thinking back to those late 80s, early 90s, when everybody came together and said,

1019
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:08,680
we just can't handle this amount of violent crime, we're going to get tough on crime,

1020
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,720
we're going to create more prison beds, we're going to put more police officers on the street,

1021
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:17,160
etc, etc. Was it sort of a combination of things that led to where we are now? Was it basically

1022
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:23,320
more police, more arrests, stiffer sentences, less leniency around parole, lower tolerance on

1023
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,960
parole violations? Like, was there any one thing or even three things that stood out as the most

1024
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:35,240
damning factors that led to mass incarceration? What is your assessment of that? And I would be

1025
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,480
curious to hear your thoughts, because I think your thoughts would be more informed than mine or just

1026
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:46,600
the average person on what other factors could have accounted for the reduction in crime, if not

1027
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:52,680
the increase in incarceration. Yeah, I'll take the latter question first. The best report I've

1028
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:57,880
seen on this is from the Brennan Center that really looked at, spent significant amount of time trying

1029
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:04,440
to piece together what were different responses and how much of it was just kind of demographic

1030
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:10,680
trends, how much of it was economic growth and drop in better education, better skilled police

1031
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:16,600
tactics, all these different avenues. And I'm doing a short shift on all the things that they've

1032
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:25,080
assigned some causation to. I think the summary is, it's hard to see any one of them being really

1033
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:32,840
causal in the shift in crime. It was, most tellingly, you saw this same trends happening globally.

1034
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:39,480
Different countries had different reactions to this. And they all had that move up in crime

1035
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:45,640
over time into the 90s and then this downward trend. And so people were scratching their head

1036
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:50,280
trying to say, well, what caused it? And part of it, I'm not sure we'll ever know. And then to the

1037
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:55,560
first question about, which I'll reiterate just in case you forgot, is basically of all the

1038
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:01,400
mechanisms or tactics that would lead to an increase in incarceration, do you have a sense

1039
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:08,680
of which of those were perhaps most responsible? I don't want to get too far of my ski tips on this

1040
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:14,040
and misrepresent the research. I think part of it has been longer sentences. A part of it has been

1041
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:19,800
the conviction rate. So once you're arrested, you can get convicted, what percent of the people are

1042
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:28,120
done so? And it leads into the system is built to demand a plea bargain. We just don't have

1043
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:32,920
the court resources, the defense attorneys, the prosecutors, the judges, the court systems

1044
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:39,880
to hear a vast majority of cases. And so it ends up being less than 5% of cases actually go in

1045
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:46,440
front of a judge. Most of them just get pled out. And for a long time, because those resources

1046
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:51,880
don't exist, there's been incentives that have been built into the system that almost coerce

1047
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:58,280
people to plead guilty to crimes that they may not have committed. Because just from a risk reward,

1048
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:06,120
it is, I didn't commit this crime, but there's a 20% chance to get found guilty. I get a 20 year

1049
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:12,200
sentence, or I can serve I can plead down to a lesser charge and get six months of which I've

1050
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:17,320
already been here for three months. So three more months and I'm out or my life's over.

1051
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:21,560
Going back to your days of trading, that's a no brainer calculation.

1052
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:27,880
Yeah, and it's really hard to see how you solve that problem without a massive infusion,

1053
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:33,240
resources into the courts and into prosecutors and defense attorneys, which is not where we

1054
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:38,120
want to be spending money. We'd rather spend money on preventing crime on social services,

1055
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:45,000
to not have that problem to begin with. And so how do you get rid of this culture where

1056
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,920
the system can't handle everybody going to trial? One of the biggest challenges that nobody has a

1057
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:55,720
great answer for. Now, I don't know if this has been a focus at all of your foundation within

1058
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:01,480
criminal justice work, but obviously in the last few months, it's quite topical with respect to

1059
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:07,960
the relationship between the police and race and the role of systemic racism within law enforcement.

1060
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:17,240
How much does that factor into the economics of it beyond the obvious, which is disproportionately

1061
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:22,920
arresting, presumably disproportionately convicting just based on what you just said,

1062
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:28,280
the stats you just laid out. I mean, I would have never guessed that 95% of cases would be

1063
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,680
pled. And if that's the case, then yeah, I just answered my own question, which is if you're going

1064
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:37,720
to arrest disproportionately minorities, then you're going to convict or at least put in prison

1065
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:44,040
disproportionately minorities. And certainly the few times I have visited prison, it's disproportionately

1066
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:50,680
minorities. Take all of that and try to package it into a question. What is the role for philanthropy

1067
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:56,760
if there is one to try to address the questions of racism within law enforcement? Does that factor

1068
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:02,680
into a tool for criminal justice reform? There's obviously been a lot of debate or discussion

1069
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:09,880
this year on that very topic. And there's no doubt the disproportionate nature of the criminal

1070
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:15,720
justice system on minorities, and particularly on the black community. For so long, the political

1071
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:23,400
incentive and so much of the focus has been just on crime rates with no regard for the secondary

1072
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:29,160
effects that the criminal justice system causes on these communities and on families. And I think

1073
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:33,960
that's one of the things that we as a society are trying to grapple with now, not for the first time,

1074
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:39,880
but for the first time, this has gone into a mainstream discussion.

1075
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:44,920
Sorry, just to make sure you're saying we all acknowledge and have acknowledged historically

1076
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:51,800
that it's disproportionately black men that go to prison. But we're now taking a more broad look

1077
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:56,920
at the implication on, for example, children that are now left without a father. Is that what you

1078
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:03,080
mean as an example of the impact on the family? Right. And the psychological effects of being a

1079
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:08,520
black man in America, especially in a low income neighborhood that has, and especially if it's an

1080
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,440
aggressive police force there. I think one of the dilemmas has been that minority communities have

1081
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:21,480
felt both over policed and under policed at the same time. They feel over policed with the

1082
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:27,400
techniques that the police are using in their neighborhoods. So the random stops, certainly

1083
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:34,520
back in the era, stop and frisk, and a presumption of guilt and that people, especially young black

1084
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:43,080
men, are likely to be up to something bad. However, there is still a crime problem. Most

1085
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:49,480
crime is committed in one's own community. We're in the very near geographic area around the

1086
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:56,440
community. And there is a huge cost to society of violent crime. So nobody wants the police to leave

1087
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:04,200
entirely. There still has to be that function of deterrence and trying to clear cases that have

1088
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:11,720
been committed. So how do you create a policing system that tries to address both of those,

1089
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:20,440
that treats people more equitably, more justly, recognizes their constitutional rights while

1090
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:25,640
protecting those communities because the cost of policing on communities is high, the cost of violent

1091
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:30,040
crime on communities is high as well. And that's the struggle with the policing reforms. And there's

1092
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:35,320
things that we absolutely should do. A lot of those are getting enacted now, or at least being

1093
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:41,800
discussed now, but it's not just, the problem doesn't get solved just by passing one new policy.

1094
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:47,640
These problems got created over decades, over centuries, over decades of policing techniques,

1095
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:53,080
over centuries of disinvestment in these communities. And the question is, how do you

1096
01:48:53,080 --> 01:49:00,440
both provide the public safety while not causing the damage that some policing techniques cause today?

1097
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,400
So then shifting gears a little bit within the criminal justice system,

1098
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:09,560
how much of your effort has focused on the other side, which is recidivism. I mean, one of the

1099
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:17,880
things that I was most struck with when I visited prison was the lack of what appeared to be

1100
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:25,080
logic around why somebody was in prison. So again, maybe I'm being overly simplistic, but the way I

1101
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:32,040
would view it is there are sort of not that many reasons to put someone in prison. One reason to

1102
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:38,600
put somebody in prison is to protect the public from them. Another reason to put someone in

1103
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:44,680
prison is to punish them for something they have done. And yet a final reason to put somebody into

1104
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:51,320
prison that would factor into the first two, should they be released again, is to provide them with

1105
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:57,800
a set of skills to reintegrate into society in a better way. So you've got these, call it two

1106
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:05,160
pillars and then a foundation. And I was very surprised. Admittedly, I was in a maximum security

1107
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:09,800
prison, but nevertheless, at least half the men that were there were going to be out of jail in

1108
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,960
their lifetime. I was very surprised at how there was virtually no effort into the rehabilitative

1109
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:23,480
part. So even if you took a long view on protection and punishment, the lack of rehabilitation,

1110
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:30,120
almost guaranteed recidivism. Again, going to your point, if 95% of people are

1111
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:36,280
pleading out of something, many of which are things they didn't do, what they don't realize

1112
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:43,160
in that VAR calculation is, yeah, I'm going to be out of jail in three months, but I'm going to have

1113
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:51,320
a very difficult path to getting a job. I've now moved off the track of non-felon to I am a felon,

1114
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:56,440
and that's a very different path. So is there an opportunity for strategic philanthropy to play a

1115
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:03,560
role in the rehabilitative side of incarceration? Yes. I agree with everything you said. It's

1116
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:12,920
very hard to design effective recidivism programs after someone's come out. We've tried this as a

1117
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:21,400
society in many different forms and shapes for a long time, and the evidence is very poor that

1118
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:29,240
they have. You study it in a diligent way that these programs work. It's a very tough problem.

1119
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:35,320
And so there's a theory, which I believe, and kind of going on what you said, that the nature of

1120
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:41,400
prisons has to change. That if you wait until the day someone's released, that's way too late. It's

1121
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:48,520
like if you wait until someone drops out of school to step in with some more social services,

1122
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:56,760
it's too late. And so we have a couple of projects trying to reimagine prisons, think about exactly

1123
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:04,600
what you said about what's the role of prisons. What do we want society to do? The struggle is

1124
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:12,040
that states and cities, states and counties that fund this are often constrained financially. And

1125
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:17,720
so they're trying to figure out how do I meet today's problem, which is I got a lot of people

1126
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:25,320
in prison, versus how can I make investments to improve outcomes over the long term? And how much

1127
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:30,920
of the budget can go to improving outcomes over the long term while we have to meet today's needs?

1128
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:37,880
And anytime that there's a financial shock, you stop investing in the investments, because you

1129
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:45,080
try to meet today's needs. And so I think so much of the public money has gone to the day to day

1130
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:51,560
work of it, that not enough is trying to step back and think, how could a system be redesigned?

1131
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:57,240
What should people who are stuck behind the bars, what should they be doing with their day?

1132
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:01,880
How can we try to maximize the percent chance that they don't come back here when they're

1133
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:08,200
released? Because the recidivism rate is incredibly high. And we just haven't found

1134
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:12,680
ways to lower that through programs that reach people when they are released.

1135
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:19,160
So part of the problem with that, I think, is you could certainly make an ROI case that if you

1136
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:24,920
invest more now, you'll save much more tomorrow. But so in other words, if you have 100 people in

1137
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:31,000
prison that are going to get out every year, and ordinarily 80 of them are going to be back within

1138
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,200
five years, and you can make it 20 of them are going to be back within five years. Oh my god,

1139
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,920
the cost savings, you could almost invest anything you wanted to make that happen, and it would pay

1140
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:44,600
itself off. The problem is it won't pay itself off for five years. Is that a fair statement?

1141
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:50,440
Right. So in the private sector, they would make that investment every day. But in the public

1142
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:55,880
sector, it's on a cash accounting, you have to balance the books this year, and you have a fixed

1143
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:01,800
amount of money, we can raise taxes and raise revenues, but it's hard. Nobody likes to raise

1144
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:07,080
taxes. And so you have a fixed amount of money. So how much money goes to the investment, even if it

1145
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:13,800
has a strong ROI. And I think that's where the philanthropic sector can be an active player or

1146
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:20,680
actor in this system is by providing the funds to experiment with different ideas, different

1147
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:29,000
programs in prison, and then funding the high quality evaluation to see what is the ROI. Can

1148
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:36,200
we get good data so that we can go to the state and say, look, this program has a very positive ROI,

1149
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:40,760
I know it's hard in the short term to deviate money away from just the way we're doing it now,

1150
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:46,200
and it's gonna be hard to find the funds today to make that investment. But there's great evidence,

1151
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:50,680
if you can find those funds that five years from now, everybody's gonna be better off.

1152
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:55,080
The state's gonna be better off, society's gonna be better off, the person entering society is gonna

1153
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:59,480
be better off. And so you got to make that argument, but you have to be able to provide that

1154
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:05,480
high quality evidence of effectiveness because everybody shows up saying, my program works,

1155
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:10,600
my program works. Is that exactly the type of work you guys are doing in this space,

1156
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:17,000
which is basically trying to design the best, quote unquote, trials or experiments that could

1157
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:23,480
at least allow for an evidence based decision with respect to how to handle these things?

1158
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:31,160
That's certainly a line of the work. Some of it is more about values. And it's, should we keep

1159
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:39,640
someone detained in jail before they've gone to their court date because they don't have the

1160
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:46,280
money to pay bail? I think that's just a value. So the criminal justice has this mix of things that

1161
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:53,640
you can talk to ROIs on some things. Other things, it's just, is this how our society should be

1162
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:59,480
functioning? Is that a right thing? Is that balance the interests of the system? I think a lot of times

1163
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:05,080
when you sit down with people and you're like, is this an American value? Is this an American

1164
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:12,600
ideal that the system works this way? They will say no. Okay. Then how do we fix it more closely

1165
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:19,240
represents American values without while minimizing any potential second order effects, negative second

1166
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:24,200
order effects. So let's pivot to another area that is enormous for the foundation, which is health

1167
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:29,800
policy. This might be, I don't know, this is easily one of the most complicated systems in

1168
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:35,560
this country. How are you thinking about it and where are you trying to apply yourself? Because

1169
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:41,000
it's just too big. This strikes me as sort of the hedge fund problem you alluded to earlier.

1170
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,880
You could potentially try to spread yourself too thin, try to play in every area of it and get

1171
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:53,560
nothing done. So knowing you, though I don't know where you've chosen to invest your time lately,

1172
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:57,880
I'm guessing you have some clarity about the precision with which you want to think about that.

1173
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:05,720
Yeah. And you're right. It's just such a big issue complex, the number of things that one could work

1174
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:12,920
on and health policy is immense. And so I did the same thing. We're thinking about where in health

1175
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:20,200
policy should we be focused? We started working in this area about eight years ago. And after

1176
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:24,920
doing that same type of canvassing that we did in criminal justice work, we realized that our first

1177
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:31,640
area should be on drug prices. Kind of identified that as an area where kind of very obvious flaws

1178
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:39,240
in the existing system, that there were ideas that one could conceive of being enacted on how to fix

1179
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:47,880
it. And that the political window might open in the future, such that there was demand by the public

1180
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:54,200
and thus by politicians to actually adopt some of this stuff. And so using those three criteria,

1181
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:01,960
we ended up with how do we create a more rational system to price pharmaceuticals that balances

1182
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,160
interest, balances incentives that are necessary for the private sector to do the innovation that

1183
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:13,640
they're doing. It balances the financial interests of the state and the federal government that's

1184
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:18,920
largely paying for a lot of this stuff and that maximizes access for the patient.

1185
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:24,600
So if I understood you correctly, you're basically saying, look, let's look at what solutions could

1186
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:30,040
look like, even though if today the political will to make changes is in there, this is going

1187
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:35,560
to take us a while to figure out what to do. And maybe in 10 years, the water has gotten hot enough

1188
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:39,480
that the frog is willing to jump out. We'll at least have something in place. Is that kind of how

1189
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:44,520
you went about thinking about it, was taking a long-term view? Yes, it was that the political

1190
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:51,400
window wasn't open eight years ago when we started the work. We could see cracks in it. We could see

1191
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:56,440
cracks in that window. And I think that's one thing that we've been good at at a foundation is

1192
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:02,120
trying to identify where's the political window going to open up in the future, whether it's in

1193
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:09,080
changing the bill system, whether that's in doing pension reform or in pharmaceutical prices. We've

1194
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:16,520
gone to these areas and we were early. And so when the window opened, we had evidence-based

1195
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:22,120
ideas that we could present to policymakers and could properly document the problem.

1196
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:29,880
There was a whole effort on communications to both individuals, to society about what the abuses

1197
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:36,680
in the system are in any of these areas, including in drug pricing. But then also had ideas that you

1198
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:42,120
could go to him and say, here are the three things you need to do. Now, the pharmaceutical

1199
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:49,480
industry is perhaps the most complex industry of any. And so there aren't the three things that

1200
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:55,160
should be done. There's the 20 things that should be done because it is just such a broad and complex

1201
01:59:55,160 --> 02:00:01,080
system with so many loopholes and bad incentives that's driving bad behavior that to get at it is

1202
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:05,880
not, okay, here's the one thing, it's here's the 20 things. The downside is you start to lose

1203
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:10,600
policymakers when you hit number four, because they only want to speak in lists of three.

1204
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:16,360
So how optimistic are you? Because this is an area where I know a little bit. I've had Marty

1205
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:20,440
Macri on the podcast before. I know you know Marty and we've spoken about this. We have an

1206
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:24,760
entire episode on this topic. I've had Catherine Eben on before to talk about a different angle

1207
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:28,760
here, which is basically just the difference between the basically the corruption within the

1208
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:32,120
generic drug industry, which is a totally different problem from the one you're addressing.

1209
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:37,320
For as much as I know about this, I feel like I still don't understand it, which I think speaks

1210
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:43,800
to exactly what you just said. If a problem has 21 bullet points to fix it, it's a complicated

1211
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:49,320
problem. What is your level of optimism? I mean, to be blunt, do you feel like you are spinning

1212
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:54,040
your wheels for eight years? And this is a problem that will only get fixed when we are on the verge

1213
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:59,000
of bankruptcy in this country. Because as you said, this is largely a government spend problem.

1214
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:06,360
This is my view, by the way, this is my little rant on the United States. So we basically carry

1215
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:11,560
two enormous burdens for the world. There are two things we disproportionately pay,

1216
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:17,160
that our taxes disproportionately go to on some level subsidize things in the world. And one is

1217
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:21,720
military spend and the other is healthcare spend. And you might say, well, gosh, why would healthcare

1218
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:26,120
spend in the United States be a subsidy for the world? But it's effectively that we pay so much

1219
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:33,640
more for drugs here than our neighbors do, that we in effect subsidize the cost of R&D to the point

1220
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:38,440
where the incentives are to make the drugs here, to distribute them here and elsewhere,

1221
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:42,360
but we disproportionately pay. Do you agree with that assessment or is it overly simplistic?

1222
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,520
Right. We're 3% of the world's population. United States, 3% of the world's population,

1223
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:57,560
we pay 50% of the pharmaceutical revenues of the world. So there's no doubt that the prices that

1224
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:05,080
we're paying is helping and creating incentive for more medicines that others then get the benefit

1225
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:12,680
from. But one of the talking points I have in this is the NIH spends so much money on the basic

1226
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:18,280
science that's required to get these drugs started. And in return, the pharmaceutical companies

1227
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:25,240
charge us 2x, 3x the prices of other countries. We shouldn't be getting a discount because the

1228
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:30,840
United States taxpayers funding some of the basic science, much of the basic science, but some of

1229
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:36,040
the total cost of developing these drugs. But rather than we don't get the discount, we don't even

1230
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:39,800
get the same price as we get the highest prices in the world by a large measure.

1231
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,440
So it comes back to this notion of you'll hear people say things all the time like this is not

1232
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:47,880
sustainable. Our cost of healthcare is not sustainable, blah, blah, blah. And I remember

1233
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,240
hearing somebody say something once and I don't remember who it was, but I really agreed with the

1234
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:56,760
point he made, which was nonsense. It's totally sustainable because we're still doing it. I mean,

1235
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:03,080
it's going to be sustainable until it's no longer sustainable until we default on our debt as the

1236
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:09,720
largest sovereign default. This ridiculous system is totally sustainable. So then my question is,

1237
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:16,440
what will it take to change this given the complexity of it, given all of the bad incentives,

1238
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:22,840
given everything that you and I just said, what would it take for us to not be spending 15, 16,

1239
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:29,480
17% of our GDP on healthcare at a clip that's probably increasing at 5% per year in relative

1240
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:36,440
growth? Right. We spoke earlier about the downsides of the state having to balance the budget,

1241
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:41,880
and that's that it can't make the high ROI investments that it should. The upside is that

1242
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:49,400
it forces the states to consider trade-offs. They can spend a dollar on healthcare or a dollar on

1243
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:54,200
roads or a dollar on education or a dollar on social services, and they have to decide

1244
02:03:54,920 --> 02:04:00,360
where's the highest value, and they look to save money. The federal government, without that

1245
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:07,720
constraint, at least in today's environment, doesn't have to make that trade-off. So any

1246
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:16,040
proposed legislation where somebody gets harmed unless it's concentrated mostly in the other

1247
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:22,840
party's constituency, that will not pass because no hard decisions want to get made.

1248
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:30,200
And so the ramification of that is enormous budget deficits today and an enormous debt

1249
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:40,200
that has had a lot of people sounding alarms for decades. Now, those alarms and those concerns

1250
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:45,320
about the debt and what it's going to lead to have not come true today. It doesn't mean they're

1251
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:50,840
not going to come true in the future. And I think that's the greatest concern is that

1252
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:54,440
the United States is not going to default on the debt. We can just print the money,

1253
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:59,640
but what can happen is high inflation. And again, people have been talking about this for years,

1254
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:06,200
and I don't know if it ever comes true or not, but we in this country now have a fiscal or monetary

1255
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:14,440
response to every problem, and the one problem you can't solve from fiscal and monetary tools

1256
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,640
is inflation. And in fact, you have to go the other way. And that's when things get really

1257
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:25,240
bad is when you have to be cutting fiscal spending, when you have to be increasing interest rates

1258
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,840
to try to combat inflation. And so I don't know if the inflation comes. I don't know if it ever comes

1259
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:38,520
as someone who thought a lot about risk in their career and very concerned about the downside

1260
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:44,200
should it come. We just don't have a political environment now where tough decisions can get

1261
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:50,120
made. And so what happens if we start seeing high inflation then forces up interest rates

1262
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:53,720
that causes all the repercussions, negative repercussions of that, because we have the

1263
02:05:53,720 --> 02:06:00,600
system now so levered with debt at the household level, at the business level, at cities and states,

1264
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:04,680
at the federal level. So what would we do, John? Help me understand that. So right now,

1265
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:09,960
we can get away with printing money because the interest rate that the government pays is very

1266
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,960
low. If inflation hits and the interest rate goes up, I mean, as it stands now, the United States

1267
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:20,600
government's debt service is a staggering number. You probably know it. I certainly don't. I try to

1268
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:25,240
block numbers I really, really hate out of my mind, by the way. So I think at one point, I knew

1269
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:31,000
how much the United States paid per day in debt, and I quickly buried it somewhere in, I don't know,

1270
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,240
somewhere in my spinal cord. It's not even in my brain anymore. But at some point, as you said,

1271
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:40,120
if inflation hits and interest rates rise, that debt service could overwhelm our GDP, yes?

1272
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:46,200
Yeah, it could. People argue we should do more deficit spending today because interest rates are

1273
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:52,360
low. We can borrow for 10 years at very low rates. The reality is we borrow generally short term,

1274
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:57,240
but even if we put all the borrowing at 10 years or 30 years, we never actually pay off the debt.

1275
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:04,040
It's just accumulating. So as long as GDP is growing faster than real inflation, it's okay,

1276
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:10,440
because in a real basis, it declines. But that's not what happens. Debt's increasing much faster

1277
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:16,200
than real GDP. And so the real debt is increasing, and we never pay it off. And we're not sure whether

1278
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:21,240
the low interest rates are going to be around forever or not. It was 2007 when interest rates

1279
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:26,600
were close to 5%. Just imagine that now if interest rates went back to 5%, what it would do

1280
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:32,520
to stock prices, to businesses who are so levered, to cities and states, to everybody,

1281
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:38,840
to households. If you raise the cost of borrowing. Historically, 5% is not astronomical either.

1282
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:43,480
No, we've certainly seen double digits. And they've got to go back 40 years now. But we've seen

1283
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:48,760
double digit interest rates before in this country. And the decimation that would take place

1284
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:56,680
if that happened again is immense. And so I always think about, I want to help the world. I want

1285
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:03,240
to solve problems. But if the answer is just shovel more money at it, that's not a sustainable

1286
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:09,560
answer in my mind. So everything becomes, how do we improve the system without spending more money?

1287
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:15,000
Or how do we prove the allocation of resources today? And that gets us back to pharma, is that

1288
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:20,120
a dollar spent on pharma, which some portion of that goes to innovation and creates incentive

1289
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:26,120
for innovation. Well, innovation is great. In a world of no trade offs, there's no problem with

1290
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:30,760
that. And if you believe that there are no trade offs with how we spend our resources,

1291
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:36,360
then pharma prices are fine. In fact, double them, triple them, there'll be more incentive

1292
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:41,080
for innovation in that world. But that's not the world that I believe we live in. I believe there

1293
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:46,440
is a trade off and that a dollar put into pharma innovation is a dollar less for everything else.

1294
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:50,520
It could be other healthcare innovation or healthcare services that aren't getting provided

1295
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,480
today. Or it could be an education, it could be in making our prisons better, so that there's less

1296
02:08:55,480 --> 02:09:01,080
recidivism in all these ways. And somehow the pharma industry has been able to create this

1297
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:07,000
island. Every other industry has to fight for the dollars and try to convince the state and federal

1298
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,720
government, give me an extra dollar. Here's why. And the pharma system has just been able to create

1299
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:16,360
this island where they don't have to compete with anybody. They got their own rules. And it's a

1300
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:21,240
messed up set of rules that incentivizes the wrong thing. So even within that, we're not getting

1301
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:26,680
the drugs that we should be getting. We get a lot of marginal oncology drugs that probably

1302
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:32,440
don't provide any real benefit versus the current drugs. And we're not investing in the antibiotics.

1303
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:36,440
We're not investing in vaccines because the financial incentive isn't there for lows.

1304
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:41,640
So we're spending tons of money as a society and not even getting good returns for it. Sorry,

1305
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:48,120
that's my rant. It's very disheartening to see just how low that ROI is. I mean, I think,

1306
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:54,280
again, it comes back to this question of where does the crack finally have to occur?

1307
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:58,520
I love this expression. I don't know who it's attributed to and I'm probably paraphrasing it,

1308
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:04,600
but it's like change happens very slowly and then it happens very quickly. It's like the

1309
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:10,920
stone mason that is banging, banging, banging away on the stone for hours and hours and hours. And

1310
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:17,160
to the outside world, nothing is happening. And then with one more strike, it splits. And I feel

1311
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:24,680
like a lot of your philanthropy is like that. It is years of banging away at something that seems

1312
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:30,680
unchangeable. And there's a belief, there has to be a belief that at some point that

1313
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:37,080
nth strike is going to split that rock. Is this a skill that you, because that seems like the

1314
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:41,880
opposite of trading in some ways. Trading was in a relatively short period of time, you're going to

1315
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:47,400
find out if you were right or wrong. Again, you always had the advantage of being able to adjust

1316
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:53,080
your positions in the presence of new information, but at least you had a feedback loop that was

1317
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:58,920
relatively short. Here, your feedback loop is much longer. Does that pose a challenge for you

1318
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:05,800
emotionally? Absolutely. And you're right that the trading world has that instantaneous feedback

1319
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:13,080
about whether you're right or not. And you used to have the P&L marker up in the corner of the

1320
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:19,400
computer screen that would tell you at every moment in time what the market was telling you

1321
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:24,200
about your position. And a lot of these efforts that were involved in on policy change,

1322
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:30,840
number one, it'd take a long time. And second, as you described, you don't know if you're making

1323
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,960
progress often because it feels like you just have the hammer against the wall, have the hammer

1324
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:42,840
against the wall, and driving yourself crazy and wasting money. And then all of a sudden, it happens.

1325
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:48,120
There's a great book I read. It was written by an advocate who was trying to get rid of the don't

1326
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:53,160
ask, don't tell policy in the military and allow gays to openly serve. And this turned out to be

1327
02:11:53,160 --> 02:12:01,880
close to a 20-year campaign for him. In the first decade, his wins were so small. His advances in it

1328
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:08,760
was like he was trying to get invited to give a talk at a class at the military academy was a step

1329
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:16,280
forward. And you could see at any given time, he could have spent five years with very little

1330
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:21,640
visible progress and just stopped and said, pushing this rock, I've been hitting the wall,

1331
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:25,640
I'm not making any progress. This is a waste of my time. I should be doing something else

1332
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:30,920
and gone and done something else and not achieve success. But he stuck with it. And the second

1333
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:36,280
decade, he ended up getting the policy reversed and it led the effort. And I think about that story a

1334
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:43,000
lot of it's hard to know, but during that time, like five years in, are we wasting our time and

1335
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,120
this is never going to pass, or is the wall going to crack tomorrow? And you just don't have that

1336
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:53,400
feedback mechanism in this work that you had in the market and the complete opposites into the

1337
02:12:53,400 --> 02:13:00,120
spectrum. And I guess that's why the research that you do, the time that you take, the amount of

1338
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:06,280
deliberation that goes into your philanthropy at least gives you a greater foundation of confidence.

1339
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:10,920
Interviewed someone by the name of Rick Doblin, who's been singularly focused on the legalization

1340
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:17,080
of MDMA since about 1986. Again, it's staggering to me to think 34 years he has worked on the

1341
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:22,280
exact same problem. And I just had a call with Rick yesterday and I guess I don't know if I'm

1342
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:27,160
going to be careful what I am allowed to say or not say, but I think I can say with some confidence

1343
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:32,760
that he is probably closer than ever to achieving that goal through his organization maps, the

1344
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:39,160
multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies. And again, I just think that people who

1345
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:42,520
can do what you can do, who can do what Rick Doblin can do, who can do what a lot of great

1346
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:48,280
philanthropists can do. It's not just writing the check. That's amazing. That is unbelievable

1347
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:52,920
to be able to write the check. It's equally amazing to be able to stick on a problem.

1348
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:58,760
Speaking of problems, there's one problem you and I have never discussed, but it seems so up your

1349
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:04,360
alley. I wonder if you have evaluated it and decided it's not worth, you don't have the assets,

1350
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:09,000
you don't have sort of the problem solving asset to go after it, or you think enough people are on

1351
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
it. But I'm very curious as to what thought you guys have given to climate change. Again,

1352
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:18,920
given your understanding of energy, which is at least a third of the problem, tell me how that's

1353
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:26,840
come across your radar. Yeah, we do a little bit on climate change. I think as a trader and again,

1354
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:33,400
someone who thinks about risk, it's a problem where the downside possibilities are so enormous

1355
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:40,200
that it makes sense as a society for us to make the investments today to try to decrease the

1356
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:47,800
probability of those downside scenarios. I don't know what probability it is of those downside

1357
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:53,640
scenarios that are truly catastrophic from an economic standpoint, from a life standpoint,

1358
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:59,880
that change how humans really live, but it's greater than zero. It's less than 100%. It's

1359
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:04,120
somewhere in there, but the downside is so great that society needs to make that investment.

1360
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:10,920
We typically get drawn to the areas where I'd call them orphan areas, where there's not much

1361
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:17,640
focus, especially philanthropic focus. Things like public pension reform, or changing how

1362
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:23,320
elections are conducted, or the pharmaceutical pricing, or surprise billing. Things where the

1363
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:30,120
day we enter it, we probably have committed the most money of any other philanthropic actor in

1364
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:37,240
the system already. What strikes me about the climate field is that there are remarkable people,

1365
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:44,280
these brilliant people who are working on this today, who are very thoughtful philanthropists

1366
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:52,120
who are working on this today, who oftentimes either make their single issue or one of two

1367
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:58,360
or three issues that they'll be working on. I always think about what's our additionality

1368
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:04,840
into the problem. One of them is that I think because we work with both the left and the right,

1369
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:10,920
and we're not a political organization, and many of those who are both the researchers, the advocates,

1370
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:17,000
the funders in the climate space, do come from the left. I think we can try to support those

1371
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,520
efforts, those organizations and politicians that are on the right who want to start taking

1372
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:30,760
the steps, because this has to be a bipartisan effort to solve. It's hard to imagine today

1373
02:16:31,560 --> 02:16:39,080
how that happens, but the Republican Party is moving slowly, very slowly, but you start to see

1374
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:44,120
some people with real credibility within the Republican Party, and there are thought highly of,

1375
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:49,880
start to think about there's an acknowledgement that there's a problem. There is dispute about

1376
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:57,320
what level of investment is merited to deal with it, and I think that Democrats don't help

1377
02:16:57,320 --> 02:17:03,000
Republicans get there. When you put the whole Democratic platform into a climate change bill,

1378
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:11,320
I don't think it helps Republicans talk about the issue and be a productive partner, and I think

1379
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:16,920
it's going to have to be, again, it has to be bipartisan for it to be sustainable. Perhaps

1380
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:22,440
Democrats win the White House, to perhaps Democrats win the Senate for 2021, they might

1381
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:27,960
take down the filibuster, but what happens when that changes, and do those rules and laws

1382
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:32,680
stay enacted, or do they get repealed? That's why I think all these things that we work on

1383
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:39,080
need to be done in a bipartisan way, including the pharma. We got a bill passed through Senate

1384
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:43,720
Finance Committee, Republicans, Democrats come together, get this close, and we just can't get

1385
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:52,280
it onto the floor. That's where we are. John, your kids are, I'm guessing, they probably don't,

1386
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:58,840
even your oldest probably doesn't remember you being a traitor. Your kids are going to grow up,

1387
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:04,600
and they're going to think of mom and dad's job as philanthropy. What's the impact that that has

1388
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:12,840
on them? I suspect it's pretty profound. They see how seriously their parents think about this stuff.

1389
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:17,160
Do they come to you with questions about the work that you have? Do they have their own interests?

1390
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:23,160
They're obviously not that young anymore, and they're obviously very smart kids. They must be

1391
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:26,200
thinking about, hey, mom and dad, why aren't you guys working on this problem? Or what do you think

1392
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:32,040
about this problem? How does your curiosity for the world trickle down to them, and how deliberate

1393
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:38,360
a part of raising your kids is that? They certainly understand high principles about

1394
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:41,560
what we do. We're philanthropists. They know what that means. They know that we give money,

1395
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:46,120
trying to make the world a better place. But we do have those conversations when we walk past

1396
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:53,480
a homeless individual who's asking for a dollar. My daughter says, we need to give them a dollar.

1397
02:18:54,280 --> 02:19:00,680
Having those conversations about, do we give this dollar here, or do we give it to someone trying,

1398
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:06,040
in a more philanthropic or more strategic way to try to get to the root of the problem?

1399
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:10,440
Do we give the dollar here, or do we give it to the food bank down the street that hopefully he

1400
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:13,880
can go to and get the same meal that we would want him to get, or something like that?

1401
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:20,920
Right. It ends up being both. I think you need to teach kids about humanity, about

1402
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:28,760
the love of the individual. We can't say no every time, but also have to teach them about,

1403
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:35,160
you're not going to give all the money away, dollar by dollar, to somebody on the street.

1404
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:41,000
You've thought a lot about, what's the kid's role in this going forward? Laura and I are very much

1405
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:49,000
on the same page here. We don't want their lives to be defined by their parents. We don't want them

1406
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:53,080
working at the foundation. We don't want them, at least when they're in their 20s,

1407
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:58,680
and probably in their 30s, to be working at the foundation if it's still open. We want them

1408
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:05,080
to go have their own life experiences, create their own life. Then after they've done that,

1409
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:11,640
if they want to come join the work here, that's great. It's really important that they're not

1410
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:18,760
part of the foundation at a young age, because there's a downside. Whenever you have that

1411
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:23,720
checkbook, people look at you differently and treat you differently. Your jokes are funnier,

1412
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:31,880
and people have a sense of their own best behavior around you, because there's always

1413
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:37,560
something that they want funded, or that they're involved in, and are going to come with an ask at

1414
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:44,520
some point. We minimize this largely because of the types of things we fund, and we've made it

1415
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:51,000
very clear about what we do fund. But if somebody's growing up in their teens and their 20s, and is

1416
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:56,680
looked at by the rest of the world as a checkbook first, I think that's a very damaging way to grow

1417
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:03,400
up. It's not reality. The 20s is the time when you need to be kissing somebody else's butt.

1418
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:08,440
You need to be going to get the lunches for everybody else, not vice versa. You need to be

1419
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:14,600
trying to climb up to the organization, not be gifted the checkbook on day one.

1420
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:22,040
So what advice would you give to people who were where you were 25 years ago, which is,

1421
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:27,960
they're going to be writing three-figure checks, or maybe a four-figure or a five-figure check,

1422
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:31,400
to an organization. They're not going to be able to set up their own foundation.

1423
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:36,760
They have the same tug that you have, which is, hey, whatever stage of my life I'm at,

1424
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:42,280
whatever my means are at, I know that giving away some of my money makes the world a better place.

1425
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:45,160
I just want to make sure I do it as intelligently as possible.

1426
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:52,600
Yeah. In many ways, what we're doing is not remarkable. So many people in this world,

1427
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:58,760
especially in the United States, are very generous with time, with resources relative to what they

1428
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:03,160
have, relative to the time that they have, relative to the money that they have. So it can just be done

1429
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:07,640
at a different scale, but I think there are some people who are much more altruistic than we are.

1430
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:12,120
There's people who give away 10% of their money when they're making $100,000 or $50,000

1431
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:17,960
that changes their quality of life. There's a sacrifice, a trade-off by doing that, and they

1432
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:23,560
still do it. And there's a small movement called Further Pledge where you pledge to give everything

1433
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:30,840
above a relatively small salary, like $30,000 or maybe up to $50,000 to charity, and knowing that

1434
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:37,560
that dollar you're giving is creating more total good than you spending it. And that's huge. And I

1435
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:44,280
think we as a society benefit when our community around us is stronger. And that's why people do

1436
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:50,040
it. Whenever we have the needs of our family, whenever our family is secure, then I think it's

1437
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:56,600
natural, it's human nature to start thinking about your community and however you define your

1438
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:03,240
community, whether it's your group of friends, your city, your country, might be shared experiences,

1439
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:08,920
but everybody kind of goes through that process of defining his or her own community and then

1440
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:15,400
uses the resources of time and money to try to help that community to the best extent they have.

1441
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:19,080
There's no right answer in how you define your community. There's no right answer as to

1442
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:24,680
how you improve your community. But it is remarkable just this culture of giving and

1443
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:29,240
philanthropy that exists in this nation. I think largely because we are a wealthy nation, right?

1444
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:35,720
Where more people are more secure here, people have more likely to have the needs of their family

1445
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:42,200
set aside or in line of sight. And so they're able to do these things. And that's one of the

1446
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:46,120
reasons that make this country so great. I don't know if I answered your question.

1447
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:50,360
No, you really did actually. I mean, certainly what I took away from that was you pointed out

1448
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:53,800
something that I think doesn't get enough appreciation, which is you're absolutely right.

1449
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:59,000
For you to give away $400 million a year is less, I mean, I'm not minimizing that at all,

1450
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,640
but you're right. It's less of a sacrifice than someone who makes $50,000 a year giving away

1451
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:09,400
$5,000. The incremental $5,000 is when making $50,000 is staggering if you're trying to raise

1452
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:14,840
a family or do anything else. And the other thing I took away was this idea of giving locally. I

1453
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:21,080
think the way you define locally is very important. It doesn't mean necessarily if I live in this city,

1454
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:25,960
I only give to this city, I can broaden my definition of local. Local could mean I'm a

1455
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:33,160
veteran and therefore my giving back to veterans affairs or other vets is what I define my community

1456
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:36,360
as. I think that's an elegant way to think about it. I think the other thing that comes with that

1457
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:41,480
is frankly, giving to your community means you can probably make a more informed gift. You have a

1458
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:46,760
better sense of potentially what the needs are of your own community. Absolutely. John, I'm going to

1459
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:50,760
be honest with you, man, we've been talking here for like over two and a half hours. I took a bunch

1460
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:55,480
of notes before we spoke. We haven't got through half what I want to talk about, but I also can't

1461
02:24:55,480 --> 02:25:01,080
keep one of the world's busiest philanthropists wasting any more of his time talking with me. So

1462
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:06,280
I'm going to honor my commitment to you to keep this relatively short, not make it a seven hour

1463
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:11,080
discussion. I'm going to let you go. We might have to do a part two at some point, but I want to thank

1464
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:16,360
you very much for first and foremost, just set aside the time today, but more importantly, just for

1465
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:21,320
the work that you do. I know personally how seriously you take this work and the world is

1466
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:27,480
definitely a better place for having the best natural gas trader of all time, no longer trading

1467
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:33,560
natural gas. Thank you. It's been a fun experience. Looking forward to part two. All right. Thanks, John.

1468
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:39,160
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1469
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:43,560
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1470
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:49,000
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1471
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,280
back much more than the price of this subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

1472
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:59,880
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1473
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:05,000
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

1474
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:10,360
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1475
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:16,120
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1476
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:21,480
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less

1477
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:25,800
than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

1478
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:30,920
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1479
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:34,840
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1480
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:40,840
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,
