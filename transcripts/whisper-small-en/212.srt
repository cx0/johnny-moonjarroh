00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,060
Hey, Stefan, thanks so much for making time. I've been looking forward to this for such

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,920
a long time, probably since I started a podcast, which has been now we're coming up on four

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,760
years. I always knew we'd have to sit down. So I'm glad we're finally doing this, albeit

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,080
not in person, but that's more an artifact of my laziness. So anyway, again, look, I

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,840
think a lot of people listening to this will be familiar with you and your work, but I

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,080
think a number of people won't be. So let's tell people a little bit about kind of your

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,840
path to where you are now, which is sort of being one of the most thoughtful people on

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,760
the nuances of obesity. What did you study in college? Were you a neuroscience major?

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,480
Biochem. Yeah. But I had a neuroscience in mind when I was doing biochem. My idea at

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,560
the time is that it would provide a foundation for going into neuroscience later, which

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not sure that reasoning really works out so well, but it worked out OK in the end.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,760
And did you go straight from your undergrad to Mike Schwartz's lab or did you do your

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,880
PhD with Mike Schwartz or a postdoc? Postdoc. OK. Yeah. Where did you do your PhD? PhD was

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,440
with Alice Bada at the University of Washington studying neurodegenerative disease. Interesting.

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,320
So tell me about that. Was that a detour that was always part of the plan or at that

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,080
point were you not yet fully interested in obesity? Yeah, I think more the latter. So

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,720
I've always been fascinated by the brain, but I didn't know which area of neuroscience

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,600
I wanted to get into for a long time. And I became interested in neurodegenerative disease

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,200
for a few different reasons. One, they're just absolutely horrible diseases. And two,

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:05,840
my grandmother had Alzheimer's disease. And the but so in in grad school, I was studying

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,440
neurodegenerative disease, but I wasn't studying Alzheimer's disease. I was studying a class

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,600
of neurodegenerative diseases called triplet repeat diseases. That includes Huntington's

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,480
disease or polyglutamine repeat diseases would be another name for them. So Huntington's disease

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,400
is the most common. That's the most common heritable heritable neurodegenerative disease.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,400
But as you said, it's an absolutely awful disease with I mean, almost 100 percent penetrance,

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,880
correct? I mean, it's a deterministic gene. Well, it's actually more complex and interesting

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,760
than that. It's actually the genetics of it are real interesting because they are non

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Mendelian because the length of the CAG repeat actually changes intergenerationally. The

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,200
weird thing about it is there's there's these CAG repeats that code for polyglutamines,

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,560
polyglutamine stretches in the protein, they are unstable in replication. And so what you

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,680
tend to see is an enlargement of these polyglutamine repeats from one generation to the next. And

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,120
so yeah, so it has this really weird non Mendelian pattern. I think I think okay, you asked specifically

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,600
about penetrance. I think the penetrance actually is pretty high. So in other words, if you

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,000
have a polyglutamine repeat in the wrong protein of a certain length, yes, I think very high

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,760
likelihood you're gonna you're gonna develop the disease. But like anything, it is not, you know,

37
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,960
100% fixed. But I don't think we really understand what makes it not fixed. But I was I was studying

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,680
a one of the less common ones called SCA seven, Spinocerebellar ataxia type seven. And, you know,

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,000
it's an interesting disease. It's a neurodegenerative disease with some relevance to other more common

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,640
neurodegenerative disease. But I used to joke that there were probably more scientists studying it

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,000
than people with the actual disorder. I don't think that's actually true. But I think you get the

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:28,720
the point of the joke. And I just kind of wanted to study something with greater impact. And I also

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,760
I've always been interested in fitness and nutrition, kind of on a personal level. And so

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,000
when I started learning about the neuroscience of obesity, during my PhD work, I got really into it

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,520
because that was a way to kind of satisfy my criteria for something that's impactful. It's hard

46
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,600
to imagine much that's more impactful than that in the world we live in. It's very common.

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:11,280
It is it relates to my interest in fitness and health, and it has a strong relationship with

48
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,240
neuroscience. And so once once I figured that out, which I think to a lot of people is not obvious,

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,280
the relationship with neuroscience, I think that's a topic we'll get into. But once I figured that out,

50
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,120
I started realizing that not only was this really fascinating, but there was a ton of information in

51
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
the space that was incredibly enlightening that was not making it to the public.

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
What year did you finish your PhD?

53
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
2009, I think.

54
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,040
Okay. And did and Mike Schwartz was also at the University of Washington, correct?

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Correct. Yeah.

56
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,400
So at what point as you were wrapping up your PhD, did you connect with Mike and or at least

57
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
become familiar enough with his work that you thought, you know, this is kind of my finishing

58
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:05,200
school? Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't remember exactly what all the options were that I was

59
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,600
considering, but I was particularly interested in obesity and staying at the same institution after

60
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,360
your PhD is atypical. It's something that I wanted to do in part for personal reasons.

61
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,560
I don't I'm not really a big fan of the typical academic thing of it's almost like a military

62
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
life. You know, you're moving around like five or more times before you you finally settle down.

63
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,440
So that was part of it. But Mike was also a really good fit. And there are other labs that could have

64
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,200
been a good fit in other places. But Mike's lab was a really good fit and he was willing. So I

65
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,880
I did that. And God, I think that I feel like the first time you and I met would have been

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,240
probably at a conference in 2012. And I'm guessing you had had you just finished by then?

67
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,400
Had you just finished your postdoc? Were you wrapping it up then? That would have been close

68
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,760
to the end of it. Yeah, I was I think I was a postdoc until 2013. So would have been approaching

69
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,240
the end of it. Wow, it's hard to believe that's 10 years ago. I still remember all that stuff

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,200
pretty well. So so let's let's tell people a little bit about the problem that you work on today.

71
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I think everybody knows directionally that obesity is a significant issue. But you can probably

72
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,120
quantify this for people a little bit better and help people understand maybe even over a few

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,120
thousand years how things have changed in terms of the let's just talk about the phenotype. We're

74
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,040
going to obviously talk about the environment and the triggers. But let's just talk phenotypically.

75
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,760
How have we as a species who we've been around what, maybe six million years in our current

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,040
rendition? But what's changed over the last thousand thousand years in terms of our phenotype?

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Yeah, so if we're talking if we're comparing the body shape of people in modern affluent

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,680
societies like the United States to what the typical human would have looked like a thousand

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,200
years ago, I think it's clear that we're much fatter today on average with a much higher

80
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,640
percentage of obesity. And a thousand years ago, there was obesity. I mean, we have evidence even

81
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,160
from Egyptian mummies that among the wealthy, there was obesity, not to say that it necessarily

82
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,200
was super common, but I don't think it was that uncommon. Among the wealthy, I think probably for

83
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,960
similar reasons that we have obesity today. But certainly the prevalence was much lower. And when

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,960
we start to get into the more modern historical period where we start to actually get data on this,

85
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,240
the first data that we can find on this in the United States, or at least that I have found that

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:10,080
is somewhat informative, are from Civil War veterans from 1890 and 1900. They did height and

87
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,920
weight measurements on middle-aged Civil War veterans. So these people were, I think almost

88
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:24,560
exclusively white men. However, if you compare to the same demographic, so middle-aged white men

89
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:33,680
today, you see that there was almost no obesity back then. And today the obesity rate is something

90
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,520
like probably 45% for that same demographic. And just to be clear, we're defining obesity

91
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,960
in the most traditional way, which is the use of body mass index. And we're defining it as a BMI

92
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,000
of more than 30, correct? Yeah, correct. And so, yeah, so the advantage of BMI is it's really easy

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,480
to measure and you can calculate it from these really simple measures that go back a long time.

94
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Unfortunately, they didn't have decks of machines. Yeah, exactly. 1890, which would have been, of

95
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,400
course, a more informative way of looking at it. But yeah, using measures that we can compare over

96
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,160
long periods of time, like body mass index, I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was like

97
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:26,160
a few percent. It was like low single digits of people actually classified as BMI over 30

98
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:39,120
at that time, 120, 130 years ago. And then if we look toward more recent data, what we see is that

99
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,200
between... So the first really good data we have starts in the 1960s for the United States. That's

100
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:55,280
when the NHES surveys started, which later became NHANES. And in those surveys, what you see is by

101
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:03,920
the time they started measuring it, it had already gone up from that previous time in the late 1800s,

102
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,720
early 1900s. So you're saying, Stefan, that there really wasn't a lot of longitudinal data from 1900

103
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,720
to 1960 to check what that trend line was doing. It was this big effort in 1900, and then another

104
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,880
big effort didn't take place till about 1960? Yeah. I don't know that I'd call it a big effort,

105
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:34,640
but the biggest that I'm aware of in the one in the late 1800s, early 1900s. And then the true

106
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,280
representative national sampling started in the 1960s and then got better through the 70s. And

107
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,240
now we have this NHANES survey methodology that is the best source of evidence that we have.

108
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,160
And so it started getting good in the 60s. And what were those levels there, Stefan, in the 1960s?

109
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah, I think the earliest measures we have are something like, I don't remember the exact figure,

110
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,720
but it's like 12% of US adults had obesity at that time, something like that in the earliest

111
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,400
measures. And do you have a sense of, because I'm sure this is going to become more relevant today,

112
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,800
is looking at what is the term that's used if BMI is over 35? Isn't there an extreme category

113
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,520
of obesity? Yeah. Or morbid obesity? Is that defined as 35 or 40? Yeah, I think the terminology

114
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:36,480
has changed to try to avoid stigma. It has been extreme obesity or morbid obesity. I can't remember

115
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:44,080
what the current term is for it. But yeah, there's a category over 35 as well. And presumably,

116
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
there's been a change in that as well. And I wouldn't be surprised if- Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

117
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,720
There's a class system. So class one, class two, class three. So I think that corresponds to 30,

118
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:03,040
35, and 40, if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, you were saying? Yeah. So basically, this progression was

119
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,560
not just at the kind of median level, because I'm sure the median BMI was also moving, the mean BMI

120
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
was also moving, the fraction over 30, and presumably the fraction over whatever that

121
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,160
highest threshold is, be it 35 or 40. Yes. And actually, the most extreme changes happened in

122
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,320
more severe obesity. So you see very, very little, very, very few people had BMIs over 35 in the

123
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:41,280
earliest measures. And then now it's like, it's something like 9% or 10% today, so of adults.

124
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:51,120
So there has been more movement at the extreme end than at the mean. Yes. And

125
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,120
that's what happens when a distribution spreads out, which is what happened. If you look at the

126
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,760
distribution of BMIs, it used to be a lot tighter, and it just got less tight. So there are still

127
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,800
people who are lean. There are still people in every BMI category, just like there used to be,

128
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,240
but since it is spread out, you get a disproportionate increase at extreme values.

129
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,720
What about underweight? What was, if you happen to know, what was the fraction of underweight

130
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,240
in 1900, if we would define that to say BMI below, I don't know what underweight is, is it below 18

131
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,920
or below 20? And then how has that changed over time? Yeah, typically the cutoff is 18.5. And I

132
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,600
don't know the answer to your question. I think it was higher than it is today, but I'm not sure

133
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,880
about that. When did people first make the connection that there is an association between

134
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,440
obesity and adverse health outcomes? I mean, presumably back when you think back to a thousand

135
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,120
years ago, or back with the Egyptian aristocrats, obesity probably would have been a sign of

136
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,280
affluence. And I don't think anybody would have looked down upon it too negatively. Back in

137
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,400
medical school, I remember learning about gout and how gout emerged around this time. And it was

138
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,040
really this disease of excess, right? Alcohol excess, sugar excess protein would manifest itself in

139
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,640
gout. And this was the ultimate rich man's disease, basically a sign of affluence. So I can't

140
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,600
imagine people were too upset to be obese back then. And of course, today we take it for granted,

141
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,000
right? I mean, I think there's, despite some of the political pressure to understandably try to

142
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,720
destigmatize obesity and somehow now suggest that it's completely unhealthy, I think the reality of

143
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,720
it is it's pretty unambiguous that obesity is indeed associated with poor health outcomes.

144
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,280
When did that become clear? Yeah, that's a good question. So I'm not real knowledgeable about the

145
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,000
deep history of this. But I know I've heard that, you know, there were physicians in ancient Greece

146
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,520
and India who recognized that being very heavy was associated with health problems such as

147
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,880
having sweet tasting urine, for example, sign of type 2 diabetes or any kind of diabetes.

148
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,640
And but I think, yeah, and then there were these insurance life tables in the early 1900s that

149
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:43,760
suggested that people who had obesity had shortened lifespans and greater risk of certain diseases.

150
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,520
But it actually became pretty controversial with a series of studies that was published.

151
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,720
Catherine Flegel was intimately involved in this work, suggesting that there was actually not the

152
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,160
relationship people thought there was between body mass index and mortality. So these studies,

153
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,160
which were this was labeled as the obesity paradox, because what they found is that there

154
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,360
wasn't really much of an association between obesity and poor health outcomes. And often,

155
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,040
if you look at the relationship between BMI and mortality, if you just look at a graph of it,

156
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,960
the nadir, the lowest point on that graph was in the overweight range, or sometimes even on the

157
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,080
low end of the obese range, depending on what the study was. And they were finding this in

158
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
meta-analyses of millions and millions of people. And so suddenly people were saying, well,

159
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,680
maybe higher body fatness is not bad. Maybe it's actually protective. So there's been this big

160
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,080
debate about it. I think what has emerged in recent years, especially the last 10 or 15 years,

161
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,560
and by the way, let me take a step back. The reason this is called the paradox is because

162
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,680
there's all this evidence that excess body fat contributes to all kinds of diseases,

163
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,560
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers. And so how could it be protective

164
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,720
for mortality when it's driving all these diseases that are the leading causes of mortality? So

165
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,640
that's why it's called a paradox. And I think the research that has come out since then is suggesting

166
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:36,800
that it's probably not a paradox as paradoxes often are not, and that it's an artifact of those

167
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,400
observational data. That essentially, there are probably a few different things going on, but

168
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:53,760
the biggest one is that people who are sick often lose weight. So there are many different health

169
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,040
conditions that can cause a person to lose weight. So type 2 diabetes, if it's not well

170
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,200
controlled, you can be losing weight. Certainly renal failure, COPD, things like that. Yeah,

171
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,280
those are great examples. Alzheimer's disease, cognitive decline, those things can cause a person

172
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,600
to lose weight. And so there are many health conditions that can cause a person to lose weight.

173
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:27,120
And essentially, the concern was that that makes leanness look worse than it really is,

174
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,280
because you're getting all these people in the lean category that are lean because they're sick.

175
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,360
They're not sick because they're lean. So some people have called that reverse causation.

176
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,720
David Allison corrected me, it's technically confounding.

177
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,120
That's right. Yeah, you and David and I had an Icy Mill exchange because we did discuss this.

178
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll share with you a very glib example. I had shoulder surgery less than three weeks ago.

179
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,760
So in, I don't know, in the 18 days since I've had my shoulder operated on, I've lost nine pounds.

180
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Now, I don't know what my BMI was before versus after. I probably went from BMI of 26 to BMI of

181
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,800
24. So on paper, that looks good. I would argue there is nothing about me today that is superior

182
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,680
in health to where I was 18 days ago. Right. Of those nine pounds I've lost, I'd be willing to bet

183
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,080
seven of it is lean body mass. So again, it's a silly example, but it illustrates that one can see

184
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,960
an improvement in BMI with probably a deterioration in body composition and an increase in morbidity.

185
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,960
Absolutely. BMI is a crude measure, you know, no doubt about it. It's useful. I mean, yeah,

186
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,440
you talked about this with David Allison in your episode, and I think you guys had a nice

187
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
conversation. But Cliff's notes is, you know, it's useful for a population level study as it can be

188
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,560
useful for screening, but it's a crude measure. Yeah, so, you know, how do you get around this

189
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,200
issue of confounding or reverse causality? There are some methods that have been developed

190
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:17,760
for this. One of them that I particularly like was developed by Andrew Stokes and his colleagues,

191
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:26,080
and that is the maximum attained weight method. So instead of using the exposure variable,

192
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,480
instead of looking for BMI right now and seeing that how that correlates with mortality risk

193
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,800
right now, you say, what's the heaviest you've ever been? And how does that correlate with your

194
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,240
health outcomes? And what you see when you do that, so essentially that's saying like, you know,

195
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,360
whatever health condition you've developed that might have caused you to lose weight,

196
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,080
we're kind of screening that out. We're looking before that. And when you look at it that way,

197
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,840
you get a sharpening of the association between BMI and mortality, and you find that the nadir,

198
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,840
the lowest point shifts to a lower BMI. So essentially, whereas before it looked like maybe

199
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,200
overweight was the best, now you see that in the lean range looks the best and there's a stronger

200
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,360
difference, a larger difference between being lean and having obesity in terms of mortality. So it

201
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,200
really sharpens things up. And the reason that happens is because when he looked into this,

202
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,120
you're excluding a bunch of people who were formerly in the obese or overweight category

203
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,760
and went into a lower category. And those people, if you look at their health outcomes,

204
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:47,600
they're terrible. So those people who used to have obesity, and now just are overweight or are lean,

205
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,480
those people have massively elevated rates of chronic disease and of mortality. And so they're

206
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,200
essentially bringing all this excess mortality into lower weight categories.

207
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,000
And why is that seven? Because that almost sounds like the worst news you could ever hear,

208
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,720
right? It suggests that if your BMI is 33, all hope is lost, that your fate was sealed the moment

209
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,360
you hit that BMI. You know what? Just dig in and eat more hagandas because if you bring that BMI

210
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,800
down to 26, you don't assume the health of the 26, you bring the health of the 33, which that

211
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,360
doesn't sound right either, right? No, it's not right. And this is another limitation of the

212
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,040
observational data because these people, so it's hard to lose weight, right? And so most of these

213
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,480
people, it's hard to lose a lot of weight. It's hard to change. And it's hard to keep it off.

214
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,280
Yeah, it's hard to go from 35 to 25 BMI. That's a lot of weight loss. Most people, frankly,

215
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,720
are not able to achieve that and maintain it. And so through voluntary means. And so these

216
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,720
people who are losing weight, it's predominantly unintentional weight loss. This is not people who

217
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,280
start a diet and lifestyle plan and lose a bunch of weight. This is predominantly people who are

218
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,600
losing weight unintentionally. And as a doctor, I'm sure you know this, when a person starts losing

219
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,640
a bunch of weight for no reason, that's probably not a good sign, right? Even if they start off

220
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,960
overweight and they're lean, maybe they even look good. That's probably going to start ringing

221
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:37,040
alarm bells. So if you look at studies that have measured the impact of intentional weight loss

222
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,480
on mortality, this has been done both for diet and lifestyle weight loss,

223
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,440
randomized controlled trials. So, you know, we're talking about good quality of evidence. And also

224
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,680
for bariatric surgery, you see a reduction in all cause mortality. That's what I was going to ask

225
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,640
you. I was going to say, how does bariatric surgery end pretty soon? I'm very, be very curious. How

226
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,440
does some of the gluteus effect this? It's too soon to say. But when we start to look at what I think

227
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,720
is the most impressive weight loss drug out there, and then of course, when you think about ruin Y

228
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,000
gastric bypass, which has been around for a while, it'll be interesting over time to see if that can

229
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,080
flip that paradigm. Well, we have data for type two diabetes for people with type two diabetes for

230
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,800
somaglotide, and it does reduce all cause mortality in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.

231
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,760
So it will be interesting to see whether that extends to people without type two diabetes.

232
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,840
Obviously, people with diabetes are probably going to benefit the most from that kind of drug class

233
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,240
in terms of the physiology of it. But I think there are promising signals

234
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,200
that at the very least is probably not going to kill you.

235
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,160
We go from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s. When does it really, from an epidemiologic standpoint,

236
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,320
just completely take off in terms of, you know, because even if I remember what you said a moment

237
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,640
ago back in the 60s, we might have been at 12 percent obese. And I mean, today it's hard to

238
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:16,240
imagine such a low figure given 40 to 45 percent today. Yeah, 43 is the latest.

239
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,480
That's simply unbelievable. Not that I don't believe it, it's just hard to fathom that nearly

240
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:31,200
half of the U.S. adult population could have a BMI above 30. When did it really hit its stride?

241
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,480
Yeah, so this is an interesting question. So probably a lot of people listening will have

242
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,360
seen graphs of NHANES data where it kind of spikes around 1980. But the interesting thing about that

243
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,760
is that point around 1980 is actually the average date of that survey. But it was actually a

244
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:03,360
multi-year survey. It was a survey that started, I believe, in 76 and ended in like 84, something

245
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,720
like that. I don't remember the exact years, but it was a range. That's how the NHANES used to be.

246
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,480
Today, the range is much narrower, but at the time it was a broader range. And so what we're

247
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,440
seeing is, you know, we can turn that into a point and put it on a graph, but really it represents a

248
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,280
range of years. So we don't know exactly when it happened, but if you look at the average value

249
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:33,760
for that, I think 1978 is the average value for that survey, the average year. But we don't know

250
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,240
exactly where in there it started to turn up. And we don't really know how sharp it was because we

251
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,760
don't have that resolution. It looks real sharp on the graph. Again, when you make it a single

252
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,400
point, it looks sharp, but we don't really know exactly how sharp it is. And so anyway, I'm kind

253
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,680
of putting a lot of nuance into this, but to answer your question. Well, it is actually an important

254
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,360
point because I know that many people, I've probably been guilty of this myself 10 years ago,

255
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,240
would also look at changes in macronutrient composition that occurred around the same time

256
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,480
and say, boy, it's hard to uncouple those. But in reality, if they occurred over a different

257
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,920
time scale, it might make that correlation a little less robust. I mean, I would say that we have more,

258
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,520
we have a sharper focus on the changes in dietary intake because we have annual data from

259
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,200
the Economic Research Service, USDA Economic Research Service. The data on BMI are less sharp.

260
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:49,200
So I would say that those two changes are absolutely compatible and just on a logic level,

261
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm sure they're related. You see big changes happening around the same time in the diet.

262
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,120
So yeah, anyway, to give a kind of simpler, hopefully more satisfying answer, sometime

263
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,840
around between the late 70s and the early 80s, we see an uptick, an apparent uptick in the

264
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:15,280
obesity rate. So the rate starts to increase, goes up and up and up. And then there's a couple of

265
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,520
places where it slightly goes down for a year or two and then it keeps going up. Yeah, it's,

266
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,160
it looked like it was going to plateau or maybe start going back down. But really in recent years,

267
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:34,800
it's really just been skyrocketing. So yeah, so essentially from somewhere in the late 70s

268
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:45,040
to early 80s to now, we went from something like 15% of obesity to 43% of US adults. And I want to

269
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,560
point out something else too that I think is relevant. One way I like to think about this is

270
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,920
the lifetime risk. So that's just the population prevalence. That includes people who are 20 years

271
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,480
old. Yeah, that includes people who may be growing into it. Exactly. Yeah. If you look at the lifetime

272
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,360
risk, I don't know what the exact figure is, but I think it's well over 50%. So I think more than

273
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:18,080
half of US adults will be classified as actually having obesity at some point in their life if the

274
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,080
current context is maintained. And you see the same thing for type 2 diabetes that the prevalence

275
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,840
is like the prevalence of all diabetes is something like 10 or 12%. But if you look at

276
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
the lifetime risk, it's like double that. Or maybe even more. I can't remember what the exact figure

277
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,680
is, but it's like mind blowing. The number of people who will at some point in their life

278
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:47,120
develop type 2 diabetes in the US. Yeah. I mean, if you take a 50 year

279
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:56,720
look at the change in type 2 diabetes prevalence, so the snapshot, I believe it's a five fold

280
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,160
difference in risk over 50 years, the past 50 years. So you go back 50 years ago and look today,

281
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,640
just the prevalence delta is 5x. I can believe that. So you have to then look at what does that

282
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,440
rate of change tell you about lifetime prevalence? What does it tell you about a person who is only

283
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:21,040
five years old today or a person who's 15 years old today? Yeah, I haven't done the math, but I

284
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,480
would completely agree that their lifetime risk is probably at least one in five of having type 2

285
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,880
diabetes. Yeah, absolutely. And this has been quantified. I tweeted out a paper about this

286
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,840
a while back. And unfortunately, I don't remember the top line figure, but there are actual data on

287
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:46,720
this. So what about the rest of the world, Stefan? Where are they in relation to us? I mean, we

288
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,760
probably led the way along with a handful of other developed nations. But one of the things that

289
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,000
seems to have changed is this is no longer a condition of affluence, correct? Well, it

290
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,760
at the individual level. I think that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it really started to be

291
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,880
pedantic, but it really hinges on how we define the term affluent. Because if you go to the very

292
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,920
poorest people in the world, there still is not a lot of obesity in those places, places that are

293
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,520
really challenged with food security, where the diet is very limited, like subsistence farmers in

294
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,640
sub-Saharan Africa, you're still going to see that there's a low prevalence of obesity in that in

295
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,440
those places. Yeah. So I think what I meant was at the individual level. So if you look at the

296
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,680
United States from the bottom 10 percent of the population economically to the top 10 percent of

297
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,480
the population economically, is there a difference in obesity there? I think bottom 10 to top 10,

298
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,640
you would see a difference if you're looking in turtles. So just bottom third to top top third,

299
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,880
there's very little there's very little difference actually. If you start slicing and

300
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,680
dicing it by sex and race, then you will start to see larger differences emerge. For example,

301
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,280
women who are in the top turtle are leaner than women in the bottom turtle. But there's no

302
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,840
difference for men in terms of income. So you can start to find patterns when you slice and dice.

303
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:32,720
My overall feeling though is that there is no demographic in the United States that has not

304
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,000
gotten a lot fatter over the last few decades, even though I think if you look at certain

305
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,160
demographics, particularly with regard to education, you're going to see gradients emerge. But even

306
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,320
among highly educated people, you're going to see a higher prevalence today than there was 50 years ago.

307
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,520
So let's not bring this up to your work. What did you do when you got to Mike Schwartz's lab? How

308
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:09,040
did you begin your reeducation around neuroscience as it applies to everything that has to do with

309
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,560
obesity? Which let's just talk about this. There's an input side and an output side.

310
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,360
I think we should talk a little bit about, I mean, Rudy was on the podcast,

311
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,040
God's probably been two, three years ago. So maybe it's worth a refresher on the neurobiology

312
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,560
of how the different parts of, for example, the hypothalamus can regulate energy expenditure,

313
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,880
can regulate appetite, and what we can learn under very, very controlled experimental settings

314
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,760
with animals. And then how we can start to think about how that applies to humans with

315
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,760
a primitive brain in a modern world, so to speak. Yeah. So I want to take a little step back before

316
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,760
getting into that and say, answer the question of what does the brain have to do with obesity at all,

317
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,880
just to make sure we're bringing everybody along. Because I think it's not obvious to everyone what

318
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,880
the brain might have to do with obesity. But I think if you start to think about it,

319
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,160
it becomes pretty obvious that the answer is just about everything. And the reason is that,

320
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,120
you know, the most obvious reason is that the brain is the organ that generates behavior.

321
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,320
And so if you think that behavior of any kind relates to body fatness, what we eat, how much we

322
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,480
eat, how we use our bodies, how we sleep, whether we're stressed or not, if we think any of that

323
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,160
relates to body fatness, then we think the brain is playing a role. I think most people would agree

324
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,240
that food intake quantity and quality is pretty important there. And then the second reason is

325
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,880
that the brain actually contains a regulatory system for body fat, for body fatness, I should say,

326
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,280
body fat mass. And it's the only known system in the body that does that. And it's located

327
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,200
primarily in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is like, forget who described

328
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,560
it this way. Maybe it was Herman Ponser. It's like a wad of bubblegum on the bottom of your brain near

329
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,640
where your optic nerves cross. So it's this little tiny part of the brain that specializes in

330
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,640
homeostasis, maintaining the stability of body systems. I was described as a walnut, but maybe

331
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,800
a walnut. Okay. Yeah. So just to give you an example, it's the part of the brain that

332
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,560
regulates body temperature. And there's a thermostat in there and effectively a thermostat

333
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,880
and thermometers. There are thermometers that measure your core temperature. There are

334
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,000
thermometers on your skin that measure future threats to your core temperature. Like if you

335
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,400
jump into a cold lake, your core temperature doesn't instantly drop, but your brain knows

336
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,880
that it will drop because of the temperature sensors in your skin. And so it can respond

337
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:12,000
adaptively. And then that system in the hypothalamus engages a behavioral, a suite of behavioral and

338
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,320
physiological responses to maintain temperature homeostasis. So you'll, on the physiology side,

339
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,600
you get vasoconstriction, you get non-shivering thermogenesis through brown fat, you get shivering.

340
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,480
And then through the behavioral side, you want to get out of the cold water. You want to put a

341
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,920
sweater on, you want to drink some hot tea, you want to adopt a heat conserving posture. And

342
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,160
through this coordinated physiology and behavior, you get incredible regulation of temperature,

343
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,400
of core temperature, I should say. And like plus or minus one degree Fahrenheit,

344
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:59,360
when the exterior temperature could be varying by 50 degrees. And so it's an incredible regulatory

345
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,840
system. And the body fat regulatory system, unfortunately, is not so precise. But I give that

346
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:12,240
as an analogy just to give you a sense of what the hypothalamus specializes in. There's also a

347
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,440
regulatory system for body fatness. And a nice name for that is the lipostat. So lipofat, stat,

348
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:28,240
the same. And really, we've known about it since 1840. Or we've known there was something going on

349
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,120
since 1840 when the Viennese physician Bernard Moore published a case study about a woman who

350
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,200
had extreme obesity, that rapid onset extreme obesity. He did an autopsy after her death,

351
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,080
and she had a tumor in her hypothalamus. And to this day, hypothalamic obesity is a thing that

352
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,400
we have to deal with, with people with tumors or other damage to the hypothalamus.

353
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,600
It often causes extreme obesity. And what's the nature of the obesity?

354
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,680
How much of it is due to hyperphasia, excess eating? How much of it is due to

355
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,200
loss of activity or even just a shutdown of metabolic rate?

356
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah, that's a great question. So if you look at probably the closest experimental analog

357
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,760
of hypothalamic obesity that sort of human-like hypothalamic obesity would be

358
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,440
the MH lesion. So this is something that's been done since I think the 20s. They go in with a

359
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,240
very precise instrument called the stereotaxic instrument in animals. And they lesion this part

360
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,960
of the hypothalamus called the ventromedial hypothalamus. So basically, they're replicating,

361
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,880
they're trying to replicate the damage of hypothalamic obesity. And as soon as the

362
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,240
anesthesia wears off, these animals are cramming food into their faces. And if there's no food in

363
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,200
their cage, they'll eat bedding, they'll eat the bedding, they will just like put anything

364
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,880
they can get a hold of into their bodies. And they will continue binging until they have rapidly

365
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,720
gained a large amount of weight and then it will start to plateau off. But they have extreme

366
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,640
hyperphagia. And if you restrict their calorie, the first experiments that were done on this

367
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,600
showed that if you restrict them to a normal level of calorie intake, so that of a non-lesioned

368
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:40,320
animal, it prevents the fat gain suggesting that the, or I should rephrase that, it prevents the

369
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,080
weight gain. So they were just weighing them at the time, suggesting that it's primarily a phenotype

370
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:55,760
of hyperphagia. However, later experiments that were more precise found that it doesn't completely

371
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,640
eliminate the weight gain. It only eliminates about 80% of it. And so there is a component

372
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:11,200
coming from energy expenditure. So primarily hyperphagia, but there's also an energy

373
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,480
expenditure component that's smaller. Yeah, it's funny. I just remember in medical school,

374
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,520
one of the neurobiology professors saying, if you were asked to give up a piece of your brain,

375
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,360
like the last one you want to give up is a piece of your hypothalamus. If you had to give up like

376
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,640
one cubic centimeter of brain tissue, you just fight like hell to make sure you preserve your

377
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,120
entire hypothalamus. I agree with that. I would say the brainstem and the hypothalamus probably

378
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:48,960
not places you want to lose. Let's go a little bit further in that. You referred to the lipostat. So

379
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,320
say a little bit more about what we've learned about this lipostat and what circulating factors

380
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,840
might play a role in governing this and what's been learned through some of the work that was

381
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:09,520
done using parabiosis. Yeah. So I'm going to give you the simple version. There is a more complex

382
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:22,160
version that is emerging, but I'll start with the simple version, which is that it is a negative

383
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,720
feedback system, similar to your home thermostat, similar to the thermostat in your brain in that

384
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:38,400
there is the hypothalamus measures levels of a circulating hormone called leptin that circulates

385
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,200
in proportion to your body fat mass. So the same way your home thermostat measures the temperature

386
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,320
in your home, your hypothalamus is measuring the level of leptin in your circulation. Still some

387
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,480
controversy about how exactly or where that measuring happens, but the signal gets to the

388
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:03,120
hypothalamus and it uses that to determine whether you essentially have the amount of fat that your

389
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,840
hypothalamus wants you to have. So the same way that your thermostat has a set point and

390
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:17,520
your internal thermostat in your body has a set point, your hypothalamus has a certain idea of how

391
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,200
much fat it wants you to have on your body. And if you deviate from that, it starts to engage a

392
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,800
coordinated series of physiological and behavioral responses to restore the previous level of body

393
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,960
fat. And this system works better at protecting against fat loss than it does against fat gain.

394
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,560
And certainly over long periods of time, we see that the average person in a country like the US

395
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,640
tends to gain fat. The lipostat is not stopping them or at least it's not preventing them.

396
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:59,600
It might be resisting, but it's not stopping the process of weight gain. But we see that it

397
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:07,360
actually is quite vigorous at defending against weight loss. And this is part of the cruelty of

398
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,840
or the unfairness of how obesity works is that your set point or your defended level of body

399
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,640
weight is a controversy about what to call that. But whatever it is, it goes up. And so a person

400
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,480
with obesity, their body defends against weight loss as if they were starving, just like a lean

401
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,520
person losing weight, their body and brain would defend against weight loss. And it's literally a

402
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,480
starvation response. It's the same behavioral and physiological process that ramps up your hunger,

403
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:53,200
that makes you more focused on food cues, greater cravings. It down regulates your energy expenditure.

404
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:03,680
And it does everything it can to try to bring the fat back. And so that is, I think,

405
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,880
a key reason and possibly the primary reason why weight loss is so difficult and so temporary.

406
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,400
There was no regulation happening. Weight loss would probably be pretty easy and weight

407
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,360
maintenance certainly would be very easy. But it's not. You see that people tend to regain

408
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,480
back to their former level unless they're being really well supported in that weight loss. And

409
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,720
even then there's usually some amount of weight gain, weight regain, I should say.

410
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,000
So let's go back to leptin for a moment. So leptin is a hormone. Is it made in the adipocyte?

411
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,160
It is. Yeah, it's made in the adipocyte and secreted in proportion to body fat mass.

412
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,120
So the more adipose tissue you have, the more leptin you have. Is it generally pretty static?

413
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,080
Does it change with meals or exercise or anything like that?

414
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:09,760
Yes, it does. So over the long run, the amount of leptin in the bloodstream is strongly correlated

415
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:19,280
with fat mass. However, it's also strongly impacted by short term energy balance. So if you

416
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,760
let's say cut your calories by 25 percent for a couple of days, you're going to see a drop in

417
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:37,440
leptin that is disproportionate to your amount of fat mass. And so where is the leptin receptor?

418
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,840
Is there a leptin receptor in the periphery or are they central?

419
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,320
There are leptin receptors in many parts of the body, but the ones that are relevant for

420
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,560
body weight regulation are in the brain. Are they in the hypothalamus?

421
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,080
There are there is a high concentration of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Yes.

422
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,200
There are leptin receptors in other parts of the brain, too.

423
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:12,160
However, it's not 100 percent clear where the important ones are for body weight regulation.

424
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,080
Probably somewhere in the hypothalamus, but there are a lot of different papers where they

425
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,480
take mouse models and they knock the leptin receptor out of different cells in the brain.

426
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,960
If you knock them out of GABAergic cells, you get a really big, basically you recapitulate

427
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,720
animals that don't have the leptin receptor at all in terms of their body weight.

428
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,160
GABAergic, that's a major one of the two big neurotransmitters. That's the main inhibitory

429
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,880
neurotransmitter in the brain. And then you can knock it out of certain subtypes, cell subtypes

430
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
in the hypothalamus and get big effects. There was a paper suggesting you can just knock it out of

431
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,760
AGRP neurons and get and recapitulate the obesity phenotype of animals that have no leptin receptor.

432
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:08,800
However, that is controversial. Not every paper has shown that. So I'm not sure what people who

433
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:16,640
are on the cutting edge of this field would say about where that evidence is. But certainly there

434
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,760
are cell populations and probably the most important ones are in the hypothalamus. There

435
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,960
are cells in the brain, probably mostly in the hypothalamus, that are receiving that signal and

436
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:37,120
conveying it to the key cell types that are kind of at the center of this lipostat, which are AGRP

437
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:44,080
neurons. I refer them in my book as MPY neurons just for story line simplicity, but more commonly

438
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:53,280
they're called AGRP neurons and POMC neurons. So the AGRP, those are the hunger neurons, the POMC

439
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,840
or the satiety neurons, or you could think of them as hunger slash body fat increasing neurons.

440
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:08,400
The POMC are the opposite essentially. And so what is leptin resistance and how does it manifest?

441
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:18,720
Why does it manifest and how frequent is it? Leptin resistance. So when leptin was discovered

442
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:29,760
first in 1994 by a team led by Jeff Friedman and Rudy Leibel, they found that this was the gene

443
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:38,080
that was missing in an obese mouse model called the OB-OB mouse. This animal was extremely obese

444
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:46,160
as a result of lacking a defect in the production of this protein. One single amino acid substitution

445
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:55,280
that destroyed this protein and caused, sorry, one single base pair that destroyed this protein

446
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:03,200
and caused the loss of function and this mass of obesity. And when this was discovered and also

447
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,200
discovered that humans have leptin, then it was like this scientific bonanza. It was like, well,

448
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,920
maybe we've discovered the cause of obesity. Maybe people with obesity don't have enough leptin.

449
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,400
And so their brains think they don't have enough body fat when really they do. The failure to

450
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:31,120
perceive the body fat, that's what causes obesity in these OB-OB mice. And so they started measuring

451
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,240
leptin levels and people with obesity and it turns out they were actually elevated. Yeah.

452
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,040
Because it's correlated. We now know it's correlated with fat mass. And so

453
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,440
what's the deal? If this is a hormone that regulates body fatness, why is it that people

454
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,360
with obesity have so much of it and it's not suppressing their excess body fat mass?

455
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:05,440
And the concept that has been invoked to explain this is leptin resistance. So in the same way

456
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,080
that people can develop insulin resistance where it takes more insulin to do the physiological

457
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:21,040
jobs in the body, people with obesity require more leptin for the hypothalamus to be satisfied.

458
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,600
So another way to say that they require more leptin to avert the starvation response

459
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:34,560
that the brain has where alarm bells start going off because it thinks you don't have enough body

460
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:41,520
fat. So they require more leptin to achieve that state. And so we call that leptin resistance,

461
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:48,720
but we don't really know how it works yet. So that's just a general term for requiring more

462
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,880
leptin to avert the starvation response. But we don't know whether that is something where

463
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,000
there's fewer leptin receptors on certain kinds of cell, whether there's a downstream signaling

464
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,240
impairment in, in serocellular signaling cascades, whether there is a change in cell to cell

465
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,720
communication. Maybe the cell that's receiving a leptin is getting the message just fine,

466
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,240
but there's some kind of downstream change in neural processing where the signal gets,

467
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,640
gets clouded or modified. We don't know the answer to that question.

468
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,920
It seems, it seems like the only thing we know is it's not too low an amount of circulating

469
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,760
leptin as evidenced by two things. One, the high circulating levels of leptin and the fact,

470
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,160
I think more importantly, that when you give exogenous leptin, it doesn't improve the condition

471
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,800
suggesting that that's not the defect. Yes. I mean, you can give high levels of leptin and it

472
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:50,080
will cause weight loss, but it doesn't do much. And if you look at leptin signaling,

473
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,320
there's, there were some early studies done in an animal model suggesting that

474
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,880
if you're just looking broad, if you mash up the hypothalamus and you look at what's going on in it

475
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,240
broadly, on average, you find that the amount of leptin response, the intracellular signaling

476
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,480
cascade that's activated by leptin is not really impaired in animals with obesity. It's like,

477
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,360
it's like they're getting the same leptin signal from a much higher level of leptin.

478
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,520
So that, that's kind of like some evidence that we have.

479
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,880
I looked at some twin concordant and discordant studies, identical twin, and I was surprised to

480
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,760
see, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was surprised at how heritable obesity was.

481
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,800
It was about 0.7. And that's, I mean, when you see heritability of 0.7, that tells you something

482
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,600
is very, very genetically predetermined. So even though a hundred years ago, virtually none of us

483
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,960
were obese and today, let's just call it your lifetime incidence of obesity is 50% tells you,

484
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,600
and our genes haven't changed in a hundred years. So clearly our susceptibility for obesity has been

485
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:13,040
with us for a great period of time and it is highly, highly preserved. It's just that in the last,

486
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:20,240
whatever 40, 50 years, we now have matched or mirrored our genes to an environment that is

487
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,000
allowing that trait to flourish. What do we know about the genes that regulate obesity

488
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,320
or fatness? Let's just talk about it through that lens, I suppose.

489
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,720
Yeah, the meta-analysis of twin studies that I like to

490
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,040
cite these days suggests an average heritability of 75%.

491
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Wow, that's really stronger.

492
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,160
It's massive. And there's some debate about that.

493
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,720
But directionally, this is a really big deal.

494
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,040
It's very heritable. Yeah. And a lot of things are very heritable. I think that's one thing

495
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:02,400
we're learning. But yeah, so you have this very high heritability of body mass index.

496
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:12,880
So variation between individuals and body mass index, about 75% of those differences between

497
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:21,760
people is explained by their genetics. That's what that implies. And if we look at other methods that

498
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,760
have tried to figure out what are the genes that underlie this, what are the genetic differences,

499
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,800
these are the genome-wide association studies that I think are particularly informative in

500
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:39,600
this regard. They simply ask the question, if we look at the entire genome, and we look at these

501
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:47,120
representative genetic markers where different people have different genetic code called SNPs,

502
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:53,440
single nucleotide polymorphisms, where in the genome, what markers correlate with differences

503
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,800
in body mass index. Fortunately, body mass index is really easy to measure. So you can get really

504
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,960
big sample sizes in these studies, which you need to get statistically significant results, because

505
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,000
you're looking at, I think, like millions. I don't remember exactly how many, but you're looking at a

506
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,880
lot of genomic markers. So you need tremendous statistical power to detect anything with a high

507
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,080
level of confidence. So you have these studies, I think the latest is like 800,000 people.

508
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,640
The leader of the PAC is the height genome-wide association study. I think they have like

509
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,120
3 million. And now they've saturated the heritability. They've gotten all the information

510
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:40,880
they can with that sample size out of what the common genetic variants are that correlate with

511
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,640
differences in height. So I think with body mass index, we may, in the near future, we may saturate

512
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:54,080
it as well. We may know what are all the common genetic differences that correlate with differences

513
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:04,560
in body mass index. So essentially, so far, these studies have identified, I think, like 900 variants

514
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:11,040
that differ. So what this suggests is that differences in body mass index between individuals

515
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,480
are very complex, that genetically, very complex, are determined by a lot of different genes

516
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:26,640
with very small effect sizes. So you get this sorting of all these different genes, and whatever

517
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,040
combination you get, lucky or unlucky, determines whether you're, to a large degree, determines

518
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:40,240
whether you are susceptible or not susceptible to obesity in a fattening environment, is the way I

519
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:48,240
would put it. And so they have various ways of looking at what these genes are doing, because

520
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,320
that's one way you can use these genome-wide association studies. That's particularly

521
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,040
informative. You could say, what's the underlying biology that makes some people fatter and some

522
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,280
people slimmer? And I want to talk a little bit about why this is such an important approach.

523
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,440
One is that you're looking at people in their regular, everyday context. This is not an

524
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,360
artificial lab scenario. You're just looking at people living their lives and experiencing higher

525
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,400
or lower weight, and you're saying what genes correlate with that. So it's very naturalistic.

526
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,480
Second, it's very replicable. These studies are highly replicable. In other words, if you do

527
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:38,880
three studies of this nature, you're going to tend to get similar results. So the methodology,

528
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,720
it's one of the most rigorous, I would say, in the biological sciences that we have.

529
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,200
And I think that, sorry, I'll let you finish because I was going to add something to that,

530
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,920
but go ahead. And the third one is that it's unusually objective as well. It has a higher

531
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,360
level of built-in objectivity, resistance to bias compared to other types of investigation because

532
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,360
it's not hypothesis driven. You're just looking across the whole genome and seeing what pops up.

533
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,160
You're not saying, I'm going to focus on the connection between X biological process and Y

534
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,720
outcome. You're just saying, I'm interested in Y outcome, what correlates with it, and let's see

535
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,720
what biology pops up. Could be anything. We're just going to see. And so that really gives you

536
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:30,560
a chance to, I think, check your thinking on what the underlying biology is in various traits

537
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:37,120
and diseases. Yeah. And I think part of that comes from the strength of what ultimately makes

538
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:43,520
genetic analysis like Mendelian randomization so powerful is the genes are randomly distributed.

539
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:50,320
So that's what cleans out some of those biases is when you are looking at a million people

540
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:59,040
for whom the genes are randomly spread across them and you take an unbiased view of the sample

541
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,400
and then you get those results over and over and over again. I think it becomes very powerful. And

542
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,280
if people are listening to us saying, God, what are these guys talking about? I mean, I think it's

543
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,440
just important to understand the big picture here. The big picture here is a thousand years ago,

544
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,160
to all intents and purposes, none of us were obese. But that still means directionally,

545
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:30,640
50% of us at least had the genes that would allow us to become obese in an obeseogenic environment.

546
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,360
That's really all that's that's really what we're explaining here is that there are a highly,

547
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,640
highly heritable set of genes that will allow a subset of the population. And actually,

548
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,640
one of the things I'm just curious about your thoughts are teleologically, why is it 50%? Why

549
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:55,760
isn't it 100%? Right? Like, why is it that more people don't have that? Was this just a fluke of

550
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,040
evolution? Was this, you know, you would you would almost think that evolution would have wanted

551
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:08,800
everybody to have those genes. Yeah, absolutely. So I'm gonna I'm gonna finish up the thought we

552
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,320
were on previously, just to wrap that up. But I would like to get back to that.

553
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:21,840
So we have this incredible methodology for looking at, you know, and just to step since you

554
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:26,400
want to step back a little bit, I just want to also add, like, what we're talking about is why,

555
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,560
you know, some people can effortlessly stay thin, and other people have to really struggle to

556
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,000
maintain their weight and maybe are not able to. So that's kind of like the everyday thing that

557
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,320
we're trying to explain here that I think many people recognize intuitively, that that is, you

558
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:50,880
know, a thing that different people have different propensities for becoming obese, for developing

559
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,000
obesity or not. And yeah, so we can look at the underlying biology and that's been done. And there

560
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,520
are a couple of different ways you can do it. One is you can say, what are the genes that are that

561
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,880
seem to be associated with these genomic differences? And where are those expressed?

562
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,320
What tissues are those expressed in? And there was a paper where they looked at, I think 43

563
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:22,800
different traits of all kinds, diseases, personality traits, other stuff. And, and they

564
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:31,280
and they asked what, what does the tissue enrichment look like? And if you look at body mass index,

565
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:40,400
it looks like psychiatric diseases and educational attainment. So all of those are heavily enriched

566
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:49,600
for brain related genes to a similar degree. So conditions that we know are related to the brain,

567
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,880
like educational attainment, how you know how many years of education you've attained,

568
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,880
whether you are susceptible to schizophrenia, depression, Tourette's, like all these brain

569
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,360
related conditions. Obviously, the brain shows up in genome wide association studies for those

570
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:13,440
conditions. And you put those next to body mass index and you couldn't tell them apart. Like that's

571
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,160
how heavily enriched for brain related biology, body mass indexes. And those diseases, by the way,

572
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,360
that you just mentioned are some of the most heritable diseases we see in medicine. I mean,

573
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,760
when you look at autism, when you look at schizophrenia, these have heritability

574
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,560
indexes of point six to point seven. They're, they're, they're highly genetic conditions. So

575
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,800
there's two things going on, right, which is you have these parallel things that are highly,

576
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,560
highly genetic, and then they're disproportionately concentrated in the brain.

577
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:52,320
That's right. And so we know it's, you know, and I don't want to say that it's literally 100% about

578
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:58,160
the brain. I think that's unlikely to be true, but it's certainly the primary signal that emerges

579
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:05,600
across the literature. And, and so I think that really validates this idea of the brain

580
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:12,720
being important for body fatness. And if we look, you know, a little bit deeper at what is going on,

581
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,840
for a lot of it, we don't really know, we don't really know exactly how the brain is doing this,

582
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:23,520
what it is about these genes, but we can see that it correlates with certain types of

583
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:30,640
ways of interacting with food. So people that have obesity promoting genes tend to

584
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:41,360
have greater eating drive, they tend to have lower satiety. And, but this is an area that hasn't

585
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:47,280
really been very well explored yet. So there's a lot we don't know. However, if you look at the

586
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,880
monogenic obesity syndromes, so where there's one mutation that causes severe obesity,

587
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,760
those really revolve around the leptin brain signaling axis. So those mutations tend to be

588
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,760
in leptin, the leptin receptor, melanocortins, melanocortin receptor that are downstream of

589
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,560
leptin in the brain. And those types of signals also show up in the genome wide association

590
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,400
studies, but they're not dominant. A lot of this stuff is really general. It's like stuff that

591
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,320
affects general neuronal development and, you know, neurotransmitters that are involved in a lot of

592
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,360
stuff. So I think there's a long way to go before we really understand exactly how those genes are

593
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:39,120
affecting the brain in a way that impacts body fatness. But I do think we can say that differences

594
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:45,280
in body fatness between individuals are primarily determined by differences in how the brain

595
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,720
is constructed and how it operates. So, Stefan, let's now go back and try to put all of this

596
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,400
in the context we were just ready to get to a moment ago, which is

597
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,040
it's 250,000 years ago. For all intents and purposes, we're the same creatures we are now,

598
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:12,160
obviously, minus the environment that we live in. But food and energy are one of our top priorities.

599
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,920
Like most, I'm guessing, I'm not an anthropologist, but, you know, it would have to seem to me

600
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,800
that security from other tribes and animals and the environment, right, weather,

601
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:34,080
acquisition of energy and reproduction were kind of the only things that would have mattered,

602
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,280
right? There probably wasn't a lot of other stuff that mattered at the time.

603
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:46,720
And acquisition of energy was essential in that it could kill you very quickly if you failed to do

604
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:52,960
that. So acquiring energy, storing energy was like kind of the struggle that defined us,

605
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:58,640
probably in the short term, much more so than reproduction, which obviously is a huge other

606
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:08,240
contributor here. So we evolved over millions of years and everything you said about leptin now

607
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:14,800
starts to make sense in that environment, right? Leptin is a signal that says there's not enough

608
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,400
energy and that's what should really trigger the response. So in that sense, it's not surprising

609
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,880
that leptin isn't doing the opposite. It's not surprising that high leptin doesn't make you want

610
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:33,280
to stop eating. It's who cares? Nature wouldn't have cared about that, but it certainly would care

611
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,480
if leptin gets too low. That should be a screaming signal to go and eat, resist that sign.

612
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:46,560
What do we know about the genetics, the efficiency with which we store energy? I mean,

613
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,560
we haven't really talked about that, but this ability that we have to get fat is kind of a

614
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,880
remarkable thing, right? I mean, we don't really store carbohydrates, can't really store protein,

615
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,000
and we don't want to be breaking down muscle to get amino acids. So we do really have to rely on

616
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,720
this ability to store fatty acids and excess carbohydrates as fatty acids in a relatively

617
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:15,440
inert structure of white adipose tissue. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think Hermann

618
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,640
Ponser would be a great person to talk to about this. Yes, I definitely look, his book is on my

619
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:26,720
list to read and I definitely plan to have him on to get into this. Yeah, he has some good thoughts.

620
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,520
John Speakman has some good thoughts on this as well. Another person I should probably have on

621
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:39,440
the podcast. Yeah, so I think there are good reasons to have a certain amount of body fat,

622
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,880
and I think, you know, some of them, you know, the basic idea is pretty obvious. You want to have

623
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:53,520
a way to cover your energy needs between eating opportunities. And, you know, we have other

624
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,840
energy reserves, we have glycogen, but they're just far more limited. The thing that's awesome

625
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:05,200
about fat is, first of all, it's a very concentrated source of energy, right? Like dietary fat is

626
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:10,240
nine calories per gram, carbohydrate is four, protein is four. Yeah, it's anhydrous, there's

627
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:16,480
no water. It's exactly literally just pure energy. That was the second thing I was going to say is

628
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,640
that it's hydrophobic. And so you can store it without having to hydrate it like you do with

629
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:30,000
glycogen. Glycogen, the weight of glycogen, I think is mostly water. Three or four to one water. Okay,

630
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,520
there we go. And then the weight of adipose tissue, even if you include all the interstitial

631
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:43,760
stuff and all that, I think it's like 85, 90% pure fat. So the energy density is just off the charts,

632
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,280
depending on, you know, relative to any other storage method that the body has.

633
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,600
And so it makes sense that that's kind of our long term energy buffer.

634
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,280
By the way, just for people who think about EVs and stuff like there's no battery that can come

635
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,880
close to the energy density of our fat. Just to put that in perspective, right? Like,

636
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:12,000
or any hydrocarbon for that matter. Yeah. So, and so I think the importance of that is obvious to

637
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,280
have a way to cover times when you don't have as much energy coming in as you would like. And

638
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,800
in the evolutionary context, you know, the thing that comes to mind from our modern perspective is

639
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,040
whether they find food or not, but there's also the question of illness. And I think that's a

640
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:37,440
really important one. So if we look at the primary causes of mortality in children under five

641
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:45,840
in low income settings, what we see is that it's strongly related to their weight for height,

642
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:53,360
which is kind of a different way of measuring BMI. And, and it's also strongly related to disease

643
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:59,840
pressure, especially diseases like diarrhea that interfere with nutrition. And so if you look at

644
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,480
the correlation between weight for height and mortality, there's a massive correlation. So kids

645
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,680
who have malnutrition, moderate or severe malnutrition, that's what we call being under

646
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,720
weight to a certain degree, they have massively increased mortality. Because basically, if you

647
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:24,320
don't have those energy stores, you can't defend yourself against infections. And so it's not just

648
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,880
about energy, you know, there are other nutrients that are important vitamin A and some other things,

649
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:36,640
but energy is huge. And so there's this, because it's such a huge source of mortality, especially

650
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:44,240
in kids, there's this massive selective selective pressure to maintain a certain amount of energy

651
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:50,800
storage in the body. So that would be, you know, just an example of the selective pressure that

652
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,720
would select for a certain amount of body fat. And it is interesting in this regard that humans

653
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:04,560
have a lot more fat than our closest primate relatives. So chimps are like mid single digits

654
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,240
fat, and they don't develop obesity, they cannot physiologically develop human like obesity is my

655
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:21,440
understanding. So we're kind of special physiologically in our capacity for fat storage.

656
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:32,480
Has anyone ever looked at different ancestral populations for this might be just irrelevant to

657
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,920
do because we don't have enough data, where there were different amounts of food scarcity,

658
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,280
and seeing if there's an inverse relationship between the food scarcity that that population

659
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,920
emanated from whether it's this part of Africa versus that part of Europe, and how that translates

660
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:54,960
into the genetic predisposition to obesity in their modern ancestor in their modern kin today?

661
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,440
Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. But you understand the question I'm asking like, yeah,

662
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:07,360
yeah, basically, does the history with starvation select for more even greater obesity today?

663
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:14,960
Yeah, I know that john speakman has argued against this idea, he has pointed out that apparently

664
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:22,480
people with obesity do not survive famines better than lean people, which is kind of counter

665
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,720
intuitive. I'm not sure why that would be. I know that's a point that he's made. Yeah, so anyway,

666
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,760
that's about all I know about it. I don't really know the answer to that question.

667
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:42,640
Okay, so let's start to talk about the hedonic aspect of food. So we have five tastes, right,

668
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:51,280
we can taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Those are the things the five things we taste.

669
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,160
What's the best way to describe umami to somebody?

670
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:04,000
It's a meaty flavor that is present in cooked meat, bone broth, soy sauce.

671
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,960
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I think people kind of get it. It's distinct from salt, I think is an important

672
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:16,800
point here. Yes. Although they often go together. Yeah. And I know different parts of our tongues

673
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,760
have different, you know, we sense for example, sweet on the very front of our tongue, I recall,

674
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,920
but that's, that's about the extent of my knowledge and recollection of where our tongue resides in

675
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,360
that. But what do those, what does the taste that we experience today, you and I, if we go out to a

676
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,720
restaurant, how does that compare to the range of tastes that our ancestors experienced?

677
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:47,520
Yeah, I think, I think this is, this brings up the topic that I like to, I like to talk about,

678
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:54,720
because I think most people, if you look at what hunter-gatherers actually eat, let's say we're

679
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:00,480
looking at contemporary and historical hunter-gatherers where data have been collected and

680
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,520
using that as a proxy for the types of food that our ancestors would have eaten.

681
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:14,800
It is radically different than what we eat today in many ways, but one of them is the hedonic

682
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:21,360
properties of it. Like if you look at what the Hadza eat, you know, if they go out and kill

683
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:28,000
an antelope, they just like cut off pieces of meat and throw it in the fire or put it next to the

684
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,200
fire in coals. They don't have sauces, they're not putting salt on it. And then they just like cut

685
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:39,920
off the charred parts and eat, and sometimes it's like half raw on the inside. They eat rotten meat,

686
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,880
meat that we would consider literally rotten. They will eat. I was just thinking about that the other

687
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,800
day, by the way, because I eat so much wild game that I killed, but I realized like I'm still a

688
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:57,360
baby because like, hey, I cook it, I don't eat it raw. But more importantly, to your point, I

689
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:05,600
season it, right? Like I use salt, I use pepper, I put lemon on it. And I'm sure it would taste

690
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,600
fine without those things. It would certainly be edible. I just don't do it, right?

691
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah, and that's right. And, you know, I'm sure like, yeah, I think if a person,

692
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,400
a typical person were to try to eat at a Hadza camp for like a week, I think it would be really

693
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,960
challenging for them. You know, like even that meat, even meat, as you said, cooked unseasoned,

694
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,880
it's not, doesn't taste bad, wouldn't taste as good. But now imagine like,

695
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,200
the outside is charred, the inside is half raw, you're brushing sand off of it. Like,

696
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,760
that's kind of the context. And then, you know, that's the meat, that's like one of the most

697
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:54,080
palatable things they eat. And then, you know, we have like, probably the most palatable thing,

698
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,640
yeah, probably the most palatable thing, certainly the thing that they really like is honey.

699
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,520
But they're not putting it on toast with butter on it, you know, they're literally

700
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:09,200
drinking straight. They're just taking the honeycomb, eating it and like drinking the honey.

701
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,080
So it's a bit of a different scenario even there. And then we have like, they eat a lot of baobab,

702
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:23,120
that is a very fibrous fruit that has sweetness to it, but it also has some off flavors. It's not a

703
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:31,360
very sweet fruit. It's not like an apple. It's got a lot of fiber. And then there's the tubers,

704
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:37,200
which is another major article of diet. And to be fair, this is their least preferred type of food.

705
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,780
Okay.

706
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:46,880
Yeah, it's, it's, they would rather eat things other than tubers. But they roast these things in

707
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,400
the fire, they dig them up. They're these like long stringy things that look like long sweet potatoes.

708
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:58,080
There are multiple species, but that's one of the common ones. And they're so fibrous

709
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,240
that they actually have to spit out a wad of fiber after they're done chewing it.

710
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,320
So it's like a sugar cane or something where you suck out the nutrient,

711
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,920
but you're spitting out the pure, unsoluble fiber.

712
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,520
Yeah. And so they're not sitting there or sauteing onions on the stove. They're not putting sauces.

713
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,960
They're not spicing. Like they're just taking food out of nature and cooking it and eating it.

714
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:30,960
And so I think it's, it's just a radically different type of diet than we're accustomed to.

715
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:42,400
And I think in this regard, it's interesting to consider how rewards circuits adapt to that.

716
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:51,600
Basically our brains are set up to not be satisfied with ordinary stuff. Once we have

717
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,000
gotten good stuff is a simple way to put it. And Michael Crashes did a really interesting

718
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,640
neuroscience study on this in mice. Mice normally they eat these unrefined food pellets.

719
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:11,040
That would be like the default diet, but they much prefer these calorie dense refined high fat

720
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:17,760
pellets. And if you give that to them, they will very much preferentially eat that over the healthier,

721
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:27,360
unrefined pellets. And what happens is they actually neurobiologically devalue. If you look

722
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:33,280
at the circuits, activity of the rewards circuits, they devalue. Once they've been exposed to the

723
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:38,800
preferred food, they devalue the less preferred food. So it no longer satisfies them, no longer

724
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:46,080
motivates them in the same way that it did before they were exposed to the highly preferred food.

725
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:52,000
And so, you know, to bring this back to our context, if you have somebody like you or I,

726
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:59,680
who's been raised in a context where we have tasty calorie dense, easy to eat food,

727
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:06,480
and that's how we were raised, then going back to eat food more like how our ancestors would eat is

728
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,280
really difficult. Like not twice you've mentioned the calorie density. So let's now talk about that

729
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,840
because that's kind of different from taste, right? So the taste thing is interesting to me.

730
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,600
This is something you and I actually remember speaking about probably one of the first times

731
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:29,360
we met this, like I said, 10 years ago, which was I actually think table sugar is disgusting.

732
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:34,480
Like I truly do. Like if you put a bowl of that white crap in front of me and said, dip your

733
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:40,400
finger in and eat it, like it maybe do it once, but that's about it, right? If you said, just mix

734
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:47,040
it into water and drink it, it's gross. It tastes fine in coffee and tea, but just by itself, it's

735
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:53,680
really disgusting. And similarly, if you just have me eat lard, it's really disgusting. Like I,

736
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:58,080
despite the fact that I was on a ketogenic diet for three years, I never developed a taste for

737
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:07,760
putting coffee and butter and things like that. But I freaking love ice cream, right? Like,

738
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:15,520
I think ice cream is about one of the most beautiful tastes in the world, everything about

739
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,800
it. So, and it really isn't that much more than sugar and fat, right? I mean, yes, there's some

740
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,840
flavors to it. And if you make it a coffee ice cream, I like it even more. But so, so I guess

741
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:32,880
my question is, can you walk me through what my brain is doing when it's tasting sugar, when it's

742
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:39,440
tasting butter, neither of which by itself, I find remotely enjoyable, but then when I'm tasting ice

743
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:45,760
cream and because the ice cream is not that much more caloric than the butter and the taste of

744
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,200
those two things, you know what I mean? Like there's something I'm trying to understand here,

745
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:54,080
which is taste and energy density. And how are those figuring out? Because I believe they are

746
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:00,400
instantly rewarding. So I'll give you one other analogy here. I remember when my daughter, who's

747
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:07,520
now 13, turned six months old and my wife and I were really fastidious about not feeding her any

748
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,520
junk, right? Like, you know, fortunately my wife was able to breastfeed so she didn't have all that

749
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:18,320
formula. And, you know, we just, we were like, you know, your typical idiot first parents, right? Like

750
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,640
we spent way too much time thinking about what she was eating, I'm sure. But on her six month

751
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,840
birthday, we got her ice cream. So you got it. So this is kind of an interesting experiment, right?

752
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,280
Like she's never experienced anything like this. So I take a little ice cream cone and I put it up

753
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,880
to her face and I still remember where we were sitting in Del Mar when I did this.

754
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:48,000
Stefan, it we're talking in milliseconds response from her milliseconds. Her eyes opened wider than

755
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,600
they've ever opened and she couldn't get into that thing fast enough. So to suggest that that isn't

756
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,760
her brain responding is crazy, right? Like there's there's nothing in her periphery in the moment

757
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,520
that governed that response. So whatever ice cream loving genes I have, she got them.

758
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,080
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm in a hard agree on ice cream. It's it's really for me,

759
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:22,400
like almost drug like the effect it has on my brain. So yeah, this brings up a couple of

760
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:30,400
interesting questions. So you're alluding to the fact that sugar and pure fat are very calorie

761
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:38,160
dense. So if our brains are wired for calories, why are those not very motivating, which is a

762
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:44,960
great question. So I'll start with that. And the reason is that this starts to get into the

763
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:52,320
the complexity of it is that there is an optimal concentration of these nutrients that is not 100%.

764
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,960
So you know, a great way to illustrate this would be with salt, right? Like

765
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,720
eating straight up salt is not something that most people would enjoy, like eating spoonfuls of salt.

766
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:09,280
It's horrible. But at the right concentration, it's excellent, right? It really enhances food.

767
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,720
And so that's actually generally true about all of these nutrients. It's true also about

768
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:21,200
carbohydrate and fat. So a term that's been used for that is the bliss point. So there is an optimal

769
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:29,440
concentration for enjoyment and presumably also for reinforcement, which is that dopamine release

770
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:42,000
that sets your motivational drive and helps you learn and form habits. And so ice cream, you know,

771
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,920
if you take out the sugar, probably wouldn't taste bad without the sugar, but not nearly as good,

772
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:55,040
if you take out the fat, fat free ice cream is not flying off the shelves, even though it does exist.

773
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,040
So it's really that combination of the two that really puts it over the top. And that's generally

774
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:09,440
true. When you look at the types of foods that are most commonly associated with strong cravings

775
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,600
and loss of control over eating, so like addictive like behavior, you see that generally the foods

776
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,120
that are cited are combinations of carbohydrate and fat. Usually there's other stuff involved.

777
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:28,240
There's flavorings, there's salt in the savory items like pizza or french fries.

778
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:37,600
So sweet or savory, generally they're combinations of carbohydrate and fat. And I think that, again,

779
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:44,800
it just relates to the fact that there is an optimal concentration of these nutrients in

780
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:53,600
terms of stimulating our reward centers. And so what you see in modern foods that have been

781
01:25:54,240 --> 01:26:03,440
crafted to maximally stimulate our enjoyment and motivation, either they've been crafted by

782
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:11,920
food industry or by grandma, passed down through the generations of recipes. What you see is that

783
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:19,280
generally these items are hitting multiple bliss points at the same time. And that's just not really

784
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:28,400
a combination you see in nature. So I mean, you don't see foods that are as reinforcing. I mean,

785
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,680
I think the closest we would come is like maybe certain types of nuts would have some carbohydrate

786
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:42,560
and some fat together. But we really don't see anything that really hits the high points as much

787
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,560
as the foods that surround us today. Let's go back to our ancestors for a moment.

788
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:57,360
What apparatus was at their disposal subconsciously or consciously to help them understand and

789
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:05,200
prioritize calorically dense food? Because I got to believe that the three things that mattered most,

790
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:14,000
correct me if I'm wrong, would be total calories, protein, and sodium. I mean, it can't be an

791
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:23,200
accident that sodium is the only mineral we can taste, right? Yeah, correct. So, or I should say

792
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,480
by correct, I mean, that is how I think about it as well. And to break down the energy piece,

793
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:34,880
that would come for an animal with a digestive tract like a human, that would come primarily from

794
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:43,520
carbohydrate and fat. So we have carbohydrate, fat, protein, salt, and then sometimes I add

795
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:51,120
glutamate, umami to that list as well. And essentially- And this is subconscious, Stefan,

796
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:58,720
where we- Is this again just part of that stuff that was now so wired into us that- Yes.

797
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,840
We didn't want to eat grass. We knew that even though you could sort of get the gastric

798
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,720
distension from eating a lot of grass like a cow could, it was doing nothing for us. It didn't

799
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,040
taste good. And so in the short term, it wasn't pleasing. And in the long term, obviously,

800
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,920
it didn't satiate us. Yeah, that's right. And I think there's a couple of angles on this. One,

801
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,200
obviously humans have cultures, so we figured out what foods are good over long periods of time.

802
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:30,800
But a key aspect of this is dopamine mediated reinforcement. And essentially, our bodies are

803
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:38,480
set up to respond to certain types of nutrients, like the ones you mentioned, and create a

804
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:46,480
motivation and learning response that prioritizes and sets the motivational level on the seeking of

805
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:57,120
those types of foods. And so presumably, these are the kinds of nutrients that our ancestors

806
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:03,600
would have needed to prioritize to maximize the reproductive success, the currency of natural

807
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,880
selection. So essentially, we have these motivational systems that were selected to seek

808
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,160
certain types of nutrients in the environment. And if you look at the modeling that's been done on

809
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:20,640
foraging behavior in a wide variety of animals and in humans, you see that it revolves around

810
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:27,280
maximizing the energy return rate of foraging. This doesn't describe every species, but it does

811
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:34,080
describe many species. It's amazing to watch it in big cats, for example, where they'll be chasing

812
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:40,400
an antelope. And it's literally almost like they have a sensor inside that says, I'm going to stop

813
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:46,400
chasing now because my energy cost is not going to be met by my consumption over this period of

814
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:52,720
time. Absolutely. And these animals, you know, they don't know how to do math. They don't know

815
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:58,000
that they're actually implementing a mathematical equation in their head, but they are. It's just

816
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,080
wired into their brains the same way it's wired into us. You can predict hunter-gatherer foraging

817
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,800
behavior to a surprisingly to a surprising degree just by knowing the calorie return rate of

818
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,000
different foraging options. So our brains are very much wired, not just our brains, but our bodies

819
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,440
are very much wired around energy acquisition in terms of how our motivation and learning is set up

820
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:30,240
on a non-conscious level. And this is very much hardwired. So we have dedicated sensors in the

821
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:38,880
digestive tract. This is all pretty recent research since 2018. They discovered these cells that they

822
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:46,480
named neuropod cells in the small intestine primarily that have receptors for specific nutrients

823
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:54,720
that are directly, these cells are directly hooked up to vagal neurons. So when they detect glucose

824
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:02,320
or amino acids, fatty acids, so that would be carbohydrate, fat, protein, they get the

825
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,960
concentration and they start sending signals up your vagus nerve up to your brainstem. And from

826
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:13,840
there, it gets distributed to many parts of your brain, but particularly relevant part is the parts

827
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:22,400
of your brain that have to do with dopamine release onto your reward centers. And if the food that

828
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:27,440
you're eating contains a high concentration of these valuable nutrients, particularly in

829
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:32,240
combination with one another, you're going to get a higher level of dopamine release. The more

830
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:38,400
dopamine release you get, the more of a motivation you will develop toward that food.

831
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,000
Why is it there there are, and maybe this is just to me, I don't know what the literature would say,

832
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,560
so this could be incorrect, but in me,

833
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:55,920
like a ribeye is not something I seem to be able to eat into excess. And I feel like I should,

834
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:03,920
like shouldn't I be wired to eat ribeye until I can't stand? Like shouldn't I be wired to eat

835
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:11,600
ribeye until the point of vomiting, given how high it is in sodium, fat and protein and total calories?

836
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:18,240
The only thing it's missing is sugar and fiber and carbohydrates and things like that, but

837
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:25,200
it's easier for me to overeat baked potatoes than it is to overeat a ribeye.

838
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,720
And I'm not sure I understand why.

839
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,720
Let me just clarify, with the potato, is that with or without toppings?

840
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:41,200
With, let's say with. So yeah, let's put on butter, sour cream and salt.

841
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,480
So I'm clearly making it much more than the carb, of course.

842
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:44,880
Got it.

843
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,960
And it has to be crispy skin, too, like if I're going to do it right, you know,

844
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,520
I can't be like some lame ass buffet baked potato. It's got to be my style.

845
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,880
Yeah, that's.

846
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:03,120
But I don't know why I don't know why, like a fatty piece of meat is not something I have an amazing.

847
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,400
Is that is my experience typical or would most people be able to just eat ribeyes until they puke?

848
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,160
Oh, that's a good question. I really don't know. I will say that when you look at

849
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:23,440
the foods that people cite as the most typically associated with strong cravings and loss of

850
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:29,760
control over eating behavior, meat does not usually come up high on that list. And so.

851
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,600
Which seems like it should, right?

852
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,680
Yeah, I mean, I can only speculate about that. I'm not really sure why

853
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,880
I can understand where you're coming from. I don't know whether that's a kind of

854
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,080
generalizable phenomenon. I can only speculate about why that might be.

855
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:55,920
So there are a couple of things that come to mind for me. The first is that meat is about 75% water.

856
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:03,120
So the calorie density of is actually it's not low, but it's not especially high unless you're

857
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:09,280
eating a really fatty piece of meat. So that's one thing if we're comparing it to something like

858
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:16,720
brownie or something like pizza, which is more calorie dense than steak.

859
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,120
The second thing is it doesn't have any carbohydrates. So it doesn't have that

860
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:30,880
fat carbohydrate combination that is most closely associated with foods that people lose control

861
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:38,480
around. The third thing I would say is the high protein level. So even though we have

862
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,920
this strong protein specific appetite that's been demonstrated in many different species,

863
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:53,280
protein doesn't work the same as carbohydrate and fat. And I think we recognize that that's the

864
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:58,080
case. Protein seems to, it's something that our bodies really want to get enough of,

865
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:04,160
but don't want to get too much of. So there's really not only there's a drive to acquire it,

866
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:09,520
but there's a drive to keep it within a certain range and not eat too much. And we see that,

867
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:16,400
you know, if people go on high protein diets, their overall calorie intake will drop.

868
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,400
Yeah. I mean, I wanted to talk about the carnivore diet with you a little bit because I

869
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:26,240
know you guys did a review on a book. It's not a diet I've spent any time really thinking about.

870
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:32,640
So I've basically spoken to, I don't know, a dozen people who have gone on it. And without

871
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:38,480
exception, they all lose weight, which I think for some of them is their motivation for doing it.

872
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,560
And it must simply be that they just get tired of eating, right? They just don't,

873
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:49,360
they just can't take in the number of calories if they're doing it in that format.

874
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:54,400
I think there's probably, so I would say that, you know, we don't have any good

875
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:03,760
data on the impact of carnivore diet on, on weight. So, you know, there's no randomized control trials,

876
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,680
but you know, we have these anecdotes of people saying they lose a lot of weight. I certainly

877
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:17,600
don't dispute that. But I think if you came to me with this diet on paper and you asked me,

878
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,880
would this cause weight? I would say absolutely, because it has multiple properties that I would

879
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:30,000
expect to make it a particularly effective weight loss diet. One, this is something we could talk

880
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:39,040
about more if you want, but it has zero carbohydrate. So I think that anywhere, if you're on the extreme

881
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:44,560
of the fat to carbohydrate ratio in either direction, that's more slimming than being in

882
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:51,200
the middle. So the most fattening diets are rich in both carbohydrate and fat. So there's zero

883
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:55,280
carbohydrate. You're on the extreme or I shouldn't say zero, very, very little. Right. That's out of

884
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:01,120
the glycogen in the meat. Yeah. There's a little glycogen. So you're on the very extreme end of

885
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:08,320
the macronutrient distribution. It's high in protein. That's also known to contribute to

886
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:14,400
weight loss. You're eliminating almost every type of food. So your variety, the variety of your diet

887
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,520
goes very low. I mean, you can prepare your meat in different ways. You can eat chicken or fish or

888
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,800
beef or whatever, but the variety is greatly, greatly reduced. So that's, I think, part of it.

889
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:32,800
And you're cutting out all of these highly processed, calorie dense foods that are the foods that I

890
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:41,200
think, you know, we could debate about why, but I think everyone agrees that those are foods that

891
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:48,400
drive excess intake and elevated body fatness. So I think all these things together, it's just

892
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:54,880
even on paper, it's a diet that I would very much expect to cause weight loss more to greater degree

893
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:02,800
than your average diet. And while we're on the topic, what are you mean, tell me a little bit

894
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,960
about your review of this, because I know you've put some time into this. And for folks that are

895
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:15,600
wondering, you know, I don't really plan to do a podcast on the carnivore diet. It doesn't seem to

896
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,920
make a lot of sense to me, although I don't dispute that there are people who I think have had very

897
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,880
successful outcomes on it with respect to dealing with some of their physical ailments.

898
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:36,160
So maybe it has a role in sort of overcoming some acute illness. And maybe I'm just biased towards

899
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:42,000
thinking plants are valuable. But I guess it seems to me that one of the core tenets of the

900
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:47,760
diet is that plants are sort of low grade toxic, right? I mean, isn't that sort of part of the

901
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:56,560
thesis? Yeah, the thesis is basically everything is toxic except grass fed animal foods.

902
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:08,880
So like even tap water is considered not optimal. But yeah, so the book spends a lot of time like

903
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:15,440
going through the litany of all the potentially harmful compounds in plant foods. And actually,

904
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:21,680
you know what, I sympathize with some of this, I think there is a bias toward thinking, if it's in

905
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:27,280
a plant, it's healthy. And I don't think that's true. I think the book is right, that that's not

906
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:32,960
necessarily true. And I think there are some plant compounds that at least for some people are not so

907
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:39,120
good. And you know, there are well characterized examples of this, like if you eat a lot of spinach,

908
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:47,600
you can get kidney stones from all the oxalate. There are studies suggesting that the glucosinolates

909
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:57,200
in cabbage family plants might contribute to type two diabetes. You know, there's like kidney beans,

910
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:02,640
if you don't cook them enough, they can be really toxic because the lectins. So it's not like there

911
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:10,080
aren't examples of this. It's definitely true that to some degree, I think it just gets taken

912
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:16,960
far beyond where the evidence is. And you know, the way to think about how healthy a food is,

913
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:23,840
is not to say does it contain toxins, it's to say what's the cost benefit analysis on this food. And

914
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:31,040
most importantly, what are the empirical outcomes that we can see when it's impacts on health are

915
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:36,480
directly studied. So you know, like this is something that I've kind of focused on in my

916
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:45,360
evaluation of some of the ideas that are put forth in the public sphere, is that a lot of

917
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:54,160
people with, a lot of people who are coming out with, let's say unusual ideas in this sphere,

918
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:03,360
they really, they take a mechanism and they run with it. Like, you know, X toxin is really bad,

919
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,760
like lectins, for example, Gundry, lectins can do XYZ, lectins are in plants, therefore we shouldn't

920
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:17,040
eat these types of plants. And that's really like a bottom up approach, like extrapolating

921
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:23,440
empirical effects on health from mechanism when really, I think in a complex field like nutrition,

922
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,320
it's better to start with the empirical evidence like, oh, we have this study that suggests

923
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:35,360
that there's actually an effect on health. Let's see if we can understand the mechanism.

924
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:42,160
What are some of the biochemical changes that occur in people on a carnivore diet?

925
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,720
I mean, the obvious one must be the dyslipidemia, right?

926
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:55,760
Yes. So, you know, there's a shift toward a ketogenic metabolism because of the fact that

927
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,520
it's very low carbohydrate. That would be an obvious shift that occurs.

928
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,680
There, you know, I don't know if I'd use the term dyslipidemia, but one of the terms that,

929
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:15,280
one of the potential downsides I focused on in the review that is downplayed by many

930
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:22,480
carnivore diet advocates, including Paul Saladinho is the change in LDL cholesterol

931
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:29,360
and LDL particle count. So, and again, we don't have great evidence here. And this is kind of

932
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:37,120
the crux of our review of the book on red pen reviews is simply that there are a lot of claims

933
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:45,840
made that are not supported by any kind of convincing evidence. But we have some evidence.

934
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,640
So there's this survey study that was done on something like 2000 carnivore dieters.

935
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:58,080
I think David Ludwig was involved in that. And they just reached out to people in social media

936
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:04,560
groups, like their Facebook groups and things, and they administered this survey. And one of the

937
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:14,080
questions was, what was your various blood lipid values before and after this diet? And you see

938
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:20,080
that there are changes in positive and negative directions. Triglycerides go down as you would

939
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:27,600
expect. I don't remember what HDL did, but it probably went up. Yeah. And then there was a

940
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:37,840
large increase in LDL cholesterol. And so that's a concern, you know, as far as I'm concerned. And I

941
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,880
think you would agree. And Paul Saladinho himself, you know, I'm not trying to pick on him. I don't

942
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:49,520
want to make it personal, but he's, you know, been public about some of this stuff. So I think it's

943
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:59,360
fair to point out to just repeat what he himself has said. But his LDL cholesterol is 533 megs per

944
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:11,280
deciliter. And his LDL particle count is also absolutely through the roof. And so not everyone

945
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:17,040
responds like that. Like if you look at the survey data, I think there was a mean increase of like 30

946
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:24,720
megs per deciliter in LDL, 30 or 40, something like that. So I think it depends on the individual.

947
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:31,840
I think some people like Sean Baker's lipids are fine. He's another carnivore diet guy. Last time

948
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:37,440
I saw his lipids look just fine. So I think it depends on the individual. But some people

949
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:44,480
do experience a large increase in LDL cholesterol. And I mean, you know more about this than I do,

950
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:50,560
but that certainly raises red flag for me in terms of cardiovascular risk over the long run.

951
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:57,120
Yeah, the thing I've never understood is this is probably true of not just carnivore, but

952
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:02,160
ketogenic or anything that that does produce that hyperbeta lipoproteinemia.

953
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:11,120
It's it almost seems to be worn by some as a badge of honor, as opposed to saying, well,

954
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,840
maybe this diet is doing a lot of really good things for me. It's improving my insulin

955
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,760
sensitivity. I feel better. I have fewer energy swings. But this one thing isn't so good. But

956
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,920
here's the thing of all the things that could go wrong. That's about the most treatable one out

957
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:36,880
there. Very easy to treat elevated Apo B. And so that's the part. And this is what we do clinically,

958
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:43,200
right? This is how we treat patients, right? We have patients who only get better on very,

959
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:50,320
very carbohydrate restricted diets. But then, you know, if they develop that that pattern,

960
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:56,000
that elevated LDL pattern, we have a choice to make, which is we abandon the diet or we treat

961
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:02,000
the elevated Apo B. And that's not a failure. That's simply using modern medicine to help us

962
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:10,640
achieve the best of both worlds. So I think I've always struggled to understand why a person will

963
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:18,560
go on that diet, have, you know, an Apo B or LDL go from the 50th percentile to north of the 99th

964
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:24,240
percentile. And instead of being curious about what the implication is, sort of dig their heels

965
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:30,480
in and say, clearly, this is a good thing. And LDL does not cause heart disease. I absolutely agree.

966
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:39,840
I mean, it's a dietary ideology. It's an ideology that has emerged to defend a certain

967
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:46,480
type of dietary pattern. These kind of ideas emerged from the low carb community, essentially,

968
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:52,880
to defend against the idea that there might be some downsides to certain types of low carb diets.

969
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:58,240
And they've been taken to an extreme, I think, in the carnivore community, because that's a

970
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:05,440
particularly potent stimulus for increasing LDL. So people don't want to believe that there's a

971
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:11,520
downside to the thing they're doing. And, you know, like, I kind of get it. Like, people go on this

972
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,160
diet, they lose weight, they feel better. Some people, you know, they say their skin cleared up

973
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:23,040
or XYZ condition improved. Like, there's all these tangible things they can see that are getting

974
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:28,960
better. They don't want to believe that there's an intangible thing that's actually putting them at

975
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:34,400
severe risk. Because, I mean, as you know, like, I say severe risk, I just mean cardiovascular

976
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:41,440
disease is a big risk, generally. Like, as you know, this is the number one killer. Cardiovascular

977
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:46,480
disease is a huge big deal. Even if it doesn't kill you, it can do really bad things to you

978
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:52,160
physically and cognitively. So, like, it's not a risk you want to be ignoring. So I absolutely

979
01:47:52,160 --> 01:48:02,400
agree. I think it's an irrational part of dietary tribal ideology that is holding people back from

980
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:07,520
experiencing their best health. And it's so treatable. I said that in the review, too. I was like,

981
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:15,760
you don't even have to stop the diet. You can just get it treated. Or you could modify the diet.

982
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:22,320
Yeah. And by the way, you see the same sort of equally stubborn ideology at the exact opposite

983
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:28,560
end of the spectrum where we see these patients that will go on these incredibly restrictive

984
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:34,240
plant-based diets. And it's usually some combination of micronutrient deficiency and or protein

985
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:40,240
deficiency that's going to be the death of them. But there's no deviating from it. There's no,

986
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:44,560
like, I'm going to supplement with protein shapes. I'm going to take B vitamins. I'm going to do

987
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:49,120
these. And again, it's the same sort of thing. It's like somehow if I acknowledge the fact that

988
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:54,400
I need to supplement with these other things to work around a diet that I otherwise like,

989
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,960
or that is congruent with a belief system I have around the treatment of animals, which I can

990
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:03,600
respect that. Right. If that's if that's your belief system, then by all means be true to it. But

991
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:12,720
but yes, I find it somewhat self-destructive. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's very analogous

992
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:17,120
to what we see in certain corners of the vegan diet community. They want it to be best for

993
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:24,480
everything. It's got to be best for the environment and for ethics and for health. And like, it's just

994
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:29,120
very hard to swallow that there might be some downsides. And for the carnivore diet, too,

995
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:34,720
you see, like, they try to justify the environmental aspects of it, too. Like,

996
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:42,080
in the carnivore code, he talks a lot about regenerative agriculture, which, you know,

997
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:48,160
is a concept that I think is interesting. And I think I support it, but

998
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:56,640
it's a certain, I would say, spin on it that makes it seem particularly favorable. And also, like,

999
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,880
there's an underlying assumption that the average carnivore is going to eat nothing but

1000
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,920
regenerative agriculture beef, which I think is not the case.

1001
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:12,080
Let's talk about one more big topic, Stefan, which you've you've written a lot about, God,

1002
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:17,920
you're I don't mean I don't know if you're sick of it or you're still enjoying it. But this idea of

1003
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:26,800
kind of energy balance, carbohydrates and insulin and unifying theories around adiposity.

1004
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:32,960
Now, very recently, I heard you and Kevin Hall on a podcast. I don't remember what the podcast

1005
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,840
was called, but it was a wonderful discussion because I know you well. I know Kevin well.

1006
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:44,160
And anytime I can listen to a podcast with people who I know a lot about and I know most of what

1007
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:48,800
they have to say, but yet I still pick something up in the discussion, it's fantastic. And that was

1008
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:57,840
that was an example. So in it, you guys did a pretty good job, I thought, of really explaining

1009
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:04,560
the history of these models, which I think you acknowledged are probably not perfectly named.

1010
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,080
So there's a little bit of historical baggage that goes into the nomenclature.

1011
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:16,320
And I think anybody who is able to sort of pay attention long enough will realize that there's

1012
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:22,000
a lot in common with these models, but there are some fundamental differences that are important

1013
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:29,200
to understand. So maybe we could sort of talk a little bit about that. And again, I think this

1014
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:34,720
is not a time to be overly simplistic. I think this is a time for nuance and it is a time for

1015
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:40,560
putting the finer point on the similarities and differences of these models. So maybe just start

1016
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,600
by explaining, well, pick the one you want to start with and let's kind of walk through them.

1017
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:54,720
Yeah, so the two models are the carbohydrate insulin model and the energy balance model.

1018
01:51:54,720 --> 01:52:00,960
And the carbohydrate insulin model, I just want to get a little more specific with that because

1019
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:10,400
there are different versions of this. And so this is the one that has been promoted by David Ludwig,

1020
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:17,040
and particularly in a recent review paper that he published with along with some other researchers.

1021
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:24,480
And the energy balance model in this case is being represented by Kevin Hall, but I would say

1022
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:30,880
he's pretty close. It has very deep roots in models, similar models that go back decades.

1023
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:39,040
Carbohydrate insulin model in its most recent incarnation is a lot more complex than previous

1024
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:45,120
inclination. So I'm going to do my best to kind of summarize it and hit the key points.

1025
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:53,440
But essentially, it's the idea that there are things in the diet and in the environment that

1026
01:52:53,600 --> 01:53:01,440
impact insulin signaling and insulin signaling impacts body fatness. And then that

1027
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:10,480
fatening process of insulin signaling on adiposity, then downstream leads to elevated

1028
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:18,000
calorie intake and elevated and possibly a decline in metabolic rate. So it proposes a

1029
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,600
reversal of the relationship. This is one of the key aspects I want to highlight,

1030
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:31,840
proposes a reversal of the relationship between energy balance and body fatness. Basically,

1031
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:38,080
the energy balance phenotype is downstream of that fatening process instead of being upstream.

1032
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:44,000
And that really, I think, is a key difference. When we go to the energy balance model,

1033
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:49,600
the energy balance is upstream of the fatening process. So basically, we have all these things

1034
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:55,600
happening in the environment and physiologically in our bodies. Those signals are impinging

1035
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:06,960
primarily on the brain. And then energy balance is a result of primarily that brain activity.

1036
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:11,680
And then that is feeding into adipose tissue. So in that context,

1037
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:20,960
adipose is body fatness is receiving the excess energy. It's not really the driver

1038
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:29,920
of this process, but when excess energy enters the body, it's what mops it up. So that's the

1039
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:35,840
difference between those two models. So let me say that again, just to make sure we've got this

1040
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,440
right. So in the former model, in the carbohydrate insulin model, the idea is that

1041
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:52,240
the primary cause is the adipose tissue increasing in its fatness. The adipose tissue

1042
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:57,680
wants more energy that's driven by the external factors, both carbohydrate and otherwise.

1043
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:05,520
So in a drive to increase the influx of fatty acid into adipose tissue, you see a reduction

1044
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:13,840
in circulating metabolic fuels, which drives an increase in appetite. So intake goes up to

1045
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:19,840
accommodate the reduction in circulating metabolic fuels, which is being caused by a drive towards

1046
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:26,400
fatness. The conventional model basically says that's happening in reverse. It's saying that

1047
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:33,200
the input of fuels into the system leads to an increase in circulating metabolic factors

1048
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:42,320
that is now driving energy balance into the fat cell. Is that safe overview? Yes. You said

1049
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:47,760
conventional model though. And I think, do you want to call that energy? Is that the energy

1050
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:54,960
balance? I have heard both terms. Yeah. Okay. So sorry. I think this is worth a moment to clarify.

1051
01:55:54,960 --> 01:56:02,560
So if you look at David Ludwig's paper, he contrasts the carbohydrate insulin model against

1052
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:09,200
what he calls the energy balance model, which is basically calories in and calories out.

1053
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:14,480
So it's like, it's not really right. None of this is really regulated. It's just however many

1054
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:22,080
calories you happen to passively eat or how much you decide to exercise. And then your fat tissue

1055
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:32,720
is a result of that. So the energy balance model in contrast is acknowledging all of this brain

1056
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:39,520
regulation of body fat, brain regulation of appetite and saying actually body fat is a

1057
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:48,560
regulated process. However, it's body fatness, I should say is a regulated variable. However,

1058
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:58,800
it's regulated by the energy intake and expenditure via the brain. Got it. Okay. Yeah. So the

1059
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:07,680
conventional model, I will say is not a model that really any research, any obesity researchers

1060
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:16,320
currently ascribe to at least the obesity researchers who are actually studying the

1061
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:22,640
mechanisms of body fat regulation. Yeah. And one of the things that I think Kevin pointed out on

1062
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:28,640
this podcast to go further on that, down that thread is the energy balance model does not

1063
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:34,480
consider all calories identical. Yeah, it does not presuppose that they're all identical. That's

1064
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:41,840
right. And in terms of their impact on body fat. Correct. So not only do they potentially have

1065
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,800
different thermogenic effects, but they also might have different regulatory effects on

1066
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:54,400
compensatory appetite, right? That's right. And I think where we really see this emerging is in

1067
01:57:54,400 --> 01:58:01,360
animal models. And I don't know how relevant this is for humans, but I'm just using it as a general

1068
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:07,200
proof of principle that it can happen. You can see in animal models where you can change their

1069
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:12,880
diet composition. David Ludwig has shown this for carbohydrate quality. It's been shown for

1070
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:20,720
dietary fat as well. And you can actually produce animals that will gain fat independent of calorie

1071
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:26,560
intake. So you can actually clamp them at their former calorie intake and they will nevertheless

1072
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:36,720
gain fat. So so they're at least in principle, those types of effects are possible. Yeah,

1073
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,520
I believe Rick Johnson described an experiment like that on my recent podcast with him, which

1074
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:48,080
was an isocaloric swap to a very high fructose diet where the animals didn't gain weight,

1075
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:54,160
but they fuel partition differently. They got fatter. This was over a long time. This was over

1076
01:58:55,120 --> 01:59:00,000
nine months. So nine months for a mouse, right? As an eternity. Yeah, that's a very long time.

1077
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:05,040
Yeah, absolutely. That is a very long time. And I think that's a very long time.

1078
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:10,880
Yeah, absolutely. That has been shown in a number of contexts that that can happen in rodents. But

1079
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,760
they also I think it's worth pointing out that rodents have their energy expenditure is more

1080
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:21,600
plastic than ours. Yeah. By the way, I want to go back to that because this is something

1081
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:27,520
this will tie into what we're about to talk about. But you have a person who weighs

1082
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,840
200 pounds person who weighs 160 pounds of the same height.

1083
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:39,520
The 200 pound person loses 40 pounds. They're now 160 pounds. The other person's always been

1084
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:46,000
160 pounds. On the surface, they look identical. In fact, let's pretend they're siblings.

1085
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:52,000
But one was obese, and he's now post obese. The other was never obese.

1086
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:58,560
Let's pretend that that one that lost the 40 pounds has really kind of dialed it in.

1087
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:06,880
And doesn't yo yo, he manages to stay there. It's three years later. Are they the same person yet?

1088
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:17,840
No, probably not. They're so Rudy Leibel has done studies where I think they've had people

1089
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:26,080
out to a year, maybe two years where they have them weight reduced. And the starvation response,

1090
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:32,880
this left independent starvation response, he hasn't seen any sign that it goes away. So

1091
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:39,520
could it maybe be possible? Could it maybe be possible under some circumstances? Maybe. But

1092
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:47,680
the evidence that I've seen suggests that it is at least not typical.

1093
02:00:52,080 --> 02:01:01,200
I want to specify that I think that the set point around which the lipostat regulates can change

1094
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:09,440
based on dietary and environmental variables. And so for example, just to give an example that

1095
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:15,360
you'll be familiar with and others probably listening will be familiar with. If you take

1096
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:20,560
someone on a typical diet and put them on a low carb diet, you don't have to tell them to reduce

1097
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:29,200
their calorie intake. That will occur spontaneously and they will lose fat and end up in the typical

1098
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:34,800
person comfortably being at a lower weight. They're not experiencing the starvation response.

1099
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:41,840
And you can see this on other diets as well. So I think there are things we can do to change the set

1100
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:49,920
point. However, that person, that doesn't mean that they are cured. So if they went back to their

1101
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,920
other diet, if they just went back to how they used to be eating, so they're not maintaining

1102
02:01:54,560 --> 02:02:01,200
this attempt for weight reduction anymore, they generally will go back to where they were. So it's

1103
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:06,560
not that there's a durable resetting of the set point to like flipping a switch and resetting,

1104
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:15,280
like restarting your computer. It's more like the set point has been modified because it's in a

1105
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:21,600
different environment. And as long as you maintain that change, you can maintain the effect. But if

1106
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:28,160
the change goes away, then the effect goes away. Where do we think is the greatest window of

1107
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:32,880
vulnerability for someone? Just going back to these two hypothetical individuals who, and let's

1108
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,440
just now make it even more, let's take the genes out of it. Let's pretend they're identical twins.

1109
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:47,040
Born in the same household, clearly they both can, they both possess the genetic traits that would

1110
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:54,640
allow them in the right environment to become obese. But one of them, you know, let's just say

1111
02:02:54,640 --> 02:03:02,320
had an injury in high school that kind of kept him home from playing sports. And he ended up

1112
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:06,080
playing more video games and kind of eating more. The other one was more active. So that explains

1113
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:12,400
why when they're now 40 years old, one's 40 pounds overweight, the other's not. Are there windows in

1114
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:20,640
a person's life when they are more susceptible to that resetting of a set point, a higher and

1115
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:25,520
higher set point, which it sounds to me like it never goes down. It's a monotonic crank, right?

1116
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:34,000
I don't really know. I honestly don't know. I mean, I think certainly there is a substantial

1117
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:43,760
potential for most people to gain weight at almost any point in life. So I'm not really sure.

1118
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:50,240
I think, I think one, and by the way, let me say that I think there are other people who could

1119
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:56,240
probably answer this question better than me. There are people who have studied the trajectory

1120
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:02,800
of weight gain over the life span. So part of the issue here is I'm just not that well

1121
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:10,000
first on this literature. But one thing I'll point out that is potentially interesting is

1122
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:19,600
there may be an influence of the intrauterine environment. So what's going on as you're

1123
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:28,560
developing inside the uterus. So there is evidence, I wouldn't call it strong, but there is evidence

1124
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:36,160
that women who undergo bariatric surgery for obesity and lose a lot of weight, their children

1125
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:42,720
are at a lower risk of developing obesity than women of similar weight who did not undergo

1126
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:49,840
bariatric surgery. And the effect size is large. Wait a second. Meaning two women of the same weight

1127
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:57,120
have children. One of them was, is that weight naturally. And the other one is weight reduced

1128
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:05,920
at that weight secondary to gastric bypass. No, no. So think about two women with severe obesity.

1129
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:13,040
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. One of them has gastric bypass. Yep. Okay. After that surgery, they both

1130
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:17,680
have children. But starting from different weights, obviously, because the gastric bypass one is weight

1131
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:25,440
reduced. Okay. Yes. And the children of the woman who had the surgery and had previously lost weight

1132
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:31,600
before getting pregnant will have a lower risk of obesity. And again, I wouldn't call the evidence

1133
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:36,000
strong. And what if, what if she achieved, what if she achieved that weight loss without gastric

1134
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,560
bypass? So what if you had two women who were overweight and one of them lost weight through

1135
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:50,560
diet and nutrition, and then they got pregnant? I don't know. I am not aware of data on that.

1136
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:57,520
I would if you know, if you wanted me to guess, I would say it would probably be similar. But is

1137
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:05,760
gastric bypass? Does that have you know, is that really the same physiologically as

1138
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:13,600
the physiological situation that you get from diet and weight loss, diet and lifestyle?

1139
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:18,480
See, I don't I don't think it is I think I think gastric bypass is a unique situation

1140
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:28,080
where provided a person doesn't take in liquid calories. It's it's it's quite durable. The

1141
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:35,920
the Roux and why obviously liquid calories can completely disrupt the feedback mechanism there.

1142
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:41,520
Kind of similar, by the way, to a GLP one agonist. This actually kind of gets back to

1143
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:49,520
I've seen patients who take semiglutide who don't lose weight. And the way you can cheat

1144
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:54,720
semiglutide is to drink your calories. If you if you drink massive amounts of calories. Again,

1145
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,600
this is anecdotal. I don't think I don't know that this has been studied. I'm just saying this based

1146
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:03,520
on observing a number of patients. But, you know, if you continue to drink a lot of alcohol,

1147
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:11,360
if you continue to drink juices and things like that, you're you can sort of bypass some of the

1148
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:17,040
the the GLP one effect on the brain. It would seem that that's my only explanation for why I see that.

1149
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:23,600
And we do see that definitely with with with gastric bypass. So who knows about about what

1150
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:30,560
that would look what that would look like. I mean, what what advice or what insight comes from this

1151
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:34,720
as it pertains to a person who's listening to this? And by definition, half the people listening

1152
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:40,800
to this are probably at a body weight above where they want to be. What's the takeaway? Right? Is in

1153
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:46,880
terms of pregnancy? No, no, just in terms of overall weight loss. Like how how do we get

1154
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:54,000
you know, we're sitting here in this environment that is, you know, almost deliberately trying to

1155
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,800
put weight on us. We're not going to get any help from our ancestors because the reality of it is

1156
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:03,600
our ancestors didn't care if we gained weight. Quite happy to have us gain weight, actually.

1157
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:10,400
They just want to make sure we don't starve. And so what can they do? And more importantly,

1158
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:16,720
how do they keep it off? Because as you said, most people can lose weight. But the keeping it

1159
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:27,440
off is really it poses a challenge. Yeah, so I think that I'm going to take this as a question

1160
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:36,400
about on the individual level, which I assume is what you meant. Yeah. So I think that there are

1161
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:47,360
a couple of different things to think about. I think that for people who have, for people who have

1162
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:56,720
obesity, bottom mass index 3035, I think it's worthwhile to consider medical treatment. So

1163
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:04,080
something like some aglotide, for example, the tools that we have now are just way better than

1164
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:11,920
what they used to be. That's a separate topic we could talk about. But some aglotide, as far as we

1165
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:21,280
can tell, it's a very safe drug. It causes something like 18% weight loss, which is much

1166
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:29,920
better than the typical effect you're going to see in diet and lifestyle strategies. But like diet

1167
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:34,400
and lifestyle is something you have to maintain. So I think at this point, now that the tools are

1168
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:39,920
getting better, particularly now that the tools are getting better, I would recommend seeing an

1169
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:49,680
obesity medicine specialist, I think, for people who are experiencing substantially impaired quality

1170
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:57,920
of life or are really concerned about the health impacts. If we switch the focus to people who

1171
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:03,120
might just want to lose a few pounds or who are overweight, where they're not in as, perhaps not

1172
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:13,440
as serious a situation, I think the brain, so your appetite and your body fatness are very much

1173
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:20,480
regulated by your brain based on inputs that your brain is receiving. And so, and a lot of that is

1174
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:26,880
non-conscious. And so the approach that I like to take is to try to give the non-conscious brain

1175
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:32,960
signals that are going to be more consistent with your goals, signals that are going to tell your

1176
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:40,320
brain to regulate things in a more slimming direction. And that way you're not relying on

1177
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,720
heavy exercise of willpower all the time, which I don't think is really sustainable or effective

1178
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:53,600
for most people. You are, instead of setting up a scenario where you have these non-conscious

1179
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:58,960
urges that you're having to fight with your conscious brain, you're addressing the non-conscious

1180
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:08,320
urges directly so there is no fight. That's what I prefer. And so I think controlling these signals

1181
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:13,440
that your brain is receiving is really important and there are different ways to do that. One of

1182
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:18,960
them is to control your food environment, so the sensory cues in your environment that your brain

1183
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:24,720
is exposed to, whether there is food in your immediate vicinity, how tempting that food is,

1184
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:31,520
how hard you have to work for it. So like if you can just grab it and put it in your mouth,

1185
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:38,080
that's not as good as if you have to walk into a room and then peel an orange before you can eat it.

1186
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:47,760
Just little effort barriers like that. And then with the types of food we're eating,

1187
02:11:49,520 --> 02:12:00,160
there's a wide variation in the number of calories that it takes to feel satisfied at a meal

1188
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:07,760
depending on what foods you're eating. So typically a typical person sits down and eats food

1189
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:15,520
until they feel satisfied and then they stop eating. That is the intuitive, typical, natural,

1190
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:20,800
easy way of interacting with food, but depending on what's on your plate, that point can be reached

1191
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:26,880
with vastly different numbers of calories. So if you're eating... So is the proximate sign

1192
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:32,960
of satiation more a gastric distension function in that immediate cessation mode?

1193
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:43,520
Oh, that's a great question. So okay, that is important. I can say that it's important,

1194
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:49,360
but if I were to assign what percentage of the effect is attributable to that,

1195
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:55,360
I don't know what percentage I would put on it. Is that more than 50%?

1196
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:01,840
I think it's a very complex system. The brain is receiving a lot of signals. Some of them are stomach

1197
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:07,520
distension. Some of them are signals from the small intestine about what the nutrient composition is.

1198
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:16,640
Some of them are simply sensory or sensory detection of food properties and stimulating

1199
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:23,920
your brain knows based on those sensory properties what the nutritional composition is.

1200
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:29,040
What the nutritional composition of the food is based on prior experience that it has stored.

1201
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:35,280
So there's a lot of stuff going on that contributes to ultimately that sensation of

1202
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:45,280
satiety. Satiation would be the proper term for it and satisfaction that causes us to end a meal.

1203
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:52,560
Certainly stomach distension is a biggie. So anyway, so that relates to calorie

1204
02:13:52,560 --> 02:14:00,000
density, which is an important determinant of the satiating and satiety promoting properties of

1205
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,920
food. So in other words, how many calories are there per gram or per volume of this food?

1206
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:12,640
If you have a food that has more volume per calories, fills up your stomach more, it stimulates

1207
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:19,760
those stretch receptors more, that goes up to your brainstem and that's a signal that opposes

1208
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:27,440
further food intake. And then protein, so more protein is more satiating per calorie.

1209
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:35,040
Palatability, the better something tastes, the less it fills you up per calorie.

1210
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,560
And I'm actually not sure how to disentangle that from

1211
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:47,280
calorie density. Not sure how much of like what's the independent variable there and what's the

1212
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:52,320
dependent variable or is it some of both? I don't know the answer to that, but they're both

1213
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:58,800
strongly correlated with lower satiety. And I've also seen these experiments where people are

1214
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:04,480
drinking from a bowl or a cup and it's being refilled constantly versus one where it just

1215
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:09,600
kind of runs out. I mean, what are the differences in how much people consume based on just, I mean,

1216
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:14,960
I noticed this in myself, like I'm eating, I put a little too much in the bowl, but I eat it anyway,

1217
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,800
because it's like, oh, I got to finish this thing. And if I had finished it 10 bites earlier,

1218
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:23,040
I would have been totally happy. Again, I don't know how much that matters, right? Does that

1219
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,880
type of behavior factor in the long tail here or is that just an acute thing that is sort of

1220
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:35,280
irrelevant in terms of optimal weight maintenance? I think it's very plausible, but the problem is

1221
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:40,960
that stuff comes from Brian Wonsink and so it pretty much got blown up. He was the guy at Cornell

1222
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:46,160
that kind of, did he falsify a bunch of data or something? I don't think there is clear evidence

1223
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:52,080
that he falsified. I think there are at least- He hacked a lot of it pretty badly. Oh yeah,

1224
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:58,480
really badly. And there are some data where it's not clear where they came from and they're very

1225
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:06,400
implausible. So I don't know how strong the evidence is that there was actual fabrication.

1226
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:10,160
I think there may have been some evidence of that. I don't know where that landed,

1227
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:16,720
but basically there were a bunch of problems and yeah, he got blown up. So I would say that

1228
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:22,960
anything that has his name on it at this point is pretty suspect. And the refilling soup bowls was

1229
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:29,120
one of his classic experiments. And I'm just going to disclose that I did cite one of his studies in

1230
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:34,320
my book. So I wasn't immune from getting taken in by some of this stuff.

1231
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:41,680
One of the things that going back to the sort of the energy balance model versus the carbohydrate

1232
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:49,040
insulin model, one of the arguments in favor of the carbohydrate insulin model is other examples

1233
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:56,560
of growth that are regulated from the hormones out to the intake of energy. And I was thinking

1234
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:02,560
about this the other day because I measure my kids, I have three kids and every three months,

1235
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:09,280
each of them gets a little tick on their closet door. And I don't know if you have kids or if

1236
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:12,880
you've done this, but any, I think anybody listening to this who measures their kids at regular

1237
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:19,600
intervals, I don't know why I picked three months, but four times a year, the non-linearity of this

1238
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:26,720
is unbelievable, right? They'll go little, little jump, jump, slow down, jump. Like it just,

1239
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:32,560
it's pretty intense. And that growth correlates with how much they seem to eat during that

1240
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:39,520
interval period. Like right now, my youngest who's not yet five, I think he eats more than the other

1241
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:46,080
two combined. And I'm probably not being facetious. He goes to a preschool or a pre-K where they give

1242
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:51,840
them breakfast there. He eats a breakfast at home, he eats two breakfasts at home. Then he goes there

1243
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,520
and still eats more than all the other kids. I mean, the kid's just an eating machine

1244
02:17:56,320 --> 02:18:03,360
and he's growing commensurate with that. I think most people would agree he's not growing because

1245
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:06,960
of how much he's eating. He's eating that much because of how much he's growing.

1246
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,640
So he's responding to growth hormone and all these other things.

1247
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:18,000
And, and I think that's basically the central thrust of this carbohydrate insulin model, right?

1248
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:25,120
Which is whether it be sleep disturbances that increase, you know, or decrease insulin signaling

1249
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:32,400
or foods that stimulate insulin. They're driving that hormonal environment that is driving the

1250
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:42,320
increase in food intake. But I think experimentally, what can we say about the differences in these

1251
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:47,760
models? And I guess I think experimentally, you have to think about this in terms of animals and

1252
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:54,560
humans, right? It seems to me that the balance of experimental data would suggest the energy

1253
02:18:54,560 --> 02:19:00,560
balance model is easier to explain. Would you agree with that? I think so. Although I do want

1254
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:08,720
to acknowledge the fact that they're not mutually exclusive. So I think it has not been ruled out

1255
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:19,040
that there could be a contribution from that type of a model. Why is this so important? Is it so

1256
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:26,560
important? Is it important to understand this? I suppose the implications have to come down to how

1257
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:36,960
we treat the condition, right? I think that it is important in the sense that if you understand the

1258
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:44,720
mechanism of something, it makes it easier to address. And, you know, if you look at the history

1259
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:53,360
of obesity drugs, weight loss drugs, I should say, most of them were discovered in entirely haphazard

1260
02:19:53,360 --> 02:20:02,960
ways. Like dinitrophenol was a high explosive that was used in World War One. And somebody figured out

1261
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:08,800
if you take it, it makes you lose weight. And it does so by increasing your energy expenditure. So

1262
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:16,400
some people managed to cook themselves. And like literally from the inside out. And then you look

1263
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:21,760
at other drugs and most of them are psychiatric drugs. They're just repurposed psychiatric drugs

1264
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:26,640
that just happen to cause weight loss. Some psychiatric drugs cause weight gain,

1265
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:30,720
some cause weight loss. And the ones that cause weight loss, we just said, hey,

1266
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:36,560
can we repurpose these? Can we combine them to accentuate the effect? And that was kind of

1267
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:44,080
most of the history of weight loss drugs. And now for the first time, we have drugs

1268
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:50,800
that are safe and effective, FDA approved. I should say we have a drug,

1269
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:58,640
Wegavie, AKA, semaglutide, that is safe and effective and was developed for this purpose

1270
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:04,320
based on mechanism from the bottom up. So it wasn't just a haphazard discovery. So I think

1271
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:13,360
we are in a new era now where we are actually designing weight loss drugs based on mechanism.

1272
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:19,920
And so I think based on an understanding of the biological mechanisms of regulation. And so I

1273
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:29,280
think because we're out of the haphazard era and into a more targeted refined era, I think that's

1274
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:33,680
we're in a place where it becomes really important to understand mechanism. And in

1275
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:40,640
cardiovascular medicine, I'm sure you recognize this, there are incredible insights that have

1276
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:46,320
been coming out of the genetics that have resulted in therapies like the PCS skin inhibitors.

1277
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:52,080
Thank you. Thank you. I always mix the letters up. That's a great example of it where we first

1278
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:57,360
understood the biology and then we came out with the therapy and it works awesome. And so

1279
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:04,160
I think that's the era we are getting into now with obesity. So I think it actually is

1280
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:10,240
really important to understand the mechanism. I think my prediction is over time, these models

1281
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:20,160
will have more and more in common. I mean, one of the arguments against at least the way the

1282
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:25,520
carbohydrate insulin model is typically played out is actually given by semaglutide, which raises

1283
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:33,120
insulin in the short run. So one of the things we always see when we put patients on this drug is

1284
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,360
they're going to lose a ton of weight and their insulin levels go up slightly. Now, this tends to

1285
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:41,600
resolve over time. So we're long enough period of time we tend to see insulin come down. But in the

1286
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:48,960
short run for about three months, we see elevations in insulin. And we also know that it's

1287
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:54,160
increasing insulin sensitivity. So they're getting really the double effect. So we're

1288
02:22:54,240 --> 02:23:00,400
going to see a double effect. But it's hard to reconcile that with a model that would state

1289
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:08,640
insulin must go down for weight to go down, for fat to go down. Yeah, I mean, I think that model

1290
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:14,560
is just not even plausible at this point. I think if you want to say, is it a factor? I think that's

1291
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:18,560
still in play. But to say like this is the determinant, I just don't even think that's

1292
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:26,880
plausible at this point. And yeah, I mean, this class of drugs was identified based on its ability

1293
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:35,520
to increase glucose stimulated insulin secretion. That is what GLP one does. It's an incretin hormone.

1294
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:42,560
And so that was the original purpose and why it was used in type two diabetes management, because

1295
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:47,200
it gives people more insulin around meals when they really need it. Because, you know, if you

1296
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:53,760
just inject insulin, that's a really kind of crude way to manage your blood glucose. It's not

1297
02:23:53,760 --> 02:24:00,160
time specific. So GLP one gave it that much needed time specificity and also had some other

1298
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:07,600
beneficial effects. And it was only after that that they figured out that it has this big impact

1299
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:14,960
on food intake and body weight. So yeah, I mean, absolutely, I agree with that. And yeah, there's

1300
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:24,640
just a lot of other literature. I think, you know, I want to talk about, I want to like throw the

1301
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:32,560
hypothesis of bone though. I think that if you look, so if you look at genome wide association

1302
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:39,120
studies on body mass index, they're all about the brain, largely about the brain. If you look at

1303
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:48,080
genome wide association studies on body fat distribution, so you're getting rid of the BMI,

1304
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:54,000
you're controlling for BMI and you're saying, where is that fat on the body? Those have more

1305
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:01,920
of an insulin signal. So insulin pops up pretty prominently in those. And so I think there's still

1306
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:09,680
a world and you know, the distribution of fat on the body seems related to insulin signaling.

1307
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:16,080
The total amount of fat on the body seems more related to energy intake. If I remember what we

1308
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,080
talked about really at the beginning was it's not just regulated by the brain, but it's on the,

1309
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:25,760
it's more on the intake side of the equation. Yeah. And I would say, you know, even to add a

1310
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:30,720
little bit of extra nuance on top of that is we're really talking about body mass index.

1311
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:40,160
So, you know, if you consider this idea of energy partitioning, which the carbohydrate insulin model

1312
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:47,120
is all about, there could be some of that flying under the radar of body mass index. And so I don't

1313
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:52,480
think the door is closed to that. And the fact that it's showing up in body fat distribution,

1314
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:59,920
and now, you know, David Ludwig is publishing studies suggesting that there could be a

1315
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,640
correlations between baseline insulin secretion and how much, what proportion of fat loss is lost

1316
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:14,160
as fat versus lean tissue. I think, you know, there's a world in which there could be some

1317
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:21,120
energy partitioning effect. I just don't think it explains obesity, because obesity is not just

1318
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:27,040
energy partitioning. You have a bigger body, you're eating more energy, you're burning more energy,

1319
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:32,400
you have more lean mass, more fat. That phenotype is not explained by energy partitioning.

1320
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:40,000
But could there be some subtle energy partitioning phenotype that is operating also?

1321
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,520
Maybe. So that's kind of like my

1322
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:52,880
like view of how there could be a way that this has validity.

1323
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:56,240
Yeah, it's interesting. And you said something earlier about

1324
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,080
the more you restrict carbohydrate or the more you restrict fat, typically the more

1325
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:06,800
weight you're going to lose, the sweet spot, if you want to gain weight, is to have lots of both of

1326
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:12,320
them. Is that how much of that do you think comes down to the hedonic component of how good ice

1327
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:19,040
cream tastes, the ubiquity of food choices? Or do you think there's something very unique

1328
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:25,040
physiologically going on? You know, you've probably heard of the potato diet. I mean,

1329
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:30,480
all these diets just sound so stupid. But I mean, again, it's sort of one of these things. Like if

1330
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:34,800
you talk to somebody who just mainlines potatoes all day, they lose weight like crazy, right?

1331
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:42,080
Yep, absolutely. And and this has been shown really clearly in animal models, which have the

1332
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:47,520
advantage of you can get really tight control for a large portion of the animal's lifespan.

1333
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:56,240
John Speakman published a study that is the best one that's been done in animals where 29 different

1334
02:27:56,240 --> 02:28:01,840
diets, I believe, and five different strains of mice, they systematically varied carbohydrate to

1335
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:08,480
fat ratio in the diet. And they said, how does that interact with body fatness? And what they saw was

1336
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:16,960
if you start with animals that are on a low fat, high carbohydrate diet, and you start replacing

1337
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:22,800
that carb fat, they get fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter until you hit about

1338
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:30,000
60%. And then you keep increasing the fat and decreasing carbohydrate, they get slimmer again.

1339
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:36,080
And there are studies published mice lose weight on a ketogenic diet, just like humans do you can

1340
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:41,440
put mice on the diet, you can put rats on the diet, they lose weight. So it's really in the middle

1341
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:47,360
that the problem is. And which is ironic, because that's where the standard American diet is,

1342
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:52,960
if you just walk into the grocery store and just eat without any filtering, you will eat that wrong

1343
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:58,880
combination of fat and carbohydrate. Exactly. And if you look anywhere in the world where people

1344
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:04,320
are rich enough and industrialized enough to eat whatever they want, that's generally what you're

1345
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:10,960
going to see. At least after a couple decades of, you know, cultural adaptation, you're going to see

1346
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:14,800
pretty equal proportions of fat and carbohydrate. That's what you see in most parts of the world.

1347
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:24,640
And so, so why is that? Well, I think there are some hypotheses that can be considered and,

1348
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,280
and let me just be clear here that this is speculative. So I don't want to present this

1349
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:35,440
as the answer. Because I don't think we really know. But I think this is primarily a

1350
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:43,440
empirical observation that we're trying to explain. But some explanations, you could say maybe it's a

1351
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:51,040
physiological effect. So if you're not eating much carbohydrate, your body has to work a little bit

1352
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:57,280
harder to synthesize glucose, for example. So there are some physiological ways in which you're

1353
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:04,240
kind of increasing the demands a little bit, metabolic demands. Same with very low

1354
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:11,200
fat diets. You're slightly increasing metabolic demands. You have to synthesize,

1355
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:18,320
you're going to synthesize more fatty acids. And, but I don't know, I don't think that's,

1356
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:23,440
I don't think that's a great explanation because those metabolic demands are very small.

1357
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:30,000
In Speakman's experiments, did these were all ad libitum, I assume? Yes. So were they just eating,

1358
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,800
were they also significantly eating less at the extremes in terms of total energy intake? And were

1359
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:42,320
they controlled for protein? Yes. Yes. I think the answer is yes to both of those, if I'm recalling

1360
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:51,680
correctly. And although, you know, I do want to put a little asterisk on that, that sometimes there

1361
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:58,640
is not a perfectly tight correlation in rodent studies between energy intake and fat gain. So you

1362
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:04,960
can get some results where it's not fully explained by that, or in some cases not explained at all.

1363
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:13,520
So yeah, where was I? What was I saying? Lost my train of thought there.

1364
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:22,000
Well, I think we're still trying to reconcile why at the extremes your, what's the count? Is it,

1365
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,600
is it all being driven by less intake or is there some increased metabolic cost of living at the

1366
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:35,760
extremes? Yeah. So the physiology would be one and then the other would be just the neurobiology

1367
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:41,600
and the food intake. And I think that's the most satisfying explanation we have right now is that

1368
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:49,520
it is simply more appealing to eat food, more motivating to eat food that has both carbohydrate

1369
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:55,120
and fat. I'm not saying I have strong evidence that that's the explanation, but that's kind of

1370
02:31:55,120 --> 02:32:02,080
the only thing I can think of that explains it. I mean, why else? The metabolic cost of being at

1371
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:07,920
the extremes should be pretty modest. It can't explain effects of hundreds of calories a day,

1372
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:14,160
which are, which is what's observed. When you put people on a very low fat or a very low carb diet,

1373
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:20,880
their energy intake declines by hundreds of calories a day right away automatically. And so

1374
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:33,040
it's yeah, that's the only thing I can think of is that essentially the food has less implicit

1375
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:41,040
value to reward regions of the brain because of how our motivation is determined for certain

1376
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:45,840
types of food properties. The food is intrinsically less motivating and so we eat less of it.

1377
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:52,560
That's my best guess as to the main reason. And it's interesting. I mean, I think it's not very

1378
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:59,600
difficult to take your carbohydrate intake down to five to 7% like a ketogenic diet will do that.

1379
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:04,880
And it's a pretty easy diet to adhere to, especially today, harder 10 years ago when

1380
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:09,920
there were fewer sort of food choices geared towards it. But if I mean, I'm not necessarily

1381
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:14,960
saying it's an overly pleasant diet, but it's not difficult. You don't have to put a huge amount

1382
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:19,360
of effort to eat 5% of your calories and carbohydrates today. I don't even know how

1383
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:25,360
one would go about getting only 5% of their calories from fat. That is a much harder thing

1384
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:31,840
to do, is it not? Yeah, I think it would be very difficult to get that low. When you look at

1385
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:41,040
studies that test low fat diets, some of the lowest fat diets I've seen were in the kind of 10%

1386
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:52,560
fat range. I mean, even foods like whole wheat and corn have a fair amount of fat and not a

1387
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:58,400
lot of fat, but I don't remember exactly what it is, but not far off from 10% just from those

1388
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:05,360
foods that we would call starch foods. Yeah, so I think it is quite challenging to get that low

1389
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:15,600
in fat. You can do it with more refined diets like semi purified diets. It's not so hard to do that

1390
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:22,000
in rodent studies, but to design a diet that someone will actually eat as a human in a,

1391
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:26,800
randomized controlled trial or something at that level of fat intake, I think is pretty challenging.

1392
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:35,280
Yeah, I think 10% is, even 15% is not easy. I mean, you're really working hard to do it.

1393
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:40,640
I'm not convinced that there are great health benefits to that either. Probably better than

1394
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:47,520
being in the messy middle, but it's pretty hard to do. Last thing I wanted to ask you about was

1395
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:51,680
red pen reviews. Tell folks a little bit about how long you've been doing that and what's the

1396
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:59,200
frequency with which you guys put these reviews out. Yeah, so red pen reviews is a 501c3 nonprofit

1397
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:06,400
that publishes the most informative, consistent, and unbiased reviews of popular nutrition books

1398
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:14,080
available. The thing that really makes us unique is that we have developed this semi-quantitative

1399
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:22,880
review method, structured review method, that we apply to each book that yields numerical scores

1400
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:30,640
for scientific accuracy, reference accuracy, and healthfulness. Essentially what this does is,

1401
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:37,040
it allows us to apply the same rigorous method to all books such that you know

1402
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:43,360
where it's coming from, where the numbers are coming from, and you can compare and in

1403
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:49,760
apples to apples way between different books. You could say, I want to know the best book on

1404
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:56,800
topic X, and you can literally compare the scores of two books, apples to apples, and choose the one

1405
02:35:56,800 --> 02:36:04,400
that has the highest, let's say, scientific accuracy. Go ahead. I was going to say, how often

1406
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:08,400
do you do... This is a pretty labor intensive process, so how many do you bang out in a year?

1407
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:20,160
It takes us about 40 to 100 hours per book, and we have been operating since 2019, and we have 14

1408
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:28,880
reviews. I will say that our pace was quite slow last year due to COVID-related time challenges,

1409
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:36,480
so we're on target to have probably six to eight reviews published this year.

1410
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,280
We have some things going on behind the scenes that could potentially greatly accelerate that pace

1411
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:54,080
we're seeking funding. How many folks do you have that review the books? We have a total of,

1412
02:36:54,160 --> 02:37:00,480
I believe, eight reviewers right now. Each reviewer might do one a year on average.

1413
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:05,920
On average, yeah, but the way it turns out is that some people do the majority of reviews,

1414
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:11,920
and then other people only rarely do a review. How do you guys select books for review?

1415
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:19,920
We are trying to maximize our impact on public health knowledge and public health, so we really

1416
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:25,360
try to pick the books that are most impactful right now. We're looking for books that are

1417
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:30,080
selling the most. We're looking for books that are having the most social media engagement. We're

1418
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:38,480
looking for books from authors that are particularly influential, so we're really trying to give people

1419
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:44,640
information about the things that they are already interested in. What are some of the

1420
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,080
recent ones that you guys have published? Which books? Obviously, we talked about The Carnivore

1421
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:53,600
Code as one of them. Yeah, so that's one of the recent ones. Let's see, I'm just going to pull it

1422
02:37:53,600 --> 02:38:05,280
up. Redpenreviews.org. The most recent one we did was The Volumetrics Diet, Ultimate Volumetrics

1423
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:13,280
Diet by Barbara Rolls. Before that, we did The Carnivore Code. I was the primary reviewer on that.

1424
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:19,920
We have a primary reviewer and a peer reviewer. Before that, Eat, Drink and Be Healthy by Walter

1425
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:28,080
Willett. Before that, Eat Fat Gets In by Mark Hyman. That's a taste of some of the ones that we've been

1426
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:35,520
doing. Given that you've been doing this for three years now, anything surprised you so far? Were

1427
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:40,160
there any that you went in thinking, yeah, this seems like it's going to be a pretty good book,

1428
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:43,840
and you came away thinking, no, they really didn't get this right, and vice versa, where you

1429
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:47,200
went into it thinking this is going to be nonsense, and you came out thinking, actually, they've

1430
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:56,080
changed my view on something? Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the things that has really come into

1431
02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:04,640
focus through the course of this process is that credentials are not a reliable correlate of

1432
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:14,720
information quality. There are people that have MDs and, like David Perlmutter, he's a board

1433
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:21,600
certified neurologist, and his book Grain Brain got the lowest scientific accuracy score of any

1434
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:27,040
book we've reviewed. I'm not trying to pick on anybody in particular, but that's just an example

1435
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:33,840
of the credentials not lining up with the scientific accuracy. We've seen that in many cases.

1436
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:41,040
I would say probably there is some correlation there, so I think credentials, they're not

1437
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:48,160
completely meaningless, but once you get into people who are highly credentialed, it's just highly

1438
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:53,680
variable. Some of their books do really well, some of their books do really poorly. That's been

1439
02:39:54,400 --> 02:40:01,680
somewhat of a surprise to me. I think most people who are educated in this sphere know that there's

1440
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:09,680
a lot of low quality information in the sphere, but I think you can't help but be shocked sometimes

1441
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:17,920
at just how bad the situation is. Even people, and we know in science there's a replicability

1442
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:24,640
crisis, so scientists are not infallible. There's problems like this even in this peer-reviewed

1443
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:31,760
literature, but once you get outside of the sphere where there's accountability and you're

1444
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:35,760
in the public sphere where there's very little accountability, it's like a free-for-all.

1445
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:44,720
Many people, even those who are well credentialed, share information that is very low quality and

1446
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:51,520
there's very, most people have very little ability to detect it. Even somebody like me who I consider

1447
02:40:51,520 --> 02:41:00,240
myself knowledgeable, at least in some areas, I can get taken in too. Maybe I might read a book

1448
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:04,320
and it seems compelling. I'll tell you the carnivore code. It did worse than I expected.

1449
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:10,960
As I was reading it, there were parts where I was like, yeah, this is interesting. I'm going to

1450
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:18,000
look into this. This is kind of making sense to me. It wasn't until I started checking the citations

1451
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,000
and doing scientific literature searches where I was just like, no, this is really not

1452
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:33,120
the best interpretation that an unbiased person would come to looking at this body of evidence.

1453
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:44,960
I think there have been many surprises and most of them were updates in the direction of thinking

1454
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:49,200
that the state of popular nutrition books is actually even worse than I thought.

1455
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:56,320
Well, it's interesting. I'm in the process of trying to finish my book and one of the things

1456
02:41:56,320 --> 02:42:05,440
that is so daunting is the fact-checking process. I don't know what an author relies on because

1457
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:09,840
I could certainly never rely on my publisher to fact-check my book.

1458
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:19,040
It's too technical. They don't have people with the knowledge to do the fact-check. I have to have

1459
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:26,080
analysts who work for me fact-check, but they have to be analysts who had no help in doing the

1460
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:32,400
research for the book because you have to get fresh eyes on it. I think that means my book will come

1461
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:37,520
out more accurate than it probably would otherwise. Yet that's very difficult. I mean,

1462
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:44,960
I just know there's going to be something we get wrong. We're going to either incorrectly cite

1463
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:49,520
something or we're going to have misinterpreted it or something like that. I feel like we're

1464
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:57,760
in as good a position as almost anybody can be given the size of our team. Yet it's still very

1465
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:03,920
daunting. There's something about a book that is daunting in the sense that, and you know this,

1466
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,480
you've written a book from the time you put your last, last, last edit into a book until it hits

1467
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:13,200
the shelves is about eight months. Something's going to change in those eight months. Even if

1468
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:19,120
it was perfect the day you finished it, which I think is impossible, eight months later it's not,

1469
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:28,160
let alone two years later. Yeah, absolutely. I agree with that. Every book's going to have

1470
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:34,800
mistakes. The process that you described is, I guarantee, far more rigorous than

1471
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:45,120
most books that are being published in the sphere. As you said, publishers do not impose a filter

1472
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:51,760
on the contents of these books. I mean, very little of one. They just simply do not view it as their

1473
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:58,720
job to police the claims of authors. If somebody comes in with an MD, for example, their position

1474
02:43:58,720 --> 02:44:02,960
is, and this is literally what my publisher told me, they're like, you're the expert,

1475
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:16,160
we're not experts, we are not here to check your work. For me, my process was, I sent each chapter

1476
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:22,160
out to experts in the field and had them look at it. Does that mean my book has no mistakes?

1477
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:30,160
Absolutely not. I've been cataloging my mistakes on my mistakes page on my website, the ones that

1478
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:36,560
I know about. I think that's inevitable. I've accepted the fact that that's going to be the

1479
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:42,800
only way I'll sleep at night is just acknowledging 5% of this stuff is going to be wrong. Let's

1480
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:47,520
collectively figure out what it is and let's create a repository where we can put the updates.

1481
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:52,000
I think that's absolutely the best attitude because not only is that a truth seeking attitude,

1482
02:44:52,000 --> 02:45:00,240
but you are putting yourself in a position where you're not presenting yourself as someone who has

1483
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:06,000
to be right to be rational. You're presenting yourself as someone who's trying to get towards

1484
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:12,720
the truth and your audience can help you and help all together to get closer to the truth.

1485
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:22,720
That's the attitude that I like to cultivate as well. One thing I want to mention in this context

1486
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:30,960
is that the method that we developed for Red Pen Reviews is available on our website for authors to

1487
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:37,600
see. Part of the reason why we do that is because we're trying to help authors

1488
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:48,320
write better books. We do random citation checks. That's one aspect of it. We have certain criteria

1489
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:53,920
for healthfulness. We have certain criteria for scientific accuracy and it can't be gained.

1490
02:45:55,120 --> 02:46:00,720
I don't think our method can be gained. If you look at our criteria and you write a book

1491
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:08,160
that fulfills that you think would score well, that's going to be a good book from an evidence

1492
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:15,040
standpoint. I don't think it can be gained. When I think about me and my book, which came prior to

1493
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:20,560
the Red Pen Reviews, I would have loved to have this resource. I think if I had had it, I would

1494
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:29,200
have written a book with higher evidence quality. Knowing that there's accountability and having

1495
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:36,800
a method that helps you turn that into something concrete to improve what you're doing,

1496
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:45,680
I like to view our organization as not just being finger-wagging at people who make mistakes,

1497
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:55,040
but more also providing a resource to help the information quality be good from the beginning.

1498
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:58,960
Tell me, are the reviews available to everyone or only to donors?

1499
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:06,640
Yeah, absolutely. They are freely available to anyone. We love receiving donations, but

1500
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:11,200
access to our resources does not depend on that.

1501
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:18,480
Excellent. Well, Stefan, this has been super interesting. I always enjoy interacting with

1502
02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:26,240
you and talking about all of these things. I think it is kind of amazing how much we still

1503
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:33,840
don't know about something that is so ubiquitous and so important. But I also get the sense we're

1504
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:40,320
kind of converging. I do think that these good faith debates that exist between people

1505
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:49,120
like you, Kevin, David Ludwig, I think they're really good for the field because I think it's

1506
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:55,040
forcing people to be sharper in their thinking. And ultimately, I think getting us closer to

1507
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:01,920
theories that are aligning better with experimental evidence. I know my thinking on this has changed

1508
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:10,240
quite a bit and I certainly find now the balance of the evidence more on the energy balance side

1509
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:17,760
of the equation. But I constantly enjoy just trying to understand both sides of this. And

1510
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:23,680
it's very complicated. Again, suggesting that there's more overlap than we probably appreciate.

1511
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:29,440
Yeah, well, I appreciate you having me on. It was fun to discuss all this stuff.

1512
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:43,040
Yeah, thanks, Stefan. Thank you.
