00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Hey, Shereen. It's great to finally meet you. Not in person, but better than being on the

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,720
phone, I guess.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,880
Yes, same here.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,800
So, you know, people on this podcast have probably heard me in a couple of episodes

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,520
reference this thing called DBT. I've never really gone into much detail about it, but

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,360
it's something I've wanted to obviously have a dedicated podcast around, and now we're

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
finally going to get to do that. So, I mean, I guess maybe we can just start by kind of

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,520
defining what it is a little bit before we get into its history, its founder, your involvement,

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,400
and things like that. So, if you were at a party and somebody said, Shereen, I heard

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,320
that you're a DBT therapist and a practitioner. Can you tell me what that is? What would you say?

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:06,000
Sure. So, DBT stands for Dialectical Behavior Therapy, abbreviated DBT, and it's a form of

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,240
therapy or a form of talk therapy that is largely inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy,

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,280
also abbreviated as CBT. So, we often say that DBT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that was designed for individuals that have complex mental health problems and originally

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,480
designed for individuals that are suicidal or self-harming and who may meet criteria for a

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,800
disorder called borderline personality disorder. So, at its simplest, I would say it's a form of

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,400
cognitive behavioral therapy that was designed for more complex people or presentations. But then,

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,160
of course, there's a lot more nuance beyond that. Yeah, which we'll certainly get into.

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,840
Maybe give people a bit of background on what cognitive behavioral therapy is. I mean, that

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,160
term I've heard a lot, but truthfully, I don't know much about CBT outside of CBT-I,

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,040
which is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which we have referred, I would say,

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,680
over the past five or six years, probably a dozen of our patients to CBT-I practitioners.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,120
And I think I can say without exception, it has always proved to be incredibly valuable,

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,160
not just incrementally valuable, but incredibly valuable. But that's the very limited experience

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,440
that I have with CBT is through that one narrow lens. Is there something more broadly we can say

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:53,120
about CBT that then allows us to contrast it with DBT? Yeah, so CBT refers to maybe a class of

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,480
talk therapy and could often be used to contrast with other kinds of talk therapy. But some of the

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,520
distinguishing features of cognitive behavioral therapy is that it's present focused, so focused

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,840
on what's happening for people right now in terms of the problems they're experiencing, and less

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:23,440
focused on one's history, one's childhood, less focused on the sorts of things that have led to

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,200
the person experiencing the problems that they're experiencing. So it's present focused, and it's,

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,440
as the name implied, it's focused on working with thoughts and behaviors that go along with the

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,440
problems that people experience. So in CBT-I, for example, it would be, you know, what are the

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,160
thoughts that are contributing to your insomnia? And how do we work on modifying or changing those

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,080
thoughts that you're having in order to increase the likelihood that you fall asleep, or stay asleep?

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,440
What are the behaviors that you do that promote sleep? What are the behaviors that you do that

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,080
get in the way of sleep? And how do we modify that? So at its most concrete level, it really is

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,160
working with thoughts and behaviors that, in the present, that are contributing to your problems

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,160
right now. So it's very much an active problem-solving approach. And I think what is, with people who

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,240
don't have a lot of experience with therapy or receiving mental health treatment, they might have

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,080
an idea, based on the media or TV or movies, that the best therapy is one where you just go in and

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,640
talk about whatever is on your mind. And CBT and similarly, DBT is much more structured and guided

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,840
than that. And the other distinguishing feature I will say about CBT and DBT is that

45
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:05,120
it's evidence-based, meaning that we construct treatments in a way that we could measure

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,920
its effectiveness. And if we find that something is not effective for people, then it's not likely

47
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,400
to stay in the therapy. That's our goal, anyway, is to be as empirical and scientific in our approach

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:29,360
as possible. So how long has CBT been around as a discipline? I would say it emerged, you know,

49
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,080
probably the figure that is associated with the beginning of CBT is a man named Aaron Beck,

50
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,960
who died last year, I believe, at the age of 100. And so he, or something like that number,

51
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:54,000
I would say it was probably the 60s in which he first started developing his form of cognitive

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,280
therapy. He was trained as a psychoanalyst and was seeing that it wasn't all that useful for a lot of

53
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,920
the patients that he was treating in psychiatry. And so he started developing an approach that was

54
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,640
much more about changing the way people thought about themselves and others.

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,200
So let's talk about Marcia, who is obviously Marcia Lindhen, who's, you know,

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think it's safe to say really the creator and founder of DBT, is that a fair statement?

57
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
Yes, for sure.

58
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,120
So tell me about her journey. Presumably, she had tried CBT both as a patient and maybe even

59
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,720
as a therapist before realizing that there was a way that it could be improved upon for at least

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
a subset of patients and or a subset of problems. Would that be kind of a fair statement?

61
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah, so the origin story of DBT was that originally Marcia set out to apply what might

62
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,880
be considered standard CBT to folks who were chronically suicidal. And this was, you know,

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:11,360
and this was, you know, perhaps beginning in the 70s. She was receiving advanced training at

64
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,440
Stony Brook in New York. At that time, Stony Brook was considered one of the premier places to

65
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:28,880
learn and apply behavior therapy. And back in the days of the 70s, 80s, there was really the heyday

66
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,760
of behaviorism. And the idea was, in some ways, in many ways oversimplified. But the idea was that

67
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:44,240
we could treat any mental health problem with behavior therapy in very few sessions just by

68
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,920
applying these, you know, standard principles of what we know about behavior change.

69
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,240
By the way, can you give me an example of what that would be? So does that mean that if

70
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,760
if a person was clinically depressed and came in and they were suicidal, what would the CBT

71
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,560
approach have been in the 70s or 80s to address that concern?

72
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,320
Well, I might if I can come back to depression and suicide in a minute, but I might start with

73
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,760
anxiety disorders, because this is actually what behavior therapy and CBT was probably most

74
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,720
prolific about in those days. And the idea was that you could have somebody who came into

75
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,760
treatment with a fear of something, a phobia, it could be something like a fear of heights,

76
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,240
or a fear of spiders, or it could be a fear of social situations, social anxiety, and the

77
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,280
behavior therapy approach to this or the cognitive behavioral therapy approach to this would be

78
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:54,640
to teach people competing thoughts. So rather than thinking this thing will kill me,

79
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,360
I can learn to have thoughts like, I can tolerate this, this might be difficult, but I can

80
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,120
handle it, or even have thoughts like this is not going to kill me. But those thoughts

81
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,080
were only one part of it. The other piece of it was the more behavioral piece, which is

82
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,360
exposure, basically saying that how you're going to get over your fear of spiders is not to talk

83
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,160
about it every week for an hour with somebody, but it's actually going to be coming into contact

84
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:41,040
with spiders repeatedly, over and over again, so that you learn that you can handle it. But you

85
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,840
also learn that the fear outcome is not going to occur. So that was some of those...

86
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,280
Change your thoughts and get exposure, change your thoughts, get exposure.

87
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,520
Exactly. And the getting exposure is changing your behavior because you want to run away or avoid,

88
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,800
and instead it's saying come into contact with approach, something that you want to avoid.

89
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Right. And so what they were finding in these early days of applying CBT is saying

90
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,880
people may have gone to psychoanalysis, which was the dominant paradigm of therapy in those days.

91
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,560
And by the way, this is almost exclusively a rich white person issue when I'm talking about

92
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,240
who was receiving treatment for mental health problems. That's what I'm talking about back in

93
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:45,280
those days, largely. And so people could go to a psychoanalysis, a psychoanalyst, and talk about

94
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:56,640
their fears for months and years and not necessarily do better with them. And so CBT comes along and

95
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,280
says, actually, we could do this sometimes, depending on what the fear is in one session.

96
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,040
There were people who would do like a three hour session to, quote unquote, cure somebody of a

97
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,200
phobia. And they were finding that it worked. And so then you say, okay, how do we take those

98
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,400
principles to something like depression? And this is what Aaron Beck started to do with cognitive

99
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,400
therapy more, was noticing that people who have depression tend to think in very particular ways.

100
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:41,680
They have negative interpretations of almost everything, right? And also about themselves,

101
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,440
about their future, about others. And so a cognitive behavioral approach to depression

102
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,680
would be about working on changing those thoughts to be more balanced and evidence-based. And then

103
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
also the behavior change that goes along with depression is usually about getting active.

104
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:10,240
So when somebody is depressed, the tendency is to retreat, shut down, avoid. And the behavioral

105
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,920
treatments for depression would be to get people activated and to solve the problems that are

106
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,160
causing the depression, whether it's unhappiness with a job, unhappiness with a relationship,

107
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,040
and work on targeting the problems that are causing depression in a systematic way.

108
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,680
How successful was it? You mentioned earlier that evidence is a very important part of this.

109
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,680
How were they able to tally the results and determine if their intervention

110
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
was in fact better than the standard of care at the time?

111
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,560
Right. So the history of psychotherapy trials is largely based on a paradigm known as randomized

112
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:02,080
clinical trials, where you would recruit individuals who meet certain inclusion criteria,

113
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,800
say somebody meets the diagnosis for depression, and then you would randomize them to either, say,

114
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,600
receive 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy or receive nothing. And then you would

115
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:25,120
nothing or receive treatment as usual or standard of care and then evaluate outcomes over time.

116
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,840
And with things like depression and anxiety disorders, there are these standard measures

117
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:41,200
that are popular within our field, where we have developed benchmarks for what we're trying to get

118
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,200
to, what might be considered a success. And I would say that in general, the trials for CBT

119
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,720
for things like depression and anxiety are overwhelmingly positive, meaning that most of

120
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:02,800
the trials, especially in the early days when you were comparing CBT to nothing or treatment as usual,

121
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:12,000
found very large effects for CBT in those settings. Now, I think where we see or where

122
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,480
we'll come back to Marsha emerging is recognizing that, of course, none of these treatments were

123
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,800
100% successful for everybody. And more than that is that when you look at these studies and you see

124
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,760
who were these studies done with, the inclusion criteria, meaning what allowed somebody to be

125
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,920
in the study, were often quite narrow. For example, with a depression study, the person

126
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,120
might have to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression, but not have suicidal behavior.

127
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:56,000
So people with suicidal behavior may be excluded from a lot of those studies, which makes sense

128
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
from a research point of view in some contexts. But in other contexts, doesn't make sense because

129
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,200
of course we know that a lot of people who experience depression are also suicidal. So

130
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,200
if you're removing suicidal people or not allowing suicidal people to be part of this research,

131
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,240
then we don't know ultimately if the treatments work for those populations.

132
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,520
So when did, I mean Marsha as a young girl, I think was diagnosed with schizophrenia,

133
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,120
is that correct? And was treated with electroconvulsive therapy and all sorts of things that

134
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,120
are still used today, but probably not as frequently and probably with a bit more

135
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,880
particular attention to the use case, probably used more liberally than I'm guessing.

136
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,600
So Marsha was a teenager, I believe, at the time that she was receiving

137
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,680
a lot of treatment. And this was in the late 60s, if I'm, no, wait, if I'm remembering correctly,

138
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:03,440
what, when she was born now that I'm thinking about it. But it was before CBT was really in

139
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:17,280
the picture. And she was sent away, hospitalized for being suicidal and chronic, and she was

140
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:24,240
chronically self-injuring, doing a number of things to cause physical harm to herself as a way

141
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,000
of relieving emotional intensity and overwhelming emotions. And so at the time, there was not

142
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,880
a lot of treatment options that were available. And the medical model was to treat with really

143
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:48,400
strong meds, you know, antipsychotic meds at the time, or to use something like electroconvulsive

144
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:55,360
therapy. And so those were the treatments that she was exposed to from a very young age,

145
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,880
in addition to therapy. But the types of therapy that she was receiving at that time

146
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,480
were unlikely to be, you know, anything like the cognitive behavioral treatment we know today.

147
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,800
So how did she find her way from being almost institutionalized to eventually, you know,

148
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,520
getting an education and herself becoming a therapist? What was that journey that went from

149
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,720
that teenage girl to kind of the person who created DBT?

150
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,840
Yeah, so she has written about this in a memoir as well as described it in a piece in which she,

151
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,360
in the New York Times, which was a piece where she kind of came out to the world as having

152
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,800
been someone who experienced her own struggles, significant struggles with mental health. And I

153
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,840
say that as a preface because for that article in the New York Times came out, I believe in 2010,

154
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:04,720
2011. So for most of her career, she was not forthcoming about this, her own personal

155
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,080
struggles. She would tell people that were close to her new, her students, I was one of them,

156
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,440
knew about this experience, but she wasn't public about it. And she would long say that the reason

157
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:28,720
for that is because she wanted DBT to be judged on its merit empirically. She did not want

158
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:38,320
DBT to be judged on her personal story alone. She wanted this to be a scientific treatment that

159
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:48,720
lives and dies by its outcome, she would say. So when she would talk about how DBT developed

160
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:59,520
to the public, she would talk about it in leaving out this earlier part of her own history. So the

161
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:07,840
earlier part of her own history that she describes is that she had a spiritual moment when she was in

162
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:18,800
one of these institutions. And the spiritual moment was that she describes experiencing

163
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:28,720
God in a very dark moment of her own life. And in that moment, she realized that she could,

164
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,160
she felt the love of God and felt that she could serve this purpose in life, which is

165
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,240
to get out of hell, her own experience, and then to work her entire life to get other people out of

166
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:54,480
hell. And that was how she took this spiritual experience and developed her life's work based on

167
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,560
that. Now another reason why she did it. How old was she, Shereen at that time? I would say

168
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,400
I would say as best I remember in her early late teens or early twenties.

169
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,080
Kind of profound to follow through on something that you could argue,

170
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,560
well, God, you were still so young when that was happening. And was she at some point here

171
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,040
diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder as well? Or is that something that

172
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,640
is more retrospective where it's sort of like looking back, she was probably misdiagnosed as

173
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,160
having schizophrenia. I mean, what was the state of understanding of her actual condition?

174
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:47,440
So I believe that she was probably, you still see this today, but when people are unclear about how

175
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,040
to explain someone's problems, they get given almost every diagnosis in the book. And now this

176
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,640
would have been before the criteria that we now know is borderline personality disorder being

177
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:10,240
defined in the way it is most well known would have started in the third edition of the DSM,

178
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,720
which came out in about 1980. So the criteria that we have now to define borderline personality

179
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,400
disorder was not the same as when she was receiving treatment. So I believe that she

180
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,640
had a number of diagnoses attributed to her. I can't remember, it's quite possible that

181
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,000
borderline personality disorder was one of them, because of course, that's also the diagnosis that

182
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,520
they give people when they don't know how to treat them. And so it wouldn't surprise me.

183
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,120
And what are the criteria? Tell folks what borderline personality disorder is today. What

184
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:53,040
do we know today? Yeah, so borderline personality disorder is considered a complex mental health

185
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:02,640
disorder that is defined as meeting. There are nine criteria of borderline personality disorder

186
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,640
as defined by the DSM. And in order to meet criteria or to have the condition, you have to

187
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,440
endorse five of the nine, which actually means that ultimately, it's a really heterogeneous

188
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,840
disorder, because there's all these different combinations and different ways in which one

189
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:31,120
can meet criteria. One of the things that Marsha did was to restructure the different criteria

190
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,720
of borderline personality disorder in a way that perhaps is more understandable and also makes more

191
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,360
cohesive sense. And to say that it's a disorder of dysregulation across a number of different

192
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,440
domains. So the core domain of dysregulation that we see in borderline personality disorder is what

193
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,960
we refer to as emotion dysregulation. And this is largely defined by people's experience of emotions

194
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,640
as feeling like they have very intense emotions, they don't feel like they can control their

195
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:13,120
emotions very well, their emotions change very rapidly. So that's referred to as affective

196
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:21,600
lability, that the emotions will go from set intense sadness to intense shame to fear to joy,

197
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:31,200
you know, very quickly and seemingly without a lot of reason. So emotion dysregulation is part

198
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,640
and considered core to the disorder of borderline personality disorder. And then these other domains

199
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:45,920
of dysregulation stem from emotion dysregulation and include behavior dysregulation. So not having

200
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,720
control over or feeling like you don't have control over your behaviors. This is associated

201
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,960
with a lot of impulsivity and behaviors that go along with impulsivity. So substance use,

202
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:10,480
reckless spending, impulsive sexual behavior, impulsive driving, you know, behaviors that are

203
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,400
experienced as impulsive and potentially could cause problems for the person. Impulsive eating

204
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,920
is another domain. I mean, it sounds like there's quite an overlap, at least in some of those with

205
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,200
bipolar disorder, right? Bipolar one, where you could sort of see, I don't know about the

206
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,600
affective lability, but certainly the mania side of it sounds like it might be consistent with some

207
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,280
of that dysregulation. I'm guessing that's what makes psychiatry so difficult is you don't have

208
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:48,320
biomarkers, you don't have imaging scans that give you diagnoses, right? Right. We don't. And so there

209
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,800
is, you're right, a lot of overlap and actually probably the ones, the overlap that is more

210
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:02,000
consistent or difficult to discriminate as bipolar two, because bipolar one is associated with

211
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,240
the depression, longer, longer lengths of either a pure manic state or a pure depressed state. Bipolar

212
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:19,600
two might have manic states, but it is shorter in duration or might not be, you know, super manic,

213
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:29,040
right, as high. And so that's often really hard to discriminate from somebody who has borderline

214
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,520
personality disorder. And generally what we're talking about with BPD as opposed to bipolar is

215
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:44,800
that we actually see the mood changes happening more frequently within BPD than with bipolar two.

216
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,360
But I'm probably oversimplifying, but that's what I would be looking for if I was trying to

217
00:25:49,360 --> 00:26:00,320
assess the difference between the two. A person with BPD, what are the challenges that they face

218
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,680
in the world, right? If this is a, let's just assume this is a person of totally normal intelligence

219
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,040
and other, all physical capabilities are fine. And this is sort of the one issue, this one

220
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,040
psychological issue. How does it manifest itself for that person when they're in school, when they're

221
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,680
in college, if they get married, if they have kids, like help us understand how this condition

222
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,600
makes life more difficult for the individual and those around them. Yes. So one thing I'll say is

223
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,120
that you rarely will see this condition in isolation of anything else. And again, this speaks to one

224
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,000
of the complexities of trying to study psychiatry that I think on average people who meet criteria

225
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,320
for BPD have three to four other mental health problems at the same time. So they'll also meet

226
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,280
criteria for depression or an anxiety disorder or a substance use disorder or an eating disorder.

227
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,720
And those things aren't stemming from the BPD. These things are, we believe independently there

228
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,920
as well. Well, I think it depends on who you ask because I would say as somebody who is trained

229
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:21,120
mostly behaviorally, I would say the diagnosis matters less than how we conceptualize these

230
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,320
problems. And to that point, I would agree with you. We could say emotion dysregulation is central

231
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,960
to all of those things, but the diagnostic system as we currently have it does not allow for that.

232
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,560
So they would say, if somebody meets criteria for these other disorders, they also have these other

233
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:46,000
disorders. So how somebody with borderline personality disorder lives their lives, I would

234
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:59,520
say it's complicated because on the one end of the continuum, we see people who have severe problems

235
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:07,120
associated with BPD such that they struggle to hold on to a job so they don't work and they're

236
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:16,880
on disability or receiving social security. They can't maintain relationships. So they're very

237
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,520
isolated. And why is that? Why are relationships blowing up and why are they not able to hold down

238
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,640
a job? What's the fundamental issue or fundamental issues that are impairing them?

239
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,520
From a DBT perspective, we would say that it all comes back to difficulty regulating emotions.

240
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:50,000
So that if I experience intense emotions that I feel like I can't control, when I get angry,

241
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:02,240
I lash out. When I get scared, I run away or avoid. Or I have emotion dys... One of the

242
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,440
criteria that goes along with BPD that you could see as tied with emotion dysregulation problems

243
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:16,080
is what's referred to as fears of abandonment. So a person with BPD often will have a lot of fear

244
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:25,920
that a person that they love or are close to will leave them. And if I am in a relationship

245
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:34,320
where I am afraid that the other person is going to leave me all the time, that may cause me to

246
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:44,560
behave in ways that are frantic, chaotic, and actually paradoxically have the effect of causing

247
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,360
the other person to be more likely to leave. Texting the person, calling the person relentlessly.

248
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:01,760
If a person doesn't come home or call at the time that they say they will, having the experience of

249
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,040
feeling like I'm losing it because I don't know where that person is or perhaps they've left me.

250
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:15,600
As a result, if I have BPD, I experience intense fear, intense shame, intense sadness, and now I

251
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:23,920
don't know what to do with this intense behavior. And I may self-injure as a way of leaving that

252
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:32,400
emotional intensity. Or I may threaten suicide as a way of getting the person to come back to me.

253
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
And maybe I'm doing this without even having awareness that that's the effect of my behavior.

254
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,600
I just know that in this moment, I don't know what to do. I feel entirely out of control,

255
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,960
and I need to do something to fix it in this moment. What is the

256
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,600
mortality of BPD? I was very surprised to learn recently that anorexia nervosa has probably the

257
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,680
highest mortality of any psychiatric condition. I would have guessed depression, presumably.

258
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,240
But where does BPD stand in terms of mortality, either through self-harm and neglect potentially,

259
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,920
or obviously suicide? I sometimes get into the weeds a little bit about this. And when,

260
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,440
as an academic and psychologist, what I find, and someone who studies suicide,

261
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:35,680
I review a lot of manuscripts and grant proposals, and I am always saddened and amused

262
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,920
when I see people write about a disorder and say, this disorder has one of the highest rates of

263
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,040
suicide. Because if you look at it, it seems like every disorder has one of the highest rates of

264
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,960
suicide. And I think it's because we don't know how to study this very well, honestly. We don't know

265
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:03,600
how to determine of the people who die by suicide what are the mental health conditions

266
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,360
that they had, and what is the relative risk according to these different disorders.

267
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,640
Especially when you overlap, because as you said earlier, if a person with BPD also suffers

268
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,560
significant depression, if they commit suicide, are we attributing that to depression?

269
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,800
So, no, I think my question more broadly is knowing that one could never tease that out,

270
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,880
how risky is it for an individual understanding all of the comorbidities that tend to cluster with it?

271
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:43,520
I will say it's very high. And one way in which I can answer this is that another criteria for

272
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:55,520
for BPD is repeated or chronic self-injury or suicide attempts. And upwards more than 75%

273
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,000
of people, and in some studies 90 to 95% of people who meet criteria for borderline personality

274
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,160
disorder, engage in self-injury or have made more than one suicide attempt in their lives.

275
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:19,520
And this tells us a couple of things. One is that on its own is considered a very high risk

276
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,800
behavior because people who engage in self-injury, even if they don't intend to die,

277
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,800
there could be accidental death as a result of self-injury.

278
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
What are some examples, I mean, people probably think of the most common examples of people

279
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,480
cutting themselves or burning themselves. What are some other examples of self-injurious behavior

280
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:51,040
that people engage in? Head banging or punching or hitting oneself. There are multiple forms of

281
00:33:51,040 --> 00:34:01,280
cutting that include different objects to cut, but could also be people really intensely scratching

282
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:08,400
themselves to the point where they draw blood. There's overdosing is considered a form of

283
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:17,200
self-injury, especially if it's or you have to determine is this with intent to die or not,

284
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,280
but there are people who overdose without intent to die as a way of hurting themselves.

285
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:33,040
There's also more rare, but other forms of self-injury may involve ingesting toxic substances,

286
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,760
et cetera. So this has also, I think, evolved over time, or we didn't know how to study it

287
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,920
very well over the years because even in my career, I feel like 20 years ago when we were

288
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,280
talking about self-injury, we were talking much more about things like cutting or burning.

289
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,520
I feel like as there have been more people interested in studying self-injury,

290
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:10,080
we're also finding out about other ways in which people cause harm to themselves. Then there's all

291
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:16,240
sorts of debates about whether this is considered self-injury or not because some people might say,

292
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,560
I have binge eating or I overeat and I do that intentionally even though I know it's causing

293
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:33,200
harm to myself. Whether we classify that diagnostically as self-harm or not is one

294
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,720
question, but whether a person considers themselves actively doing harm to themselves,

295
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,200
that's another question. What's the male-female split in BPD?

296
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,520
Yeah. So that's another thing that's changed over time. It was long thought to be a female

297
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:58,560
disorder and there's all sorts of reasons for that. A lot of them are sexist. Now we

298
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,280
see more studies that indicate that there are roughly equivalent rates among men and women.

299
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:18,480
However, there's still a diagnostic bias for tending to diagnose women more often as BPD

300
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,760
intending not to diagnose men with BPD. So does that mean underdiagnosing men over diagnosing

301
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,200
women potentially? I think so. I think the underdiagnosing of men has been shown in a number of

302
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,040
studies and it appears that men have to be more severe in order to receive the diagnosis

303
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,480
than women. Whether women are over diagnosed, I'm not sure, but I think it's very rare that you would

304
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:57,920
see a psychiatrist or a medical professional do a diagnostic assessment. I think it's much more

305
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:06,480
likely that they base that diagnosis on is this person difficult in some way. So when you look at

306
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:14,160
the twin concordant studies of things ranging from autism to depression, you see a very strong

307
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,240
genetic component to these things. Do you have a sense of how strong the genetic link is for BPD,

308
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,880
presumably based on these identical twin discordant studies, identical twins raised separately and

309
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,720
looking at the prevalence. How much of this is genetic and then how much of this is environmental

310
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,800
where life events trigger a susceptible individual to manifest the traits?

311
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
So I don't know the data off the top of my head about the twin concordants, but I would say there's

312
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,360
a general understanding that there is of course a genetic component to this disorder.

313
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:02,400
And I would say that the DBT framework is one that has a model for explaining how BPD

314
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,120
develops, which we can probably get into, but that speaks to the fact that there is both a

315
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,800
genetic and an environmental component to the development of the disorder.

316
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,920
So let's go back to Marcia in her journey. So she has this, you know, literally come to Jesus,

317
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
right? So she has this kind of epiphany in her late teens or early twenties,

318
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
which it sounds like, you know, puts her on a different path, potentially saves her life.

319
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,840
It's still a long way from there to where we are today. So walk us through that journey.

320
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:49,760
Right. So this is where it picks up in terms of the story that is part of the development of

321
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:58,800
DBT story. So now leaving out her own personal history, you know, Marcia went on to get a degree

322
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,880
in, I mean, I should also point out that I think one of the factors that led to Marcia being able

323
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:13,360
to do this is that I think she's hands down a genius. And so that was probably despite her

324
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:24,240
really difficult experiences. She had this amazing capacity for, you know, thought that helped her,

325
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,600
I'm sure, in numerous ways, including developing this treatment. But so she went on to get a degree

326
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,840
in social psychology, a social psychology PhD, which is a little known fact about her that she's

327
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,680
not a clinic. She doesn't have a degree in clinical psychology, but she got her social

328
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,720
psychology degree, but then decided that she wanted to get clinical training. And that's what

329
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:55,040
led her to this training experience at Stony Brook, which is where they were doing a lot of work

330
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,440
on theory and treatment related to cognitive behavioral treatments for a range of disorders.

331
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,080
And at that time, nobody was studying cognitive behavioral treatment for suicidal populations.

332
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:16,480
And so Marcia decided, I want to take what we know about CBT that seems to be hugely effective

333
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,720
for all of these disorders. And I want to take all that we know about CBT and just plop it into

334
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,840
treating chronically suicidal individuals. The way she reports it is saying she wasn't interested at

335
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,880
that time in diagnosis, she just wanted to work with people who chronically experienced urges to

336
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:45,360
die. And so that's what she attempted to do. And by her accounts, this quickly blew up.

337
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,280
And just for timing, this is kind of, I'm guessing this is now the early 80s?

338
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,560
Yes. Late 70s, early 80s when she did her fellowship there.

339
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,800
And do we have a sense of how she is treating herself at this point? In other words, how is

340
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,520
she regulating her own emotions? Are the tools of CBT things that she is finding helpful for her own

341
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,600
self-care? This is a great question. And I'm not sure I know what the answer is. And what's

342
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:22,400
interesting is that I think that what Marcia did was she took a lot of her own experiences,

343
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:30,160
and then she was able to translate that into cognitive behavioral terms, which led to the

344
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,960
development of a lot of the skills in the in DBT that she developed for people. Whether she was

345
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
thinking at the time about applying CBT to herself, I don't know. But I think that that's

346
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,960
what she ended up doing by developing these. So she sort of became the index case, right?

347
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,160
She was sort of not necessarily thinking it this way, but she was working out the tools of how do

348
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,200
you transition. I sort of liken that to what Bruce Lee did. I don't know how familiar you are

349
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,640
with Bruce Lee, but most people sort of know him as kind of a movie star in martial arts. But he

350
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,720
was far more relevant in creating a system of martial arts called Jeet Kune Do, which took from

351
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,480
over 30 different other styles of martial arts and in his words, took what was useful and discarded

352
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,200
what was useless and sort of created a new system with a very particular goal, by the way.

353
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,200
So he had a very clear objective in what Jeet Kune Do was to be about. And in some ways,

354
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,400
it's almost like that's what Marcia was doing on herself, right? Yes, on herself and also in her

355
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,520
treatment development work, which is a very iterative process like, let me try this. Does

356
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,960
this work? I'll keep it. Does it not work? I'll throw it out. If it works, what is it? How do I

357
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:09,360
define it? How do I write about it in a way that other people can do it? And put it all together

358
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,480
in a package. Again, I think this speaks to how brilliant I think she is that she could do it,

359
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,600
but it does align with what you're describing, which is really, and what's I think really

360
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,800
exciting about treatment development work is this whole process of figuring it out as you go

361
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,440
and then trying to replicate it and really using the client's experience to say,

362
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,000
is this having the intended effect? So I interrupted you, but let's go back to Marcia

363
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:51,040
at Stony Brook and finding out that CBT in its current form is not helping suicidal patients,

364
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,880
at least not to a level that she's feeling is successful, right? Right. So what she,

365
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,320
again, this is secondhand, so I just tell the story as though I'm her, but what she would

366
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,480
report is, okay, I go into my session with somebody and I ask them about what are all

367
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,440
the problems that you're experiencing that is causing you to feel suicidal. And the person would

368
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,440
say, I hate my job, you know, I hate my relationships, I don't have any pleasure in my life, whatever

369
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:29,840
those things are. And Marcia with the CBT lens would say, no problem. We can figure this all out.

370
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,640
We'll just, you know, take all of your problems. We'll put them on the list. We'll systematically

371
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,280
go through each of your problem one by one, which we'll solve. And we'll figure this out in no time.

372
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,480
And the way she reports it is that she did that feeling all the hope in the world and the reaction

373
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:57,520
that she got was totally unexpected, which is people saying, you have no idea. You have no idea

374
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,080
how bad my problems are. If you thought that these are things that are easy to solve,

375
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,720
you are sorely misunderstanding the depths of my problem. You clearly don't understand anything

376
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,920
about me or my situation if you think that these are things that could be easily solved.

377
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,960
And more than that, if these were easily solved, I would have solved them a long time ago. You have

378
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:30,480
no idea how much I'm suffering. You don't get it. So this iterative process was like, okay,

379
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:38,880
this blew up, right? Clearly, this isn't working the way I intended. And so the next piece of her

380
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,080
story is she would say, okay, that's not working. I need to figure out what's going to work. And she

381
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,600
said, she took kind of the other perspective and she said, okay, what they're telling me is that I

382
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,920
don't understand the depths of their problems. And maybe that's true. And so what I need to do now

383
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,440
is tell them and work with them to completely understand. And so she would go into her sessions

384
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:13,440
with, again, people who are chronically suicidal and say, you're right, your problems

385
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:22,240
are too difficult. You've had long standing experiences with trauma. You've been treated

386
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:29,920
terribly your whole life. You have a number of obstacles that may prevent you from getting the

387
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:38,800
job that you want or the relationship that you want. And perhaps what we need to do is work on

388
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:50,560
accepting your life as it is and finding joy in that, but accepting the life as you have it and

389
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:57,520
let go of trying to solve all these problems. And so that was her next step.

390
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,320
So this is the epiphany that of course, anyone who's done DBT knows is radical acceptance.

391
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,360
Well, it wasn't quite labeled that yet.

392
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,320
No, no, no. Yeah. But was this kind of the precursor of what we would now describe as that?

393
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,800
Yes. I think it could be the precursor, but it was missing something because what she would say is

394
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,680
this is the acceptance piece. But when she tried it thinking, oh, this is what people want,

395
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,600
they're saying I can't solve their problems. And so clearly if I communicate that I understand

396
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:37,200
how difficult things are and we can work on accepting it, the reaction she got then was,

397
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,720
what? There's no hope.

398
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,680
How can you say that I should just accept this? My life is miserable as it currently is.

399
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,400
If I accept this, there's no hope. I should just die. Again, you don't possibly understand

400
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,880
everything. And this was the, DBT stands for dialectical behavior therapy. We can talk about

401
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,880
dialectics. But this is what turned into the idea of this primary dialectic in this treatment,

402
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:15,200
which is the dialectic between change and acceptance and figuring out how do I as a therapist,

403
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,280
as a treatment provider, straddle this line, synthesize this because both of these are

404
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,400
important. We need to work on solving the problems in your life that are causing you such distress

405
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:34,080
and misery. And we also need to work on accepting your life as it is and accepting the things that

406
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:42,320
we can't change about our lives. But how do we do that in a way that is palatable to the person on

407
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:51,120
the other end, and in a way that conveys hope that things could change? And so it's about

408
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:58,160
synthesizing those two elements. And I think it's the synthesis of those elements that lead to

409
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,280
things like radical acceptance and other components of the treatment.

410
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,760
So this is probably a great time to double click on what dialectical means because it is,

411
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,120
I don't know, I'm not sure if it's innate to us, right? I think it requires some practice.

412
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,480
Yeah, I was listening to some interview the other day where somebody just simply said,

413
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:26,800
humans don't like contradiction. And I think that that's true. We don't like contradiction.

414
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,800
And so dialectics is really the, at least I'm, by the way, I'm no expert in dialectical philosophy

415
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:42,000
as, you know, as Marx initially wrote about it. I'm more a student of dialectics as it informs,

416
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,480
you know, my life and my practice. But dialectics is this understanding that there is contradiction

417
00:49:50,480 --> 00:50:02,160
and opposition and tension in everything. And therefore, we can't avoid it. And the more we

418
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:11,040
try to avoid conflict and tension, the more likely it is that we're going to see conflict and tension.

419
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:19,120
And so dialectics is at least, again, in the practice of DBT is the practice of recognizing

420
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:27,520
tensions as they exist, polarization as it comes up, and then striving to find

421
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,760
what is valid about both sides, or both sides of the tension and seeking to find a synthesis,

422
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:45,360
some new argument or new statement that recognizes and adopts the validity in the two opposing sides.

423
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,200
This might be a reasonable time to jump forward. And then I want to come back because I love this

424
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,640
sort of story. But if you've, if a person listening to this or watching this has ever kind of gone

425
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,400
through DBT, then they're familiar with the workbook, right? You're doing this in a very

426
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,800
structured way. And one of the first images in the workbook is the two intersecting circles of

427
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,280
wise mind and emotional mind. Do you? Emotional mind and reasonable.

428
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,720
Sorry, reasonable mind. Yeah. Wise mind being the intersection. Yeah. So maybe use, you want,

429
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,080
can we use that as an example of dialectical synthesis where you have those two minds

430
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,520
intersecting and then that union or intersection of them being the wise mind and how do we find

431
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,320
those? But again, contrasting it with sort of emotional and reasonable mind.

432
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:40,720
Yeah. So I think you, that's exactly right. That is an illustration, a key illustration

433
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:49,280
of dialectics at play is this notion of wise mind and the way we, and wise mind being a skill in the

434
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:59,760
workbook that we teach people as something that we are striving to access wise mind more often

435
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:08,080
in our lives and that accessing wise mind involves synthesizing these two tensions

436
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:18,160
potentially or polarizations known as emotion mind and reasonable mind. So we emotion mind is

437
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,760
the idea that a state in which we are completely controlled by our emotions.

438
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:32,800
So when we're angry, it could be lashing out at somebody. It could be engaging in physical

439
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,080
violence. It could be threatening physical violence. It could be slamming doors. It could

440
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,560
be quitting things, you know, all the things that we might do when we're, when we're being controlled

441
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,640
by the anger we're experiencing. Reasonable mind on the other hand is when we're controlled kind

442
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:58,000
of by facts and logic and emotions aren't really, we're not aware of or experiencing any strong

443
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,080
emotion and you could, you could imagine or you can envision the tension that exists between these

444
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:10,480
two. If you've ever been in emotion mind having an argument with somebody in reasonable mind

445
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:18,720
or vice versa because that happens a lot. I think it has happened in my marriage. It probably happens

446
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,880
a lot across many people's marriages where one person is in emotion mind, the other person is

447
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:33,040
in reasonable mind and that's a recipe for you know really strong conflict. So wise mind is saying

448
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:44,240
okay what can I, what's valid about the emotion that I'm experiencing here? What's valid about

449
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,040
reasonable mind that I'm experiencing here and what's a synthesis? So a silly story that we

450
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,720
might tell to illustrate wise mind or emotion mind is you're walking down the street and you

451
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:07,200
pass by a pet store and in the window are a dozen puppies or if you're a cat person imagine

452
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:16,480
a dozen kittens okay. Emotion mind takes over and says get them all. I want all the puppies,

453
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,680
every single one of them because this one is cute for this reason, this one is cute for this other

454
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,760
reason. Oh my god they would be so happy together and I would be so happy if I had all these puppies

455
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:35,440
in my life I want them. So emotion mind says get all the puppies. Reasonable mind says oh my gosh

456
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:43,280
dogs are so much work. You have to walk them three times a day. They're expensive. You have to get

457
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:52,640
all this equipment. You have to get a veterinarian. You have to restructure your time so that you

458
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,680
spend more time with the dogs or not. You have to you know reimagine your whole life around that.

459
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:06,080
So reasonable mind might say no puppies. Puppies are never for you right. So what does wise mind

460
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:15,440
say? Well what's great about even teaching this as an idea is that wise mind is not a synthesis,

461
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:22,000
a dialectical synthesis, is not a compromise. It's not a halfway point because if I were to say that

462
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,840
then wise mind would say get six of the puppies if there are 12 right. And that makes no sense

463
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:37,920
as a compromise or as a synthesis because it's not seeing the validity in both sides. So what would

464
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,440
wise mind be? That would vary depending on the person because for some people a wise mind decision

465
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:50,640
would be to bring home a puppy. For other people a wise mind decision would be to say now is not

466
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,720
the right time for me to have a puppy but I am going to do x, y, and z in order to increase

467
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,120
the likelihood that I can have a puppy in the future. Wise mind might be I have the perfect

468
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,560
scenario now I can bring home two puppies and we will live happily ever after. So it's going to

469
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:17,040
vary but the idea of finding this synthesis is about seeing what's valid and true about both ends

470
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,280
of the or both of the sides and then trying to figure out what a synthesis could be.

471
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,640
Does that make sense? It does it really does of course and I think one of the things I'm struck

472
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:38,960
by when I look at the notebook, the workbook that we use in dbt is how much is in it. And

473
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,560
to think that this is sort of the work of largely one individual and obviously it's been iterated on

474
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:53,760
but it's really kind of remarkable. So can we kind of go back to the story of some of the earliest

475
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:03,840
insights she had treating some of the most in need patients and how she basically then realized

476
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,160
she couldn't do what she was doing under the umbrella of cbt and needed to make this change

477
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,680
from the cognitive to the dialectical and create another form of behavioral therapy which again is

478
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:23,600
it's really a kind of remarkable thing to realize given how relatively recent this is. I mean this

479
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,840
is something that's happened in the last 30 or 40 years. Agreed yeah so I think you know getting back

480
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:37,840
to where she was in terms of realizing that you know if I push for change too hard disaster happens,

481
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:46,160
if I push for acceptance too hard disaster happens, what can I do to you know find the middle,

482
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:54,160
how do I balance these two things. And again part of the the lore of the story of dbt was that she

483
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:03,280
was writing about this idea of balancing change and acceptance and these were the days where she

484
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,800
would you know write up notes either handwritten or on a typewriter and hand them over to a

485
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:16,800
secretary who would you know type them up or revise them and her story is that the person her

486
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:24,080
her assistant that was working on typing this all up came to her one day and said my husband is a

487
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:32,560
graduate student in philosophy and we were looking at this and we think that what you're describing

488
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:38,720
actually is something that he he studies and is called dialectics. So according to Marcia she

489
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:47,200
didn't know anything about dialectical philosophy as she was iterating this treatment and this was

490
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,560
one of those happenstance moments that that came to her and then of course she sought out readings

491
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:01,040
descriptions of dialectical philosophy and saw yes that is exactly what she's thinking and that

492
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:11,680
dialectical philosophy informs a lot of science and scientific thought and so actually worked

493
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:19,280
well within the the paradigm of you know the development of of cognitive behavioral treatments.

494
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:28,240
So so that's where you know dbt started to take form however if if you're familiar with her books

495
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:35,120
you know that her original treatment manual that was published in 1993 including the and and also

496
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,800
the original skills workbook that was published in 1993 says on the cover cognitive behavioral

497
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:46,480
therapy for born personality disorder yeah the the newer edition says dialectical because she

498
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,320
was told at the time by the publishers that nobody will know what this means and nobody will want it

499
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,680
and I think that may be true it's it's possible that if it was called dialectical behavior therapy

500
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:07,920
on the cover of the book back then it would not have actually been as popular as it is now. Now

501
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,400
of course we can put dialectical behavior therapy on the cover of any book and and people will see

502
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,680
the value in it but I don't think that was true then. When did she develop kind of her own sort

503
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,840
of interest in zen philosophy and the practice of mindfulness which also is a very important

504
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:36,240
muscle that one kind of develops as they move along their dbt journey was this something that

505
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:44,240
had been more long-standing with her? So I think that this was all happening around at the same

506
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:56,880
time that she was her own interest in you know Marcia grew up in a catholic family identified as a

507
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:04,400
very religious person identified as saying that at one point she thought she was going to become a

508
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:13,200
nun and so this was a large part of her upbringing when and also was part of that spiritual

509
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:21,600
experience that she had personally but I think she also realized that and another reason by the

510
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,440
way that she didn't want to come public with her story early on is that she didn't want the lesson

511
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:34,800
to be oh if you want to get better you also have to have a spiritual experience. Instead what she

512
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:47,040
wanted to figure out was how do I operationalize for lack of a better word this spiritual experience

513
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:55,840
so that other people could experience it as well and so I think that was going on in her mind

514
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:05,440
at the same time that she was interested in her own spiritual development and learned more about

515
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:13,200
Zen and became a student of Zen Buddhism and saw that they all connected and came together because

516
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:21,680
ultimately how she translated that personal experience is into this idea that you mentioned

517
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:32,480
earlier of radical acceptance can you radically accept this moment the situation yourself exactly

518
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:41,600
as it is and if you can experience that radical and complete and total acceptance you can experience

519
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:49,680
joy you can crack open the moment of joy she would say. Yeah I mean there are some things where

520
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,840
Shireen that's I get it right like you're stuck in traffic right so you're supposed to be going

521
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,120
somewhere and let's pretend it's someplace that matters right it's not just like a dinner

522
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,480
reservation let's say it's your kids sporting event or you go into the airport and it's a

523
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,440
flight and if you miss it it's going to really wreck things up and there's nothing you can do

524
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,560
about it you're stuck in traffic there's an accident a mile ahead and that this is the way

525
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:22,240
it's going to be walk me through what you would say you know your your patient now is in the car

526
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,720
and you're sitting with them in the car and they're understandably getting very flustered at the

527
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,920
situation walk me through radical acceptance in that situation how are you helping that person

528
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,280
go through the you know can you fix this problem are you accepting this problem can you change like

529
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:45,520
going through all of those layers for that specific type of problem yes and I've been in

530
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:57,360
that problem myself so I understand yeah so you know um what I would say as a precursor is that

531
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:06,080
when we're experiencing suffering however you define that suffering if you were to look at it

532
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,640
more deeply you would say the vast majority of the time that we're experiencing suffering

533
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:20,320
it's because we're thinking about something that has already happened ruminating um wishing it

534
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:26,880
hadn't happened mulling something over whatever it might be or you're thinking about something

535
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:33,760
that may happen in the future and that actually if you just experience this one moment

536
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:43,840
uh and let go of the past and the future that alone might reduce your suffering a ton

537
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:49,280
but we could say you might experience pain in this moment because this moment might be painful

538
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,960
but we're not adding on we're not adding on all of these things that actually increase our suffering

539
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:07,600
so in this moment when you are stuck in traffic you can't undo the decisions that you made that

540
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,960
got you to this point right because of course we're saying things like oh if only I had taken

541
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:19,360
this other road or if only I had left 15 minutes early or we think all these stupid people on the

542
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:26,000
road if only they had done something different right so that's those are all fantasy thoughts

543
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,680
because they're all not reality of this moment so I would say how do we reduce our suffering in this

544
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:42,960
moment is to say I can't change any of that for today in this moment this is what it is

545
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,680
um and what happens you'll see actually I'm holding my palms up right now as I'm talking

546
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:56,160
because I associate holding my palms up with this idea of willingly accepting this moment which is

547
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:04,800
uh this is the moment that I'm in yeah it's sort of a surrender posture yeah yeah in a way it's

548
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:10,880
the surrendering willing this is the moment I'm in and what happens if I just just as though it's

549
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:18,240
easy but what happens if I accept that right now there is nothing I can do to change this

550
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:26,560
right now I think the other piece to this is and this is why it's not just about acceptance

551
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:34,240
because I would say if this is something that happens a lot right if you often find yourself

552
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:40,240
in situations whether it's traffic or something running late or something like that then we

553
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:49,360
absolutely want to figure out how to prevent this from happening as much in the future but in this

554
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:58,000
moment when you're there you can't do that so in other words in the moment of crisis you don't

555
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,040
really want to be problem solving around how can I avoid this the next time how do I avoid this

556
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:11,520
crisis again in the future when I'm at a 100 or a 90 of distress I'm not going to be able to

557
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:20,400
effectively do that now obviously so much of what you're saying sounds very familiar to anybody who

558
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,240
has practiced mindfulness or vipassana or one of its derivatives in forms of meditation

559
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,840
we've had a couple of podcasts that have sort of gone into that and

560
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:42,320
you know when the goal of the practice is to help you identify thoughts and to separate you from

561
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:50,160
these thoughts and so in this individual I mean there's probably nothing as you say in this exact

562
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:56,320
moment that is particularly unbearable but the thoughts are unbearable if you're if you let them

563
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,880
go right which is I'm gonna get to the airport I'm gonna miss my flight then I'm gonna have to wait

564
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,560
for another flight and I'm probably gonna miss that too or they're not gonna be a good seat or

565
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,400
whatever and then I'm gonna not get to where I'm going and maybe the whole trip's gonna da da da

566
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,720
and and so what is what do you say to the person who says okay Shireen I understand that those

567
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:21,840
thoughts which are all future are not happening to me now and I can just sit here right now in

568
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:27,200
this car and frankly I could turn on music and enjoy the music for the moment but that doesn't

569
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,960
change the fact that that's going to happen it doesn't change the fact that in an hour I am going

570
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,760
to get to the airport I am going to have missed my flight what do you say to the person when they

571
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,640
they acknowledge that I could probably take myself down from 100 to 50 by being present in the moment

572
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:48,000
but will I get back to 100 when I get to the airport when I realized that I now have to deal

573
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,880
with this mess possibly but that's a new moment now now you're in a new moment and a new situation

574
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:02,480
so part of it depends on well what's your what's your goal so when you're experiencing distress

575
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:08,240
in that moment of being stuck in traffic and not having any control about that what's your goal

576
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:16,240
if it's to get to the airport in two minutes sorry that's not a realistic goal we're gonna have to

577
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,920
let that one go if it's to problem solve what will happen when you get to the airport is there

578
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,160
something that you can do while you're in the car you know possibly but if your goal is to how do I

579
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:35,920
make this moment more bearable because I can't undo anything then I think we have some other

580
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,640
options available to us which could be distracting you know doing something like music or

581
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:50,000
or some other forms of distraction that you could safely do in the context of your car

582
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:56,560
okay so now let's look at kind of the other end of the spectrum where I think it becomes even

583
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,280
harder to do this so I'll think of two examples I think of an individual who receives a terminal

584
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:07,680
diagnosis so they're they're diagnosed with a cancer for example that and let's let's make this

585
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,920
even more tragic right I think anybody dying of cancer is tragic but now it's someone your age

586
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:20,720
or my age who's you know dying decades too soon but they're basically told and and it's accurate

587
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:27,040
that look in six months you're not going to be alive so in that sense they're they're you know

588
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,240
there's they're mourning the loss of their life and who they're going to be away from and then

589
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:38,400
there's another example which is very fresh in my mind right now because you know a very close

590
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,480
friend of my wife's daughter drowned a year ago and and because we're coming up to the one-year

591
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:52,800
anniversary of that it's it's all you know she's reliving a lot of this so you know it's hard for

592
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,160
me to imagine what she's going through and what her husband is going through but they can't there's

593
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:05,840
no there's there's nothing that will undo that there so so maybe use those two examples as two

594
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:14,560
of the the most difficult examples of how can radical acceptance allow the a this this person

595
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,040
who's who's going to die far too soon to come to grips with that and maybe have a chance at

596
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:29,040
having the best six months that they can have versus not you know you know and then perhaps

597
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,160
even more tragically the you know a parent losing a child is you would sort of hold that up as about

598
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:41,040
as tragic as anything can go where nothing is ever going to bring that child back and yes

599
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,120
cognitively you can say look you still have other children and you have to be a great parent for

600
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:51,440
them you can't allow yourself to you know you can go through all of that stuff but like I don't know

601
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,160
how I would cope with that I don't think I could I'm not I'm not sure so yeah now let's go from the

602
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:06,320
sort of banal of traffic to the the really heavy stuff of life yeah easy right so uh I mean one

603
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:14,000
I've thought about both of these things um a lot or both of these circumstances a lot and I think

604
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:24,640
one of the um misunderstandings about acceptance is somehow this idea that it if you accept

605
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:32,880
something you don't experience pain and so I want to differentiate that uh life is full of pain no

606
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:41,120
matter how zen and mindful you are you're going to experience pain and a lot of pain and we're not

607
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,600
trying to eradicate pain because actually without pain and I don't mean you know physical pain I

608
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,880
mean emotional pain but it could be both but without that we would have other problems right

609
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:02,800
if we did not experience um pain as you hear about your friend's daughter that would be a

610
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:10,240
problem for you in a different way so we need to understand that that pain is going to be a part

611
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,640
of our lives and actually we cause a lot of problems for ourselves when we try to escape

612
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:21,760
the experience of pain so that's one thing about um reality radical acceptance that I want to talk

613
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,080
about but the other is when when you ask questions like that like how can we ask somebody to radically

614
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:37,280
accept this I would answer in part by saying what's the alternative the alternative is refusing to

615
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:45,440
accept how how does that work how how do you do that um how and how long can you sustain that for

616
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:51,280
so I would actually argue that the refusal to accept or the putting your head in the sand

617
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:02,720
or the denying reality actually ends up taking a lot more mental resource and ultimately causing

618
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:11,280
more problems for you in the long run and that said from a dbt perspective when we when we talk

619
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,560
about practicing the skill of radical acceptance we have another expression called turning the mind

620
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:26,240
which is referring to the fact that um practicing radical acceptance involves a very active process

621
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,640
of continuously turning your mind towards acceptance the the metaphor is that you're at

622
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:38,640
a fork in the road and one road is acceptance and another road is is refusal to accept you're going

623
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:46,000
to come across the fork in the road possibly multiple times a minute and what does it look

624
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,640
like for you to say I'm going to actively and willingly choose the road of radical acceptance

625
01:14:52,640 --> 01:15:00,880
how can I turn my mind my body my soul towards acceptance and for me a lot of it is actually

626
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,680
asking myself that question of what's the alternative what other choices do I have

627
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:13,840
and recognizing that more suffering comes from refusing to accept more often the fact that it's

628
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:19,360
referred to as radical acceptance versus acceptance I think kind of highlights that that it it's not

629
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,120
easy it's not it's not a decision it's not like you would sit down with my wife's friend have this

630
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,120
discussion once say what's the alternative I know this is awful but in the long run this is going to

631
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:37,680
produce more happiness for you and your family and for her to say yep I think that's right thanks

632
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,760
like it's no it's not it's to your point every minute of every day for god knows how many

633
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:54,800
months and years you're confronted with that and if I speak for myself there's a lot of uh what's

634
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,720
the what's the term uh backsliding right there's a lot of no I don't want to accept this today

635
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,880
like I'm not I don't accept this this is I'm angry about this I want to pout and have a little

636
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,960
pity party about this um and then maybe I experienced that and I realized that wasn't

637
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:17,680
very productive because now I feel actually worse and so um you know one of the things about dbt

638
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,080
that so I you know we were introduced through Andy White which is who I work with and I just I just

639
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:27,440
think the world of Andy one of the things about dbt that for me makes it a wonderful system

640
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:34,000
is that you do work like you you have you you you write you do you have homework you

641
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:41,360
you you have to talk you know write out your emotions and your decisions and the

642
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:49,520
the trees like you know if you feel this do you do this and I don't know I how deliberate was that

643
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,880
in in Marsha's mind as a system I've never done cbt so I don't know if cbt has a similar workbook

644
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,680
and she's just modifying it is that is that something that's been modified from other systems

645
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:08,160
certainly cbt is associated with doing homework doing work in between sessions

646
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:16,080
more standard cognitive therapy is associated with doing worksheets about your thoughts what

647
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:22,080
thoughts you have what the evidence for your thoughts are that sort of thing and so I think

648
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:29,440
doing work during worksheets not shying away from the term homework as part of the treatment

649
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:35,520
is very consistent with the cbt model now what I will say is um

650
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,920
you just reminded me about this based on something you said is that one of the

651
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:51,120
assumptions about borderline personality disorder from the dbt lens is that this is uh we use a

652
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:58,240
skills deficit model which is to say that we believe that people who end up with the constellation

653
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:04,480
of problems associated with borderline personality disorder have an absence of certain skills and

654
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:11,440
skillful behavior in their lives and that absence could be a result of never having been taught it

655
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:17,680
in the first place or having had effective behaviors been punished out of them by their

656
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,640
environment this is the environmental piece that we're talking about but they they don't have

657
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:32,480
we all you know have certain deficits in in some air in some skillful areas and so the work

658
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,600
another one i would just add to that it's so yeah the skills have never been modeled for you

659
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,640
you've done them correctly and been punished for them i think a bigger one might be you've done

660
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,640
them incorrectly and never been corrected yeah that's a good one too yeah absolutely so you

661
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,360
built all the muscle memory doing it wrong your whole life and you didn't have parents there to

662
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:02,480
sort of say hey that's not how you do it this do it this way yeah and it's a lot harder to unlearn

663
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:08,400
a behavior than it is to learn a new behavior uh and that we know that as a phenomenon so

664
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:16,000
so marcia developed this you know this workbook what we refer to as the skills training manual

665
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,800
that's part of of the treatment of dbt and perhaps what dbt is probably most known for

666
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:30,560
more broadly speaking are the skills that are part of it but that these skills deficits are

667
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,480
thought to exist in in four different domains or five different domains actually mindfulness

668
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,000
so when we say someone has a deficit in mindfulness it's not that we're referring to anybody who

669
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,400
doesn't practice zen as having a mindfulness deficit but it's a deficit in excuse me a deficit

670
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:58,560
in the capacity to be aware of the present moment basically another domain in which people have

671
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:05,920
deficits is interpersonal effectiveness as i go through this you'll see everybody has deficits in

672
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,640
in all of these areas at different times and i think again that's that's part of the beauty of dbt

673
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,920
is that it can help so many people so interpersonal effectiveness which could mean conflict with others

674
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:21,760
but also could mean deficits in in knowing how to ask for something effectively how to say no

675
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:30,720
effectively emotion regulation deficits is the third domain so deficits in knowing how to label

676
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,320
your emotions what to do with emotions when you have them how to prevent having intense and extreme

677
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:42,720
emotions how to change emotions can't remember if i said that uh and then a fourth domain is is

678
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:50,560
deficits in distress tolerance how do you tolerate really stressful and distressing situations without

679
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:57,280
doing anything that to make the situation worse and then the fifth area that is not talked about

680
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,160
as much though i can certainly talk about it if that'd be helpful is this idea of self-management

681
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:08,160
deficits and self-management which has to do with um being able to do things you don't want to do

682
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:15,600
you know broadly speaking you know how some people can get up every morning at six o'clock

683
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:21,360
and go exercise and eat a healthy breakfast uh and you know go to work while other people

684
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:29,600
snooze their alarm eight to twelve times you know haphazardly eat breakfast sometimes um

685
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,840
get to work late you know those are sorts of things that we might uh say fall into this kind

686
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:43,440
of self-management domain and so dbt is designed as a treatment package to teach people the skills

687
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:50,000
to overcome deficits in these different domain so i actually wasn't aware of the fifth i was

688
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,320
really only aware of the four is that fifth one um is it kind of a more recent addition

689
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:04,160
so it actually is in the original treatment manual in the 1993 um text that she put out but

690
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:09,760
her thinking was i don't need to create a whole other skills module for self-management because

691
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:15,680
dbt therapists are going to infuse this throughout their entire treatment and i think this might have

692
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,080
been at the time a little bit of a missed opportunity because i don't think she realized

693
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:27,120
that actually a lot of clinicians don't know how to do that um very well marcia was thinking that

694
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:33,120
actually this is where behaviorism comes in it's teaching people principles of of behaviorism so

695
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:38,960
you don't see it in the original skills manual and you don't necessarily see it in the new skills

696
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,560
manual or what i refer to as the new skills manual unless you look because where you would see it now

697
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,160
is in the set of skills that are referred to as the walking the middle path skills which are

698
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:59,280
which actually came out of um the first adaptation of dbt for adolescents and their families um and

699
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:05,920
jill rathis and alec miller who along with marcia created the adolescent version of dbt

700
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:13,520
took a lot of these principles of the self-management skills and created this fifth module

701
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:19,840
of dbt skills called walking the middle path in which they teach adolescents and their caregivers

702
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:27,360
their parents these skills about how to how to manage your behaviors how to learn behaviors um

703
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:34,720
and to be more effective more broadly you know just kind of going back to the origin of dbt

704
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:44,400
around basically um a modified tool to help some of the people who are suffering the absolute most

705
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,280
right if you think somewhere in the back of marcia's mind it probably wasn't just how do i

706
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:56,880
make cbt better to handle the most recalcitrant depression suicidal patients perhaps on some level

707
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:03,040
it was also bpd right which we didn't we kind of glossed over this but i'm guessing that cbt has

708
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:07,920
historically not been very successful for borderline personality disorder is that a fair statement

709
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,440
well i would say at the time that marcia was was doing this treatment development we didn't know

710
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:24,480
and i think the the general thought and they're actually there have been more studies that have

711
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:29,200
looked at whether the presence of borderline personality disorder interfered with

712
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:35,600
um outcomes for standard cbt and there's kind of mixed data on that and that some studies

713
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:44,320
showed that the presence of bpd did uh lead to worse outcomes in in some studies but what i

714
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:51,600
was going to say is that marcia didn't know one the reason that she gives for her pivot to borderline

715
01:24:52,480 --> 01:25:00,320
personality disorder as a population of interest is that when she was first seeking research dollars

716
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:09,040
research grants to study the development of dbt and the you know to start to do randomized clinical

717
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:18,800
trials of dbt rather back in those days you could only get research grants from nih if you identified

718
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:25,440
a disorder of interest the way she tells it as oversimplified is that you know she was interested

719
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:32,480
in suicide and suicidal behaviors and at the time she thought her choices based on that behavior

720
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:40,160
was either depression or bpd and she said at the time she didn't want to do depression because

721
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:46,400
there were already so many um smart people doing depression research she wanted to do

722
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,840
go into an area where there weren't already a lot of people doing research in this area and that's

723
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,720
why she chose bpd again this is the story but of course i think there's more to it than that

724
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:04,640
because i think the you know her own experiences uh would lead one to assume that she also had

725
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:10,800
specific interest in a motion dysregulation piece that goes along with bpd and doesn't

726
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:17,760
necessarily go along with with more standard depression yeah i mean so what would you say i

727
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,880
know what i would say but what would you say to somebody who doesn't have bpd doesn't it's not

728
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:29,120
depressed who says you know peter shireen this is all very interesting but what would there ever be

729
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:37,520
any benefit in me doing dbt given that this program was really built around people with real pathology

730
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,520
of which i have none if you i went through the dsm five last week nothing in there i don't meet

731
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:50,800
the criteria for anything fully um would i have any would there be any value to me in in this

732
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:56,480
type of practice i think that's part of what's so fascinating about this treatment because you're

733
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,360
exactly right this was the treatment that was developed for what could have been termed the

734
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:09,360
worst of the worst at the at the time and it's a treatment that is actually for all of us i have

735
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:16,560
yet to meet a person who could not benefit from at least learning some of the skills nor have i

736
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:25,200
met a person who i've yet to meet a person who hasn't identified the skills as being something

737
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:30,080
that could be relevant for them now whether they're always willing to use them or apply them

738
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:36,400
or want to do them that's a different issue but when i talk about here's what the skills are for

739
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,480
i get universal agreement that those skills could be useful to learn yeah the way i kind of describe

740
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:51,200
it i you don't know this about me but i love cars and race cars and all sorts of things like that

741
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:56,880
and a lot of people say like i don't really understand how there's any value in you know

742
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,320
a company like mercedes or you know any of these companies participating in you know building race

743
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:08,960
cars you know it's such an expensive proposition it seems so gratuitous but the trickle-down effect

744
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:16,160
for what the impact of that is on street cars is remarkable in terms of fuel efficiency power

745
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,600
safety all of these things you know it's true if you want to build a formula one car it's you know

746
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,680
it's basically a 400 million dollar a year operation to build and operate those things

747
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:34,560
but those things are functioning at the absolute limit and if you you know where every gram matters

748
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,640
and the stakes are so high and if you take everything that you learn there and bring it

749
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:44,960
down to the rest of us who aren't driving formula one cars the benefit is actually enormous

750
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:51,760
and i think of it as sort of similar right which is this is a system that was conceived and

751
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:58,720
um validated on a sample set of people with real difficulties in regulating their emotions

752
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:05,040
and you know when i go through the list of the dbt you know skills pillars it's like i mean check

753
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,840
check check check check right i mean i can i might not meet the diagnostic criteria for something in

754
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:16,400
the dsm-5 but i mean i have enormous problems with all of these things i have staggering deficits

755
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:23,440
of skills i mean one of the first exercises that really illustrated that was something as simple as

756
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:30,240
identification of emotion you know it was any emotion that i wouldn't say that that's simple

757
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,360
necessarily yeah yeah yeah but but it was like i couldn't really identify an emotion that wasn't

758
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:42,960
anger it was very difficult to go beyond anger to helplessness sadness hurt fear all of these

759
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:49,840
other things so that i mean i don't know andy and i must have spent three months with my homework

760
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:55,760
just being okay you're going to get angry 16 times a day 16 times a day pull out this sheet

761
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:03,600
and go through and figure out what else is going on you know that's that sounds maybe simple but

762
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:10,800
that's learning a new language as well what what made you want to do that why not just stick with

763
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,440
your experience of anger yeah i mean look it's it's a it's exactly what you said earlier it's

764
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,720
like what's the alternative all the alternative is you're really you know alienating a lot of people

765
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:30,160
um and i think watching my kids get older and realizing i don't want them to see me always

766
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:34,720
angry i mean you know i think i was just angry 24 seven i don't think i really experienced

767
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:43,520
anything that wasn't anger um so yeah i think it was just uh it was it was sort of just saying like

768
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:49,680
i have to sort of break this cycle because it's you know my kids will if every time i get cut off

769
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,200
on the road i'm screaming so much at the person who cut me off that you can see the droplets of

770
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:01,120
my spit on the windshield even if i'm not yelling at them it's not like i was actually yelling at my

771
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,800
kids but it doesn't matter i don't you know as i've learned since i don't think kids can appreciate

772
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:12,400
the difference a five-year-old doesn't understand that just because daddy is yelling at the guy that

773
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:19,920
cut him off he's not mad at me so i think once i came to realize that i realized no this i i don't

774
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:29,040
want to do this yeah i think these skills are for i just totally agree i mean i've been so i don't

775
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:36,960
actually have my own experiences with borderline personality disorder or psychopathology in that way

776
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:48,400
and i learned dbt as a grad student uh in you know my early 20s and it's been a long time now

777
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:55,760
that i've been using and applying dbt and i will still go in my head like when i have a difficult

778
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:02,160
interpersonal situation happening where i will walk through the steps in my mind of the the dear

779
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,400
man skill of how to ask for something and be effective let's go through dear man in a moment

780
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,640
finish your story but i would love to go well i was just gonna say like it's been 25 years and

781
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:18,640
i'll still be writing an email and then i'll say wait pause edit am i following the dear structure

782
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:24,480
what what can i take out what am i adding on what judgments are in here so i feel like i you know

783
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:34,480
i've been a pretty skillful person for most of my life and i still need to i still benefit from

784
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:44,080
actively thinking about uh using these skills in my daily life so i mean i'm still so early in my

785
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:51,680
journey i would say i'm you know if if if 10 out of 10 is having all the skills and always employing

786
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:58,320
them one out of 10 is not even knowing what a skill is you know i'm in the sort of three to

787
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:06,640
four out of ten range which is i know them and i don't know maybe half the time i reach for them

788
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:13,360
correctly um but let's talk about dear man um because everything in dbt is really built

789
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:19,840
around being highly accessible it's not it's not really at least to me it doesn't come across as

790
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:26,800
having errors right like this is you know it's it's funny acronyms it's like little diagrams it's

791
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:36,880
there's nobody that can't do this right so um tell everybody what dear man is and what the acronym

792
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:43,680
is is really used to walk you through as a thought process right i think sometimes people actually

793
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,880
have a negative reaction to all the acronyms in in dbt and i think that's a fair criticism but

794
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:55,440
acronyms are you know meant as mnemonics to help us remember um maybe because i went to medical

795
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:00,880
school we just you do so much through that yeah yeah yeah yeah though i will say i was training

796
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,240
dbt somewhere where was i i think it was iceland was it iceland where they don't do acronyms

797
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:11,680
um like it's just not part of their language uh to use acronyms and so that isn't added

798
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:20,320
difficulty but in in the u.s and canada and we can talk about these acronyms so dear man is a skill

799
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:25,680
that's in the interpersonal effectiveness module so this these are the skills that are designed to

800
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:32,480
help you be more effective with other people in your life and dear man is specifically the skill

801
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:40,240
to uh on how to ask for something in a way that gets another person to give it to you

802
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:46,960
or how to say no to something in a way that gets the other person to accept your no or increases

803
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:54,000
the likelihood i should say because nothing is going to be 100 effective so dear man walks you

804
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:04,560
through these seven kind of sub skills to help you do that so it stands for describe express assert

805
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:15,440
reinforce that's the the dear part that's that's basically what you say um or write uh to ask for

806
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:23,040
something and then the man stands for mindful appear confident and negotiate or be willing

807
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:29,600
to negotiate so that when you're in a situation so i don't know do you have a situation that is

808
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,480
coming up for you where you need to ask for something or say no to something yeah i do

809
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,480
actually um i don't think i can talk about it publicly unfortunately it's such it's a very good

810
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:47,840
one but i probably can't talk about it publicly let me think of one where i could um without

811
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,120
embarrassing someone uh okay this is going to embarrass the hell out of her but let's try it

812
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,840
my daughter wants to get a third earring so she's got two piercings in her ears and she really wants

813
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:05,600
to now get a third and i'm not sure maybe this isn't a great example but i'm hoping to talk her

814
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,960
out of it for a little longer how's that i i'm like why don't you wait till you're a little bit older

815
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:16,880
i just have this fear that she's going to you know damage her ears and have so many things hanging

816
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:22,240
that it will stretch her ear lobes out and she'll be 50 years old like me one day and regret it

817
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:29,680
potentially a totally irrational fear but that's the fear i have so the ask that you want to say is

818
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,120
will you postpone this decision for a while or will you take this off the table for a period of time

819
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,800
right and the reason because someone listening to this might say what kind of lousy parent or you

820
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,560
just assert it but um but but her mom is not opposed to it her mom's like i think it's

821
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:52,960
reasonable for her to get it so so now it's become kind of more of a negotiation and how old is she

822
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:58,800
uh she's 13 yeah so i would say the more you tell somebody a 13 year old not to do something

823
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,640
that's pretty much the recipe for for going out and doing it so uh so if you were to practice the

824
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:10,720
dear man the first step would be to describe the situation without adding on any interpretations

825
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:19,360
or judgments so uh if i were your daughter you would say to me um olivia i understand that you

826
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:27,280
want to now get a third hearing great so often this means exactly what you did which is to

827
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,960
keep it short because sometimes we have a tendency to go on and on and on about all of our reasons

828
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:38,080
for something but actually the more we do that the more we lose the other person's interest

829
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:46,240
uh and then express would be to express your feelings about it i have some fear about you

830
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:52,560
getting a third earring because i worry that it would damage your ears and this would be

831
01:37:52,560 --> 01:38:00,240
something that would bother you many years from now right so you know we could work on on

832
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:06,480
simplifying or shortening or saying i i fear i have fears that you would regret this if you did it

833
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,080
whatever it might be to get the express but that was also really nice because you didn't add on

834
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:18,160
judgments you didn't say you shouldn't do this right these are all just describe the facts and

835
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:24,240
then express your feelings about it now assert is where you ask for that's the a where you ask

836
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:31,520
for directly what it is that you want olivia would you be fine if we could postpone this

837
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:40,880
decision until you're older maybe even out of high school so you may think about prior to doing it

838
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:48,480
what is it specifically that you're asking for so if you want to start out by asking i'd like you

839
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:54,320
know would you be willing to postpone this decision until after high school might be a more direct

840
01:38:54,320 --> 01:39:00,880
assert but it could be there's other factors that might contribute to you asking it more tentatively

841
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:07,840
or more firmly but making a direct ask now what we often say about this you didn't illustrate this

842
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:14,800
but what we often say about this a part the assert is that a lot of the time we don't actually

843
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:21,120
assert we just want somebody else to read our minds or do what we want and i think this is

844
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:28,560
especially a problem for uh not to over generalize but i think women have more trouble with this on

845
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:35,360
average than men loads of reasons for that but actually asking directly for what it is that you

846
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:40,960
want is is really challenging for people and so what instead you would see people doing is just

847
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:47,440
doing the describe and express and then expecting the other person to just know what it is they want

848
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:52,560
and do it so we're trying to get people to to learn how to be more comfortable with

849
01:39:53,120 --> 01:40:00,960
asking and stating directly what it is that you're that you want and then the r is stands for

850
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:08,400
reinforce uh which is to say you want to say explicitly what's what's in it for the other

851
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:15,680
person what reward could come their way by by giving into your request or giving you what you

852
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:21,440
want which in a second we can talk about whether or not this is manipulation but in the moment uh

853
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:27,280
in your dialogue with olivia what's in it what's something that you could imagine uh reinforcing

854
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:31,840
so here's where i could go into many directions right one direction is

855
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:39,520
you know you play volleyball you're really good at volleyball you're you're playing year round now

856
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:45,760
and the more jewelry you have on the greater your risk of injury you get hit in the head with a ball

857
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,040
that's one more thing that could hurt this is just one less thing to worry about right that would be

858
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,520
one sort of very narrow niche approach probably my preferred way would be something like

859
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:06,240
optionality is a great thing and by not doing it now it doesn't mean that you can't do it tomorrow

860
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:10,800
you always have that option but you can't undo it once you have it now she'll argue

861
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,240
yes you can you can just take it out so i don't know maybe she's right but um

862
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,720
that's probably those would be the the things i would reinforce which is

863
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,360
i'm not saying no i'm just saying not now and that really isn't taking anything away it's just

864
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:31,440
potentially delaying something yeah so what i would say is that i agree with you about all of

865
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:37,360
those points what you're doing is you're providing more evidence in favor of what it is that you're

866
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:47,120
asking for but if i were to think about about uh reinforcing in the sense of what reward

867
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:58,080
could she expect if she were to say yes dad i won't get a another piercing so is this something

868
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:04,800
like where i could literally just say and if you don't do this like i give you know is it literally

869
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,960
like you're bribing your kid is that potentially what's in there well it could be uh but i wouldn't

870
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:16,480
necessarily i mean it would be bribery but bribery is what we do all the time right if you mean would

871
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:22,320
it be something like you know and if you don't do this i mean we could go shopping in those new

872
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:30,160
converse shoes you love let's get those instead it could be okay yeah i never thought of it that

873
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:37,200
way right i've always thought of it in more sort of theoretical reinforcement which i think um

874
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:43,520
can work sometimes with some people but i think uh more often than not

875
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:53,760
it needs to be a tangible connection to to this now what we often say is a good good fall back

876
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,600
you know to asking somebody for something um at work or interpersonally is to say if you do this

877
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:06,160
i would really appreciate it right my appreciation of you and your behavior is a reinforcer

878
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:11,680
right you might feel good by the fact that i appreciate it when i see something like what

879
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:17,040
you're describing your daughter wants her dad's appreciation of not high on the list of things

880
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:23,120
exactly right so you have to think about the person that you're asking and what is most likely

881
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:29,680
to work now and and you also have to think about it to a certain extent how important is it for you

882
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,240
to get this thing that you're asking for and if it's really important for you to get it

883
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,400
then you might say oh i don't like you know buying her sneakers instead but if that's what

884
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,360
worked then we would say you know be effective like in this situation if this was something

885
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,760
that was really important to you well and i think it illustrates this i'm glad we did this example

886
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:53,600
which is kind of like i thought of it as well sort of glib but it illustrates another point which is

887
01:43:54,480 --> 01:44:03,040
um there's sort of there's a meta thing here which is i'm teaching her by my behavior

888
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:08,640
and my interaction what is a more emotionally regulated way to handle this because

889
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:16,960
i think if the old version of me would have just said no like i'm the parent you're doing what i

890
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:23,360
say like this is non-negotiable and you know if i was a kid and argued this i would have got the

891
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:28,000
back of the hand to my face so just be lucky you're not getting that for even pushing and provoking

892
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,520
this discussion you know i mean like so so that would have been the old way to have dealt with

893
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:39,520
this and and so i get to at least they would have run out and gotten the earring and just right

894
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:47,360
right so now instead we get to model something better and i i think that that's the other i

895
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:52,800
assume that that also factors into the dbt for adolescence which i actually haven't maybe it's

896
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,040
time that i sort of look at that as well but i i haven't really spent any time looking at that work

897
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,800
but i would imagine that it's as much about helping the kids as showing the kids how the

898
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:11,040
parents can change as well well what what is an amazing adaptation for dbt so in standard dbt for

899
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:17,520
adults in uh what we do we haven't really explained like what the therapy looks like but in general

900
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,560
what would happen if somebody were receiving dbt treatment is that they would be coming to a skills

901
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,880
training group once a week or receiving skills training individually where they meet with the

902
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:34,320
therapist who teaches them these specific skills they practice that they come back report on their

903
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:41,520
practice um and get feedback and coaching etc in skills training group you might have a number of

904
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,480
adults all together and you teach them all together and you assign homework and you all talk about the

905
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:53,120
practice and use of skills what was an amazing i mean i just think it's so brilliant adaptation

906
01:45:53,120 --> 01:46:00,240
for dbt for adolescents is that in your skills group you have now multi they're called multi-family

907
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:05,120
skills groups where you have the adolescents in the skills groups but you also have the

908
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:12,480
adolescent adolescents parents or caretakers in the skills group at the same time and everybody

909
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:18,960
is learning the skills all together and the way these groups are designed it's not overall learning

910
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:24,480
these skills so that you all can you know help your adolescent apply them of course that's part

911
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:30,160
of it but we're framing the groups as saying we're teaching everybody the skills because the parents

912
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:35,760
need the skills as much as the adolescents need the skills and therefore the parents have been

913
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:41,840
caregivers have to practice the skills on themselves not just for their adolescents

914
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,920
i mean do you do you do you find it's do you find it's harder for the parents because

915
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,840
you know you said something earlier which i completely agree with

916
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:56,960
it would almost be easier to come to dbt with no skills positive or negative and then just learn

917
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:05,280
the positive skills um it's it's harder to come in when you have decades of reinforced negative

918
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:12,800
skills anti-skills and you have to unlearn anti-skills and then build positive skills so

919
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,040
do you see that it's easier for the kids sometimes to pick this up than their parents

920
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:26,880
i think there's um sometimes easier to pick up but there's different levels of willingness

921
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:32,560
and willfulness yeah so with adolescents a lot of the times adolescents not not necessarily there

922
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,520
by choice i'm guessing sometimes yes so a lot of the times it's their parents or their schools

923
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,320
that say they have to do this and so there's always a question of how much they're there because they

924
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,880
want to be there at a less i mean of course with adults in certain contexts and situations they

925
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:55,920
don't want there to be there easy uh either but there's generally more willingness um let's talk

926
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,440
about the structure of the therapy i've jumped around a lot because there's just so many interesting

927
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:05,440
frameworks and i want to make sure we get to them but um let's assume that you know a person comes

928
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:12,240
to you now um and they're there by their own choice this is an adult and they don't meet the

929
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,400
criteria for any of the dsm-5s so this is just someone who's having difficulty interpersonally

930
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:24,320
um you know one of the things that i think i sort of realized was so much dysregulation stems from

931
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:30,480
interpersonal interactions gone bad with your spouse with your child with your co-worker with

932
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:35,200
the person who cuts you off on the street i mean it's generally an interpersonal interaction

933
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:42,640
that doesn't meet your expectations whether those are reasonable or not reasonable that then leads

934
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:48,400
to sort of an emotional regulation or dysregulation thoughts that then feed into those emotional

935
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:55,600
dysregulations and then you create this awful feed forward loop that can lead to bad behaviors i mean

936
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:01,040
that is that it's sort of a safe way to talk about it from interpersonal to thoughts uh emotion

937
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:04,960
emotions thoughts feeding off each other and then behaviors i mean that's kind of like the pathway

938
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:12,000
of how this all seems to go wrong for people and i mean there are some people out there who just i

939
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,960
seem who seem just wonderful and they don't seem to suffer from these issues but but most people if

940
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,000
we're being really honest with ourselves even if you're not as extreme as as me i think most people

941
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,920
realize that this isn't always going well especially as we're under more external stress you know

942
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,560
there i i love the idea of distress tolerance and i i think that's just one of the most

943
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,520
interesting concepts is a window and that's the sort of image that i have of it right so

944
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:45,920
i mean this entire year my distress tolerance window is about this thick and it's all my own

945
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:51,840
fault i've put way too many things on my plate and so there's no buffer there's no margin for

946
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,560
error one thing even before this podcast was recorded i was getting upset about some stupid

947
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:01,760
video i had to record that i was like yeah but i had to record it twice it was supposed to be two

948
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,920
minutes the first time i did it it took two minutes and 20 seconds like like something so

949
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:12,800
like something so dumb that shouldn't even bother me bothered me because i'm out of time so so

950
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:19,440
something like external factors will change your distress tolerance window and and for me it's

951
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:23,360
always being too close to the top where it's getting upset but for some people it's being

952
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:29,120
too close to the bottom and it's getting you know sort of dysthymic or depressive versus getting

953
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:36,080
irritable and during good times like people imagine being on vacation where for two weeks

954
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:42,320
like you don't have to worry about email nothing is going on you know nothing really seems to

955
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,080
bother you doesn't you know you go to a restaurant and they forgot your reservation you're like yeah

956
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:50,800
no problem we'll go to the next one like it just you know i think people can resonate with this

957
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:57,360
idea so one of the skills is how do you make that distress tolerance window higher how do you make

958
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:03,520
it wider there's nobody that's not going to benefit from this so it's a it's a long rambling

959
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,920
question but really where i'm going is you get somebody that comes in where do you start

960
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:15,200
well i will say that one of the when when you just said that what i was reminded of is

961
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:24,000
what is learning what makes us more vulnerable to negative emotions or stress or distress and

962
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:32,560
that is another key skill in dbt is to identify and understand what our vulnerability factors are

963
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:39,600
and then to address because sometimes we could actually solve our you know target or treat our

964
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:49,440
vulnerability factors and our lives just go much more smoothly you know when we sleep decently you

965
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,800
know when we remove some things from our list so that we're not so stressed all the time like that

966
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:59,120
could actually solve a number of problems but where i start with by the way that's i want to

967
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:03,120
that's i'm glad you brought that up because i i i should have mentioned that's actually one of the

968
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:11,520
first things andy asks me every i i work with andy once a week so we every you know i've been

969
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:15,840
working with him for two years now it's always once a week um but that's one of the first

970
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:22,080
questions he always asks which is tell me what's going on physically right so are you in pain

971
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:27,840
are you sleeping uh what are the other vulnerabilities and i think out of the

972
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:34,560
gate he's trying to gauge what state i'm in as a function of how many things are pressing me

973
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:45,280
and what uh and i mean i can't speak for what andy's doing but uh and how um in those moments how

974
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:52,480
able are you to receive info like if you're at you know a 90 on a scale zero to 100 you're not

975
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:58,560
taking in a lot you're not learning a lot right so we if you're at that level that we need to figure

976
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:06,320
out how do we get you regulated enough so that you could learn uh learn to do something differently

977
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:11,360
and i think that that's great that he asked those questions i think for myself when i'm in physical

978
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:19,920
pain i i just can't do much of anything and it makes me admire yeah yeah or sleep deprived as you

979
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:28,400
said i think i think uh he he's he's had me pay much more attention to those things like if you

980
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:34,480
haven't slept well in two nights you can't and you shouldn't assume that you're at your best

981
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:41,520
in terms of your ability to receive both information and tolerate things um physical

982
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:48,000
pain is a very interesting one i agree with you completely um i'd love for you to share an example

983
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,000
of your own life i have so many of where i've been in pain and it's made me more irritable

984
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,560
what what have you noticed and what do you do about it specifically well what i was going to

985
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:04,880
i just admire people so much who have chronic pain conditions and and function in their lives

986
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:11,440
because i have been fortunate to not i mean i've had pain um but to not have a chronic pain

987
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:19,360
condition uh because i think uh that would be a challenge um for me to learn how to navigate that

988
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:26,560
but i do think that when i'm experiencing pain and whether it's you know a transient headache

989
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:36,000
that i know will pass or um i hurt my back you know exercising and now i feel it you know every

990
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:43,280
which way i i personally recognize that as a huge vulnerability factor for me because it makes me

991
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:53,360
more irritable um in general and makes me much more likely to to snap at people um or to have

992
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:59,680
less patience for things so for me what that means is recognizing kind of similar to what you

993
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:06,480
said like okay this is going on for me right now i have to accept this is going on for me right now

994
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:12,320
because i can't just will away physical pain as much as i want to and know that this is a

995
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:18,160
vulnerable time for me so given that it's a vulnerable vulnerable time for me is there a

996
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:26,080
way that i can reduce demands on myself in other ways or is there a way that i can treat myself

997
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:34,400
kindly in other ways to kind of offset the the pain that i'm experiencing and sometimes it's

998
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:41,360
for me it's also um learning to be more explicit and vocal as it relates to kind of this

999
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:50,960
interpersonal effectiveness uh because when we experience pain it's often entirely um experienced

1000
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:57,360
within our bodies other people may not uh even know that this is happening for us so learning to

1001
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,920
say out loud and you know granted it helps as your kids get older you can say things when they're

1002
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:08,480
younger you can't say as easily mommy has a headache so you know but they get older and you could say

1003
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:13,920
um i'm really suffering right now from this headache so i need to have a little bit of space

1004
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:20,880
you know from this conversation or this situation so learning to recognize this as a vulnerability

1005
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:27,440
factor and then figuring out how can i act more skillfully within this context to prevent

1006
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:34,080
the lashing out to prevent irritability because i don't know if this is your experience peter but

1007
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:41,920
mine is that whenever i do act out of anger i almost always regret it and almost always feel

1008
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:49,280
worse about myself um afterwards and so it's almost a selfish process it's it's to help the

1009
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:53,280
other person by saying i'm not going to get irritable with my kids it's to protect them but

1010
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:59,920
it's also to help me not feel so bad afterwards uh because my kids will recover i'll recover but

1011
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:07,040
i don't like how it makes me feel yeah the the cycle of of anger and shame and isolation is is a

1012
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:14,320
is a pretty frequent i know the path well um you know before we leave the pain thing one thing

1013
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:21,120
i've observed in myself is not all pain is created equal and expected pain seems to be far less

1014
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:28,880
destabilizing to me than unexpected pain so i had shoulder surgery recently um i don't know why i

1015
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,920
hadn't been told how much it would hurt but and i so i didn't really want to take any of the

1016
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:38,320
narcotics and things like that i mean for a week it was i mean for two days the pain was so bad i

1017
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:42,640
couldn't sleep i mean literally i was just sitting up in a chair not sleeping for two nights but even

1018
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:52,000
for that week the pain was excruciating interestingly it didn't uh negatively impact me in terms of

1019
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,120
interactions like it didn't i would have guessed look knowing what i know about how much pain can

1020
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:02,640
destabilize distress tolerance um capacity i would have thought well that would have thrown me over

1021
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:08,400
the edge but it didn't because it was like look i had six trocars in my shoulder i just had a an

1022
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:15,200
enormous operation this is kind of what it's going to feel like whereas i've had headaches that have

1023
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:21,360
lasted for three days at a time due to you know some awful tension and no amount of tylenol can

1024
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:27,760
make it go away and it ostensibly it's not as bad as my shoulder was hurting but one i don't

1025
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:33,760
expect it i don't know why i have it it i find that far more destabilizing to me from an emotional

1026
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,760
regulation standpoint i don't know if you've ever observed that and by the way i think people with

1027
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:43,920
chronic pain that must be the most frustrating and difficult thing because a lot of those patients

1028
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,800
are told by physicians like either a there's nothing we can do or b this is in your head and

1029
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:56,240
really you should just kind of ignore this i 100 agree with you personally and professionally

1030
01:58:56,240 --> 01:59:03,120
what i noticed and what you said is that you actually um engage in a lot of self-validation

1031
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:08,800
with regard to the shoulder surgery basically saying of course i feel this way it's okay to

1032
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:15,200
feel this way and i think with the other pain that we experience sometimes we might not realize that

1033
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:19,440
we're doing this so explicitly but we're actually invalidating ourselves we're saying

1034
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:24,400
why am i feeling this way what's wrong with me how could this be happening right and so we're

1035
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:30,880
rejecting it and and i have my own personal example i'm i'm tapering off a medication right now

1036
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:38,400
and i didn't realize when i was prescribed this medication how difficult it it's known to be a

1037
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:45,040
medication that's difficult to get off and had i known that um it was sort of a moment of weakness

1038
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:50,960
that i was prescribed this i decided to take it had i known how horrible it would feel to go off

1039
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:58,880
it i never would have gone on it um but now i'm i'm trying to wean myself off of it i'm i'm really

1040
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:05,440
going kind of nuts with how much i'm like microtosing myself on this medication because i start to

1041
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:12,400
feel this this withdrawal symptom and i'm realizing exactly to this point that you made is that part

1042
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:18,240
of the suffering that i'm experiencing about this is my thoughts like oh what if this goes on

1043
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:25,520
forever what if this doesn't end and and even when i realize okay it's not going to last forever the

1044
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:32,320
subsequent thought is but can i tolerate this for two weeks you know why can't it just go away and

1045
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:39,440
so this is the way in which we do have some control over the suffering that we experience because

1046
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:45,920
we're adding on all of these thoughts and so one of the one of the mindfulness tricks that i really

1047
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:53,120
love when i hear it is i think i heard it as it relates to like learning to be mindful and

1048
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:59,520
accepting of your emotions is just to say to yourself it's okay to feel this and it seems so

1049
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:07,600
simple but just say those words it's okay to feel this no matter what the this is is can be a really

1050
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:14,160
powerful experience and i think even with the pain we could say it's it's okay to feel this

1051
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:21,840
and just notice what effect that has on us so going back to kind of the beginning of the

1052
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:27,440
interaction with the clinician and the patient you start with this idea of what are the vulnerabilities

1053
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:35,760
so once you sort of establish that and i suspect a lot of that is you'll see it quicker than the

1054
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:42,720
patient will like a lot of times people probably don't appreciate what the vulnerabilities are

1055
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:48,080
until they're kind of pointed out which is no like these are again it's a form of validation

1056
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:56,240
these are really clear things that are going to make it more challenging for you to be understanding

1057
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:00,480
of others to be understanding of yourself to regulate your emotion to control your thoughts

1058
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:06,000
and ultimately to control your behaviors so once you establish that i imagine it's somewhat

1059
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,160
liberating for people it's it's kind of a nice first way to have you validate things for them

1060
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:21,600
is that usually received that way so i think for a lot of people understanding the vulnerability

1061
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:29,200
factors and determining ways to reduce their vulnerability is really critical and you ask me

1062
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:35,120
like what i would typically do with somebody who first came in and i think that is something i

1063
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:42,400
mean i'm used to working only with people who meet criteria for bpd and are unusually on that more

1064
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:50,320
severe end of the continuum so i don't have a lot of people i don't have experience with you know

1065
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:58,640
people that are not as extreme usually so i think that for a lot of people learning about

1066
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:03,760
vulnerability factors is really important but i put vulnerability factors in the context of

1067
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:11,600
something that we do in dbt called a chain analysis which is a way of assessing problem

1068
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:17,280
behaviors that people have that they want to change as a way of assessing it in order to figure out

1069
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:24,960
how to change it going forward so vulnerability factors is an element of that chain analysis so

1070
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:30,880
for example you know you were in treatment with me and one of the things we were working on is

1071
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:40,000
this target behavior of you exploding in anger at you know various points we would identify

1072
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,960
what a recent occasion in which that happened and then we would do an assessment of what were all

1073
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:53,200
the factors events thoughts behaviors that led up to that behavior and then what were the consequences

1074
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:59,760
of that behavior that would be the chain that we assess as a way of identifying okay well what can

1075
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:07,680
we modify in this chain going forward to make it less likely that that problem behavior is going

1076
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:13,040
to show up again and i think what we've been talking about is addressing what happens actually

1077
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:18,240
very early on in the chain that vulnerability factor and for some people and in some situations

1078
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:25,360
working on the vulnerability factor changes everything that follows but there's other events

1079
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:30,480
and circumstances where it's not about the vulnerability factor or the vulnerability

1080
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:35,600
factor is just one element but something happens in the environment a prompting event we would call

1081
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:42,400
it perhaps that sets off the chain and it doesn't matter whether you got sleep or not the night

1082
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:48,080
before because no matter what that whenever that prompting event happens you're going to explode in

1083
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:53,040
anger right so we want to work on vulnerability factors but we also want to identify well what

1084
02:04:53,040 --> 02:05:01,360
are some other critical elements along the path towards the problem behavior that we can address

1085
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:08,480
and and uh behaviorally manipulate yeah i mean when you say it that way it's really obvious because

1086
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:14,720
you know even using myself as an example which is probably a more extreme example nothing ever

1087
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:20,480
occurs in isolation like i've yet to come up with one example in my life where i can say yeah i

1088
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:25,600
flew off the handle and it was only because of what was happening in that moment i mean it's just

1089
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:32,640
not the case it's if i flew off the handle this is a situation where i would have barely got upset

1090
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:39,520
a day ago or a week from now it was the literally the six things that had happened and maybe yeah

1091
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,200
maybe maybe i didn't have a great sleep that's not what caused it of course but that made me more

1092
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:49,600
susceptible and maybe this other thing happened and i didn't deal with it you know i didn't

1093
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:55,440
confront the person who said such a thing that upset me and i just sort of buried it and went on

1094
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,320
and maybe i you know read something on social media and i didn't even acknowledge that that

1095
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:05,920
was very upsetting to me somebody attacked me and i sort of ignored it and then i find myself

1096
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:12,080
in this situation and um i liken it to sort of the the challenger blowing up you remember when

1097
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:17,360
the space shuttle challenger blew up this is you know god almost uh 40 years ago now um

1098
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:24,000
it's so interesting and i'm an engineer by training so i i really have a keen interest in

1099
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,920
in kind of the ins and outs of that that type of scenario and what you realize is like there was

1100
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:36,080
nothing sudden about that horrible tragedy nothing about that was remotely sudden and

1101
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:42,080
unexpected when you actually peel back the layers of the onion and go through the entire chain

1102
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:48,720
analysis for not just the challenger but all the previous space shuttles and you realize

1103
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:57,520
how inevitable this was and on that day this was almost a foregone conclusion um and yet at the

1104
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:02,720
surface it just you know again now imagine watching that as a spectator oh my gosh how

1105
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:11,600
could that happen well it it ties into the you would get an a on your dbt test because it ties

1106
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:20,560
into the dialectical philosophy of everything is caused right and everything has multiple causes

1107
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:34,080
um and that is very hard to accept sometimes and it's also very hard to experience especially in

1108
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:44,400
our dominant culture that wants us to believe that there are simple answers uh and there's one person

1109
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:51,120
to blame or one root cause that's that's what the dominant culture is trying to tell us about

1110
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:58,480
everything and anything because that's simple and it's more complex than that uh that there's

1111
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:06,000
always multiple determinants um of anything and that we could dissect

1112
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:13,600
any behavior any problem and see the thousands or millions of causes that led up to that behavior

1113
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:19,360
i have one of the pages in front of me that i've copied from my skills book that has so many of my

1114
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:26,000
notes in it um and it you probably remember the page it's um sort of what makes it hard to regulate

1115
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,960
your emotions and i've all this is probably one of the 10 you know this is a 350 page 400 page workbook

1116
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:38,960
but this would be there's probably 30 or 40 pages that i have stickies in and this would be one of

1117
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,360
the 10 most important and it's just this great reminder so just for the person listening to this

1118
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:47,760
so what makes it hard to regulate your emotions biology let's just acknowledge there are

1119
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:54,480
biological differences between us our brains are different um i won't go into some of the details

1120
02:08:54,480 --> 02:09:00,240
there but but you know anybody who has many kids more than one will recognize that they are simply

1121
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,640
different even if they're raised identically um one that we already talked about lack of skill

1122
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:10,000
right so lack of skill because skills were not taught because good skills were pushed away or

1123
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,520
because bad skills were reinforced i think this comes from it which is reinforcement of emotional

1124
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:21,520
behavior so kind of going back to childhood this one's very interesting right moodiness right

1125
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:28,320
your your mood in the moment will alter your ability to regulate emotion um this one i can

1126
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:34,160
relate to a ton which is emotional overload so the more pressure you have on you whether

1127
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:40,080
self-imposed or otherwise the more difficult it is and then one that i love which is emotional myths

1128
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:47,360
so mistaken beliefs about these things and i just may i have my own notes here one of them says when

1129
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:53,440
i can't regulate it is almost always the case that at least one and typically three of these

1130
02:09:53,440 --> 02:10:01,520
are happening um so it's very interesting you know again three of these really pegged to

1131
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:06,000
childhood right the biology the reinforcement of emotional behavior plus or minus skill and the

1132
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:14,640
emotional myths yes i definitely think that they um a lot of them are long-standing patterns and

1133
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:22,720
some of them are are current and also contextual so for example there might be a person in your life

1134
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:33,200
just one of many that actually when you um uh display anger gives in to everything you're asking

1135
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,320
right and that this could be totally outside of your awareness but that means that you're more

1136
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:47,920
likely to have that anger response with that person in that context uh in the future i had

1137
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:56,720
a while you know before my husband uh ex-boyfriend at one point who um when we would argue if i started

1138
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:03,760
to cry he would immediately back down and this was outside of my awareness that this was happening

1139
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:12,000
but i realized over time i found myself crying a lot more than i ever had before um and crying is

1140
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,400
i'm not saying crying is good or bad but i just noticed that that was what was happening because

1141
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:22,720
in that context with that person that behavior was was being reinforced and i feel like this could

1142
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:31,520
happen so subtly and um it's so contextual that how we and why we're sometimes different with

1143
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:38,160
different people um is because of that this is often at least as it relates to bpd is is like

1144
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:42,560
pathologized oh if a person if you're different with different people there's something wrong

1145
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:48,560
with you you have no core sense of identity or something but i would say it's actually pretty

1146
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:54,880
normal we're all different with different people um because the context you know often call for that

1147
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:02,880
and it's adaptive to be that way so is it essential for everybody who's practicing dbt to also be

1148
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:10,240
practicing mindfulness meditation given the importance of that first step which is

1149
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:16,400
recognizing the thought it is uh well we might have to disentangle what we mean by mindfulness

1150
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:25,040
meditation because i would say mindfulness as a skill is central to everything yeah sorry let me

1151
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:30,560
rephrase the question given the importance of mindfulness as a central tenet to this entire

1152
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:38,320
practice is it also suggested that people use a form of meditation that practices the

1153
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:44,000
skill you know you you know typically focusing on something like the breath or an object and

1154
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:50,640
you know bringing their attention back to that every time it wanders as kind of one form yeah

1155
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:58,880
we have actually debated this uh within dbt and i remember actually there was a while that

1156
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:05,760
marcia was when i was a student of hers and therefore seeing her every day when she was on

1157
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:13,200
this this kick for lack of a better word saying that we need to get all the therapists to practice

1158
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:19,040
seated meditation like you're describing for at least 20 minutes every day and actually there's a

1159
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:27,440
form of cognitive behavioral therapy called mindfulness-based stress reduction mbsr you

1160
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:34,480
may have heard of it for depression in which they they teach people who are in the treatment

1161
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:40,720
to work up to that seated meditation and they also require that therapists who

1162
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:46,800
do mbsr also practice it that way and so marcia was thinking do i need to require this and i remember

1163
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:55,600
even way back when arguing against it at the time because i thought that's that's not actually

1164
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:05,040
practical for everybody always i think about a working mom who a single mom with three kids and

1165
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:16,000
to say you need to find 20 minutes a day to do seated meditation is is um impractical um there

1166
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:24,640
have been many times in my life where that was impractical as well so uh she and part of this was

1167
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:30,080
to try to figure out like how do we define a dbt therapist how do we know when somebody is doing

1168
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:37,440
dbt um so we she never ended up requiring or saying that therapists have to do this but what

1169
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:44,720
she would say is that therapists who practice dbt have to have a mindfulness practice but that

1170
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:54,400
practice could be anything um under the umbrella of mindfulness so you do yoga that's uh

1171
02:14:54,400 --> 02:15:00,000
could be your mindfulness practice or you do mind you know you do mindful walking or you do

1172
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:06,560
mindful participating in various things and i would say that that is something when it comes to

1173
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:16,320
clients who are in dbt we want them to strengthen their mindfulness muscle absolutely and if i have

1174
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:23,520
clients who are interested in learning to do seated meditation that's amazing and i would

1175
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:29,840
support that entirely i think for a lot of the clients that we work with at my clinic

1176
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:37,200
that would be too big a jump um and why marcia doesn't doesn't say that clients need to do this

1177
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:43,840
because lots for a lot of people who are in dbt who might be at that more severe end of the

1178
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:50,560
continuum just sitting with themselves and their thoughts and their minds without doing anything

1179
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:58,080
to change it for a minute could be excruciating um so we're trying to build that that tolerance

1180
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:06,480
of course but the mindfulness skills in dbt are much more concrete and practical and designed to

1181
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:16,240
be used in any moment rather than um designed to facilitate a more formal practice you know obviously

1182
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:20,480
we can't cover dbt in any comprehensive manner there's so much but there are a couple things

1183
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:25,120
i'd love to just highlight that i have found very helpful and i'd love to kind of hear your

1184
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:32,400
you expand on them one is opposite action which is um you know for anybody who's done dbt you'll

1185
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:37,600
grin when you just or grimace depending on because how hard it can be sometimes right

1186
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:42,320
do you want to explain to people what opposite action is and when we use it i think you know

1187
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:46,800
what's the use case for this yeah i did my dissertation on opposite oh i didn't know that

1188
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:54,320
action i did okay so opposite action is a skill that falls into the emotion regulation module

1189
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:58,400
and it's a skill for changing an emotion that you don't want to have

1190
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:10,720
and it's simple in concept and hard to execute because uh simply put it's engaging in the opposite

1191
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:16,160
of what your urges are telling you to do so we know and that's why it's called opposite action

1192
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:22,240
so we know that from emotion science from our own experiences that our experience of emotions

1193
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:31,920
are associated with an urge to act in particular ways so when we feel sad we have an urge to retreat

1194
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:40,720
or withdraw when we experience anger we have an urge to lash out when we experience shame it's to

1195
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:50,960
hide fear it's to fight or flight and so what opposite action says is that when your emotion

1196
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:58,240
does not fit the facts of the situation or is too intense for the situation and you want to change

1197
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:05,440
it a way to change it is to act opposite to your urges so when i'm sad instead of withdrawing i

1198
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:11,040
activate when i'm fearful instead of running away i approach kind of like the exposure we were

1199
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:18,720
talking about earlier when i'm experiencing shame rather than hide i actually confront or disclose

1200
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:30,240
and and so on so it is really hard to do but you get better at it over time i will say that if you

1201
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:34,800
practice i don't know if that's been your experience it has been and i but what i want

1202
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:38,080
to tell you and i guess you'll appreciate this given your background especially is

1203
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,000
you know i mentioned earlier anger being a profound emotion that i'm very familiar with

1204
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:50,720
the other one is is um i don't know what the underlying emotion is i haven't really figured

1205
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:59,360
it out yet um i don't think it's sadness but it produces a phenotype of needing to isolate

1206
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:06,960
so there's a uh just a desire to completely isolate so these are two areas where opposite

1207
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:11,520
action becomes very helpful right so with you know one of the really interesting things that

1208
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:15,680
if you told me this five years ago i would have never believed it but it's remarkable is the use

1209
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:25,600
of cold water to calm uh the nervous system in in moments of high fight or flight mode so that's

1210
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:30,160
part of the opposite action effect there i feel angry i'm going to go and do something that's

1211
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:35,280
really calming which is take an ice shower or jump in the cold pool this is nice in the winter

1212
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:39,280
here in austin because we still have pools open and they're you know really cold in the winter

1213
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:47,360
where i have but that's harder those are harder to do it's as you probably can imagine when you're

1214
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:54,400
when you're at nine out of ten activation and your desire is to scream or break something

1215
02:19:55,360 --> 02:20:02,560
to then walk yourself back from that is harder where i have found um opposite action to be

1216
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:08,400
remarkably helpful and helpful to the point where it's now the norm this this might be my biggest

1217
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:16,160
win so far is when all i want to do is isolate forcing myself to go and play with my kids

1218
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:19,920
and i remember the very first time this happened it was about a year and a half ago

1219
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:27,280
and for reasons i didn't understand it was a sunday morning and i just didn't want you know

1220
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:32,880
i wanted to sit in the office and do work and exercise and just do my own thing and be my own

1221
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:39,840
thing and my wife said hey we're gonna go to barton creek and you know play on the rocks and

1222
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,120
throw rocks in the water and stuff and again that's the sort of thing i would have said

1223
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:49,120
absolutely not i'm too busy i just i'm overwhelmed i need to just do this thing

1224
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:53,680
and she would have accepted it she would have been upset and she would have accepted it and she

1225
02:20:53,680 --> 02:21:00,880
would laugh and i was like okay let's go now i didn't want to go at all shireen i mean the

1226
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:07,680
thought of not getting my work done and missing a workout potentially and then going to some place

1227
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:12,240
where it's totally unstructured and there's going to be other kids potentially and it's going to be

1228
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:20,960
loud like that everything about that was unappealing and we had this amazing time doing

1229
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:26,000
nothing literally playing games like who could get across the creek without getting the most water

1230
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,720
in their shoes and you know exactly what you'd expect and then on the way home we stopped and

1231
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:35,200
got a burger and fries like the last thing i'd want to do right like we did everything i would

1232
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:41,680
never want to do and i got home and i felt great and i didn't get as much work done and you know

1233
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:47,280
and now that's become kind of the real is like you do that enough times that you realize this

1234
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:54,240
really works this is the key for me this is important when i don't want to engage with anybody

1235
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:59,600
go and engage with my family because that's by that's the drug to get out of this so yeah i

1236
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:07,280
think opposite action is really a remarkable tool even the think of a simpler one smiling when you're

1237
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:16,400
furious and meaning it right so uh what marcia talks about is this opposite action all the way

1238
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:22,320
because we all know what a fake smile is and a fake smile while you're also in your mind thinking

1239
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:27,120
oh what a asshole i hate this person you know like that's not opposite action because that's

1240
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:33,040
what we might say half-assed opposite action it's not going to work because your mind is

1241
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:37,760
still going to be angry but what's going to happen really what we're talking about with

1242
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:43,040
opposite action is if we act opposite to our urges we're sending the feedback back to our brain

1243
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:51,040
to to feel a different way right so approaching i think for a lot of people relate to the idea

1244
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:56,000
of doing opposite action like what you said but also with when you're feeling socially anxious

1245
02:22:56,560 --> 02:23:02,560
like you want to avoid going to the party or speaking up in class or at work because you're

1246
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:08,160
anxious and maybe you have a long history of avoiding saying anything or doing anything

1247
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:14,400
because you're anxious so opposite action would be to say throw yourself into that go to that party

1248
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:18,800
even though you don't want to and then throw yourself into the party which is what you

1249
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:25,040
described with your family like you could have gone along physically but all the while been thinking

1250
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:29,760
i could have been sitting there on my phone or goofing off yeah yeah or thinking this is stupid

1251
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,560
or whatever but you threw yourself into it when you were there and i think that that's the the

1252
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:40,160
critical piece it's not just the the moving your body there it's throwing your mind into it as well

1253
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:47,600
so what else do you think would be really interesting for a person who's never heard

1254
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:53,920
of dbt to kind of understand as they themselves contemplate hey is this something is this a new

1255
02:23:53,920 --> 02:24:02,320
skill i should learn right it's it's no different than saying i'd like to learn tennis because i know

1256
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:08,960
that as i age full court basketball might be hard for me but tennis is something that i'll be able

1257
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:14,880
to play for longer therefore i want to go and learn this skill i'm gonna need to coach i'm

1258
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:21,200
gonna need to practice and a year from now i'll be better than i am today but i mean is that do

1259
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:27,840
you think that's a good way to think about dbt well i do with with some caveats so you know

1260
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:35,200
anybody who reads any news or is living their lives right now knows that what we're hearing

1261
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:39,440
about is the idea that we're in a mental health crisis or that there's endless mental health

1262
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:45,920
crises right now and what we know is that there are just simply not enough mental health providers

1263
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:52,480
to treat all the need that's out there and what that has meant on a practical level is that there

1264
02:24:52,480 --> 02:25:02,800
are huge long waiting lists for treatment everywhere for most people and and i don't think

1265
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:08,160
that we don't want that to deter people from seeking out help when they need it but the point

1266
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:14,160
i want to make as it relates to that is that i don't think everybody needs full-on dbt and

1267
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:21,280
and we don't yet have the science really this is actually an area of research that i'm interested

1268
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:29,360
in is trying to figure out who does need the full package of dbt versus who can benefit from a

1269
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:36,080
lighter touch a lower dose you know whatever word you want to use there because we want to be

1270
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:45,120
efficient in our mental health delivery we also want people to learn to reduce suffering of people

1271
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:51,360
on a on a mass level so is dbt something this sort of interrupt but just to kind of this will fit

1272
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:57,840
into what you're saying is dbt something that can be done somewhat effectively on your own

1273
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:06,240
meaning with manuals with books with videos online versus the way you would work with

1274
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:10,640
you know people who are much sicker where you have to be working with them directly in person

1275
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:16,720
so this is what we don't know yet i think we have some assumptions about this

1276
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:24,080
but i don't even know if our assumptions are that valid but i think you know the assumption was

1277
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:32,480
always for example that if somebody is experiencing suicidal thoughts they absolutely need you know

1278
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:38,160
some form of treatment and it needs to be in person and it needs you know to be x y and z

1279
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:46,080
and i think covid actually threw us into this new world that we weren't expecting because we had to

1280
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:52,080
start treating people who were suicidal virtually for example and we were able to realize that this

1281
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:59,600
idea that we had to see people in person was a myth that we believed and there were reasons why

1282
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:08,400
we believed it but but there doesn't seem to be any as far as we know so far any added risk of

1283
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:15,680
seeing somebody through telehealth when they're suicidal so i think a lot of our assumptions about

1284
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:22,320
what people need are our assumptions that we don't actually know a lot about so one of an area of

1285
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:28,640
research that i'm interested in and that i actually applied for some funding to do is to do kind of a

1286
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:35,600
stepped care model of dbt to start everybody with what we might call a low dose intervention like

1287
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:44,880
videos of skills and see what percentage of people benefit from that and from that alone

1288
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:51,680
versus what percentage of people don't benefit enough need something else and then what can we

1289
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:57,440
add to that that would be a slightly step up like maybe some phone coaching you get a call with

1290
02:27:57,440 --> 02:28:03,600
somebody once a week about how to apply the skills in your daily life then then test it again right

1291
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:08,800
and then if you're not responding to that maybe then you get offered the full package of dbt

1292
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:17,200
or something else and we basically can identify through that kind of study what are the sequences

1293
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:24,400
of care that are going to be most effective that will help the most people and can be disseminable

1294
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:30,240
so that's that's an area of research that i would love to do we don't have a lot of knowledge about

1295
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:36,480
that so i'll but i'll say and i think we spoke about this very early on is that i honestly

1296
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:43,600
believe that anybody could benefit from learning dbt skills and so to that end i would say yes i

1297
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:51,600
think there is a value to your listeners to say expose yourself to some of these skills see if

1298
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,840
and there are videos there are books there are things that you could do to learn more about them

1299
02:28:56,640 --> 02:29:02,960
um see if you resonate with them see if you can apply them on your own and if you want to know

1300
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:09,440
more or you're struggling to apply it in your life then that might be where you could reach out for

1301
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:17,760
for help and find a dbt therapist now speaking of that step shireen how does a person know when

1302
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:25,120
they find the dbt therapist how can they verify that they're you know well trained i mean you're

1303
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:30,640
probably an exception in that you trained directly with marcia um there are obviously a number of

1304
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:35,840
people who train directly with her but you know that's not scalable so at some point you're going

1305
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:41,840
to meet a potentially wonderful therapist who doesn't have that that lineage so how how is um

1306
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:49,680
how is the field of dbt self-regulated or self-policed so it's been a long-standing process

1307
02:29:50,240 --> 02:30:01,280
to try to figure this out um and you know mental health is really screwing in this way because

1308
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:07,360
there are so many ways in which a person can provide can become a therapist hang a shingle as

1309
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:16,240
either window and practice therapy and um and that person can call themselves a dbt therapist

1310
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:22,480
or a cbt therapist or any kind of therapist and and may not have the credentials or training to

1311
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:28,800
back that up so i would i always tell people to kind of proceed with caution and to do your

1312
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:36,640
research when you're looking into finding a mental health provider um so we marcia was against this

1313
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:46,880
for a long time she was against this idea of um certifying dbt therapists she she didn't want

1314
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:55,440
to have a regulatory role she wanted people to learn dbt and to just sort of get dbt out there

1315
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:01,200
but then she was hearing more and more stories as we all have now of people saying that they

1316
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:09,280
received dbt and it didn't work and then you ask them what happened in their treatment and you hear

1317
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:15,600
details about their treatment that were clearly not dbt and so there's and and you know the worst

1318
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:23,440
case scenario is somebody dies by suicide or you know has a terrible outcome thinking that they're

1319
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:32,480
getting dbt when they're not so a few years ago she started the linnahan board of certification

1320
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:40,480
lbc which has started a certification process for dbt therapists so what i will say is that

1321
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:50,240
what's the logic here that i'm finding the hard time describing it but so all people that are

1322
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:56,880
certified by lbc to be dbt clinicians are likely good clinicians good dbt clinicians because

1323
02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:03,280
they've met all of these standards but not all people who are not certified are bad dbt therapists

1324
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,520
right because there's a number of dbt therapists who have just elected not to go through the

1325
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:14,880
process of certification so if you're first starting to to think seriously about dbt you

1326
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:21,360
might start by looking up certified dbt therapists but recognizing that that's not the only criteria

1327
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:29,920
to use are there any other questions that a person can ask to determine if the pedigree of the person

1328
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:34,960
who's going to be conducting their therapy is truly in line with the principles of dbt as opposed to

1329
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:43,840
you know something that's been bastardized and and sort of misused so i'll share another

1330
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:51,120
marcia anecdote in response to that question because relatively early on sort of after the

1331
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:58,480
initial trials of dbt were put out showing that dbt was effective insurance companies started

1332
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:07,760
getting interested and wanted to pay for dbt but didn't want to pay for non-dbt and so they would

1333
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:13,360
call marcia up and they would say this person says they're doing dbt how do we know if they're really

1334
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:19,360
doing dbt so that we can reimburse for the service and she thought about it and ultimately

1335
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:25,920
said ask them if they're ask the dbt provider if they're on a consultation team now i think

1336
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:33,200
that this is oversimplified by far but i'll explain that one of the aspects of dbt or one

1337
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:39,440
of the components of the full package of dbt in addition to individual therapy and skills training

1338
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:46,720
is that the dbt therapist him or herself attends a weekly consultation team meeting

1339
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:54,800
with other dbt therapists and the consultation team meeting is a place where dbt therapists talk

1340
02:33:54,800 --> 02:34:02,160
about their experiences delivering dbt with an aim towards improving their own adherence to the

1341
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:11,360
model and their motivation it's often called therapy for the therapist and and i think marcia's

1342
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:19,360
response to that question was important because in many places somebody might say i want to learn

1343
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:25,360
dbt and i can a provider might say oh i've learned the dbt skills and i can teach my clients dbt

1344
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:31,760
skills and i'll just you know pick and choose what i want to do out of dbt and the first thing

1345
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:38,080
they elect to drop is the consultation team meeting because it's time right it's time and effort and

1346
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:44,960
it's and it's centered on you improving yourself as a therapist so i think it's i think it holds

1347
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:50,720
up though as a reasonable question to know to what extent is the person that you're that you're

1348
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:57,520
looking into adhering to dbt principles is to ask whether they're part of a dbt consultation team

1349
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,840
that's a that's a great litmus test actually i really like that i don't know how many people

1350
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:05,680
yeah i mean i don't it'd be interesting i mean it's funny because i hear andy talk about his

1351
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:12,400
not surprisingly but i never really thought of it as a great litmus test as well so yeah shireen

1352
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:16,560
this was fantastic and i know we're going to get to meet in person in about six weeks so i'm really

1353
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:22,400
looking forward to that but thank you so much for your for your time uh today and i think you know

1354
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:28,080
this is a hard topic because it's so big and it's so big to get your arms around it all and i i want

1355
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:32,720
people to come away from this not at all thinking that they know what dbt is necessarily from this

1356
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:37,680
but i hope we've piqued someone's curiosity such that they go out they they watch some videos they

1357
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:42,640
maybe pick up a book or a skills book and decide hey is there something in here for me and and

1358
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:46,960
maybe for some it means going as far as you know someone like me has gone and and saying i'm going

1359
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:53,200
to make this a regular part of my training yeah great it was really fun talking to you so thank you

1360
02:35:53,200 --> 02:36:04,000
thanks shireen
