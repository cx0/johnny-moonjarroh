00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,040
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,480
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,640
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,680
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,320
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,960
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,920
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,520
you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,840
for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,760
to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,480
full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon. These

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,920
are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,080
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,600
episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,760
these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,680
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,800
I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,520
companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,320
have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,240
is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,080
content exclusive for members. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,720
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,320
by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Kyle Kingsbury. Some of you

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,320
may recognize Kyle. He's a retired UFC fighter. He's been on the Joe Rogan Experience a number

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,920
of times. He's currently the director of human optimization at Onnit. I first met Kyle in person

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,800
during a hunting trip in early 2019, though we had both known about each other prior to that and

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,640
seen each other in interviews and things like that. We immediately clicked and become very close

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,560
since that time. Now, in this episode, which truthfully, when you're interviewing people that

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,000
you know pretty well, you don't really know where you're going to go. Honestly, this episode and this

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,280
interview went in places I did not expect it to go in and for which I'm incredibly grateful. We

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,280
could have spent a lot of this time talking about UFC and mixed martial arts and all of those things,

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,000
and that would have been interesting, but we went to places that Kyle has never talked about

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,640
publicly. In fact, a couple of things that he hadn't even shared with me privately before. I

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,280
was incredibly moved by this experience. We talk about his upbringing, playing football, going to

57
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,800
JC, then college. We talk about his experience with performance enhancing drugs, something I

58
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,080
don't think he's ever really spoken about before. As a little sidebar, we talk about something called

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,480
the Wizenator, which is about the funniest thing I've ever heard of. Talk about his transition away

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,120
from football after realizing he wasn't going to make it to the NFL. It's during this piece that

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
Kyle really opens up about this period of depression in his life and his thoughts of suicide that have

62
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,120
been somewhat recurrent and had started as early as the age of seven. He talks about his close calls

63
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,240
with suicide, his eventual transition into MMA and UFC. We end our talk with a conversation around

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,960
his experience with ayahuasca towards the end of his UFC career and how that really became the

65
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,360
turning point in his own journey towards being more emotionally healthy and frankly, what's

66
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,040
enabled him to become a father and become the father that he wishes he could have had.

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,320
Now, before we get into this conversation, I feel it's really important to have a couple of

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
disclaimers. First, in this conversation, Kyle really opens up about his past depression and

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,880
his thoughts of suicide and how close he was to it on a number of occasions. It's a very heavy

70
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,640
conversation. If you're currently experiencing any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it is imperative

71
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,680
that you seek out medical help immediately. Second, Kyle and I have a very open and honest

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,160
conversation about psychedelics. The substances we speak about are illegal and by no means are we

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,280
advocating for anyone to use them or experiment with them. There are physical, physiological,

74
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,280
psychological and legal risks around the use of these plans. This conversation is purely

75
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,960
informational only. Kyle speaks about his personal experiences and how it has shaped his thinking.

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,720
So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with my friend Kyle Kingsbury.

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,240
Hi, brother. How are you?

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm doing great, brother.

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Happy Father's Day.

80
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
Happy Father's Day to you.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Thank you. I forgot it was Father's Day when I woke up and my wife left me this beautiful

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,680
little note on the counter. She had gone out running before I got up and it was like,

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,040
here's your coffee. It was like the sweetest thing. What did you do for Father's Day today?

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Because you're not with your boy.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,520
No, we head back tomorrow to the bay and we'll get like a Father's Day celebration there. My

86
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
dad's going to come up from Santa Cruz. So today is just living the dream. I mean,

87
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,080
I'm on your podcast. I'm staying at your house. We're going to shoot arrows after this with a

88
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,640
couple of great guys. So couldn't ask for much more.

89
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,920
So did you grow up in Santa Cruz or San Jose?

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,160
Right outside San Jose and Cupertino and Sunnyvale.

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Got it. And you played a ton of sports growing up, I imagine. Was football your big one?

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Yeah, I wasn't really good. I mean, I got into baseball late, 12. A lot of kids have been

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,600
playing for a long time. So I just played one year. Football I got into at 10. And I just loved it

94
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,000
immediately. Like I was playing. At that point, you had weight classes and age classes. So for my

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,800
weight and age, it was I think, I don't know, right around 105 to 110 pounds when I was 10.

96
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,560
So I was getting like a beanpole. I mean, then-

97
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,840
That strikes me as big for a 10 year old, but maybe I'm just comparing it to my daughter.

98
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't know. At 12-

99
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,760
Which is not a good comparison.

100
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,440
Maybe it was less, but at 12, we were on the Sunnyvale micro rockets. That was 118. Because

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,000
I remember that was the last year I could play. We had a running back that weighed the same weight.

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,120
We both had to cut weight. And he was a great deal shorter than me. So he was just stacked.

103
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,560
I didn't fill out till much later, like sophomore year of high school.

104
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,440
That's interesting. Kids at 12 cutting weight.

105
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Yeah, I'm not sure that's great. We'd get the seeds or something like that that are salted

106
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,520
and just suck and spit for hours on the drive out to games, that kind of stuff.

107
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,600
So in high school, you played football.

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
Football and wrestling and junior high in high school.

109
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,200
Got it. So how'd you decide where you wanted to go for college?

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I had for a long time wanted to play in the Pac-10. It used to be the Pac-10.

111
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,240
I think every kid wants to get out of state when they go, a lot of them want to get out of state

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,360
when they go to university, as you call it. And you don't want to go too far, obviously.

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,680
Your parents will throw a fit. My parents would have. But a lot of my good friends that I grew up

114
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,840
with, I knew since I was 12 years old, they were like, dude, we're going to ASU. It's amazing.

115
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,920
And I had to go to junior college because I was garbage, garbage academically. I didn't resonate

116
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,240
a lot with the teachers I had. And you know, we talked about this on my podcast yesterday.

117
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,560
Literally, I can count on one hand, everyone that stuck out and took me under their wing and

118
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,280
saw something in me more than I saw myself. So going to junior college, I went for one year.

119
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,840
And then I realized I can, if I transfer to a different junior college that's right by ASU,

120
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,640
my likelihood of getting in is much higher. So that's what I did.

121
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,920
So why do you think that is, by the way, that high school didn't resonate?

122
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,840
We had a pretty high academic school for a public school. The Wall Street Journal published us as

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,280
one of the top 10 public schools in the world. And we had a lot of people from China and Asia

124
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,560
and India coming over. It's even higher now. It's about, I want to say 70 to 80 percent

125
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,480
Asian, including Indian. And the population is what roughly of the high school?

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,760
It was huge. I mean, I think we had 2,500 people in our graduating class senior year.

127
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,760
25, so what, you mean there were 10,000 kids in the entire high school?

128
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,040
I don't think so. Maybe that's the wrong number. 2,500 total probably.

129
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay. Yeah, couldn't have been 10,000.

130
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
Regardless, that's still unbelievable.

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,720
They couldn't build whatever the portables. They couldn't get enough portables one year. So we had

132
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,400
breached the number that was allowed in the school district and the superintendent gave it an okay.

133
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,240
Because his son went to school with us.

134
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,040
In a high school that big, you don't actually know everybody in your class?

135
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,440
No, there's many, many kids that I didn't know from that. But we kind of, I mean,

136
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,480
like any high school, you stick to your core group, that kind of thing. And I was fortunate

137
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,360
enough to have those guys all the way through college and after. I'm still close with a lot of them.

138
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,320
I mean, obviously knowing you today, you're intellectually curious and thoughtful and stuff,

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,360
but I always find it interesting when you see people who have kind of gone through a transformation

140
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,120
of not resonating with any of that stuff until doing so. But I often wonder, like,

141
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,160
was there a precipitating event? Was there a bad experience you had with a teacher or

142
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,680
something like that? You know, I wasn't nice in high school or prior to that. I got in trouble

143
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,880
from kindergarten on, I'd get into the principal's office, at least three days a week, gotten a lot

144
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,000
of fights growing up. I mean, more than the fighting, just mess with the teachers, you know,

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,920
as a class clown and pretty disruptive. And I enjoyed that. It gave me some sense of control

146
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,480
in my environment. I always enjoyed entertaining people and making people laugh. So, like,

147
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,000
that checks off every box. If I can start riffing and clowning on people and everyone's laughing

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,640
and looking at me, then I can get a little attention and maybe be, you know, a little bit

149
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,240
of a jerk to the teacher, but it was worth it to me. So, it was actually at ASU, I was taking some

150
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,880
psychology courses in sociology and communication where I was like, oh, this shit matters. Like,

151
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,520
I will, it doesn't matter if I get a philosophy degree or a communications degree. Like,

152
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,080
this is, these are things that I will use the rest of my life. And that was the first time where it

153
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,680
really felt that way. You know, a lot of kids complain like, what am I gonna use algebra for?

154
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,320
What am I gonna use this for? You know, and I think that having that in college really made

155
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,320
me think like, oh, there's a lot to learn. And it's, there's really cool stuff to learn that

156
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,360
resonates with me. And in all those classes, I did really well. It was all A's and B's as well for me.

157
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,840
So, it's interesting because if it weren't for football, I mean, you jumped through a lot of

158
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,760
hoops to get to ASU, you're going to JC's before you get there, right?

159
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,440
And a walk on at ASU.

160
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,760
Okay, so it begs the question, right? If you weren't athletic, if you were the exact same

161
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,760
guy, but you didn't happen to have an ability to play, you know, division one football,

162
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,080
what would you have done after high school?

163
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,840
Something blue collar for sure. My dad, he had a Silicon Valley shelving was a company he created

164
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,360
in the Bay right as the tech boom started. And all these tech companies needed static

165
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,280
control shelving. So he was making a lot of money and he would pay me and my sister to

166
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,760
build a lot of this stuff. And it was fun for me. It was like giant Erector sets, you know,

167
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,320
like we'd we'd play with life size Lego. Yeah, huge stuff. And even you know,

168
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,040
like we'd get into a warehouse. And he and I would be drilling into concrete and pounding,

169
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,320
you know, giant hammers down to get this stuff anchored. And that was always cool. And it paid

170
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,440
really well, but I enjoyed it. So I liked working with my hands there. And he came from a different

171
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,440
era, you know, as every dad is, but he always worked on cars, and he knew a lot about things.

172
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,200
And then he would kind of shun me from living the same life as him. He was like, No, you're going

173
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,560
to go into sales, you're going to make a ton of money, you'll just pay a guy to work on your car,

174
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,560
you just pay a guy to fix your house, because he did all that he did construction since he was 20.

175
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,120
And I was just laughed at it was like, these are like really usable skills. It's nice to know how

176
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,120
to change the oil in your car. You know, like, why aren't you teaching me this stuff? So

177
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,760
thankfully, now he's kind of that have had a little bit of success. He's, he's happy to show

178
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,200
me those things. Why do you think he felt that way? Where did you grow up? Do you grow up in

179
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,760
the same area? He grew up in all my families from Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest, and then they

180
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,040
moved to California, my parents met in Alaska, and then moved to California, I think in large part,

181
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,640
to be by the sun and to get away from their families. And so you know, I grew up there. And

182
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,600
I just think all parents want better for their kids. You know, in that regard, and he saw

183
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,720
that as better, you know, financial success, stability, those kind of things as better.

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,040
And were they upset then in high school when you weren't doing well, academically?

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,640
Kind of, I mean, they paid attention, and I get in trouble a lot at home. I think for them,

186
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,520
it was really hard to kind of wrap their brain around how you can wrangle someone in at that

187
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,720
point. Because, you know, they fought a lot growing up. I talked about this before. But

188
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,880
one of the books that I really have a lot of love for is Nonviolent Communication

189
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,440
by Marshall Rosenberg, who recently passed away. And whatever that is, my childhood was not. So

190
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,200
they really didn't know how to communicate with one another. And it was like two rams butting heads

191
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,400
all the time. And then they got divorced when I was 13. And from there, that was like the deepest

192
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,080
sense of peace I'd ever had because it was less stress on both of them. They didn't know how to

193
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,320
communicate with each other. And did you and your sister spend time with both of them? Or you

194
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,720
pretty much my mom got full custody, but we'd see my dad every week, you know, twice a week,

195
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,160
something like that. And he was still a big part of our lives. And he lived right down the street.

196
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,000
So and I wanted to see him more because he was a gentler, kinder dad at that point.

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,800
Was one of your parents more strict than the other when it came to trying to keep you in

198
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,800
line at school? I'd say I went back and forth, you know, and who took the cake there? You know,

199
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,200
they had different ways of discipline. But yeah, it was, I don't know, I think they were at a loss,

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,760
really. But they still they never said, you're not going to go to college like the entire time.

201
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,760
It was you're still going to college. I don't give a shit if you have to go to junior college

202
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,880
for three years, you're going to go to college. So they were pretty pumped when I got an ASU,

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,160
which is funny. There was a Simpsons episode where there's the great flood and Ned Flanders

204
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,960
is like, Thank you, Lord, you've spared the righteous and damned the wicked.

205
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,640
And he sees Homer floating in a raft. And he's like, Looks like heaven's easier to get into

206
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,640
than Arizona State. We played that clip all through college. It was it was great. It was

207
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,880
a feather in our cap. But yeah, it is it is an easy school to get into. Yeah, but I mean,

208
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,600
it's a school that also has a great reputation as well. You get in there and and what ASU has got

209
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,680
to be huge. It was massive. It was still I mean, still to this day. And even at that point,

210
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,440
when I was there, one of the high most highly populated schools in the country,

211
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,200
huge campus, gorgeous campus, hot year around for the most part. And you know, the draw for a

212
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,320
young male is that a lot of the ladies there, they can't wear much, they can't hide it, you know,

213
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,800
because of the heat. And that was that was definitely there were some good times there for

214
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,960
sure. So you walked on. And what position do you play? I was defensive end and defensive tackle.

215
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,000
It was probably not probably I was for sure undersized to play the tackle, but too slow to

216
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,640
play the end. So it's kind of an in betweener. And thankfully, you were talking about these great

217
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,080
teachers that you've had one of them was my strength and conditioning coach actually both

218
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,560
strength and conditioning coaches ahead of Arizona State went on to become strength and conditioning

219
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,280
coaches in the NFL. And the head of the strength and conditioning department is going to Joe Ken

220
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:03,880
big house power is a kind of his moniker now was then to a big house. He's the only guy in

221
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,680
division one football history and the NFL to win strength coach of the year in both division one

222
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,080
football and the NFL. And he's the coach, he's the strength coach for the Carolina Panthers.

223
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,120
Mark ooyama, he was he went on to become the head strength coach for the 49ers. He's I think

224
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,280
he's now with the Vikings. And both those guys really pushed me past whatever limit I thought

225
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,080
I had, you know, like if there's a ceiling, they would push me so far past that I just began to

226
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,240
realize like there is no ceiling and you were how old when you showed up, you're two years older

227
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,680
than the other. Yeah, it was 20. Yeah, it was definitely an impressionable time. And I was

228
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,720
still working through a lot, not really knowing how, you know, drinking a lot doing the party

229
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,160
thing. We were number one party school in the nation. If that's any claim to fame.

230
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,200
One of my friends at med school went to ASU and the stories he told were, I mean, I couldn't,

231
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,160
I couldn't fathom what he was talking about. I mean, I was sort of like he was speaking in

232
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,760
other language. What did you guys actually do was my well, I mean, I can give one example. They

233
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,720
filmed a porno at one of the fraternities that my friends all went to a theater Kai and they

234
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,640
actually shut down all fraternities. Like they don't exist there anymore because of that. So

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,760
there was no extreme you couldn't think of that that didn't happen there. I mean, it was really,

236
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,360
it was wild and fun. And I've lost some friends to drug overdoses and many, you know, it was

237
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,120
polarized for sure. You know, and there were still people that went there that were, you know, on the

238
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,400
grind and they had all their ducks in a row. But I think there was a lot more people just

239
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,840
exploring what it felt like to be an adult for the first time. Did you sort of think about this at

240
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,000
the time? Like, I'm escaping from something I'm running from something or did you feel like you

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,800
were running to something? I didn't feel you know, it's funny because in those moments of play and

242
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,680
pushing the envelope, it just felt like we're going to tear it up tonight. You know, and it was more

243
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,280
of a celebration like I never was an angry drunk. I never never saw myself as leaning heavily on a

244
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,840
crutch. I mean, for a whole year in junior college, I would wake up and smoke pot every day, I'd have

245
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,720
to wake up my roommate to light the four foot bong for me because I couldn't reach it with my hand.

246
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,640
And that's how I'd start the day. And I had all my classes on Tuesday, Thursday schedule. So five

247
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,480
days off a week. And even in that whole year, I never thought like I'm overdoing it. It was just

248
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,320
the thing to do. And now obviously, that's, it's all much different. But we'll get into plant

249
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,400
medicines. But I think that was really where it lifted the veil and showed me how much I was

250
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,000
destroying myself without realizing it. When you decide I want to go to ASU to play football,

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,360
was that a means to an end? Where did you think that was? Was there some thought you had in back

252
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,520
of your mind, I might make it to the NFL. Yeah, I always wanted to play in the NFL. That was the

253
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,840
light at the end of the tunnel. And I think there was a lot of things driving me for that one, my

254
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,200
love of the game, like it was it was my greatest joy. It was my first legal outlet to let off the

255
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,240
steam. And because of the positions I played, I really got to you know, it was buttonheads,

256
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,160
every single play of every moment I was on the field. Once I got to ASU, I didn't play much,

257
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,120
I really was a bench warmer. And at ASU, I had to embrace my role as a secondary guy for the first

258
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,600
time in my life. Everyone who makes it to college was an all star in high school, you know, and the

259
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,240
jump is even higher to the NFL. And I remember seeing a guy who graduated a year before me who

260
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,520
had played, he started every game all four years on defensive line, which if you're a wide receiver,

261
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,040
that's fine. But defensive line, that's pretty tough to do that, to start every game your entire

262
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,120
and he didn't make it to the NFL. And that was like, oh, shit, all right, maybe I should think

263
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,840
about something else. Because even if I get playing time, my senior year, it's pretty unlikely that

264
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,320
that's going to happen. And there was a lot of guys going into Arena League and Canada football

265
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,480
and things like that. And it was like, I don't know, there was a piece of me that that wanted

266
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,280
to be the best or at least play with the best. And if I wasn't going to do that, there was no point.

267
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,600
And I think that there was a decision because I could have gotten a scholarship to play at like

268
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,760
a D two school or D one double A and I said, No, I'd rather walk on and play with the big boys.

269
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,560
So kind of having that mindset going in, I knew I wasn't going to play some subpar level of football,

270
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
even though I probably could have extended my career there.

271
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,240
It's amazing. I think for a lot of people that maybe aren't as familiar with that,

272
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,880
what those jumps look like between high school division one and the NFL, I think I was having

273
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,240
this with my daughter a while ago. It must have been during the college football season. And I

274
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,880
don't remember how it came up. But the point I wanted to make to her was, if you take the very,

275
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,600
very, very best team in college football, the team that's going to win the national championship,

276
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,760
and you put them against the very, very worst team in the NFL, it would be the biggest blowout

277
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,720
in the history of football. I mean, in as many possessions as you could have, that's how many

278
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,600
times the NFL team would score. And she just like couldn't understand like how that could happen.

279
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,760
And I didn't have a great explanation for I said, I think one, it's just a much tighter

280
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,240
selection process. And at the end of the day, once you reach the NFL, you're a professional.

281
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,320
And nothing else matters like this is your job. But it is interesting. And it must be sobering

282
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,840
to to get there and sort of realize, oh my god, like, even if you're exceptional in college,

283
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,880
it doesn't guarantee you get to this next level. Yeah, it doesn't guarantee that you're practice

284
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,840
squad. And that's where I was like, damn, and I had a lot of guys from our team did go pro.

285
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,880
Some of them played for a few years on practice squad, other guys actually had like decent careers

286
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,040
playing starting in the NFL, a couple started for the dolphins, different teams. And it was cool to

287
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,200
watch that. But it was like, it didn't seem like there was rhyme or reason to me, because a lot

288
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,440
of these guys in college, you know, they were good, and they made progressions, but they just

289
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,680
kept getting better. That was the difference. Like they were late bloomers, whatever you want to call

290
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,720
it, but they kept improving, kept getting faster, kept learning the routes better, or whatever the

291
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,880
position was. And I think a big part of it is they also are the guys that don't get injured as much.

292
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,720
I think injury avoidance is such an under appreciated piece of professional sports.

293
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,160
I don't know the exact numbers, but you know, the median duration of an NFL player is staggeringly

294
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,200
short, it's like three to five years. And so we can sort of celebrate these people that spend 10,

295
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,240
15 years in the NFL, but they're such outliers. You know, the name of the game first and foremost,

296
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,800
once you're there is just figure out a way to not get hurt. And you talk to Joe Kanner, anybody that's

297
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,040
a strength coach, that's all they're focused on. And it's really even in the offseason,

298
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,880
they might have periods of time where they're working on guys getting a little faster, or

299
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,560
guys getting a little stronger, a little more weight, that kind of thing. But come season,

300
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,040
it's just preservation. That's it. Had you done any performance enhancing drugs in high school?

301
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,480
No, I mean, I played, actually, my senior year started with testosterone, I had a guy

302
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,120
with sustenance 250. And I realized I wanted to play college football. So that was the

303
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,320
that was the place like, all right, I got to put on some size, I've weighed about 220.

304
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,520
Prior to or after?

305
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Prior to and then 230.

306
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,440
And you're what?

307
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,160
Six, four?

308
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Six, yes, extreme half. So that was the time where I think for me, it was about,

309
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,560
if I'm going to do this, let's do this. And being thin, you know, it was like, all right,

310
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,320
I got to put on some size unless I'm going to change positions entirely. But I enjoyed the

311
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,720
positions I played. So let's let's pack on the pounds. And I was pretty disappointed only

312
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,760
gaining 10 pounds. But there was, that was a catalyst to what sleep was, you know, and I had

313
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,680
my dad telling me like, you got to sleep better, you got to get to bed on time, you can't stay out

314
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,760
all night, those kind of things. And, and you got to eat well, you got to eat more. And at that

315
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,720
point, it was just a numbers game, you know, it didn't mean eating the food that I eat now is just

316
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,920
me eating more, you know, getting more protein and more calories in general. So I think once I

317
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,680
started to pay attention to that stuff, that's where I was starting to gain the size.

318
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,000
And then throughout junior college was testosterone still kind of the staple of supplementation?

319
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,360
Yeah, no doubt. And I gained fairly consistently still kind of undersized. So I think by the end of

320
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,240
my junior college, I was about 250, you know, and put that in perspective. I mean, that's big for a

321
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,000
lot of people, but there's linebackers that are 250 pounds, plenty of middle linebackers that are

322
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,960
that size. So for the position still small. Yeah. And then what's it like when you get to a place

323
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,280
like ASU? Not and again, I'm not singling out ASU. I think this is probably true. It has to be true

324
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,600
of every Division One school, right? Yeah. And I don't want to come across as Floyd Landis. So I'm

325
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,080
not going to paint a picture of what other people are doing. No, no, yeah. Just for yourself. Like

326
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,880
what? What was that step up? It was good because I you know, I was introduced to a doctor, a natural

327
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,240
path and he'd for better and for worse. And we'll talk about what that worse looks like. He would

328
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,240
give me anything that I wanted. Thankfully, we were doing routine blood work to look at something

329
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,080
my father who I included on this. We're pretty adamant about. So that's when I first experimented

330
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,960
with growth hormone, IGF one, different things. I think when I when I realized I wasn't going to go

331
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,160
pro, that was when I started taking a decoderbal and with testosterone. And that was great for

332
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,040
inflammation and just feeling better. At that point, it really was like how big can I get? And

333
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,360
I still had a ceiling. You know, my senior year I was 268. I couldn't gain a pound more. And I

334
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,720
was having just and just give me a sense of dose. How much you were you were mixing decadrone and

335
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,840
decipinate 50 50 or like one to one ratio of those? No, it was probably 600 milligrams of

336
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,680
test to P and eight and 400 milligrams of decoderbal and you would take a week. It's about a gram total.

337
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,760
Yeah, which is just amazing. I want to kind of put this in perspective for listeners.

338
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,320
I have a subset of patients who are getting testosterone replacement therapy for, you know,

339
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,640
hypogonadism, right? So middle aged guy who's you can't get his testosterone back into a normal

340
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,800
range with all the usual stuff beginning by the way with sleep is sort of rule number one. You

341
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,120
don't run a place testosterone until a person's sleeping reasonably well. But to put this in

342
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:43,320
perspective, I would say a normal starting dose of testosterone sip. You know, eight is somewhere in

343
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,080
the vicinity of 80 to 100 milligrams a week. And we like to divide that twice a week because the

344
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,520
half life of sip. You know, it's about three days. So you'll get a smoother dose. A couple of patients

345
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,120
will even do it daily. You know, they'll put in sort of with sip in a sip in a sub cue injection

346
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,560
and they'll do 10 to 13, 10 to 14 milligrams a day would be sort of a daily dose. And then that's,

347
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,880
you know, and you know, it's really interesting, by the way, with that you see no FSHLH suppression.

348
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,360
The natural range is about 11 milligrams a day, give or take for men. So that's like where you're,

349
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,360
you're kind of mimicking that. Yeah, that's the part that blows my mind is we just discovered

350
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,720
this by accident when a patient just on his own decided to start day, like he felt started out

351
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,520
doing it injecting once a week and then twice a week and you're cutting the dose down, of course,

352
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,480
each time and then he decided, well, daily must give you the most perfectly smooth way to do it.

353
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,760
And I said, well, yeah, if you don't mind giving yourself a little shot every day, but it's

354
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,120
actually a pretty, the sub cue with the tiny needle is not a big deal. So when we looked at his blood,

355
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,160
it was really amazing. He was like, it's the only pace I'd ever seen a testosterone sip. You know,

356
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,760
he had normal FSHLH he'd looked like he was not taking exogenous testosterone. And then we tried

357
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,840
this with a couple of other patients. And sure enough, that's the case. I think the highest amount

358
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,240
of testosterone I've ever prescribed to a patient is probably in the neighborhood of 140 to 160

359
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,760
milligrams in a week. And if you're talking, did you say 600 of sip, you need 400 a decade or vice

360
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,000
versa, but they're one to one equivalent. So it's a thousand a week, right? Which is, I've seen that

361
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
a lot in athletes and bodybuilders and stuff like that. What kind of side effects do you have from

362
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,760
a dose that high? Well, that's where I capped it, you know, and there's bodybuilders that'll go in

363
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,240
the three to five gram a week range. And from what I know, loosely, they likely have more receptor

364
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,040
sites and they're going to deal with the side effects, no matter what's coming up for them.

365
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,280
I'd get acne and season, but I think it was from the shoulder pads. I never washed those kind of

366
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,920
things. So yeah, I'd get acne and stuff like that on the back. I don't know how much that affected

367
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,720
my mind because it felt good. And with the amount of training that I was doing, it was a positive.

368
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,400
Did you understand what testosterone at the time? I know today you have a much better

369
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,920
understanding, of course, but at the time, did you understand what this molecule is doing to

370
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,640
transcription factors in your, you know, cells and how it's helping you recover better? Like,

371
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,800
or was it were you not? I mean, that's maybe a dumb question. What, what kid in college is

372
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,440
thinking of that? But did you just think like, taking this makes me bigger and stronger? Did

373
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,760
you have a sense of why? Well, I understood an increased protein synthesis, things like that.

374
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,160
I think there was a book called Anabolix 2000 by Dr. William Llewellyn, which is where I started to

375
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,400
take a deep dive in it. You know, that's the funny, so Llewellyn's Principles of Pharmacology is one of

376
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,520
my favorite books on the entire study of Anabolix. I have like, it's like, you know, the volume.

377
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah, it's like a Bible. It's a Bible. And it's, it's long and wide. It's not just thick. Like,

378
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,920
it's, it's a really, it's a great place if anybody's looking to do this. No, I can't recommend it

379
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,240
highly enough because one of the things I love about Llewellyn is totally unemotional. There's

380
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,200
no editorializing, right? It's not like these things are horrible. These things are wonderful.

381
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:53,720
It's like, okay, let's go through every single one of these molecules painfully deep. And we'll just

382
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,560
talk about the relative differences, similarities between them, what they do, what they don't do.

383
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,640
And yeah, I'm a big, I'd love to meet Llewellyn. I don't know if he, he must be still alive. He's

384
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,120
certainly got to be young. He's got to be, he was doing, I think the last one I read was,

385
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,560
I think he had 2007 was the last one that I read.

386
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,640
I have a more recent one than that. And I've seen pictures of him and he looks like he's young.

387
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,040
Funny of mine had like 2011. So like he's for sure still around if he's writing books.

388
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,760
He's not on his deathbed, you know, how hard it is to write a book.

389
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,440
So you're reading Llewellyn, which is actually kind of interesting. I'm guessing not everybody

390
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,080
who's taken testosterone is reading Llewellyn's principles of pharmacology to understand what's

391
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,400
going on. One thing I just curious about, you mentioned you were never the nasty drunk, right?

392
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,240
You were, so one of the things that people talk about is, well, if you take that much

393
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,480
anabolic steroid, you, it must change your mood. Did you experience that?

394
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,920
I didn't feel, and that's what I was alluding to with that positive well-being.

395
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,000
I couldn't wrap my head around roidridge for the life of me. And then to that note,

396
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,840
I began to see like whether the guy was on like five friends that had that particular outcome

397
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,920
from anabolic. They were that way without it. They hadn't unpacked their shit to begin with.

398
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,840
And that's why whatever amplifiers in them is going to draw that out. Same thing goes with

399
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,360
alcohol or anything else. You know, you, you give somebody a little fuel to the fire. And

400
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,920
I think it was Wayne Dyer who said, if you squeeze an orange, what do you get? Orange shoes. If

401
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,600
somebody squeezes you, what do you get? Well, it's whatever's going to come out of you. Right.

402
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,800
And that's, that's the difference. Not that I was all rainbows and fucking clouds in the inside.

403
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,160
I still had a lot of work to do, which wouldn't come for years later.

404
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,080
That's interesting to see at that dose. Cause I mean, I don't have experience clinically with

405
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,160
those doses. I've, I've seen it anecdotally like in cases like yours, but I've, I've never had the

406
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,520
ability to clinically observe what happens at what we call suprafysiologic doses, but at

407
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,320
physiologic doses, which I have lots of experience with patients, I've never once seen any of these

408
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,040
horror show side effects that people talk about. And I've come to the same conclusion,

409
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,560
which is steroids are a lot like money. You know, people talk about, well, that guy's a rich asshole.

410
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,280
And it's like, I don't think those are necessarily the same thing. He's an asshole who then got a

411
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,960
lot of money and that just allowed him to amplify his assholedness. And similarly, like, I think if

412
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,360
you take a really aggressive, angry person and you give them more anabolic steroids, you can probably

413
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,800
amplify that phenotype, but you don't create that phenotype. That's why I've seen some of the

414
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,480
most beautiful people in the world I've seen are some of the wealthiest people as well.

415
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,920
Cause they were just happened to be good people. You give them a bunch of money. Now they can

416
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,560
amplify their good through that. So yeah, I think, I think of those the same. And it, but, but what's

417
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,040
interesting is that at such high doses, my observation, at least anecdotally in you is still

418
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,440
the same, which is didn't, didn't it actually seem to be quite positive. This is a topic I'm super

419
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,960
interested in because I think that the science on this whole topic is so misunderstood. I think

420
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,240
that the fear mongering around these drugs, and by the way, to be really clear, I have no idea if

421
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,280
the doses you were taking are safe. My intuition is it's probably not a good idea to be clear.

422
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,600
So anybody listening to this who thinks that me having this discussion is somehow endorsing

423
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,840
taking a thousand milligrams a week of testosterone and testosterone equivalent is a good idea.

424
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,960
I don't think it is, but that's mainly because I don't have data. I don't have long-term data.

425
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,040
I've seen short-term data, right? I've seen studies of eight, 12, 16 weeks where you put

426
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,760
athletes on those kinds of doses, which is effectively 10 times the normal amount of

427
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,000
testosterone. These studies don't find bad outcomes. Of course, you were probably taking

428
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,680
it for longer than 16 weeks. And that's my whole point, which is, I don't know how to extrapolate

429
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,320
outside of the normal window. But when you start to talk about normal physiologic doses and all the

430
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,360
fear-mongering that comes with that stuff, I don't know what it is about our society. We really

431
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,600
love to misunderstand things. There was a very famous story that was talked about in that

432
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,120
documentary that Mark Bell, or sort of that Chris Bell made. You know the story about that kid?

433
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,000
Bigger, stronger, faster.

434
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah. I forget the boy's name.

435
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,800
He got really depressed when he jumped off because he didn't have post-cycle therapy.

436
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:13,160
Yeah. I would even put a different spin on that, which is, and again, this is, I don't mean to

437
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,880
sound unempathetic at all because I know that in the documentary they feature very prominently his

438
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,240
father, who's adamant that steroids killed his son. And if I were in his shoes, I think I'd probably

439
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,080
say the same thing. But this gets to the point of, I would argue that people who are going to take

440
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,560
steroids for non-medical use are probably searching for something anyway. There's a void that's

441
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,560
probably trying to be filled there. And in the case of this boy who, I forget his name because of the

442
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,160
T. I think it was like Tyler or Taylor or something like that. You know, high school kid,

443
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,120
I think he was a baseball player if I recall. You take 10 kids who play high school baseball,

444
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,960
there's a subset of them that are going to gravitate towards wanting this. Maybe it's

445
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,160
because they want to be better. Maybe they want to be better because they're sort of filling some

446
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,120
other void. It's probably that that at least increases their susceptibility to depression

447
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,520
and not that, not that the testosterone is causing the depression. That's sort of my view on that.

448
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,360
I think that's a bit too nuanced to explain, but it feeds into this discussion of which one's

449
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,680
driving the other. And that's why when you look at studies of this stuff where you get the luxury of

450
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,720
not having to rely on a person self-selecting into it and instead you can use the process of

451
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,320
randomization, I just think these findings just, they never show up in the medical literature of

452
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,520
testosterone use. Now you mentioned growth hormone as well. Why growth hormone? What did it offer

453
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,840
above testosterone? I think from a recovery standpoint, and I don't know how much of that

454
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,680
was placebo effect. And I was taking probably four IUs a day. Which is not that much actually

455
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,240
in the big picture, is it? No, but I could feel the side effects, like little tingly fingers in

456
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,720
the middle of the night, some level of carpal tunnel. And that's also for sure had to do with

457
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,320
the water weight I was carrying and just being a swole for lack of a better word. Did you ever take

458
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,880
growth hormone without testosterone? No. So we don't know what growth hormone alone would have

459
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,960
felt like. Yeah, but I do remember, I mean, playing defensive line, you get bumps and bruises

460
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,720
every day and I rolled my ankle really hard and the next day it was like nothing had ever happened.

461
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,080
And I was astonished. I thought I was going to wake up and have blue and purple around my foot

462
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,000
for a month. It was a bad, bad sprain. And literally the next day, like there was no swelling.

463
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,680
It felt great. I went right back to practice and I could do everything again. So I was like,

464
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,760
okay, this is worth a thousand dollars a month. Like it just made perfect sense to me at that

465
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,760
point. How did you come up with the money for all this? Was the growth hormone alone a thousand

466
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,280
dollars a month? It certainly was. So without, let's just say that part was sponsored.

467
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,400
We'll just leave it at that. And the testosterone, while nowhere near as expensive, at the doses

468
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,920
you're taken can't be, it's still got to be a couple hundred bucks a month, right? Yeah,

469
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,680
especially because it's through a doctor and obviously insurance isn't covering any of that.

470
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,600
Now, did you guys get drug tested in college? We did. And I don't know if you remember this,

471
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,920
but there was a thing, I think it was, I don't want to get the guy's name wrong. Maybe we can

472
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,880
look it up. Ryan, can you look up if it was Ontario Smith that got caught with the Wizenator?

473
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,680
So the Wizenator 5000. I forgot about the Wizenator. The old Wizenator.

474
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,520
It was so great. I remember going into the weed shop back then. Of course, they didn't have

475
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,600
cannabis there. They just had bogs and whatever. And I saw this thing and they had like seven

476
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,960
different colors of a penis. Like what the hell is this doing here? And they're like,

477
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,560
oh man, that's for your piss test. And I was like, are you serious? Okay. All right. We got

478
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:35,080
confirmation. It was Ontario Smith. He fucked it up for everyone. But you know, I've seen all the

479
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,880
different colors and I'm like, huh, so how does it work? You get somebody's clean urine. He's like,

480
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,240
no, you don't even have to do that. It comes with synthetic urine. And then there's a Japanese

481
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,800
heat pad that sticks to the outside. And then you have the other part of it pressed against

482
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,680
your pubic hair or whatever. And then when you're asked to pull it out, you just pull out that one.

483
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,920
And it's kind of like, do you remember the toy water weenie back in the eighties? It's got a

484
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,560
little click in. It's like surgical tubing you'd fill with water and then squirt people. So anyways,

485
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,760
you unclick this thing and just free flows and you can push on it a little bit to get it out. But

486
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,440
it's always at like one and a half X, whatever the a hundred milliliter standard is. Does the drug

487
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,760
test or not actually look at you voiding? I mean, I had a guy look at my penis and he saw the

488
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,320
wizinator, but I had my pants on. He didn't make me drop trowel, you know, whereas what does he do

489
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,600
when he sees a purple penis? Well, I have a funny story about that. So my penis,

490
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,600
my fake penis didn't look far off. This discussion is taken out of context, is out of control.

491
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,640
We'll have him clip this for social. My fake penis looked very similar to my actual penis in

492
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,800
terms of color. Loaning that out to one of my teammates, who was half black, didn't go so well

493
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,960
for him. Thankfully he said it as long as the test is clean when he got caught, I won't get you in

494
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,600
trouble. And of course he got off because he had clean piss. The issue, what we saw with the

495
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,120
wizinator in pro sports is that the synthetic urine contained no levels of hormone. So you'd

496
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:11,240
show zero on testosterone, zero sex hormones across the board. So then they know something was up.

497
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,120
That would qualify as a positive test. I was kind of rolling the dice with NCAA. I figured at that

498
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,720
point I wasn't going to get, you know, what are they going to do? Bust the guy who's fucking third

499
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,000
string, barely made travel squad. So yeah, I was rolling the dice there. They make you go to your

500
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,240
ankles with your pants or whatever you're wearing. The team guys, they just glanced down, see what

501
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,280
you got as long as it's a penis and you're not pulling something out of a cup, you're okay.

502
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,840
In other words, there was sort of the, was this the NCAA that was basically turning a blind eye

503
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,800
to this then? The team guys. And then the NCAA, they would have you pull your pants down, but they're,

504
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,240
you know, I don't, from what I understand, not super weird about it because

505
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,760
it wasn't invasive. Like I hear horror stories from, from the guys that are fighting now and

506
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,680
have you saw to knock on their door at 3 AM. Yeah. The wizinator is not going to work when

507
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,880
you saw that or Wada comes, right? No, not even close. Never would have. I'm amazed. I mean,

508
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I've never really thought about this problem specifically, but I'm amazed people haven't

509
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,800
come up with artificial bladders and things that are more nuanced. Well, I think it was,

510
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,200
what was that movie with the old football movie? I think it was in the nineties with Latimer.

511
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,240
Latimer, Jack to the gills. Yeah. He did the oil change where he would pull urine out of his

512
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,480
bladder and then have someone else's injected in with a TCC syringe. How can I be blanking on what

513
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,680
that was? It wasn't any given Sunday, was it? No. The program. Yeah. Yeah. James Con. Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,840
I don't know how often that was going down. I don't think people were going to that, those

515
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:40,280
kind of extremes in college, maybe at higher levels of sport, but is growth hormone detectable

516
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,760
on any other tests? It certainly wasn't even something they were testing for in college.

517
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,960
I know a couple of people who have had that come up for them in fighting now with you saw to,

518
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,880
to what degree that's accurate. I'm not sure. So, you know, a lot of these guys have lawyered up

519
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,080
and are fighting it whether or not they were successful or not. I have no idea.

520
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,840
So college comes to an end, you sort of realize you're not going to make it to the NFL.

521
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,520
What are you thinking about as the next chapter? I was just in the moment. You can model the

522
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Wizenator. That's always got to be on the table as an option, a work opportunity.

523
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,880
That's all right. That was my next venture. You know, I quit going after my senior year of

524
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,920
football and I was really starting to battle my own personal demons at that point, that same doctor.

525
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,160
So I talked about the better and worse of having a doctor that would give me anything. He was

526
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,760
prescribing me two milligrams Xanax, call them Zany bars because they had the four squares,

527
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,840
60 at a time, 10 milligram volume, 60 at a time with five refills on both, 10 milligram.

528
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,240
I didn't know that was even legal. Meaning I didn't know that.

529
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,840
It's not legal. He went to jail later.

530
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,240
Oh, okay.

531
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,920
He gone. One of my friends died. So that guy, I'm sure he's out now, but needless to say,

532
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,240
also 10 milligrams of Vicodin, 60 at a time, five refills. Now, thankfully for me personally,

533
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,640
and I've lost a lot of friends to opiates, it was very hard for me to take a high dose

534
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,160
and feel good. I would get nauseated and puke violently. So there was always like this.

535
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,280
You had a built-in governor.

536
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:12,040
Yeah, built-in governor when it came to opiates. But having had a lot of stuff that I hadn't worked

537
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,680
on internally, and we can dive into that, but it just, these anti-anxiety medications were

538
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,960
fucking perfect. I would feel great. There's a euphoria. I'd sleep very well if I was using

539
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,360
cocaine or ecstasy, and these are pressed shitty pills, not the type of MDMA we talk about with

540
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,560
Rick Doblin, just a whole different ballgame. I'd be up till 5am, then I'd take my Xanax,

541
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,920
something like that. And that's, you're playing that roller coaster.

542
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,760
So you're already done with football, but you're still like finishing college at this point?

543
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,120
And that's when I quit going to school. So I didn't see, I'd finished 95% of my communications

544
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,120
classes in sociology. And at that point, in order to stay eligible, I'd switch my degree so many

545
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,560
times, there was this bullshit degree called a Bachelor in Interdisciplinary Studies, which is

546
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,200
fine. It's like two minors to equal a major. And I enjoyed the coursework. But once I got to my

547
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,840
senior year, a lot of the classes became actual BIS classes where you would go in and have to

548
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,480
write these long ass papers that you'd present to a potential employer on why it was actually

549
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,920
better that you had a basket waving degree and not an actual degree. And I couldn't stand it.

550
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,240
Like it was just so fake to me. And really like not enjoying school at that point,

551
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,480
not having a reason to be there, not having a reason to stay eligible.

552
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,640
Are you taking loans out to be in school at this point?

553
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,080
Yeah, yes. Oh, yeah.

554
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,360
So you're paying to do this thing that you think is not helpful.

555
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,600
Correct. You know, I said I'd take a semester off, my parents didn't really fuss over it.

556
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,880
And really got into pills with alcohol and cocaine and ecstasy. And that was something that I've

557
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,800
been doing. But because of football keeping me there was a point in time where I knew I had to

558
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,320
straighten up each and every year. And really being a fan of the gym and who I was training with,

559
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,080
that also would kind of regulate me. So even in the off season, I was still kind of,

560
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,000
I was mindful of the debauchery. And then without that, it was mindless debauchery, really.

561
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,840
And I was very depressed. I didn't know what I wanted to do from that point on.

562
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,920
And probably came to one of the most depressing points in my life. And to give some background

563
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,560
from, and I talked about this on a solo podcast I did a long time ago, which for sure, I don't

564
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,680
think anyone here has heard it. But from about seven years old on, I had thoughts of suicide.

565
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,200
And like pretty vivid, like thinking of my dad's handguns or his rifles, or how I would use a bow

566
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,760
and arrow, put it plainly. I remember having a conversation with my dad on the deck of our condo.

567
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,880
And I asked him, what would happen if I fell off of this and landed face first in the concrete?

568
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,200
And he said, you probably wouldn't die. You just be really messed up from that point on.

569
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,880
And but that was me, he didn't realize at the time, it was me checking to see like,

570
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,040
can I kill myself by jumping off this fucking balcony?

571
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,920
And how old were you? Seven?

572
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:03,000
Seven, yeah, six, seven. And that would circle back. I mean, many times throughout the year,

573
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,320
that would circle back. What do you think was at the root of that?

574
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,760
It was really hard. It was really hard to see my family fight

575
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:26,200
so often, you know, it was constant. And my little sister is just a year younger than me.

576
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:34,040
And I could feel her shift, I could feel her clothes inside and wall off. And,

577
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,800
you know, being the oldest, my dad was the oldest, he was a little bit harder on me than her.

578
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:50,200
And that stuck out. It was just really, I mean, without too many details, it was very, very

579
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,080
difficult. And it really felt I think at the root of a lot of depression is this concept that it

580
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,560
will never get better. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. There's no way out of this.

581
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,080
And that's how I felt most of my childhood was just like, this is not going to get better.

582
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,120
I remember when I was 10, my mom said, I'm thinking about divorcing your father. And I said,

583
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,600
yes, do it. My sister was in panic. She didn't want her family to get broken apart.

584
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,560
But a part of me knew once that happened, like they would be better people for it,

585
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,640
because they weren't meant to be together. And it took three more years for that to actually happen.

586
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,440
But yeah, it was incredibly difficult. And I think coming to this place now,

587
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,800
where once again, I felt like I didn't have any viable option of doing something that was

588
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:46,120
meaningful with my life. And not to mention, from a neurochemistry standpoint, just playing with all

589
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,760
the buttons, you know, up, down, up, down, lack of sleep, you had Matthew Walker on three episodes,

590
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,520
like I now see that very clearly when I read his book, while we sleep, I was like, well, yeah,

591
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,400
no shit, no shit. I was I was messed up in the head. I watched the sun come up many, many nights,

592
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,520
in the beautiful double edged sword of an anti anxiety pill is that you feel fucking great while

593
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,680
you're on it. And the second you stop taking it, all that unworkthrough stuff is still there.

594
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,480
It's just waiting to come up once that chemicals out of your body. And so I had a fight with my

595
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:26,920
girlfriend at the time. And there really was this thought in my head that I'll never be loved,

596
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,000
I will never find love. And with that, I took every remaining pill that I had. And I drove up to

597
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,960
the top of parking lot seven at Arizona State. Thankfully, a security guard guard saw me pulling

598
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:47,000
up like 2am got out of the car stripped down naked and walked climbed one more flight of stairs and

599
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
was standing on the edge about ready to jump. And I heard, Hey, what are you doing up there? And I

600
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,400
looked back. Actually, let me rewind that I'd been to church growing up, but I didn't consider

601
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,680
myself a religious person. Most of that stuff didn't resonate with me at all. Particularly

602
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,920
with regarding gay people going to hell, like I was from the Bay Area, that shit really didn't

603
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,400
resonate with me. And there was a lot of other things that stood out to me as it didn't, it

604
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,800
didn't make sense. Yeah, hypocritical, that kind of stuff. And but as I was standing there before

605
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,960
the security guard said anything, that was my first real spiritual experience. Like this, I don't

606
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,680
know if it was the chemicals kicking in, but this wash of warmth came throughout my body,

607
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,760
from head to toe. And it was the most peace that I had felt ever in my entire life.

608
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,200
You think it's because you sensed it might be over?

609
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:44,440
Yeah, it was the time to go. For me, like there was no no reason to stay. And this voice and it

610
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,720
might have been a voice in my head, it might have been outside of me. I don't think that's the

611
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:59,000
point. The voice just said, not yet. It's okay. So this guy gets you off the ledge, literally,

612
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,400
gets me off the ledge. And I wake up in a hospital with all my family there. They flew out from

613
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,480
California, obviously to Arizona. I don't really have a recollection of what happened after that,

614
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,320
other than I remember asking my mom, like, why was this male nurse such a dick? And she was like,

615
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:23,640
you weren't very nice to him. You weren't very nice to anyone here. And knowing myself, I just

616
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:29,240
kind of laughed and said, yeah, that's for sure what happened. So I spent about a week in a detox

617
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:36,120
center. They had everything from group therapy to activities. They wanted to wean me off the anxiety

618
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,160
medication, knowing how long I'd been on that. And then, like I had mentioned, there was no real

619
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:47,000
problem with the opiates. So they didn't wean that. But they put me on colonopin for the week.

620
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,480
And the first dose I took, I remember walking up to the nurse like, I'm fucking high right now.

621
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,480
I don't want to be high. I want that. I want to go cold turkey. And they're like, no, it's

622
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,240
really important that we wean you because you can have potential side effects here. And I was like,

623
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,600
I don't care. I'm not going to take it. I'm telling you right now, I'm not going to take it.

624
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,080
So thankfully, they they cut my dose to nothing. That was an interesting time, because there was a

625
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,800
lot of people there that had, I mean, not to make comparisons, but people that didn't have all the

626
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,200
same opportunities that I had, and didn't look the way that I looked and weren't as young as me or

627
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,000
as fit as me or any of the things that I had going on. A lot of them didn't have family there

628
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,160
supporting them. My family would come in every day, they were staying in a hotel, they had nothing

629
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:35,320
else to do. But but check out after me. I think at that stage, you know, when you have other people

630
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,320
saying like, what are you doing here? You have so much going on. It's like you don't fucking know.

631
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:45,560
And that's, to my point, when someone's depressed, they see through their lens, they don't see through

632
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,040
anyone else's lens. It's just like this is water, right? And so you could have everyone on Earth,

633
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,400
fucking Obama could show up and say like, look what you have going on for you. And you'd say,

634
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,640
you don't know what's going on for me. And that's really how I felt. When I got out, I had a

635
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,880
psychologist and a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist, I was pretty adamant that I didn't want to go down

636
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,760
the SSRI rabbit hole. I had family members that had done that. And I saw it was just a merry go

637
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,760
round of different things. And finally, when they found something that would work, they didn't

638
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,240
inevitably have to increase the dosage. So I said no to that. I was prescribed lithium. And I took

639
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:27,000
it for about a week. And I remember thinking like, I am a fucking mute. My whole life, I've

640
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,280
been an extrovert. I've enjoyed talking to people. I've walked through public speaking classes in

641
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,720
college. Now I'm a mute. There was no high, there was no low. The diagnosis was bipolar.

642
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,440
What dose of lithium did they put? They must have put you on a very heavy dose.

643
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,400
Probably. I know some, you know, I think we know some people that benefit very greatly from a low

644
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,200
dose of that. But at the time, it was like, I can't do this either. And I remember talking to

645
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,800
the psychiatrist who actually resonated more with me than the psychologist. I've had great

646
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,480
therapists, but that guy wasn't it. Psychiatrist was like, all right, if you don't want to take

647
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,800
anything, read these. And he handed me six studies on fish oil in the brain. And that was my first

648
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,440
like, okay, from like a holistic standpoint of what supplementation can look like rather than

649
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,320
just creatine and testosterone. Maybe there's something to this and started something with

650
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,840
fish oil. More importantly than that, started creating space for myself to actually look at

651
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,040
my life and just create like a distance from the party atmosphere. Like maybe I can take a break.

652
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,720
And with that started to see a shift, started to get goals. Were you back in class at this point?

653
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,360
No, I never went back to school, never went back to school. So I'm still a senior at ASU officially.

654
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,920
You know, I had fought a lot growing up, like I talked about and I'd watched the UFC from its

655
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,120
infancy was a huge fan of pride. I had no intention of becoming a professional fighter,

656
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:53,880
but I knew what I was missing. And what I was missing in football was camaraderie. It was being

657
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,560
able to butt heads. It was some physical interaction with another human. And then the training, I would

658
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,520
go instead of training with all these guys and having some of the best coaches in the world hyping

659
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,480
me up before I lift, I'm lifting by myself a 24 hour fitness. I'm on a fucking treadmill. Like

660
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,520
there was no real draw to do that. I felt like a rat on the wheel. Knowing that's something I

661
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,360
missed. I wanted to start training in mixed martial arts just for the training, just for the

662
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,360
camaraderie, just for the ability to learn something new each day and not really know like,

663
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't want to have to design my entire workout in the gym. Like, let me go here and learn

664
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,640
something brand new and maybe make some friends in the process. And probably three months into that,

665
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,280
there was a guy at gym owner out in Arizona who ran rage in the cage was a local,

666
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,600
very low level show. And he said, dude, you're big, you're handsome. You played football,

667
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,840
you're athletic, fight for me at heavyweight. You don't have to do it one time. If you don't

668
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,040
want to do it again, you don't have to. And so I said, all right. In my first two fights,

669
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,240
I won in under 30 seconds. I'm not saying I was great or anything like that. And what I am saying

670
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,720
is there is a difference between an athlete that comes from division one and a lot of the guys

671
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:07,400
fighting heavyweight at the time. And this was in MMA? Yes, mixed martial arts. And what are the

672
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,160
just quickly, what are the rules? What are the parameters? I think everybody's heard of MMA.

673
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,640
People sometimes don't understand the difference between MMA and UFC. Like they're sometimes

674
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,560
people use these terms synonymously. But let's start with what mixed martial arts means.

675
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:25,080
And analogy I like to use is mixed martial arts is to the UFC as tissues are to Kleenex.

676
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,680
And a lot of people will say, can you hand me a tissue? They'll say, pass me a Kleenex,

677
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:34,120
whether it's Kleenex brand or not. So the UFC being the highest level of sport that is mixed

678
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,280
martial arts. And then mixed martial arts can have there's there's MMA shows all over the world

679
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:47,160
now at varying levels. But mixed martial arts is the practice of bringing all things together.

680
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,080
Typically, they use four to five ounce gloves that are fingerless, you can grab,

681
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,560
you can't strike in the back of the head. There used to be varying rules, you know,

682
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,160
in pride, you could stomp a guy's face, you could soccer, could guys face while he's on the ground,

683
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,200
you can knee a guy's head while he's on all fours, none of that's allowed in the UFC,

684
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,160
or in all of North America, to my understanding.

685
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,840
Can't what else can you not? Yeah, it's probably easier to say what you can't do.

686
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,640
You can't kick to the nuts. Can't pull hair. And a lot of this stuff when when MMA started was

687
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,200
allowed, you know, it was no holds barred. What's the what? Where's the genesis of MMA? When did it

688
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,920
really first start? I think it's different. You know, for different people, different camps would

689
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,560
say it was Bruce Lee different camps would say so they would say jute kundo was the original.

690
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,560
Yeah, and kaji Kempo also was different forms of full contact karate kickboxing jiu jitsu.

691
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,240
We just had john hackleman on my podcast, and he was a kaji Kempo background out of Hawaii. And now

692
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,920
he created Hawaiian Kempo. So there's there's merit in both, you know, but it is that bridging

693
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,240
of different forms and the arc of MMA. If you haven't seen it started off as like, this is what

694
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm good at versus this is what you're good at. It was like the Kuma tan blood sport. So you'd have

695
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,200
a boxer against a sumo wrestler. And then, you know, as it progressed, people begin to have more

696
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,800
than one trick pony a couple skill sets. So I'm good at defending takedowns, and I'm really good

697
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,760
at stand up. So I can stand at bangs brawling brawl, or terms that were being used or I'm a great

698
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,840
wrestler. And I can pound you when you're on the ground. So ground and pound became a thing. And

699
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,880
then as it's transitioned, and now you have to know everything in any position, because if you have a

700
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,440
weakness, it's going to be exploited. And in parallel to this, you've got this Brazilian

701
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,640
jiu-jitsu that is being, you know, you've got these incredible gracies and all these other guys

702
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,520
over there doing this other form of traditional jiu-jitsu. And when does that start to merge with

703
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,760
MMA? Because today, it's almost impossible to distinguish like, it's almost impossible to

704
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,240
imagine MMA without Brazilian jiu-jitsu, right? I think right as the UFC came along, that was the

705
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,200
point. And when did the UFC come into 93? So it was a different group of ownership. I forget the

706
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,800
guy's name, Bob something, but he started the UFC with in large part with the gracies. And they,

707
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,400
according to their story, wanted to bring in a guy who wasn't the best, wasn't the most fit,

708
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:09,080
wasn't the strongest. And they brought in hoist Gracie, just to illustrate like this is a technical

709
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,480
thing. It's not that he's a gifted athlete. And he's going to do this to you. He's not our best

710
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,560
athlete. He's not our best Gracie. And he can still do this to you. I mean, they showed what

711
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,800
jiu-jitsu was all about. It was awesome to watch that to see the difference. But now you see even

712
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,240
the sport of jiu-jitsu has really progressed. There's guys that focus on that their whole lives

713
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,480
and careers and you see them in jiu-jitsu sport competitions. And it's just a whole different

714
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,240
level. Their orders of magnitude greater than some of the guys in the UFC. Going back to when

715
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:42,200
you start training in an MMA gym and have these couple of quick fights. At that point in time,

716
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,720
outside of your fitness and athleticism strength, etc. Did you have any formal training in boxing,

717
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,680
kickboxing, martial arts? It was only wrestling. I had let me correct myself when I was 17. I went

718
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,400
with another wrestling teammate of mine. We didn't want to do tracker or any of that spring sports.

719
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,720
So we went into AKA American Kickboxing Academy, which is in San Jose. At that time, Frank Shamrock

720
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:11,800
was the coach there. This is today regarded as one of the most prolific training institutes

721
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,520
of MMA in the world. Yeah, still to this day. But you just got lucky. It just happened in your

722
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,000
backyard. Very fortunate that it literally was in my backyard. And we, you know, the first three

723
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,560
months I went there, that was about it. I went there for three months and started training for

724
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,440
football again. It was awesome. I loved it. And I was just thinking like, I'm going to learn this

725
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,680
stuff so I can kick more ass on the street. You know, that was really it. And it'll keep me in

726
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,720
shape and maybe help me be a better wrestler, those kinds of things. But it took some time. I mean,

727
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,600
once I got back into fighting, well, once I started fighting professionally and really

728
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:49,960
trying to learn this stuff, in large part, I had forgotten a lot from wrestling and most of the

729
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,200
things that I learned at AKA when I was young. So, but also having learned how to be coachable

730
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,240
was really just there to absorb as much as I could. And out in Arizona, we had some good guys.

731
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,560
It's not at the level that it is now, you know, you have some pretty great gyms out in Arizona

732
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,360
these days, but it was still still kind of young in terms of who you train with.

733
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,600
I didn't know that I'd fight in the UFC or anything like that. It was just fun for me.

734
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:20,360
And again, you could think for the listener, the UFC is like the NFL. And you have an infinite

735
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,360
number of other arena football leagues and all these other sorts of things. And you could be

736
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,880
playing in those leagues and maybe one day think you make it to the UFC or the NFL as it were.

737
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,280
Yeah. And that was the goal. I mean, or or pride, they were equal, but I, it wasn't my dream to play

738
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,720
or fight in Japan for that matter. I would have happily done it, but I just kept going,

739
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,400
you know, and I fought often. I wasn't training nearly by the standard I needed to be at. So as

740
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,640
I was building this record, were you sustaining at this?

741
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,880
Zero. I had no injuries at all. Early on in my career was only when I got to,

742
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,640
when I circled back. So I was six and oh, was now fighting in King of the cage, which you could

743
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,520
look at as kind of a bridge between the two. Still a massive jump from King of the cage to

744
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,080
the UFC. But a lot of guys that fought in the UFC had fought in King of the cages.

745
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,600
So how much are you getting paid per fight?

746
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,040
A thousand dollars a fight.

747
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,200
And how frequently do they let you fight?

748
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,640
It was four times a year with the contract. Prior to that, it was $100 a fight in rage in the cage.

749
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,080
It's just to give you perspective, $100 to go in and fight.

750
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,440
Oh, God. That's even worse than boxing.

751
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,240
Yeah, it was. I mean, that's still in the I don't know what it is today. You know,

752
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,240
this is still when things were starting or relatively. I mean, it's not like I was

753
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,880
fighting in 93. That's when it was starting. Got to six and oh, had a loss. My first loss

754
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,560
of my career in King of the cage. What happened in that fight?

755
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,200
I really hadn't hadn't trained much for it because it was walking through people. It was almost like

756
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,960
Tyson and Buster Douglas, you know, and my coach was trying to get me in there more. And it was

757
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,600
like, yeah, whatever, you know, and you think a humbling experiences like I was just had my head

758
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,200
in the clouds. I thought I was the shit thought I was going to just walk through people until I got

759
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,280
to the UFC, then I'd really have to start training. So I went into a fight. I think it was Laughlin,

760
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,440
Nevada, and just got the shit beat out of me. I mean, it was the first time I got stung with a

761
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,760
punch, need me in the head. It was Herb Dean who ref the fight. He actually stopped the fight with

762
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,160
me on my feet. I was getting beat so bad. I had a really good coach who actually had a

763
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,600
fight. It happened in the first round. It was a bad beating. My striking coach trained under

764
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:27,800
Dan and Asanto, who was one of Bruce Lee's main students. So he was a JKD guy. And I learned JKD

765
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,760
from one of Dan's six students. That's amazing. Yeah, this guy Vince Perez-Mazzola, incredible

766
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:39,720
human. He basically pulled me aside and he said, look, I can teach you all of this stuff, things

767
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,840
that people aren't doing in the UFC. But you need more than me. You need a team. You need training

768
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:50,040
partners. All my training partners fought at 185, a weight class underneath me, or two weight

769
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:56,760
classes underneath me. And he was like, you should go home and train at AKA again. They have a team.

770
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,200
They're great. There's many great guys that fight in the UFC and that's where you ultimately want

771
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,280
to go now. So you should move home. And at the same time, my strength coach from ASU hit me up,

772
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,080
Joe Ken. And he said, Kingsbury, I heard you're fighting right now. You got to go back to AKA.

773
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,640
What the fuck are you doing? And I was like, I don't know, coach, I kind of like it here in

774
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,360
Arizona. He's like, no, fuck all that. Kane's there. So Kane was the heavyweight wrestler at

775
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:28,040
ASU. He took fifth, I think, in NCAA senior year in nationals. And he's one of the greatest heavy

776
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:34,040
weights of all time. But he was only two and O at AKA at the time. So I moved back in with my dad

777
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:39,080
and started training at AKA, largely just getting my ass beat every day until I could finally get

778
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,760
my skills and endurance and everything up to par to be able to hang just to hang with Kane for

779
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:51,960
one round. We were rotating fresh bodies on him. I mean, it was a really hard entry point into what

780
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,000
being a real pro looked like. And how did you guys spar? Like, obviously very familiar with

781
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,600
boxing where you can spar, you're using slightly larger gloves. You've got headgear, though I don't

782
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:08,280
think headgear does much except prevent cuts. And it's just a little easier to dial back the intensity.

783
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,840
But when it comes to elbows, knees, things like that, like how are you sparring basically at 100%

784
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,640
all the time? So we weren't using elbows at the time. If you had knee pads, you could knee.

785
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,320
Generally, we wouldn't need the head. It was full go. I mean, it was it was a fight three days a

786
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:28,120
week. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you're in a fight period. Thankfully, that we've seen the sport

787
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,200
evolve. And that's not really the case. There's still some smaller gyms and backwoods areas that

788
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,320
still spar like that. It was a huge issue in the UFC for a long time. Fighters would get to camp.

789
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,520
They'd train like animals that spar as hard as the fight was. And then a week before the fight,

790
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:46,840
they get hurt or the week of the fight, they would get hurt. It was a real issue. And I think it

791
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,560
still happens now. But thankfully, people are being more mindful of the approach. And also knowing

792
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,480
once you have that level of experience, and you've kind of weeded out who's not going to make it,

793
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:03,480
you can scale back and work technically. You look at things like Muay Thai, which is a form of kick

794
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,520
boxing from Thailand. They fight on a weekly basis. So their sparring is just touch and go.

795
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,520
It's highly technical, and they're never trying to hurt one another. So I think we're going to

796
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,080
start to see that more and more in the sport of mixed martial arts. I did Muay Thai for two years

797
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:22,440
when I was in college. And some of the most painful injuries I had were, you know, blank

798
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:30,920
Shin to Shin contact. My God. That's the only thing that hurt me in in actually inside the octagon in

799
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,360
a fight in the UFC was Shin to Shin contact. I could get drilled and actually touch canvas,

800
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,480
snap out of it and get back up and I wouldn't have felt the punch. Like a hard rib shot. If I get

801
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,600
the wind knocked out of me, that hurts. But the Shin to Shin, that's the one where you're like,

802
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:51,000
wow, I might not be able to walk tonight. Well, I trained I was trained by a guy from Thailand who

803
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,640
can I still remember his name to I'd love to I'd love to know what he's up to now. But

804
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:01,880
his name was Eric and his shins were so badly conditioned, meaning so well conditioned for the

805
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,640
concept of the sport that you could hit them with not all out, but you could take a baseball bat

806
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:13,240
and somewhat like just gently, not gently, but like with medium force whack his shins and he was

807
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,040
unfazed at a level where even if you roll a baseball bat across a normal person's shin at

808
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:25,080
the wrong angle, it's very sensitive. And yeah, I was kind of like, look, I mean, I'm done with

809
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,520
trying to be a professional fighter here. I go to college now. I don't think I'm going to

810
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,920
do the work that's necessary to make my shins look like Eric's over there.

811
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,920
It's just not. I mean, it's just it's true, even though I didn't know much at the time,

812
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,120
I sort of knew like that's just the bridge too far right now. But gives you an appreciation about

813
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,240
sport. I mean, I used to love I mean, I love Thai boxing, but we would spar mostly with really heavy

814
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,560
equipment that would enable us to do this. And we would focus on sort of different types of things.

815
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,480
Like there were some days when it was just all going to be low leg sweeps and you were going to

816
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,320
be in shin guards and you were really heavily guarded because I always felt the worst thing

817
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,680
you could do is train at half speed because then it conditions you to be doing something at half

818
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,760
speed. You want to be able to be explosive. So you just have to have more more barrier there when

819
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,120
you're doing it. But having never done mixed martial arts, it's just nothing but I have for

820
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:19,720
how you have to be so prolific at so many things. You can be a great striker and I can sort of relate

821
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,000
to that because at least I know what those things I know it would be like to be great at that I was

822
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,480
never great. But I understand those sports well enough. But then you think you could spend your

823
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,960
whole life doing that. And if you're a horrible grappler, you get destroyed. Yeah, and vice versa.

824
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,440
That's where it's at now for sure. Yeah, I mean, I think when you look at guys like Daniel Cormier

825
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,600
and john jones, anybody who's great in the sport these days, they came in with something already

826
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,240
in their back pocket, you know, a lifelong wrestling pedigree, or a lifelong in traditional

827
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,080
martial arts pedigree, and then they could just focus on these other things. Because you only have

828
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,960
so much bandwidth, there's only so much time in the day to really learn and acquire new skills,

829
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,400
to polish them to feel comfortable enough to use that in a fight at full speed with all the pressure

830
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,440
of people watching you and pay per view and that kind of stuff going on. It's a lot. And I started

831
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,320
kind of late when you consider things. Thankfully, I wasn't missing the athletic background. But from

832
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,560
the technical standpoint, I entered the UFC as a white belt in jujitsu. I mean, there was there

833
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:18,760
was gaping holes in my game that remained there until I finished. While this whole new thing is

834
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,680
going on, how are you processing or what's the state of your mind with respect to this near death

835
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,640
experience you've had? And the culmination of really kind of what's been going on since you

836
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,240
were a kid? Like, has this has this now backburnered and sort of been supplanted by a new addiction,

837
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:41,640
so to speak? Yeah, for sure. I think having something to look forward to and train for and

838
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,520
really some level of meaning of what I want to do, I didn't obviously know it wasn't going to

839
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,200
fight for the rest of my life. I'd already experienced that in football. But this kind

840
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:57,000
of gave me a second go at it as a professional athlete, in that as I was working towards being

841
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,720
the best that I possibly could. Those are the things really, they weren't coming up for me

842
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,080
because I also had an outlet. If I was feeling weird inside and I go and fucking punch someone's

843
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,840
lights out, like that's a good feeling, right? Like it's letting the lead out. It was a great outlet.

844
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:17,880
In tandem, there was a couple catalysts, big catalysts that changed my life forever. One,

845
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,920
I started working with a sports psychologist who introduced me to breath work, and some level of

846
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,360
mindfulness. And the idea was because I mean, early on in my fight career, there was there was

847
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,200
no issues, I had ultimate confidence, I was going to walk through people. But now I'm at the UFC.

848
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,240
All these people are are as good, you know, as me, if not better. And that negative monkey mind

849
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:45,080
chatter that comes up, it was nonstop. So how do I control that? And the breath was really my first

850
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,200
entry point into quieting my mind and finding some level of stillness at least right before the fight.

851
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,640
And this was holotropic?

852
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:57,160
No, we would do various forms of slow breathing, trying to get down into parasympathetic. So at

853
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:02,200
least two to one exhale to inhale, four seconds in seven seconds hold eight seconds out, things like

854
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:09,160
that, or 1010 1010, 10 in 10 out or 10 in 10 whole 10 out. And those were I mean, fairly basic

855
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,320
forms of breath work, but I could feel the difference. And practicing that right when I

856
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:17,800
woke up and right before I went to bed helped me sleep at night. Because there was, I mean,

857
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,800
it's one thing to say I'll fight a guy on this certain date, but you sign a contract

858
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,400
every day up until that date happens. It's very hard to sleep. Cannabis helped me with that too.

859
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,680
Specifically THC, not just CBD, but there was a lot that helped me there to actually fall asleep,

860
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,800
breath work being a big component of that. The second piece that really was a game changer was

861
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:43,320
a boxing coach that I had who was Native American and Mexican. And he would take me to the reservation

862
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:49,560
to do traditional sweat lodges. So we do the Tim has call before every fight camp started to kind

863
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:55,160
of zero in on what we wanted. And after every fight for healing and reflection. And it wasn't

864
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,800
long before I just kind of looked at him and I said, coach, when are we going to use lamadicina?

865
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,200
And he just started laughing. And he said, I've been waiting for you to ask. And we started working

866
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,760
with psilocybin. Had you ever done it before? I had done it before highly inappropriately,

867
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,200
you know, at a house, like, creationally, yeah, at a house party on alcohol and cannabis with a bunch

868
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:20,360
of people I didn't know. And ultimate horror stories, ultimate horror stories. But this is

869
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,920
my first real introduction to use intention to have respect and reverence for the plants being used.

870
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:31,800
And in a completely safe and perfect environment, you know, there's no running water, no lights,

871
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,400
you're just out in nature, you know, and it's just my coach there watching me and maybe a couple

872
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:43,560
other fighters. And really, that's where I started to begin to uncover some things and really sort,

873
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,800
not too much from the childhood, but really getting direction and a true sense of peace inside

874
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:55,000
that was lasting. And at a certain point, I had a friend go down to Peru, he was going to hike

875
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Machu Picchu. And I was like, that's awesome, man. Tell me how it goes when you get back.

876
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,800
So he actually calls me early and I'm like, aren't you in Peru? And he's like, yeah, yeah,

877
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,160
I just got here. But here's the thing, I can either hike Machu Picchu, or I can go do this

878
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,720
thing called ayahuasca. It's going to take five days to do either. And I was like, hike Machu Picchu,

879
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,440
why are you even calling me? That's why you went there. And he's like, no, you got to look it up.

880
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,200
So I went to arrowid.org. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the site. It's got every drug from

881
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,840
caffeine to meth in there, including all plant medicines. They give the pharmacology of it,

882
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,880
they give the chemistry of it, they give the legality of it, and there's trip reports.

883
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,400
So I remember pulling up a trip report from ayahuasca and the first thing it was titled,

884
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:41,880
it said the apex of teacher plans. And I thought, hmm, maybe there is something to this. And so I

885
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,200
asked my coach if he would come with me to Peru because I didn't speak Spanish well, and I wanted

886
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,080
him there. And he's guided me in every meaningful experience I've had thus far. And he said, I'll

887
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:57,480
bring Peru to us. And we found people that would work with ayahuasca with us locally. And that was

888
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:04,600
an absolute game changer. That's where I mean, it that shifted more things in me on how I perceive

889
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,600
the world than anything else in terms of the catalyst for that. And again, you know, like,

890
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:13,400
as we talked about before, it's not to glorify these substances, there's a right way and a wrong

891
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:20,120
way to do anything. But under that guidance in that setting, with that medicine, no doubt,

892
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,680
some of the most powerful changes in the way I view consciousness, my spirituality.

893
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,000
Were you still fighting while you were experimenting?

894
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,520
I was I was introduced, I was fighting when I was using psilocybin when I got introduced ayahuasca,

895
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,480
to be clear, I was using psilocybin from then on still to this day. Not often, but yeah,

896
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,120
still using psilocybin. When I was introduced ayahuasca, I had just torn my labrum. So it was

897
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,920
after a brutal fight in Nottingham, England, where I had my orbital, my left orbital blown out for a

898
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,880
second time, and my left eyebrow was fractured from a head kick in that fight. And it was my

899
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,400
third loss in a row. I had always said if I get to be a 500 fighter at any level, then I'll quit

900
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:04,680
because it's it's not fucking baseball, you know. And I am taking damage is clearly if somebody can

901
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,800
punch me hard enough in the face to break bones, it's taking its toll on my brain. At that point,

902
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,920
I had some time off. I mean, I tore my labrum. It's it took me it was a year to fully recover

903
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,160
from that. How are you supporting yourself at this point? Are you making enough in the UFC?

904
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,320
I was not making enough in the UFC, even when I was fighting. So I lived in my mom's detached

905
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:29,160
garage for probably the last four and a half years I was there. And I worked at a pseudo strip club,

906
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:34,680
it was a bikini bar out in Sunnyvale as a bouncer manager and bartender. And I'd go in

907
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:40,200
twice a week, thankfully, I go on weekends and pull off to 11 hour shifts. Losing sleep, of course,

908
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,720
not in the best environment. But I still have a lot of gratitude because that put food on the

909
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:48,200
table the entire time I was fighting. At that point, sponsorships were starting to be pulled,

910
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,320
people know, or maybe not. But there was a reebok deal that UFC did, and they no longer allowed us

911
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,640
to have our own personal sponsors. So money was being taken out from under our feet, left and

912
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,080
right. And it was really important that I had a side job while I was fighting.

913
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,840
So the ayahuasca started when you were in this year of the torn labrum?

914
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,120
Correct. So you're three, you've lost three. What's your record in total at this point?

915
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:16,120
In the UFC, I was four and four. So winning record overall, but four and four, I think 11 and

916
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,240
11 and four at that point. Okay, so you're at a real crossroads, which is am I retiring from this

917
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:26,920
or do I have one more hurrah left in me? Yeah. And I wasn't getting super clear on that from ayahuasca.

918
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,680
I don't think it was my intention to make that decision until I had repaired my shoulder and

919
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:37,160
was able to train again. But all of the important things in my life were coming up for me, the deep

920
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:44,360
work. I mean, everything from childhood stuff to how I treated myself with drugs and alcohol,

921
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:49,320
you know, seeing seeing those patterns come up. I remember I was I was in Colombia, getting ready

922
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,440
to do it. And they told us we were going to use a plant, they use a lot of different add mixtures,

923
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,200
but there was this plant of 1000 ants. They said, Why do you call it that? And it said,

924
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,560
Well, we're going to rub it on you in the middle of the night, it feels like 1000 answer biting you.

925
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,080
And so I kind of chuckled. And I said, What does it do? They said, You're going to think of a

926
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,480
negative emotion that you want to remove could be anger, it could be sadness, could be whatever,

927
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,920
just something that keeps coming up for you. And I said, anger, and we got in a long conversation

928
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:17,000
about that. But it also talked before that ceremony about alcohol addiction and cannabis addiction.

929
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:23,240
And immediately, I thought, Oh, this is for everyone else. Like, I'm good. This is for

930
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:28,360
everyone else. And then you know, it does affect a lot of people, you know, and so I just thought

931
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:34,040
of it that way. And then a great chunk of that night was me reliving, puking violently over

932
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,520
a railing in my chonies and telling my sister to get away from me. You know, I didn't want people

933
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,400
around to see me like that. And I had countless nights like that. And even when I was fighting

934
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:48,280
in the UFC, it was really a polarized way to live in fight camp. I was a perfect little angel,

935
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,120
I wouldn't watch TV, I would read every night trying to study things that would help me in

936
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:58,280
fighting from mobility to diet, nutrition, you name it, eating super clean food. And then the

937
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:03,640
second the fight is over, it's whoppers and alcohol and blow and whatever I can get my hands on.

938
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,160
So that went back and forth for a while up until this ceremony, I was like, wow,

939
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:12,520
okay, time to scale back outside of camp and really treat myself better.

940
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,960
It's so interesting. When you look at the statistics, I'm borrowing a lot of this. So

941
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,480
the numbers might might be a little bit off, because it's been a while since I've read it.

942
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,880
But maybe you've heard me talk about it in the past. One of the most important books I've ever

943
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,200
read in my life is this book called I Don't Want to Talk About It. Did we talk about this in Hawaii?

944
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:32,440
We must have. I think so. Yeah. By Terrence Reel. And he talks so much about the difference

945
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,400
between covert and overt depression. So overt depression is what most people think about when

946
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:43,960
they think of depression. It's the person who can't get out of bed, who's weepy, who's unmotivated,

947
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,680
overeating, under eating, your classic picture of depression, the person who's sitting there

948
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:57,160
morose in their psychiatrist's office or whatever. And then there's covert depression, which is the

949
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:04,280
same underlying pain, but it manifests itself typically with addiction, anger, aggression,

950
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:11,560
workaholism, all sorts of other things that are numbing this sort of discomfort.

951
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:18,200
And one of the statistics that Terry talks about in the book that just blew my mind,

952
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,960
because it's so obvious when he says it, like I didn't think, I guess what I realized was I can't

953
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,040
believe I've never thought of this before. But he talks about the stark contrast between men and

954
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:33,480
women. So when you look at, for example, what's the proportion of men in prison versus women in

955
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:38,840
prison? It's something about, you know, it's like 93% of incarcerated people in the United States are

956
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:45,160
men, not women. Rates of alcoholism, you know, it's about 20% in men. And again, I could be

957
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,680
directionally, I could be a little bit off, but directionally, it's, you know, it's about three to

958
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:55,480
one in favor of men for alcohol abuse, obviously, you know, nine to one in prison, drug abuse,

959
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:01,400
violence, all of these things are vastly more in men than in women. But when you look at women with

960
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,400
clinical diagnosis of depression versus men with a clinical diagnosis of depression, it's the opposite,

961
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,600
it's disproportionately men. And he goes through this exercise in his book of adding up the absolute

962
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:16,520
numbers. What's the absolute number of women that are receiving therapy for depression, that have

963
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,480
issues with alcohol, drugs, violence, etc, etc, do the same exercise for men, it turns out it's the

964
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,440
same number. What's the difference? The difference is the form in which it exists. And this just sort

965
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:31,560
of blew my mind, right, which is all of this time, like, you know, whether it's you me, I think,

966
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:38,680
this is my anger issue, or this is my addiction, or whatever it is, and you realize what's

967
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,320
underpinning that is the same pain that in a woman might lead to depression, that we will label in a

968
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:47,160
certain way, and we're not seeing it this way. And so it's kind of listened to your story is so

969
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:54,120
interesting, because I'm just sort of watching the arc of numbing vehicles to numb pain. If it's not

970
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:59,800
this drug, it's the pursuit of this sport. And if it's not that it's this fight, if it's this thing,

971
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:06,200
and it's interesting, just it sounds like the ayahuasca became, along with the psilocybin became

972
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,920
one of the first sets of tools, these plants that and I don't put words in your mouth. So if I'm not

973
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,320
right, I'm nodding my head yes, right now, as you say, but it sounds like that was the first time

974
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:24,200
when you finally saw through the bullshit of you're on a hedonic loop, a treadmill of one next fix

975
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:31,320
after another. And again, it's so common in men, especially that, like, we're sort of drawn to using

976
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:37,640
our body as a shield, right, like the bigger and stronger and tougher you are, the more that seven

977
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,920
year old is not going to hurt, which, again, when you say it that way, it sounds so stupid. But

978
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:48,280
that's because we're now sitting here talking like, like it's a rational thought, and not realizing

979
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:53,960
that there's a wounded kid that had to come up with sort of a set of skills to adapt to a situation.

980
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,600
And those adaptations were actually very positive. For the large part, they saved you, right, they

981
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,920
prevented you probably from jumping off a balcony when you were seven. But they start to become

982
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,800
maladaptive. And it's it to me, this is the stuff that's interesting is this transition from

983
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:14,600
adaptive to maladaptive. And it starts to come crashing down. Yeah, I mean, it peels back layers,

984
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,680
they talk about the infinite onion, every time you go. And that's the something. That's something

985
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,200
that really resonates with me. You listen to people like Dennis McKenna and Gabra Maté.

986
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,400
People I find fascinating is that they've done hundreds of ceremonies, and it's completely

987
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,720
unique each time they go. And I say ceremony because of the respect and reverence that's

988
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:39,160
used when they utilize these plants. But it's the fact that if I give enough space between

989
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,720
ceremonies, and I come back and have a reason to be there, that's important to me, I'm going to get

990
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,560
a lot that has to do with that and maybe even more than what I came for. And that peeling back

991
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:56,120
at the layer really shows such a deep reflection of what's going on inside right now. And it also

992
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:03,400
has shown me the ways that I behave due to how I was programmed. It just blows my mind. We just

993
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:08,200
got back from Sartar, we did another four ayahuasca ceremonies there, about three weeks ago. And

994
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:13,960
each one just took me away took me in a different place. And they were completely unique from one

995
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:21,000
another. And I continue to learn how to work with it. It's continuing to evolve. And listening

996
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,200
to guys like Dennis, that will continue on well past 100 ceremonies.

997
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,720
Have you had some really negative ones?

998
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,120
Negative?

999
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,440
And by negative, I want to caveat that by saying highly, highly unpleasant.

1000
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:39,160
Yeah, so I'll all happy to jump into this. One of the hardest nights of my life was in Colombia.

1001
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:45,320
And ayahuasca has a visual component where you can have quote unquote visions in a dreamlike

1002
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:51,720
state. Oftentimes, they're very personal, what you see. There was a night where I had none of that

1003
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,440
and all of the purgative effects of ayahuasca. So I shit water violently, barely made it to the

1004
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:01,400
bathroom the entire night, didn't sleep one minute, puked violently the whole night. It was incredibly

1005
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:06,520
hard, but it was in many ways cleaning me out. And that's, I think, what I needed at that point.

1006
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:12,280
Now that's physiologically unbearable. But have you had, I mean, I've had one experience on ayahuasca

1007
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,400
that was emotionally unbearable.

1008
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,280
And I'm gonna get right.

1009
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,280
Yeah, yeah. Those are the ones that interest me.

1010
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:24,840
Having had a night like that, generally speaking, for the most part, and I've done now 26 ceremonies

1011
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:30,920
with ayahuasca, there would be some level of back and forth. So if I had a really challenging time

1012
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:35,240
physically, I could purge and then I'd feel euphoria. If I had some challenge emotionally,

1013
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:41,960
maybe I'm reliving some hard memory from my past, I would see within the same time span,

1014
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,920
you know, within I don't know, 30 minutes, that that other side of that coin and see the beauty

1015
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,160
in it and realize all the things that it gave me and understand it with a new perspective.

1016
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:59,320
My second to last night in Costa Rica recently at Sultara was for sure the hardest night of my life.

1017
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:04,920
I had my first dose early on and didn't feel a whole lot. And it was very peaceful. And then

1018
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:11,640
I asked for a second dose and it was my intention for healing. And I remember asking, then you can

1019
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:16,520
argue one way or another what how much intention plays a role in this, I think it plays a huge role.

1020
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,920
But I remember opening the door to any and all emotional and mental healing. And if there's

1021
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:28,360
anything left from my childhood, because now I'm 37, I've done a number of ceremonies with ayahuasca

1022
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:33,240
and even higher number with psilocybin and other MDMA of many things. And I've worked through a

1023
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:37,400
great deal of stuff with my childhood. So I didn't think there was a whole lot left. And I just asked

1024
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,120
like, if there's anything remaining from my childhood, please show me. It was fucking

1025
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:48,440
everything. It was the entire night I made it back to the room, ceremony had ended. And it kicked off

1026
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:56,680
into a whole second ceremony. And it was almost unbearable at many points. I remember just begging

1027
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,560
for mercy, like, please, I've seen enough. Let's let's we can run this back a different time, like

1028
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:06,760
any trying to rationalize or beg for a way out. So I wouldn't have to keep seeing this and to

1029
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:14,520
end up in a just a small picture of this. Sometimes if I was to have a vision, it's like

1030
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,440
watching from the third person or watching a movie and I can see from a different lens.

1031
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:23,240
This was like reliving it for the first time through your lens through my lens first person,

1032
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,840
like it was happening to me, the exact same feelings I was feeling as a six or seven year

1033
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:35,240
old or 15 year old in that moment, all the fear of my father, my mom screaming at me an inch from

1034
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:42,680
my face and spit flying into my mouth. Things like just it was in and it's so real, but it just

1035
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:48,840
kept going and going and going. And I realized, holy shit, like all that's still there. Finally,

1036
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,640
as the sun came up, I just kind of surrendered to it. And that's one of these cornerstones

1037
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:59,240
that I've learned through working with the plants is you're not in control. I'm not in control.

1038
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:04,120
Anytime I do these things, I can I have some level of direction, but really what I'm being shown is

1039
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:09,720
for me, it's not happening to me. So the ability to surrender that and let go of trying to change it

1040
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:14,360
really helped. And then having a degree of gratitude from my parents knowing they were

1041
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,280
doing the best they could with what they could at that time. And also seeing how hard it was for

1042
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:23,000
them growing up. And then seeing my son, that's really where it shifted. So we have a four year

1043
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,720
old son named Bear and seeing him and realizing like that's where it ends. Like that's where it

1044
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:35,320
ends. We all want to do better for our kids than what we were given. And then it applies to

1045
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:41,560
everything from finances to education to what kind of person they become. But knowing that

1046
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:46,920
he will never experience what I experienced or what my dad experienced and my granddad experienced,

1047
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:53,240
that generational pain is going to be gone with him. And seeing that I had so much gratitude

1048
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:59,320
for him and just knowing like, oh, okay, this breaks here. Like that was really cool. And second,

1049
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:04,680
I thought that it all washed away and I felt euphoria and I felt gratitude. And I just, it was

1050
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,280
for sure the hardest night of my life and one of the most beautiful in the end by far.

1051
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:15,640
There's not much to add to that because it's funny. I had made a note on my page to kind of

1052
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:21,800
come back to this point. All I had written down was break cycle son. Do you feel that part of your

1053
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:27,800
edge is gone as a result of this journey? Yeah, there was a fire that was in you before that was

1054
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:33,720
partially constructive, partially destructive. And you sort of were balancing those two things.

1055
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,080
There were moments when the destructive side was winning and then there were moments when the,

1056
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:42,120
you know, constructive side is winning. But it's hard to look at most professional fighters and

1057
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:47,560
not realize how much pain unfortunately is at the root of why they're doing what they're doing.

1058
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:53,400
It's very difficult, I think, to put yourself in the position of getting in a ring and fighting.

1059
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,600
I know this because I did it. You've done it. You've done it professionally. I never did it

1060
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,560
professionally. There's so much pain that predisposes a person to be willing to do that.

1061
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,200
Now I'm sure there are exceptions to this. I'm sure there were like people with the

1062
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:09,160
most wonderful childhoods who have ended up becoming fighters. But I used to study boxing

1063
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:16,200
at a level that would border on me getting an honorary PhD for it. And I can't actually think

1064
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:21,720
of an example of a professional boxer that I'd studied who wasn't fueled by some awful thing

1065
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,720
that had happened to them. You know, it can be something little, but oftentimes it was not

1066
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:32,280
right. Oftentimes it was generational and misery. Do you sort of feel a bit remote now from that

1067
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,680
sport in the way? I mean, I'm sure you still enjoy it. But do you also, I mean, is your

1068
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,680
relationship with it complicated as a result of this new insight or these new insights?

1069
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:47,800
I mean, I for sure have let go for a long time after retiring. I retired five years ago

1070
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,320
this month, actually. And I knew I wasn't going to fight again, but I still love the sport. I wanted

1071
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:00,040
to watch every fight. Never missed a fight. Trained. I didn't do striking because I knew

1072
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,640
that would lead me to fighting again. But I did a lot of jujitsu, competed in a couple of times.

1073
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:08,680
I think now I would call myself a casual fan. You know, I still have all the guys that I used to

1074
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:13,480
train with at AKA, I'll watch them when they fight. It's on ESPN a lot now. So I'll watch that too,

1075
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:18,440
if it's on TV. But I don't like scheduled stuff like, oh man, there's someone so fighting. I got

1076
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,440
to stop everything. You know, like if I catch it great, if I don't, it's not a big deal to me.

1077
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,640
It didn't necessarily change the way I look at fighting. I have a lot of gratitude for what

1078
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,120
fighting gave me and what fighting taught me. And I feel very fortunate that I retired at 32 years

1079
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:38,600
old. And retired without the catastrophic injuries that many people leave with. Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,600
And that's huge. You know, I want to be able to read to my son and any, all of our children and

1081
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:49,880
then chase them around and play and be the dad I want to be, you know, but with that chip on my

1082
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,880
shoulder, yeah, that's for sure washed away. I mean, I remember when I first started fighting,

1083
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:58,120
I just wanted to, there's a line in Fight Club, and forgive me if you've heard me talk about this

1084
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:03,320
before, but there's a line of Fight Club where Edward Norton's character beats the shit out of

1085
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:08,280
Jared Leto, the blonde guy. And Brad Pitt looks at Edward Norton. He says, what the fuck is wrong

1086
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,440
with you? And he just says, I just wanted to destroy something beautiful. And that's it. Like

1087
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:17,080
that resonated with me. I wanted to beat the shit out of people. And over time that shifted to I

1088
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:23,720
just want to be the best version of myself. And then now I see that still being the case, but it's

1089
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:27,960
from a much different lens. Like what being the best version of myself is applies to so many

1090
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,200
more things outside of athleticism. And I think that's a likely transition for people who have

1091
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:36,840
started to age and whatever, you know, there's a lot of older people like, Oh, you have an age,

1092
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:43,160
you're 37. But I feel different than when I was 27. Sure. 37 year old athletes and old athlete.

1093
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:50,440
So you're not even halfway done life. And yet the last four or five years have probably been some of

1094
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:56,280
the most important. Not that it's necessarily productive or constructive. Do you ever ask

1095
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,080
yourself the question, like, what do you think you'd be doing right now? If you hadn't had this

1096
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:04,600
fortuitous set of events, meeting the right boxing coach, being introduced to the plant medicine and

1097
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,640
being able to sort of extract from it what it gives you. Cause I don't think the plants aren't

1098
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:17,240
neat. They don't give you little turnkey, just take this. It's all okay. It's really messy.

1099
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:22,120
It's really messy work. And it's as much about the work you do before and after is it is what you do

1100
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:27,720
under the direct influence of the plant. But, but if you hadn't been as lucky as you've been to

1101
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:33,080
experience that, I mean, what's a 37 year old former UFC fighter doing who hasn't worked through

1102
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:37,640
the issues you had? Because there's a lot of those guys out there. I mean, this isn't about the UFC.

1103
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,040
This is like maybe someone who's never thrown a punch in their life, but they're still suffering

1104
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,880
from the same pain. Yeah. A lot of, I mean, I think the cliche thing to say is debtor in jail.

1105
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:53,240
I don't think that applies to me. I think I really turned the corner, but I wouldn't say it's far

1106
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,680
fetched to think that I'd still be fighting in some low level show getting the shit kicked out

1107
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:02,280
of me losing brain cells. I for sure wouldn't be with Natasha, my wife. I mean, in many ways,

1108
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,520
we were together for about a year before we did ayahuasca for the first time. And

1109
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:13,640
like that changed the course of our relationship. It unpacked so much of the arguing that we had

1110
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,920
allowed me to see things in myself that she could, but I could not. And vice versa. As we

1111
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:25,880
grew as individuals, we grew together in our relationship. And there's no way that would

1112
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,520
have worked out. How do I just continue to fight and treat myself the way that it was, you know?

1113
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,720
And so I think that's, that's a pretty, if I look at probabilities, that's probably,

1114
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,800
probably the highest probability is that I'd still be fighting somewhere, making peanuts

1115
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,640
and taking my life. And getting hurt. Yeah. Getting hurt regularly.

1116
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,280
How does all this sort of shape the way you think about raising your son?

1117
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:54,200
Because you alluded to the most important point a moment ago, which is if nothing else, the cycle

1118
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:59,480
of pain and the, and, and shame and trauma and all that stuff, at least it stops with, with you now

1119
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:04,920
to bear. But what else do you think about as far as like, cause now it's beyond not just having

1120
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,480
him be hurt, but showing him something that maybe. Yeah. Well, can I give him, you know,

1121
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,280
in the world? And I think a lot of things fascinate me. People talk shit about the paleo diet and

1122
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:19,080
that's fine. And what did paleo man actually eat and all that? And yeah, I get it. I get it from

1123
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:24,280
both sides, but to think through the lens of how our ancestors lived, that fascinates me.

1124
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:28,680
This is a giant test and it's a huge test of what we're doing now with everything that's in

1125
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,480
the modern world. It's being done for the very first time. What are the ways that we can kind

1126
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:37,720
of reconnect to our roots and still live in the modern world? And I think when I think about

1127
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:42,120
things like that, what are the most important pieces that I've learned and what are the most

1128
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:47,240
important pieces that I'm learning about now, I want him to have some degree of confidence.

1129
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:51,560
And I think martial arts is really good for that. I don't necessarily want him to fight,

1130
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,640
but that's his decision. And it'll always be his decision. Even if he says,

1131
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,640
fuck martial arts, I want to play piano. And that's totally cool. I have to let go of that.

1132
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:06,120
But still giving him the ability to trial these things and see what he enjoys. He loves, I mean,

1133
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:13,080
he's athletic, me and my wife are both athletes. So it's not confusing to me, but he's doing

1134
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:18,520
jujitsu now. It's pretty early, but it's kind of the equivalent of tumbling or gymnastics.

1135
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,560
And he absolutely loves it. And our Russell time is probably the most fun. We have a hundred

1136
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,960
square feet of MMA mats in our living room. So we can do yoga, we can roll, we can do whatever,

1137
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:34,600
and rough house. And we can play soccer or frisbee, and those are all things that he loves,

1138
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,760
but he doesn't love anything as much as wrestling me. So like, and getting him into jujitsu now,

1139
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,920
it's pretty cool to see that. I don't know how long that's going to last. It really doesn't matter.

1140
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:50,440
Getting back to this ancestral stuff, I think it's critical that we at least try to find some

1141
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,880
rite of passage, especially for our young men to bring them into adulthood. And I think that

1142
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,920
Ben Greenfield's buddy, Tim Corcoran, he's doing a lot of good stuff. He has these wilderness

1143
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,720
survival camps for father and son. When the kids are old enough, he takes them out there and they're

1144
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:12,040
solo, or they're in a small group and it's just him kind of watching over. And they learn how to

1145
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,720
build fires. They learn how to feel safe in the environment. They learn how to forage wild mushrooms

1146
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:19,880
and different things that they can survive on. And I think that's an incredible piece,

1147
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,640
taking it a step further. And again, if we're having that conversation with the DEA sitting

1148
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:31,400
on the couch, I don't know that I'd say this, but I think it's a very strong likelihood that I'll be

1149
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:36,760
taking him to the Amazon or maybe not me, maybe Uncle Aubrey will, or somebody else. Because

1150
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:41,080
oftentimes that was the case in rite of passage. The kids would have to leave their parents and go

1151
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:47,000
off with the elders, the aunties, the uncles, and go through their work. And I think having a close

1152
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,480
uncle like that, who also has experience with these things, taking him to the Amazon for a

1153
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,400
rite of passage with something like ayahuasca would be really transformative and powerful for him.

1154
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,480
And to most people hearing about this for the first time, they're going to be like,

1155
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:06,120
that's fucking nonsense. You're right, you lost me here. But I know quite a few people

1156
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:13,640
who are some of the most beautiful humans I've ever met that did that. Perongi being one of them.

1157
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:19,160
He's an incredible musician, one of the most kindhearted people I've ever met. And his first

1158
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:26,200
ceremony was when he was 11. So it's not to say that happens for everyone. But again, if you

1159
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:31,000
understand set and setting and who are really good practitioners, and that's something I say a lot of

1160
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,880
times is there's black belts, and there's white belts in martial arts, there's black belts,

1161
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,880
teaching ayahuasca and white belts teaching. And there's everything in between. And some people

1162
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,840
spend a week in the Amazon and come back and say, I'm going to give this to all my friends and

1163
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:49,000
everyone I know. And it can have really bad consequences from that. So, you know, having a

1164
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
place that that has been vetted, at least by somebody you respect and know, I think is critical

1165
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,200
when it comes to these things. Because, as Aubrey says, you're performing psychic surgery. And that

1166
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:04,520
done incorrectly can leave some really lasting damage. But correctly, it can be everything that

1167
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:10,280
I see in it. Everything that Dennis sees in it. Yeah. And anyone listening to this who has not yet

1168
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,840
read Michael Pollan's how to change your mind to have such a great storyteller and a great writer,

1169
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,960
take on such an important topic. I think it's hard to come away from that without realizing

1170
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,520
that there's there's a lot here that we need to understand better. But the promise is enormous.

1171
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,680
Yeah, yeah. And we do need to understand it better. There's no doubt.

1172
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:35,160
Under those circumstances, I think I can give to him a lot of things. You remember being in high

1173
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:39,800
school thinking, maybe you didn't because you had boxing, but I remember being in high school

1174
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,040
thinking like nothing is more important than this than how I'm perceived by my peers,

1175
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:49,880
status, things like that popularity, who my friends are, what kind of girl I'm going to date,

1176
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,840
and like, when the world ends, I went up on graduation day, what am I going to do and those

1177
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,640
kind of things. And there's a lot of weight and heaviness to that environment, especially now when

1178
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:04,120
you see kids that are glued to their iPad, and you got eight year olds with cell phones and things

1179
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:09,240
like that. It's, it's really hard to get them to unplug and to see the big picture. And I think,

1180
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,920
I think a medicine like that could be really important to reconnect them to what matters and

1181
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:19,960
you get them to see with a wider lens to things that matter to them. At that point in time,

1182
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:22,120
I think it could be a great tool for young people.

1183
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,880
It's amazing. How has your relationship come full circle with your parents? I mean, is that

1184
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:31,640
is it just this incredible place of forgiveness? Is it still difficult?

1185
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,720
It's funny you say that because right after this ceremony, or series of ceremonies in

1186
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,120
Atsultara in Costa Rica, my wife and I flew back to the Bay Area where our sons being watched by

1187
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,760
my family. And then we all flew out to Puerto Vallarta for a family vacation. And there's a

1188
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,560
famous quote from Terrence, I think it's Terrence McKenna. No, it's Rhonda's where if you think you're

1189
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,600
enlightened, spend a week with your family. It's like, fuck man, I went from one ceremony to the

1190
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:01,640
next. And it came with its own set of challenges for sure. But as far as my relationship goes,

1191
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:07,720
I have a great deal of compassion for them. I've also learned from the medicines that everyone

1192
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:14,360
walks their own path. It's not up for me to decide how or when they should learn their lessons. And

1193
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:19,960
just as it was the case with me and my wife, I can't always see what's going on where I'm

1194
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:25,400
fucking up. Everyone has a blind spot. So somebody that's close to you might be able to see what's

1195
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,400
going on in you better than you can. And it certainly was the case in my relationship.

1196
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,720
And I can see all the faults that my parents have that they don't see. But it's not up to me to

1197
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:40,520
decide that they will learn their own lessons at their own pace. And they may go to the grave

1198
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,200
without having learned some lessons. That's okay, I'm for sure going to do the same thing.

1199
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,960
But that compassion, to me, that's one of the most powerful parts of the story is to feel

1200
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:53,480
and experience empathy for another person who may have indirectly or directly hurt you.

1201
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:58,120
And to realize, wow, they didn't mean to hurt me, or even if they did mean to hurt me, which is not

1202
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:03,240
the case, I think, in your situation. But this is the set of circumstances for them. And that sounds

1203
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,960
crazy, right? That sounds like we should accept horrible things that people have done to us. But

1204
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:14,520
in reality, what's your choice? Yeah. And something that I've gathered too is forgiveness has very

1205
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,520
little to do with the person I'm forgiving. It has everything to do with taking that fucking

1206
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:25,000
weighted vest off of me. Because I'm held down by that. Whatever anger or pain or resentment that I

1207
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
feel towards another person, the longer I hold on to that, they might not even fucking know,

1208
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,880
it might not be on their radar. But I'm keeping that in me. And it's affecting the way that I go

1209
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,480
through the world. So if I can release that, what greater gift can I give to myself, let alone the

1210
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:45,640
other person I'm forgiving? Well, I want to thank you for being so open about such difficult topics.

1211
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,600
There were a whole bunch of other things I thought we were going to talk about that were super nerdy

1212
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,680
and sciencey and stuff. But I get to talk about that stuff all the time. I thought this was far

1213
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:56,360
more interesting, far more valuable. And I honestly, I think more people will find this

1214
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:00,440
resonance. So I really appreciate it. Awesome, brother. Thanks for having me. Happy Father's Day.

1215
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:06,120
