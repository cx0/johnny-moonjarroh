00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,460
of the drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia. My guest this week is one of my best friends

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,160
from medical school, a guy by the name of Eric Shayhab. Eric is an orthopedic surgeon

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,960
specializing in sports, but overall knee and shoulder. He's an assistant clinical professor

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,000
at the University of Chicago. We met obviously at Stanford and he went on to do his residency

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,680
in orthopedic surgery at the hospital for special surgery or HSS as it's known in New York City.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,560
It's generally regarded as the best orthopedic facility in the country, if not the world. He

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,160
did his fellowship with the New York Giants before settling in Chicago. He was also mentored at HSS

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,720
by a guy named Russ Warren, who anybody listening to this who knows a lot about or a little bit

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,240
about orthopedic surgery will understand the significance of that. Russ is generally considered

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,840
the godfather of sports medicine. This interview was also really informative for me because I,

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,600
as you know, think about longevity through the standpoint of living longer but living better

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,560
and a big part of living better is not getting hurt. What I love about talking to orthopedic

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,240
surgeons, especially people like Eric, who are just so cognizant of what the demise looks like

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,640
at the end of life, is I think by understanding where people fail later in life, you can understand

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,000
how to mitigate that earlier in life. So we get into a lot of detail around the common joint

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,960
injuries. So what's going on with knee pain, especially from incorrect form in a loaded

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,280
fashion. We talk a lot about shoulder injuries, especially with weights being used overhead,

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,160
elbow, wrist injuries, ankles, what's going on with the Achilles tendon. Obviously we talk about

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,400
lower back stuff, which for many people is also, you know, I think it's almost impossible to get

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,600
through life without at least one lower back flare up. We revisit sort of my injury, which I've

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,840
talked about actually in the past. We talk about all the complications that can come from it.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,800
And we talk a little bit about how you can decide when PT makes more sense than surgery, which

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,280
unfortunately for lower back injuries is almost always the case. We get into some of the real

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,480
controversy stuff like meniscus surgery, which some of you may be aware of. We talk about the

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,480
origins of pain. So a lot of times people present with joint pain, but it's not really clear,

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,000
is the pain matching the thing you see on the MRI? And again, I have an example of where that

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,600
was not the case. We get into PRP, stem cells, sham surgeries, and all sorts of things like that.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,360
The other thing that probably comes across though, not as much as I would have liked is Eric is

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,240
probably one of the funniest human beings I know. He actually sang at my wedding and I think we even

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,640
discussed that story early in this episode, although I didn't get him to sing. So that's

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,000
probably one drawback. Anyway, the show notes will be linked to a ton of awesome stuff that follows

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,960
up and goes deeper on some of these things. And obviously if you want to learn more about Eric,

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,240
that's great. But the reality of it is this is mostly just a way to kind of help people think

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,280
about orthopedic surgery and more than anything else, these types of injuries and what we can do

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,880
to prevent them. So I hope you enjoyed today's episode and here we go. Hey man, what's going on?

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,720
Not much. Good to see you. It's been a long time. I feel like it's been two years since I've seen

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,880
you in person and we did get to spend an hour finding a place to record this. So that, that

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,320
gave us a good chance to catch up. Where are we sitting right now? We are sitting in my Womat office

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,480
for Illinois bone and joint and Womat. We're actually in a patient exam room, I think. We're

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,280
in a patient exam room. It's like the only room we could find that didn't have an AC unit blaring or

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,360
something like that. Well, Eric, there's so much stuff I want to talk about, you know, mostly about

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,080
orthopedic stuff because in the spirit of sort of trying to live longer, you've probably heard me

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,280
talk about it. There's no point living longer if you're not living better. And a big part of living

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,360
better is your exoskeleton. And for a lot of people that you probably see, and certainly I see

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,920
it to a lesser extent, you know, once that quality of life deteriorates, meaning once they don't have

53
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,400
the strength, mobility or freedom from pain to kind of carry out the activities of daily living,

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,840
you know, for many people, they don't actually care that much if they're going to delay their

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,640
heart attack by four years or something like that. It stops mattering. So I mean, let's go back to

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,320
the beginning. There's so many goofy things I want to talk about. Did you grew up in New Jersey? I

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,800
don't think I knew this. Yeah, I grew up in New Jersey. I was born in Omaha and moved to New

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,360
Jersey when I was three. And is Bruce Springsteen still probably one of your favorite singers?

59
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,760
He's my favorite. Yep. There is this, I think I put it up on social media a little while ago,

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,640
but there's this awesome video. It was from 2009 in Madison Square Garden where Bruce Springsteen

61
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,240
was playing with Tom Morello. And my son, when he watches the video thinks I'm Tom Morello,

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,320
he doesn't get that I'm not. And it's like, no, no, no, actually, daddy looks like him or he

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,400
looks like daddy, but that's not mean. He's like, what do you mean? That is you. And he can, he's

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,800
like, why do you know how to play the guitar? But you never play at home. There's, there's one song,

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,960
which we'll have to link to the ghost of Tom Joe that they play together. It's like an eight minute

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,160
thing with Morello doing like a three minute guitar solo at the end that is out of control. But

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,960
there's something about Bruce Springsteen's voice that like he might kind of be the coolest guy ever.

68
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,720
No, he's definitely the coolest guy ever.

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,040
How many times have you seen him live?

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Five, six times. First concert I went to was Bruce in 84 at Brendan Byrne in New Jersey. And it was

71
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,960
as he was kicking off the born the USA tour. It was summertime. There were about five or six of us.

72
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:57,000
We were in eighth or ninth grade and it was great. Fantastic. And then I saw him, I lived in Milan

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,840
for a year. I was teaching high school and he was playing in Verona on Easter Sunday. And he was

74
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,080
supposed to play in an amphitheater in Verona that Guns N' Roses had played in like a month earlier

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,320
and basically nearly tore the place down. And one of these amphitheaters that had been there for

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,000
2000 years and sure enough won concert and no more concerts. So he played in the soccer stadium in

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,960
Verona on Easter Sunday for about five hours. And I remember I was on a bike tour. I was taking my

78
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,640
bike through Tuscany. I was by myself on a mountain bike and it was Easter Sunday morning. I was in

79
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,680
Florence and there was the Easter parade and I had this one ticket to Bruce and I'm like,

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,440
how the fuck am I going to get to Verona? So I ditched my bike someplace. I get on a train

81
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,480
of Verona. Turns out there were a lot of Bruce fans on the way and there were translations of

82
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Bruce's lyrics into Italian, which I always wonder how like working on the highway and drinking warm

83
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,080
beer in the soft summer rain translate into Italian. But anyway, and I get there and this show goes on

84
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,120
as usual for about five hours. And I get on a train at three in the morning from Verona,

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,840
head back to Florence, pick up my bike around nine o'clock in the morning and then keep riding.

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,920
Because it was so pumped up and jacked up from having seen this fantastic Bruce concert and

87
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,960
just kept riding for the rest of the day. So that was one of my favorite Bruce concerts was that

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,320
Italy. I saw him in Oakland with my wife with Lynn when we were dating in medical school.

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,240
And that was sort of tempered by the fact that she wasn't much of a Bruce fan.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,000
So my good buddy Mark Pomerance was at that concert too. Yeah.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,880
Oh, is that right? Yeah, we're up in Oakland up in the nosebleeds. And then I saw Bruce

92
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,960
most recently with Lynn, who now is a fan in Milwaukee on his river tour. And he gives such

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,120
a great show. The river tour is fantastic. And so he plays the album and then he goes on for another

94
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,160
two or three hours with just great songs. And he's so good live. I saw him at Wrigley right

95
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,760
after Clarence Clemens had died. And they had that tribute where they at 10th Avenue Freeze out,

96
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,600
they just stopped the music on when the big man joined the band and they have a

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,960
large shadow silhouette of Clarence from the Born to Run album. And it's really moving. I mean,

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,800
he must have done that about 50 times from his death to that concert, but it's still very genuine

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,520
and very moving. And the whole place goes quiet. And then it erupts in sort of cheer and laughter

100
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,480
and tears as it was really moving. And that was what I think, that must have been four years ago

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,520
when he played at Wrigley. And yet I'm sort of a JV Bruce fan compared to my roommates in college.

102
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,200
You go, my one roommate, Owen, had probably been about a hundred concerts. And he tells a great

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,520
story of... This is the Owen that I know? It's the Owen you knew. He tells a great story of punching

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,000
someone out on the Bruckner Expressway on his way to the Bruce concert. So I'll let him tell that

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,240
story. It's a successful New York. Yeah, no, it sounds like the guy had it coming. So I don't

106
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,760
really have any problem with that. Owen was a, like wasn't he a Navy SEAL or? He's a Marine and he's now

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,200
an undersecretary of defense for General Mattis. He does special ops and very busy game.

108
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,680
Do you notice over time as you go to these concerts, like, does the fans seem older to you?

109
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,960
And so for me, Pearl Jam is the band that I've seen more than any other band. And I just saw them

110
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,600
recently in Fenway. And I got to tell you, it was the first time in a long time I've been in a

111
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,560
concert where I had as much joy out of watching the other people there, because they were older

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,440
than me, some of them. But you could tell. So when 10 came out, I was maybe 17 or 18. But you can

113
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,200
tell there were people who were 30 when 10 came out and probably still found it amazing. And so

114
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,080
now they're, you know, in their late fifties and you can see the emotion in them when Eddie Vedder

115
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,600
gets up there and plays something that from 91 or something like that. So it must be the same with

116
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Springsteen, but even greater because it's a greater time period. Yeah, no, that's another

117
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,000
funny thing when you're at Wrigley and you see the fans to your left and your right. And they're

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,160
pretty old. And then you'll see some of them holding their 10 year olds. And that's the fun

119
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,520
part of it is that there's a sort of intergenerational thing. You have these younger kids

120
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,640
growing up loving Bruce because their parents love Bruce. And so but yeah, no doubt the crowd is

121
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,560
older. It's funny you mentioned Pearl Jam. They opened for U2 in Verona in 92. I was still in

122
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:17,080
Milan and I saw Pearl Jam open for U2 on the Zuropa tour. And. So Pearl Jam U2 and Bruce

123
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Springsteen in one trip to Italy? No, no. Well, I lived in Italy. Oh, we were there for a year.

124
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,440
I lived for a year, but same venue, same and fabulous venue. And the lead guitarist for

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,760
Pearl Jam was licking his picks out like he does. Yeah. Mike McCready. I've almost caught a Mike

126
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,160
McCready pick once in DC. I was in the third row. I was like, that was my one shot at catching the

127
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,720
pick. And I didn't. He also had a disposable camera. And he takes pictures of the crowd. So

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,760
it'd be great if he still had one that would be kicking in old school. But the disposable camera

129
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,000
in the crowd was great. We could spend the next two hours talking about music because we both

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,200
love it so much. The last music story I do want to tell though is, remember what you did at my wedding?

131
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,520
I hate to tell you weren't the first. I still feel special. You should. I mean, you're the first that

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,400
I use the buck teeth for. But pretty much everybody's wedding I've got up and sang with the band or

133
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,520
whomever. And for whatever reason, they let me do it. And I don't have any talent. I don't have a

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,400
voice that's worth listening to, but I certainly think I'm great. And I have a lot of verve and

135
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,560
energy. And so at your wedding, I sang a bruise. Yeah. Fire of course. And I had my teeth in,

136
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,280
so I was lisping pretty badly. Those buck teeth that make. Yeah. We're going to explain what these

137
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,360
are in a moment. So anyway, I had those Dr. Buck teeth in and sang fire to you and Jill. And I

138
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,040
could tell there was kind of like, what the hell is going on here among the whole wedding crowd? And

139
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,600
but hey, we were all in and it was great. And you had to, I remember that. I remember that wedding

140
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:50,600
also talking to Conti because he was driving from, was it then that he was driving from? No, he had

141
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:58,280
just driven from Jason Pyle's wedding in Los Angeles to Boston in 30 something hours. Right.

142
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,120
So he was planning to do it without stopping, right? But his wife or I wasn't his wife yet.

143
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,040
He'd taken Pro Vigil, which is that I gave him 400 milligrams of Pro Vigil, 800 milligrams of

144
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,360
ibuprofen. And he said he was going to be fine. And I was like, that's crazy. And she finally

145
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,280
made him stop in Cleveland. Yeah. Yeah. And it was 36 hours to get to Cleveland before she made

146
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,320
him stop for eight hours before they finished the drive to Boston. I asked him, I was like,

147
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,080
come on, you must have suffered like 24 hours. No, eight hours got up, drove the rest of the way.

148
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah. When you sang Fire at our wedding, it was one of the most amazing things because it was kind

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,720
of like Camp of a Blanknote. It was a Dan Flaherty, you know, the Dan band. Yes. It was that experience.

150
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,920
Because like at one point you threw in a couple extra fucks. Like it was fucking fine. Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,960
I did actually. That was so good. That's the part I love. Yeah. I wish I had done something more with

152
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,200
it to be honest with you because obviously it's been a great career for that guy. I actually got

153
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,680
to meet him at a party two years ago. You sent me the selfie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just glued

154
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,840
myself to him the whole night. I was like, I can't freaking believe I'm sitting here with this guy.

155
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,040
It's incredible. So where'd you go to college? So I went to a little school back East. Oh,

156
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,000
where abouts? That's East of the Mississippi. Okay. What city? Oh, I can't go city so quickly.

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,680
Oh, what state? It was in Massachusetts. This is Massachusetts. Yes. Eastern Mass. Oh, so near

158
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,080
Boston. Near Boston. This is a little school outside Boston. Boston College? No, that's in the city.

159
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Harvard. So you were the first guy I met that took that to another level in terms of the complete

160
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,320
buffoonery of the too cool to say Harvard. Yeah. No, it always struck me as odd when people

161
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,040
couldn't say that they went to Harvard. And I remember being in the backseat of a car with

162
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,160
Duncan and his brother Hunter. And this dude is there with me and I'm like, Oh, so hey,

163
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,840
we're in school. And he starts out with Massachusetts. And I'm like, Oh my God,

164
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,480
you got to be kidding me. So I play along with it. I'm like, Oh, we're in Massachusetts on the

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,640
West side of Massachusetts or the East side of Massachusetts. He's like East side. And so he's

166
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,840
so happy. He's not coming out with it. And then finally, we wither down to Boston and then

167
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,960
Cambridge and then Harvard. He finally lays it on me. I was like, Oh yeah, dude, I went there too.

168
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:14,040
And then but I've got to admit very lucky to go. And there's not a chance in hell. I'd go to a

169
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,280
place like Harvard or anything like that these days as my 16 year old is going through this.

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,680
It is a different world for college admissions and all the breaks that I had to get there,

171
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,520
you know, the door was still much wider open than it is for kids today. It's just a different world,

172
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,600
more international kids and highly more competitive. They're much less wed to

173
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,400
schools that they've used to admit to. They're much more open and for kids all over the place

174
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,160
and all the words, I think is a great thing, but it's just not the same. I mean, there's no chance

175
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,520
in hell I'd be in a school like that little school back East if I were applying today.

176
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Well, we used to joke about this so much that it stayed with me forever. So even when I left med

177
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,600
school and wound up anywhere, I would go there after now I became I was always looking for the

178
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,960
person who went to the little school back East. And so finally, so fast forward, maybe 10 years

179
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,400
after we're done with medical school, I've got this friend, his name is David Bataro, incredibly

180
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,480
talented artist, going to be talented at everything basically. And he went to that little school back

181
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,720
East and he thought that was the funniest shit on the face of the earth. And I said, David, I need

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,360
you to design little school back East t-shirts. So I want the sort of the Harvard shield, but I need

183
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,560
you to find the exact font that it normally says Harvard, but you have to just say little school

184
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,560
back East. And of course, David, because only David could do this, he probably spent the next,

185
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,240
I don't know, three weeks designing the font to make the t-shirt that I sent you. Yeah. So he made

186
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,320
10 of them because I had 10 friends who had gone to Harvard or whatever, or at least who I thought

187
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,080
would appreciate the joke. There were some who I didn't want to piss off too much. So do you still

188
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,240
have your little school back East? Yeah, of course I do. Yeah. That's so great. I should have worn it

189
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,760
during a reunion just a couple of years ago. That would have been good. So did you know when

190
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,360
you went to college, you wanted to go into medicine? I had a pretty good idea. My mom is a

191
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,680
nurse. My father, who I'm not, I didn't grow up with my dad. When my mom and dad divorced,

192
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,600
he went back to Lebanon and I really didn't hear from him until I was 16, 17 years old. How old

193
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,720
were you when they split? Three, but he's a physician and my grandfather was a physician. And

194
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,720
so I always grew up around medicine with my mom being a nurse and the doctors that she worked for

195
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,640
were terrific people. I had a bunch of injuries as a kid. So I saw Dr. Taylor, I remember like it

196
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,360
was yesterday in his office for some of the knee injuries I had as a kid. So I was exposed to

197
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,240
medicine probably more frequently than most people. And so I had a pretty good idea, but I took a

198
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,160
little bit of a circuitous route after college where I taught chemistry and physics in high

199
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,000
school, but I did it overseas. I spent a year in Milan. That's where I saw the great concerts and

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,560
taught in American school there, which was a terrific experience. And then came back the

201
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,720
states for a year to a private school in DC called St. Albans and all boys school there. It's very

202
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,920
prominent, great preparatory school. And then went back overseas to Bulgaria of all places and

203
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,880
taught in an American school there. So these three years that you're teaching kids in high school,

204
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,560
did you still think you were going to go and do medicine or was this a part of deciding if you

205
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,040
still wanted to do that? No, I was pretty sure I was going to go, but it's interesting. The teaching

206
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,160
was fun, but I felt like there was more that I could offer, I guess. And I was basically a high

207
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,360
school chemistry teacher and enjoyed the kids and loved working with the kids. But I just felt that

208
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,160
medicine would be a better fit because I'd still be able to teach and still be able to help people.

209
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,840
But it was a little bit more challenging, I guess. It was just more up my alley and I think it was

210
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,720
sort of a calling to go and do it. But the teaching was a great experience. It was a great way to see

211
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,440
the world. It was a great way to learn how to become an adult from college to earning a living,

212
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,040
getting a paycheck, paying your bills, paying back your student loans, and then directing your life

213
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,720
in a way that, geez, I really want to make something of this. And so then you go back to school.

214
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,920
So that time off between college and medical school for me was invaluable in terms of maturation.

215
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,680
And it's hard to imagine. I mean, knowingly in medical school, I don't think I was the most

216
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,600
mature dude on the block, but believe it or not, it was still maturation.

217
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,520
No, you know, Conte and I actually did a podcast a while ago, which I just actually just came out.

218
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
And we talked a little bit about this, that there was just a group of us that became very fast

219
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,400
friends. And I think we were viewed externally as sort of these testosterone knucklehead guys.

220
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,360
But we all had this thing in common, which was it all kind of taken a bit of a winding

221
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,840
path to get there. And I think on the surface, while it looks like we were just a bunch of

222
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,200
idiots, I think there was probably more to it.

223
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you and I interviewed?

224
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,080
I sure do. It was me interviewing for med school.

225
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah. I was your student in an interview.

226
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah. That was my first interview. So I was beginning like the circuit and doing all that,

227
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,360
but it was also my first time in California. So I'd never been to California until that interview.

228
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,120
And Stanford was the only school I applied to that was not in the Northeast. And I remember

229
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,280
leaving there and I think I went either Duke or Hopkins or Hopkins Duke and sort of worked my way.

230
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,280
But I remember thinking, you know, in part because I met you and I really connected with you.

231
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,800
And in part because I remember it was February and it was 76 degrees out. And I,

232
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,080
having grown up in Toronto and going to school outside of Toronto, it didn't occur to me, even

233
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,680
though intellectually I understood you could live in a place in the winter where it wasn't freezing.

234
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,200
To see that, I was like, wait a minute, this is a different place. But when you went to

235
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,120
med school, my recollection is we kind of thought you were going to wind up doing internal medicine

236
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,000
or ortho. There was a bit of a toss up there, right? Yeah, that's right. I was undecided pretty

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,440
much until the 11th hour between internal medicine and orthopedics. And the appeal to internal

238
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,280
medicine was the idea that you'd have these long-term relationship with patients. My guess is most

239
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,960
people who are struggling between ortho and something that other something is not internal

240
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,040
medicine. It's generally surgical for sure. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't be admitting this

241
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,320
among my orthopedic colleagues. Well, there's a joke. And I remember when I was going through my

242
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,280
rotations, you had the attending and the senior resident or the fellow and the senior resident,

243
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,480
junior resident, all the orthopedic team walks into the patient's room post-op day one. And

244
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,680
the nurse says, I think so and so might have broken out into AFib last night. So I'm going to

245
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,120
call the cardiology consult. And the attending says, come on, we're doctors here. You're not going

246
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,000
to call a cardiologist to tell us our own patients in AFib. Give me a stethoscope. And he reaches in

247
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,440
his pocket, doesn't have one. He looks back at the fellow. The fellow doesn't have one. He looks back

248
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,280
at the chief resident, doesn't have one. All the way down. Even the med student for the ortho

249
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,120
rotation, not carrying the stethoscope. So then he's like, yeah, just call the cardiology.

250
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,880
Well, there was a sign at the general outside of the weight room that said ortho library.

251
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,440
And there's a stereotype, right? I mean, all the jocks go into ortho.

252
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,760
Yeah, no, it's a definite stereotype, but it's sort of an unfounded stereotype. I mean, obviously,

253
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,320
there's some of it that's true. I mean, most of the guys in orthopedics are athletes or have been

254
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,120
athletes at one point. But it's a pretty thoughtful specialty. It's not simply bone broke me fix. And

255
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,440
that's that. And I'm really glad I made the decision I did. I mean, I really can't imagine

256
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,480
not going to the operating room, not seeing patients, not seeing sort of the fruits of my

257
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,240
actual work. I think being in internal medicine is for some people, it's great for me, I think it

258
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,400
would have been ultimately a poor fit. So I'm very happy with the decision I ended up making.

259
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,760
I remember you let me read your essay for residency and you talked a lot about Bill.

260
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Yeah. Who was Bill?

261
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,800
So when my mom and dad split, we moved back my essay moved back. My mother's from New Jersey.

262
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,880
We moved back to the town where she grew up. And it's a beautiful town near the shore called

263
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,000
Rumsen. Very well to do place similar on par with Greenwich, Connecticut, some other places that

264
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,800
people hear about. And when we moved back, we moved down to a smaller street. And across the

265
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,560
street was a guy, Bill Hensler, who was living with his aging mother. And he was a longshoreman.

266
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,920
He had worked on the docks. He'd been a caretaker. He'd been married three times, had kids and but

267
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,880
had been estranged from his daughter for a while. But anyway, he was our neighbor. And he took a

268
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,040
liking to my mom and my family and sort of ended up being over time a father figure to me. And like

269
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,160
I said, I didn't really have any contact, really had no contact with my biological father for

270
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,840
between ages three and 16. And Bill was that that role. He was that father figure. So the real

271
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,520
turn of the relationship actually happened in I think 1978, close to there where my older sister

272
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,840
Karina, we were all out playing in the street and Bill at that time was an alcoholic. He was a World

273
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,520
War II veteran. And I think he had PTSD. And like many other World War II vets basically suffered in

274
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,000
silence to some degree and his family, they were brewers in Newark. There was Hensler beer that was

275
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,520
brewed in Newark. And Bill passed out. And I think my sister was like trapped under his leg in the

276
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,080
middle of the street. And I mean, it was just a whole scene. And my mom said, Hey, enough. And

277
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,320
she took him to a place called Carrier Clinic in New Jersey. And he sobered up in 28 days. And

278
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,000
that's the last time he had any alcohol to drink. And he was sober since he came to all my popcorn

279
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,640
or football games, he would drive up to St. Paul's in New Hampshire, I went to boarding school and

280
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,400
come to some of those games there. And he got remarried in 87. And I was his best man. And that

281
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,040
was you would have been what 18 as 18 years old. Yeah, and it was the honor of a lifetime to be his

282
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,800
best man. And you know, we were very, very close. And part of the reason why I chose to do my training

283
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,080
in New York and leave California was so that I could be closer to home and closer to build,

284
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,040
because by that time he was in his late 70s. His health was failing, he'd had a cabbage and cabbage

285
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,680
for the listener is a bypass surgery of the heart coronary artery bypass graft. So he had, you know,

286
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,960
he was aging, and I just wanted to be closer to home. And then he died my fourth year of residency

287
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,800
about five days before my youngest son JJ was born. And those last six months were rough for him,

288
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,240
but I was very happy to be there. He actually broke his hip, which is an end of life injury for

289
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,200
many, many people, and it was for him. So he broke his hip in March. And it was actually right after

290
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,640
we had come back from Key West, Florida, where his daughter, Annie lives and works. And his

291
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,400
daughter and he had been estranged for a long, long time. But his wife, Jay, who I had stood up

292
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,320
for at the wedding, she had gotten Annie and Bill back in touch and they were close and they were,

293
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,800
they had reestablished their relationship. And so I had a week off from residency and Lynn and I

294
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,080
decided to go to Florida and our plans had fallen through at the last minute to be in a place near

295
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,600
Palm Beach. And so we said, let's go to Key West and let's bring Bill down to Annie. And so we did.

296
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,240
And then he ended up staying planning for a week, ended up staying for about six weeks. And then he

297
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,200
came back to New Jersey. And then shortly thereafter, he broke his hip. And I went down to see him

298
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,800
immediately in the local hospital in New Jersey. And they had him so medicated that he couldn't

299
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,040
talk. He wasn't him. And I said, this is not going in the right direction. So I brought him up to

300
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,680
New York to special surgery. And Matthias Bostrom, who's one of the greatest guys at special surgery,

301
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,360
did his hip, did his hemiarthroplasty. And then the nursing staff really took a liking to Bill and

302
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,640
everyone really, you know, he's a hard guy not to like. So he ended up staying for about two weeks

303
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
in the hospital after his hemiarthroplasty for no other reason than people like hanging out with him,

304
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,600
which is unheard of, right? I mean, and then, you know, when I was on call over the weekend,

305
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,480
we used to take call basically from Friday to Monday and be in overnight. And so we would go

306
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,640
up onto the roof on a nice day. And this was now in April, weather was turning nice. And we went up

307
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,760
on the roof on the sunny days and I'd hang out. My pager would go off. I'd bring him back downstairs.

308
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,320
And then whenever we had a minute, we'd go back up to the roof, we'd cruise around. And then he got

309
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,320
out of rehab. He went to the home. He was on his own, but he just got scared. And then he,

310
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,080
I forgot to mention this, he ended up having a liver cancer, HCC. So he had a paticellular

311
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,880
carcinoma. So he was becoming cacti. He was losing weight and he was just becoming scared.

312
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,440
And so the summer was sort of miserable for him. He was on his own at this point. Jay had died about

313
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,240
a decade earlier. And, you know, he went in the hospice and about two days later he died. But

314
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,840
Bill was probably the most giving and nicest person you could meet. He was always quick with

315
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,680
a laugh. He was a ton of fun. You know, when he'd come up to St. Paul's, he'd make fast friends

316
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,360
with all these other people. And again, you know, they'd be like, are you his grandfather? He's like,

317
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,680
no, he's just my friend. But he was that father figure that I otherwise probably wouldn't have

318
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,640
had. And he made all the difference in the path that I was able to take. And so, you know, I did

319
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,000
write my essay about Bill, partly because I just wanted people to know who he was. You know, if I'm

320
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,800
applying to be a part of your medical school, I mean, I didn't want to just list my resume. That

321
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,920
seems sort of stupid. I just wanted to give an insight. So I would talk about, I think on that

322
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,360
time I Jay, if it was in my application for residency, Jay had passed. It was about two months

323
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,280
after she died and I was at home for the summer. It was between my second and third year of medical

324
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,640
school. So I was in New Jersey and I wanted to take him on a, just wanted to get him away. So we

325
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,160
went up to New Hampshire like we had done when I was in high school. And we drove, he called it a

326
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,360
sponge door when he was younger. He talked with his buddies. They would go on a sponge door where

327
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,440
they go from house to house and place to place and sponge off their friends or their friends'

328
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,120
parents. And so we kind of did that. We stopped in a few places and then we went back to Cancad.

329
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,200
We were joking in the car, Concord, New Hampshire, but the way the folks in Concord say Concord is

330
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,880
Cancad. That was something I'll never forget. And then we went to Winniposaki where Mike Love,

331
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,560
who's one of his family friends and who was one of my first bosses, I bused tables at Mike's

332
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,560
restaurant in New Jersey and Mike moved up to New Hampshire and opened a restaurant in

333
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,680
Moultonboro on Lake Winniposaki. And then he opened another restaurant in one of the other

334
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,760
Lake towns off of Winniposaki called Love's Key. And so Bill and I saw Mike and Mike consistently

335
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,000
stay with him and we really were sponging from place to place. And so by the time we got back

336
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,840
to New Jersey about 10 days, two weeks later, we had gone on this nice ride and just had a chance

337
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,120
to kind of normalize his life again. And that was in the late 90s. And so I think that's what my essay

338
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,720
was about was the sponge door that I had with a guy who had just had a big loss in his life

339
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,080
and a way of sort of healing through time and healing through laughter and healing through

340
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,160
just normal daily activities. That's what sort of struck me about it. I remember this because,

341
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,160
you know, I remember going through because you were a year ahead of me and I'm sort of putting

342
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,240
that stuff into my own thought at the time, which was like, what do I want to write about? You don't

343
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,880
get a lot of space to tell your story when you're making these applications. And I remember thinking

344
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,600
this isn't what you'd expect from a guy applying to orthopedic surgery. And there was some stuff in

345
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,200
there about ortho, right? Which was like returning functionality to people and things like that. But

346
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,880
I was very touched by this story of Bill and yeah, I had forgotten until you mentioned it again,

347
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,880
but that you were his best man at the, you know, at the ripe old age of 18. I love that story.

348
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,560
And your oldest son is named after him. He is. So my will, we call him Will, is named after

349
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,240
Bill Hensler. And he was tickled pink about that. He would have loved to have met JJ. I mean,

350
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,000
sort of a hell raiser character like Bill was. And I think about life as somewhat serendipity.

351
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,800
And it is serendipitous that we happened to move into a house across the street from this man.

352
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,800
And that we took such a liking to one another and it was really all by chance. And I sometimes

353
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,320
think would it happen in a day and age like we have today where everyone's so suspicious of people

354
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,760
becoming close. Anyway, the bottom line is, it was a great stroke of fortune to know Bill. And I did

355
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,600
write about him an awful lot because he was probably one of the most meaningful influences

356
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,920
in my whole life. Are you close to your dad today? No, no, I've seen my dad probably total of about

357
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:59,560
four weeks. And you know, it's funny you mentioned that because he's recently, we were here in the

358
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,720
office right now doing this interview. And so he's been sort of raising hell through the office

359
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,080
because I get calls from the hospital pager. I think your dad is on the line. And then I get

360
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:16,520
calls from my secretary. I think your dad is on the line. And we don't talk very much. And he lives

361
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:24,280
in Spain. He was in Beirut for the majority of the civil war during the 70s and 80s. And he

362
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:31,960
refuge from Beirut to Spain in the mid 80s. And in 86 is when I saw him again. And he was in a small

363
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,600
town and Antonyante now lives in Alicante, which is a beach resort town about five hours south of

364
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,400
Barcelona. And I think he also suffers from PTSD. I mean, he was living in a war zone and he's an

365
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,640
OB guy. And, you know, he tells the story of having a woman on the table who he's doing cesarean

366
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,840
on and then someone comes in with a machine gun asking to save his brother's life. And, you know,

367
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,240
he became somewhat of a trauma surgeon as an obstetrician. And that's a big leap. And, you know,

368
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,680
I just think it got too much and he misses being at home. He misses Lebanon, I'm sure of it. But the

369
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,520
fact is, he's sort of anxiety riddled guy. We never really had a meaningful relationship. So

370
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,600
he got in touch with me again when he was hounding the office. I called him and

371
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,040
we talked for an hour, but I think the bottom line is, is at a point in his life where

372
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,640
he's not going to change very much. I'm probably not going to change very much. And it's hard to

373
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,600
bridge the gap. I wonder sometimes whether I want to expose my kids to that type of relationship

374
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,720
with their father. So I go back and forth on that. And then I did make a point of seeing him. The last

375
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,480
time I saw him was when I was engaged to my wife, Lynn. And I told her, look, you got to meet the

376
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,240
gene pool before you come into this whole thing. Cause he's a little nuts. So that was the last

377
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,040
time I saw him physically face to face. My sister random, my oldest sister went to see him and it

378
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,560
was a real brutal visit. He's starting to lose it a little bit and he's just not fully there. So

379
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,600
it's tragic. It's very sad because I think. Well, he was at Hopkins. He trained at Hopkins. He was

380
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,240
one of the former medical grads. He had gone to the American university. He was at Hopkins. He

381
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,480
did his OB guy. Is that where he met your mom? He met my mom in Roosevelt hospital in New York,

382
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,480
where he was training. I think he was doing some of his residency there or somehow they met there.

383
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm not sure if it was during his residency afterwards, but they met in New York. My mom

384
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,640
was working as a medical assistant slash nurse anesthetist at that time. She was worked as a

385
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,960
medical assistant her entire group. But I think about him in his mid twenties. He's got his whole

386
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,520
life ahead of him. Everything's very promising. He's a young medical student. He's becoming a

387
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,640
resident and becoming a doctor. He has his family and then fast forward 10 years. It's all fallen

388
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,960
apart. Like he's lost his family. He's back in Beirut. He's with his, you know, his, his four kids,

389
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,760
his wife gone back in New Jersey. He's in Beirut. And then he basically gets burned out in Beirut

390
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,240
during the war. And since then really hasn't done much. He's taking care of a few people locally in

391
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,760
Spain as an obstetrician for some of the community that are refuge there, essentially,

392
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,800
but not really doing much. It's a derailment of his life at a time when things were really

393
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,560
looking very promising. And when I see him and meet him, I can see how that can happen.

394
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,440
And then I just don't want that for myself sometimes. So maybe I'm just turning a blind eye to it.

395
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah. Again, I probably a deeper discussion that we could have off mic, but I have so many thoughts

396
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,880
about this, right? I think, but I think that, you know, on the one hand, it's, I have found myself

397
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,440
more and more empathetic to sort of the situations people are in that on the surface might look like,

398
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,160
well, you know, that's a cut and dry case of, you know, he left his family and X, Y, and Z. But you

399
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,960
start to realize that there are, there are other bits of baggage that people are carrying with them

400
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,600
that, you know, you can make a wrong decision in a moment. And that, that decision can, you know,

401
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,000
two people can make the same sort of wrong decision, but one comes with far greater consequences.

402
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,520
You know, one of the other people I had on this podcast weekend, Corey McCarthy, and it was a

403
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,840
really, really interesting discussion about his life and how he wound up in prison. And it made

404
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,960
me reflect even more on how close I could have come to going to prison too. Like when I was in

405
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,280
eighth grade, the kid I looked up to the most in high school, and he took me under his wing. I mean,

406
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,200
he really liked me and he was the toughest kid in the block and blah, blah, blah. And, you know,

407
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,600
by the time I'm in 10th grade, he's in 11th grade, he's in jail for armed robbery. And I've always

408
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,600
thought like, what if I was out with him that night that he decided to do this really dumb

409
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,600
thing and hold up a liquor store? Like you don't have enough of a prefrontal cortex at that age to

410
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,560
sometimes go, wait a minute, this is a bad idea. Like in the moment that can seem like this is a

411
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,520
great rush. Like we're going to get some money. Now that said, you've brought up Lynn a couple

412
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,640
times. So I got to get one story out of you. There's probably, if I had like top 27, shayhab

413
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,680
stories, this one's on the list. So do you remember your first date with Lynn? Now Lynn was one of our

414
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,520
classmates. So you knew Lynn, but you finally figured out a way to get her out on a date.

415
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:09,400
Yeah, our first date was a real winner. So I finally sort of mustard up the balls to ask

416
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,600
Lynn out on a date. We were going to go out to dinner someplace. It was over Thanksgiving break.

417
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:20,600
And my buddy Josh Edelman was at the ed school at Stanford at the time. And he called me up as a

418
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,640
Sid. Some of my friends call me Sid for Sid Walski from the old Bud Rising. He said,

419
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,480
I heard your mom sent you one of those hands. It's halftime at the Menlo Atherton game. I'm

420
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,560
wondering if I can come over and have some of it. Like, Hey Josh, I'm sorry, man. I got a date with

421
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,640
this girl. I really dig her. I can take her out to dinner. He's like, dude, dude, come on. I'll

422
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,280
be over in like five minutes. I'm like, all right. So I call up Lynn and I say, Hey, Lynn, I'm sorry.

423
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,960
I got to cancel dinner. I've got Josh coming over here to eat my ham, but you know, maybe we can

424
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,560
meet at the goose. Jesus Christ. I know. I know. Like that again. I mean, like, what is going

425
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,200
through your mind in that moment? I'm just thinking, I want to give all my ham to Josh. And so anyway,

426
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,480
and so she goes, are you kidding me? I'm like, no. And then she goes, okay. And I'm like, well,

427
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,440
do you want to meet at the goose? She goes, we're not meeting at the goose. You can pick me up when

428
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,880
we go to the goose. I'm like, okay. And the goose was the dive bar. You've been there a million times.

429
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,320
But for those who don't know, it's a dive bar outside of Stanford. It's still there. It's still

430
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,560
up and running. Is it still there? Yeah. Same. First place I ever ate when I came to Stanford.

431
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,920
Yeah. No, you'll never forget it either. It's probably still working its way through you.

432
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,160
So Josh did come over, he ate most of the ham and then I picked up Lynn and we went to the goose

433
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,200
and we were talking and chatting across the table. And I don't know if I should talk about this part

434
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,120
of it, but I had gas and I was just trying to sniff it one way and blow it the other way.

435
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,280
And just trying to divert it from getting near her nose. But I don't know, she says to this day,

436
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,640
she knew exactly what I was doing. I thought it was very subtle. So after that, I drove her home

437
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:05,400
and my car at that time was, this was 96 and I had an 83 Honda Civic semi-station wagon with,

438
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,640
where you could see the road through the floorboards. I had sheepskin on the seats because

439
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,640
they had worn completely through. There was no radio and there was no air conditioning. And this

440
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,240
thing was a, I bought it for like $1,300 and there's a story about selling it too. So anyway,

441
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:27,000
I took Lynn back and we're sitting in the car on the sheepskin and I asked her, Hey, can I give you

442
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,080
a kiss? And she's like, once again, are you kidding me? I'm like, what do you mean? Am I kidding you?

443
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,520
She's like, why do you have to ask? I was like, I don't know. I thought, and so anyway, we kiss very

444
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,360
awkwardly and she bolts out of the car again night and she leaves and I'm like, Oh Jesus Christ,

445
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,800
I really fucked that one up. And so I get in the car. Cause you're sort of three strikes at this

446
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,600
point. Yeah, no, I'm beyond that. Blowing off the dinner for the party. I'm going to get the ham and

447
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,320
three strikes. It's a no, like 27 ounces. Like a no hitter. So I'm leaving and I'm driving. I'm

448
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:05,000
literally like, I don't know, fourth way home. I'm like, fuck, shit, how are you idiot? So I turned

449
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,840
the car around and I, this is the story. This is the best line. So guys, if you've listened to

450
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,440
nothing else in this story, this is the money line. Yeah. So I knock on the door and she looks,

451
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,040
she opens the door. She looks at me and like, Hey, Lynn, I'm so sorry. I got halfway to the safe way.

452
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,320
And I'm like, fuck, she had me with it. And so I turned around and I decided I just got to tell you

453
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,120
how I feel. And she goes, well, how do you feel? I'm like, I think you're hot as shit.

454
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,320
And I said, and I don't, I said to myself, if I don't care if I have to sleep on the couch

455
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,480
or in your bedroom, but I'm not going home. And she goes, well, you can sleep on the couch.

456
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,840
So strike, strike 10. And then the balance of the things just sort of happened from there.

457
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,560
So, I mean, I slept at home that night. We did kiss and it was much better kiss.

458
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,360
And then, you know, things just took off and lucky me. But that's the line. I mean, I think

459
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,120
we're in a new era now. I still think that you're hot as shit is not going to get you a me too offense.

460
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,720
I don't know. I can't imagine why it could. I think it's reasonable. Yeah, no, it's objectifying.

461
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,040
It's authentic. It is authentic and it's sincere, but it's objectifying and it's using swear words

462
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,600
and stuff. So there's certainly something that could be me too about it. That's, I just love it.

463
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,200
So you've alluded to it already, but just for those who don't know what HSS is. So the hospital

464
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,040
for special surgery in New York is the apex facility for training orthopedic surgeons.

465
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,040
I mean, even though I wasn't interested in orthopedic surgery, even I knew what HSS was

466
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,600
from the first year of medical school, because if you wanted to do orthopedic surgery, you wanted

467
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,800
to go to HSS. So you end up there. But I mean, just for someone listening to this, what the heck

468
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,040
made HSS so special? They had some giants in the field of orthopedics. And so number one,

469
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,960
it was an all orthopedic hospital. It was all orthopedics. And so they were a think tank of

470
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,320
orthopedics and they were. I'll let the oxymoron there slide on the think tank of orthopedics.

471
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm just kidding. But the development of joint replacement, that was a big, they played a big

472
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,840
role in that. Some of the giants in the field of joint replacement, Chip Raunewat, Tom Sculco,

473
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,040
Philip Wilson were part of it. The spine surgeons, I mean, every field within or every subspecialty

474
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:31,000
within orthopedics, HSS had a player in that field. And again, it's just a really unique

475
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,200
environment where the reputation of the hospital is well-earned and well-deserved. Patients come

476
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,400
from all over the tri-state area to get their orthopedic work done at special surgery. The

477
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,280
hospital work now we have 20 operating rooms. And we have a lot of patients in the hospital.

478
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,960
For all the subspecialties, there were 20 inpatient operating rooms alone, all for orthopedics. So just

479
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,080
through that incredible volume, you can't help but learn just through osmosis. And they were very

480
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,200
dedicated to resident education. I remember one conference that we were getting a little bit

481
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,960
scolded because not everyone was showing up to conference. Obviously, it's funny when people

482
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,840
scold the people are actually there for not showing up, right? But anyway, I remember one of

483
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,200
the guys saying, look, we don't have to do these teaching conferences every morning. We'd be just

484
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,240
as happy to crank up the hours at 730 instead of 830. But they did do that. They would have these

485
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,680
conferences every day from 730 to 830 about some topic of orthopedics. And by the end of four years,

486
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,680
again, simply by osmosis, you'd absorb so much knowledge. And then the operative experience was

487
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,560
second to none because the operating rooms were humming all day long and sometimes well into the

488
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,320
night is not unheard of to do 10 joint replacements and be doing your last one at 10 in the evening.

489
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,880
And they just that was the ethic of the place was you took care of people you did, there was no sort

490
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:57,000
of end to it. And they had an endless demand and an endless volume. And they still do and they still

491
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,640
have the same giants in the field. They've developed some really young talent and influencers in the

492
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,800
field. So who were your mentors when you were there? Well, there were several mentors, but Russ

493
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,600
Warren, I would consider a mentor. I'm probably the not his pride and joy. He's had several he's

494
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:18,280
trained half the NFL team physicians. And he's been he's still as prolific as he ever has been.

495
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,160
And he's got to be pushing into his mid 70s now. And he's a Vietnam War surgeon. It seems like all

496
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,480
those you probably met him at Hopkins, but these old time Vietnam War surgeons were just incredibly

497
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,600
gifted, ballsy. They were just great surgeons and they really knew how to take care of people. And

498
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:41,160
I think their training in wartime was a big part of that. So Russ Warren, for sure. What did he

499
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,440
specialize in specifically with the North? So he's one of the godfathers of sports medicine. And one

500
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,480
of the earlier developers of ACL reconstruction, and he was a pioneer in arthroscopy and arthroscopic

501
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,080
reconstruction. And he's written more papers than any orthopod alive and probably more papers than

502
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:03,240
all orthopods combined. I mean, he's been he's he never stopped moving and working. If he wasn't

503
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,280
seeing a patient, he was reading a research paper, he was coming up with an idea. And I remember one

504
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,040
night, his driver, he had I worked with him as a fellow with the Giants when he and he's still their

505
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,800
team physician. And he had a driver Ernie, who would take him every place. And we had a late

506
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,640
West Coast game, we got back to Newark at three or four in the morning, and Dr. Warren spend the

507
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,600
night above his office, and then start seeing patients at 8am. And Ernie, he asked me if I

508
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,960
want to lift back as a dad, that'd be great. Thank you. Because where I live is two blocks down from

509
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,920
the hospital. And Ernie dropped off Dr. Warren, and then I was in the car with Ernie. I said, Hey,

510
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,320
Ernie, man, how does Dr. Warren do it? I mean, he's always working. And and I'm like, How do you do

511
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,760
it? He said, Well, Dr. Warren takes very good care of me. But he once told me, all I got is time,

512
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,480
and I'm not wasting it for anybody. And when I heard that, it put everything in a perspective

513
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,040
of the way Dr. Warren work, the fact that he never let a minute go wasted, he would constantly

514
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,280
either taking care of patients or thinking of research. I remember on a West Coast trip,

515
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,120
he met with some engineers at Stanford for a type of bracing, he just was constantly thinking

516
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,480
orthopedics and advancing the field. So he's obviously a huge influence. And anybody who's

517
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,080
ever worked with him will tell you he's the number one guy. And then Dr. Polici, Paul Polici,

518
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,920
he's another joint, he's a joint replacement surgeon, a sports medicine surgery surgeon,

519
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,880
was the most gifted joint replacement surgeon I've ever seen, he could do a total hip replacement,

520
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,080
45 minutes to an hour. What do you mean, skin to skin? Yes. And he just put in a perfect total

521
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,040
lip every time. And he was the doctor's doctor. He did anybody in the area, anybody in the hospital

522
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,560
and need a day replacement was getting it from police. I mean, he was just a very, very gifted

523
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,360
surgeon and everyone knew it. He's also one of the funniest people you can possibly meet a big Bruce

524
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,600
fan as well. And a Bon Jovi fan and turns out Jovi played it in an honorary dinner. And Bon Jovi

525
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,560
was playing at this dinner for in his honor. But Polici, terrific guy. And Wickewitz, Tom

526
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,320
Wickewitz, who was the director of our fellowship, again, super good guy, Scott Rodeo, who's the head

527
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,200
team physician for the Giants now, who's a phenomenal research clinician. And those are

528
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,440
hard to find the clinician scientists are sort of a dying breed. But Dr. Rodeo certainly embodies

529
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,760
that. And he takes terrific care of people, including my mom. And I don't know, I can go

530
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,520
down the list. I mean, well, before we talk about leaving New York, you spent a year with the Giants.

531
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,320
You did your sports fellowship. What did you learn there? I mean, it strikes me as an interesting

532
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,040
crash course of sports medicine, because you're really seeing the finest tuned machines under the

533
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,160
greatest destructive forces. Yeah, that's a great way of putting it. So with the fellowship that Dr.

534
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,280
Warren had, he, Dr. Warren's fellowship, he picked two guys and you would alternate a week at training

535
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,760
camp. And so once the Giants open training camp, that was also coincided with the beginning of our

536
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,240
fellowship just by just by chance. And I grew up a Giants fan like a rabbit Giants fan. And Bill

537
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,040
Hensler was a rabbit Giants fan. LT the greatest linebacker of all time. Yes, without question. And

538
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,240
one of the greatest people. I mean, so Bill and I used to go to Giants games, that was our thing. And

539
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,760
one of my first Giants games was with Bill in 1983, when Scott Bruner was the quarterback. And any

540
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,680
Giant fan will remember this when the Giants scored in our end zone, and they went up by three points

541
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,480
against the Redskins. And it was pissing rain. It was 32 and a half degrees. I mean, I've never,

542
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,880
you can't really be much colder than that. And then the Giants kicked off and they squibb kicked

543
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,240
it. And so the Redskins got great field position with 40 seconds left, they get in the field goal

544
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,440
position and Mark Mosley kicks his record tying consecutive field goal. Then the Giants lose the

545
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,480
coin toss, the Redskins get the get the ball, they drive in a field goal range. And this is like

546
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,080
first score is going to win. It's 83. And Mark Mosley kicks his record breaking consecutive field

547
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,880
goal. And we go home so disappointed. And I think that was a game that Phil Simms hurt his

548
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,040
knee and went out. But anyway, Bill and I would go to all these games. And actually the night before

549
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,920
Bill died, there was a Giants game on and we had talked about it. And we like we always did, we

550
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,320
recall, you know, when I was in New York, or California, wherever we talk every Sunday,

551
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,200
talk about the Giants game. And I remember talking about that game with Bill and then and he knew

552
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,920
something was up because that following morning, he that's when he died. And we were crying on the

553
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,840
phone, and I love you. And you know, after talking about the game, and the game was again,

554
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,120
just another vehicle. So anyway, I had and Bill had taken me to Giants training camp when we were

555
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,200
driving up to St. Paul's, I think one time, and I was going up early for my own football

556
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,800
camp as a junior in high school. And we stopped in Albany for the Giants training camp where they

557
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,160
would have it. And we hung out there for the day and watched practice. And I remember that training

558
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,920
camp. And now I'm coming back about a year and a half after Bill died to Giants training camp.

559
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,880
And it was a bizarrely emotional time. I never spoke with the trainers, Ronnie Barnes and, and,

560
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,280
and Byron Hanson and Steve Canelli about this. I mean, they're three of the greatest guys, they're,

561
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,760
they're, they're unbelievable practitioners and caretakers of these athletes. But it was a kind

562
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,400
of an emotional moment where I'm in training camp, having all these memories of Bill thick and man,

563
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:04,840
he would be he would love to get you imagine the pride he would be so happy. But okay, all that

564
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:11,720
aside, the first thing you do realize is that these guys are freak athletes, like beyond

565
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:18,520
anything you can imagine. They're so physically gifted. It is beyond belief. I remember I had a

566
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,280
poster in my bedroom when I was a kid of Jerry Rice standing in the end zone and he's holding

567
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,960
the ball up and at his feet is a player. I think it was someone in the Bengals and he's like,

568
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,680
got his ankles, but he's completely like laying out and obviously failed in his attempt to stop

569
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,120
Jerry Rice. And I remember one of my best friends in high school who was himself a fantastic athlete.

570
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,800
We were like sitting in my room one day sort of shooting the shit and he, he said one of the most

571
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,080
astute things ever. He looks up at that poster and points to the Bengal laying prone and he's

572
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,160
like, do you realize that guy's a better athlete than we'll ever be like the dude at the feet of

573
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:02,600
the guy you're worshiping? Well, the guys in the league are freak athletes. The guys trying to get

574
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:09,240
into the league are freak athletes. The guys at the top of the league are freak athletes. And it

575
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,600
is a razor thin margin that separates the guy who's a superstar in the league and the guy who's

576
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:21,480
not in the league. And again, it is such a narrow margin of, you know, this athlete versus that they

577
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:28,520
are all tremendous athletes. So that's the first thing you recognize is just how fast, strong,

578
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,640
powerful, gifted, graceful all of these guys. And longevity matters. You know, I mean,

579
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,800
Ryan Flaherty, who's a friend of mine that I do need to get on this podcast at some point,

580
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,520
I've talked about him in the past, but you know, Ryan is really the guru of speed training and he

581
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,600
does two things. Basically trains guys in college who were, you know, the top sort of 10 recruits

582
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,200
that are going to go to the combine and do really well. And then also trains guys once they're in

583
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,760
the NFL. And he said to me once, you know, the focus changes so much after the combine to what

584
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,360
you care about. So when you are in college trying to get there, it's all about performance at the

585
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,200
combine and performance to get in the league. And that predominantly comes down to speed. And then

586
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,640
he said, but once you get in the NFL, once he's working with these guys that are there, it's

587
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,200
longevity. It's just don't get injured. And he changes the strategy is completely dedicated

588
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,680
towards maintaining how long they can stay healthy. And that's a huge challenge. It is so

589
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,240
violent on the sidelines. It's very, very difficult to really get a sense of how violent

590
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,640
it is unless you're right next to it. But the hits are massive. I mean, when they talk about

591
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,920
it being like a car wreck, it really is like a car wreck. It's an incredibly high energy

592
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,760
collisions that happen over and over and over again. I mean, the closest I've ever sat in an

593
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,440
NFL game is probably 20 rows back in the end zone. So you're far enough away. Like it's still great

594
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,080
to be able to, you know, I was watching Barry Sanders play the 49ers. That was like the only

595
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,920
time I've ever seen Barry Sanders in person. But yeah, I can't imagine where you're sitting

596
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,840
on the sidelines, just even acoustically what that's like. Yeah, I remember there was an

597
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,200
interception once and the Giants had thrown the interception and and then Chris Nee, who was an

598
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,240
all pro guard and Tom Coughlin son-in-law, as it turns out, he was married to Coughlin's daughter,

599
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:12,520
comes over and just wrecks this guy. I mean, and it was right at right in front of me and he

600
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,840
flattened this guy and this guy got up, but it was the most acoustically impactful. It felt like a

601
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,080
sonic boom when this guy popped him, like just really took him out. That's the other thing I

602
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,920
think people don't appreciate. I only appreciate this because I've seen him train how fast those

603
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,720
linemen can run. Like, right. You look at this guy and you think, ah, he's 320 pounds. He's got

604
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:39,320
a little bit of a belly. He's probably not that fast. And he's going to run a 40 in like five

605
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,280
seconds flat, if not four, nine. Right. And then I couldn't run today if my life depended on it.

606
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,360
So they would do gassers. Coughlin had them do gassers where they'd go 50 yards across the field,

607
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,320
50 yards back, and you'd have to do it in 18 seconds, 16 seconds, depending on your position.

608
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,840
So I was like, all right, let me give this a try. And I wasn't as good a shape then as I had been,

609
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,000
you know, five years earlier. I'd sort of fallen off the, you know, once the kids came,

610
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,160
the wheels kind of came off. But but I was trying to do the gassers and the linemen time.

611
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:13,720
And it was very challenging. And these guys can motor. They are exceptionally good athletes. They

612
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,120
are big, but they're also graceful and they're strong and they're all that they're coordinated,

613
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,840
you name it. But the freakishness of the athletes is certainly something that sticks out.

614
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,440
The stress that these guys are under, I don't think people appreciate it. I mean, people think

615
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,120
about professional athletes just sort of coasting, they're making millions and everything else. But

616
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:35,160
that's not, it's not anywhere near the truth. And particularly in football, where they're really few

617
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,120
and far between guaranteed contracts. So these guys don't see their money unless they stay healthy

618
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,520
and play. And there's so few games. I mean, I remember reading an editorial a while ago that

619
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:50,200
talked about imagine we just took hockey, basketball and baseball and made it a 16 game season.

620
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:57,400
Like think of what that would do to the intensity of every single game, every play, every game.

621
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,240
So that's exactly what it is. It is intense. And if you're in the league and you know that the,

622
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,560
you know, you're fighting with everybody on your team for a position, you're fighting with

623
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,560
everybody in the league for your position. You're fighting with everybody out of league, trying to

624
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,440
get into the league for a position. It's an incredibly stressful environment for a young

625
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,920
20 something year old to be exposed to. I mean, these guys are under a tremendous amount of

626
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:30,440
stress to just perform, keep their job, not get hurt. And it's an intensely difficult situation.

627
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,000
So that's certainly something that stood out. What were the most common injuries? Like I remember

628
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,120
reading and this is almost assuredly dated and no longer correct, but directionally, I'm sure it's

629
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:45,560
correct. But the median tenure of a player in the NFL was like, you know, three to four years.

630
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,400
Yeah, we hear about Tom Brady. I mean, it's great to talk. I mean, frankly, most of the players we

631
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,200
know about, you know, the great quarterbacks, you know, they've been around for a decade and you

632
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,280
sort of take that for granted. But that's not the norm. Not even close. I mean, it is positionally

633
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,120
dependent. The running backs have the shortest careers. Linebackers have shorter careers, but

634
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,800
they really, really, again, because everyone's trying to get in the league, everyone in the

635
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,680
league is competing. And there's attrition. I mean, these guys leak oil and they leak oil

636
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,640
relatively quickly because of the violence of the game. And it was funny, I remember at the combine,

637
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,960
the combine, you'd examine the 300 participants were in the combine. And would you actually

638
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,480
examine everyone? Or would the Giants say, hey, look, these are the guys we're most interested

639
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,560
in go examine them. It wasn't that they would cherry pick the players. They they got a grade

640
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,360
on everybody. So all the 300 participants, they got a medical grade. But what would happen is the

641
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,400
teams get into groups of four or five, and the docs groups of four or five. So the players are

642
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,040
going to seven or eight medical exams, they're going the same physical exam, seven or eight times.

643
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,720
Exactly. And if they had an injury history, obviously, that would be what would be of

644
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,240
interest. The docs would share the information among the teams. They were, they were, you know,

645
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,160
very much working as a group of physicians trying to evaluate the medical care that these players

646
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,720
had gotten in the past. But I remember, I mean, all these kids coming through had something.

647
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:08,280
And, you know, risk surgeries for scaphoids, stability surgeries for shoulder dislocations,

648
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,360
ACLs, meniscus surgery. I mean, it seemed like more often than not, these kids had already had

649
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,800
a prior medical history or prior surgical history. And I said to Ronnie Barnes, I said, God, Ronnie,

650
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,960
all these guys are somewhat injured in leaking oil. Yet these are the best guys coming through.

651
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,120
And he said, he said, they're all injured because they're the best guys coming through and they

652
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:36,200
play. And it's made me realize, boy, it's a very tough sport to play at a very high level without

653
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,160
exposing yourself to injury and that everybody gets hurt at some point. And it's usually those

654
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,640
injuries that slow you down just a little bit. That again, is that margin, that raise a thin

655
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,920
margin of being a star in the league and being out of the league. Do either of your boys play

656
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,880
football? My youngest does actually. JJ does. He's playing freshman football. Does it worry you

657
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,120
at all? Not just with everything you know, but also with all the CTE stuff we've since learned about.

658
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,440
Sure. It worries me like crazy. And, you know, he started playing football as he's probably the

659
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,840
only Jewish kid in the history of the world to leverage his bar mitzvah into a football spot.

660
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,080
Yeah, he was in seventh grade and he was preparing for his bar mitzvah and he was hating it.

661
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,280
And he basically struck up a deal. It's like, you guys, let me play tackle football. You won't

662
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:25,320
hear a word about the bar mitzvah preparation. I'll just, I'm gonna say word. And we took him up

663
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,080
on the deal and he was playing in a weighted football league. So 125 pounds is the max.

664
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:36,520
And they, everyone's acutely aware of CTE concussions, head injuries, the way the game

665
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,480
is coached has changed drastically among the youth level. And then when you watch the games,

666
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,400
it seems relatively safe. I mean, it's sort of kids bumping hips. It certainly doesn't seem any

667
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,520
more violent than the lacrosse and hockey. The kids are playing at that age and we let him play.

668
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,920
He then he played again his eighth grade year because he's a little bigger. And so again,

669
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,320
it was still a sized limited league. So he's a little bit more advantaged then. And then

670
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,360
sort of reluctantly he's playing as a freshman and simply because he loves playing the game.

671
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:09,160
And we look at the mentors who are his coaches and we have such admiration for his coaches. And

672
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,880
we look at his teammates and he gets an awful lot out of it. And I remember hearing Curtis

673
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:19,080
Martin's Hall of Fame acceptance speech. Oh, which I will link to it, but it is beautiful.

674
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,840
It's an awesome speech. So you're better off listening to it. I don't know if you want me

675
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,120
to spoil the punch line. Yeah. I mean, go ahead and paraphrase it for the folks who don't want to

676
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:34,520
listen. So Curtis Martin talks basically off the cuff about football and his closing line was,

677
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,320
and he came from very poor, disadvantaged environment, Pittsburgh, and football gave him

678
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,160
an avenue. And he talks about all the dangers of the game. And he's not certain whether or not

679
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,920
he'd let his son play football or not, but he says to himself, if football can do for your kid,

680
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,640
what it did for me, there's no question that I let you play. I mean, that's fundamentally the

681
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,960
punch line that there's a lot of pros and cons. You have to weigh the pros and cons for your own

682
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,240
kid and decide whether or not it's worth it. And for us, we felt it was worth it. And I

683
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,840
shit my pants nearly every game. I'm always worried about him playing.

684
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,640
But then again, I see the joy he derives from playing it. And it's hard to hold that now as

685
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,320
time goes on and the game gets faster and the kids get bigger. And he may decide this is for me,

686
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,880
or this is not for me. We'll see how he develops. And he's still just a freshman and still an

687
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,400
underdeveloped freshman. But it is something we let him do despite Lynn being a pediatrician,

688
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,160
me being an orthopedist and both of us being fully aware of the risk of playing,

689
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,880
because in the end, we felt the benefits outweigh the risks.

690
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,240
Yeah, I don't know. It's tough. I was actually, as I was on the way over here to meet you,

691
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,640
I was talking to my brother and my brother's really into mountain biking. And he keeps trying

692
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,160
to get me to do it. And I'm like, yeah, I just don't want to do it. Like I just, you know, just,

693
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,120
hey, I don't need a new thing to get into. But also it's like, just don't, the risk of injury,

694
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,560
like I don't, even silly injuries, like I don't want to break my wrist or do something like that.

695
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,200
But look, he's obsessed with it. And we have a mutual friend who he's much closer to who's

696
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,040
a motorcycle racer and used to do a lot of road riding. And whenever we would be on, you know,

697
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,840
road rides, this guy was the best descender. Like because he had been racing motorcycles all his

698
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,400
life, he could, he could basically rip hell going down a mountain when all of us would be a little

699
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,160
more tentative and on our brakes and stuff. And this guy's name is Jimmy. And now Jimmy's got

700
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:24,360
my brother into something I didn't even realize was an activity, which is downhill mountain biking.

701
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,520
So they go to ski slopes in the summer and you ride, you take your mountain bike up the ski

702
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,440
slope and you just come down. And I'm like, my brother's like, I know what you're going to say

703
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,960
before you say it. So don't say it. I thought it was crazy too, but it is the fricking best thing

704
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,760
in the world. And I was like, you couldn't pay me to do that. Paul, what are you thinking?

705
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:49,240
Riding a mountain bike down a ski slope. Like, I don't know. I think I'm just a pussy. I mean,

706
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,160
I think at the end of the day, I took a trip with my buddy Jim Barker from Telluride to Moab on a

707
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,280
mountain bike over the Uncompared Plateau. But we were such novice rookies. We even like, hey,

708
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,120
let's go mountain biking. Yeah. What do you want to do? Let's go to Colorado and go down some ski

709
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,360
slopes and barrel down on our mountain bikes. That's what we thought we were going to do.

710
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,240
Well, we think it'd be fun. It's like alpine sliding on a bike.

711
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,960
So let's talk a little bit about some of the nuts and bolts of orthopedic surgery,

712
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,360
because I can't imagine there's somebody listening to this who hasn't either personally,

713
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:27,080
directly or indirectly been touched by an orthopedic injury. And I don't know the right

714
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,480
way to go through it, but why don't we just start with the knee, since that seems to be a pretty

715
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,000
common joint that gets injured. Talk to me about it through the lens of an engineer. What is the

716
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,960
knee really good at? What is it bad at? If you could be God for a day, what would you change?

717
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,160
So, oh, that's a good question. So the knee is incredibly good at bearing weight

718
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:53,240
and supporting your weight. And it's incredibly stable for what it's being asked to do,

719
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:59,320
but it's an incredibly complex design with more moving parts. Every degree of freedom is in play

720
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:07,000
with rotation, translation. So if I were God for a day, I would make the ligaments. Actually, no,

721
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,760
I would make the cartilage immortal, because the cartilage wearing down in the knee is fundamentally

722
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,120
what will slow people down. I see. So you're not going to save the ACL tear, but you're going to

723
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:25,000
save the knee replacements for arthritis. Correct. And the cartilage is what, when that wears down,

724
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,760
that's when people have pain. People can live without an ACL. I've lived without an ACL in my

725
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,400
left knee since I was 12 years old. And I was able to play sports. Not everybody can do it.

726
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,280
So, when you were 12, you tore your ACL. Yes. And you, at the time, you could have had a

727
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:44,520
cat of Eric replacement. So at 12 years old, at that time, I was casted for... Or patellar tendon.

728
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,800
It was in the early 80s. So, I mean, when I was 12, and so ACL reconstruction was in its naysenses.

729
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,240
I'm not even sure anything was really being done on any sort of widespread level. And if it was,

730
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,240
it was being done through open incisions. And there was a five in one procedure where you'd

731
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,200
sling bits of the IT band around the knee, and certainly not what modern techniques would be of

732
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,320
reconstruction. Sometimes repairs were being done at the time that failing, basically trying to

733
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,720
sew the ligament back together. And so, you can live without an ACL, and you can live a very

734
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,400
productive active life without one. But you will be prone to instability. And the instability can

735
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,520
wear down the knee. The repetitive giving out episodes can start wearing through the meniscus.

736
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,440
And then once the meniscus starts going, the articular hard cartilage starts going.

737
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,360
And once the hard cartilage starts going, the knee pain, the knee swelling, the limitations...

738
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,920
So let's talk about, let's describe the joint, because now I'm realizing it's hard to do this

739
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,400
over audio, but you've got this thing called the tibia, and it has a plateau. And that's where the

740
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,440
cartilage sits, right? On top of the plateau, yes. And then the other end of the joint is the sort of

741
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,440
bottom end or the distal end of the femur. That's kind of roundish. Yes. And it actually kind of

742
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,360
looks more like a knuckle, right? Like it's sort of... Yeah. And there are two condyles, two knuckles

743
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,960
to it. Yeah. Yes. So you've talked about the cartilage, but then where does the ACL, MCL,

744
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,760
and menisci fit into that for the person listening to this? So again, like you said,

745
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,760
it's hard to describe. And we'll put cool pictures up so people can kind of look and see this.

746
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,320
So the MCL is on the inside zone of the knee, and it's actually a ligament that we consider

747
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:17,960
extraarticular. It's outside the joint capsule. And the MCL is a very stout ligament that controls

748
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,760
the knee from swaying side to side. So if you can imagine your tibia swaying out towards your hip

749
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,720
or back towards your other foot, the MCL controls that. The LCL, which is the lateral collateral

750
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,400
ligament on the other side of the knee and the outside zone of the knee, has the same function,

751
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,280
but just in the opposite direction. And then the cruciate ligaments are crossing ligaments that

752
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,880
are directly in the center of the knee. And the anterior cruciate ligament is crucial for

753
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,640
rotational control of the knee. And when people tear their ACL, it's usually a rotational injury

754
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:54,200
that does it. And it's almost a near dislocation of the knee that occurs. And so usually the outer

755
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,760
part of the femur will rotate backwards and even come all the way off the tibia and then rotate

756
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,560
back. And as it comes off and comes back, that's where the tearing of the ACL occurs.

757
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,680
Why do people tear the ACL more than the PCL?

758
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:14,760
PCL usually gets torn from a direct blow injury from falling onto the knee, but falling specifically

759
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,600
on the tibial tubercle. And it's not easy to do that. I mean, most of the time you're falling

760
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,560
more on your patella. But if you fall directly on your tibial tubercle, you will drive the tibia

761
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,400
backwards posteriorly. And that's what puts the PCL on stretch and it gives out.

762
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:32,120
But people do very well with a full PCL tear as long as they don't have any other ligament injury

763
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,080
in the knee. And plenty of the professional athletes, including a few on the Giants,

764
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,120
had complete PCL tears who were functioning at that high athletic level. So it doesn't have the

765
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,680
same rotational implications when patients tear their PCL. They typically, if they're having

766
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,920
complication from a PCL tear, it's from the increased contact pressures that happen in the

767
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:55,880
patella because the tibia is now sitting back and it's pulling the patella into the femur as

768
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,280
it sits back. And that pressure between the patella and the femur is what gives people disability

769
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,800
from a PCL tear. And then so where do the meniscus sit? The meniscus sit on top of the plateau.

770
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:11,560
They're rounded and they basically contour the flattish plateau into a more rounded femur. So

771
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,920
it allows for the contact pressures within the knee to be distributed evenly, more evenly.

772
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,040
And they're critical tissue structures, as it turns out. It wasn't long ago that we were

773
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:27,880
removing meniscus without really any thought consequence. There was no foreseen consequence

774
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,840
of taking out the meniscus or even parts of it. And it's become very clear that losing the meniscus

775
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,000
is sort of the beginning of the end for most people's knees once they start having meniscal

776
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,120
tears. And it's far more likely that at a younger age, their cartilage is going to wear down their

777
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,480
hard cartilage. And so when a person gets a knee replacement, the tibial plateau has that built in

778
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,240
little curvature up at the edges to mimic what the meniscus would be doing sitting on the actual

779
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:00,040
tibial cartridge. Is that necessary? With a replacement. So the meniscus is also stabilizing

780
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,840
structure within the knee. And again, it takes the flat tibia and makes it more rounded so that the

781
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,800
femur fits in it. And that gives some natural anterior and posterior resistance to translation.

782
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,000
And losing that meniscus puts the articular cartilage under a lot more pressure and it tends

783
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,640
to wear down more quickly. Now there are several other factors besides the status of the meniscus

784
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:24,040
that leads to loss of that articular cartilage, that hard cartilage that coats the end of the bones.

785
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,960
But when people end up losing that coating of hard cartilage on the end of the bones in the joint,

786
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,200
that's the cartilage that we really care about because losing that will lead to swelling and

787
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,240
pain and difficulty walking and feelings of instability and all the things that slow people

788
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,800
down as they're trying to live a long life. And that's where their health span and their

789
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,680
lifespan starts separating. As you know, you've taught me this whole concept about lifespan and

790
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,680
health span, but that's where it starts separating when that articular cartilage starts wearing down.

791
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,840
Now I tell all my patients, everyone's going to lose their hard cartilage. That's not an if,

792
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,920
it's a matter of when. And we all want to lose ours when we're 150 years old. And the things that

793
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:13,400
influence that are genetics, exposure to injury, trauma, but also things that are modifiable,

794
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,520
your weight, your exercise, things that really tend to help. And so when people have knee

795
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:25,000
replacement, the plastic that's put in between is really again for stability and to distribute some

796
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,560
force and to hold the knee in place. And they're different designs with... Is it still ultra

797
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,360
limo like the weight polyethylene? It is polyethylene that's used in hips. There's

798
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:39,400
more cross-link polyethylene to resist wear. The knee replacements tend to fail because of

799
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,640
loosening of the prosthetic from the bone. And one of the things that can lead to loosening is

800
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,920
particulate wear causing inflammation leading to a cascade that eventually results in failure of the

801
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:58,280
knee. And unlike changing the tires on your car, when you have a new knee, it's not the same as the

802
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:03,240
old set. It's not as durable. It's typically not as satisfying. It's not as flexible. And so people

803
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:08,200
don't have the same sort of euphoric outcome with their second knee replacement, for instance,

804
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:14,200
than they do with their first. What's the typical expected or median expected utility out of any

805
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,680
replacement? Again, it depends heavily, I'm sure, on the age of the patient and activity level, but

806
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,920
as a general rule, do you... We don't necessarily give a number because it does depend on the

807
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,920
activity. The younger a patient is, the more active they'll be and the more likely they will loosen at

808
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,480
an earlier age. And so for the people who need the knee replacements, the longest people in their

809
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,080
40s and 50s will have the shortest lifespan of the knee. And so a 40 to 50 year old, you'll tell them

810
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,680
just to set expectations, you're probably going to need two of these in your lifetime. It's going to

811
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,240
need a revision at some point in their lifetime. But it's a significant difference in longevity

812
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,960
for the 50 year old getting a knee replacement than the 65 year old. And so we try and kick the

813
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:53,560
can down as far as we can down the road so that if patients end up needing knee replacement, that

814
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,280
it's going to be... Their knee replacement will outlast them and that they'll only have one

815
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,520
operation on their knee. So it's not unlike the way you think about a heart valve. It's the same

816
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,000
age and we use tissue versus mechanical, different situation. Let's go back to some of the

817
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,040
modifiable factors you talked about. So weight, how clear... I mean, it's intuitively obvious.

818
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:17,240
How clear is the relationship? Is it linear? Is it nonlinear between... It may be geometric. I mean,

819
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,960
because every pound of weight loss up top is four pounds of weight loss through the knee,

820
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,760
which is walking and it becomes amplified. Why is that? That's just... Again, the mechanics of

821
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:32,680
the knee. So your center of gravity and how that applies torque into the knee is part of the reason

822
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:38,040
why that body weight is amplified. So it's not just pound for pound. So when patients gain a pound,

823
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,720
they're putting four more pounds of pressure through the knee, which is walking six pounds

824
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,680
more with going up and down the stairs, eight pounds more with running. So it's a significant

825
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:52,680
multiplier and there's similar multipliers with the hip and the back. And so we... So interestingly,

826
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,400
bring this up, we've been trying to help patients with these modifiable factors for their knee and

827
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:02,040
particularly their weight. And we started a program in our practice called OrthoHealth,

828
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,800
which is based off a lot of the work you do. And I don't know if you've ever seen the webinar I

829
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,240
give, but you're sort of an all-star in the webinar and so is Lin. But we're trying to help patients

830
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:16,280
sleep better, trying to help them manage their stress better, try and help them eat better,

831
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:22,440
and try to help them exercise more efficiently. I think people exercise way too much trying to get

832
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,200
it all in, burn all... They have a concept of burning all the calories as opposed to sort of

833
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,320
activating their metabolism. And so we're trying with this group of patients who are typically

834
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,760
overweight, BMI over 30, 35, 40, they're pretty ill patients. They're not just their knee that's

835
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,200
bothering them and trying to get them to turn their lives around a little bit.

836
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:45,960
So from an activity standpoint, is all things equal running harder on the knee than any other

837
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:51,400
activity a patient does? It is harder and puts more strain on it. But the body reacts to this.

838
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,120
There's, I think it's called Wolf's Law, where the body reacts to stress. So the more stress

839
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,800
that's put on it, the more bone that's laid down for instance. That's why we emphasize weight-bearing

840
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,840
exercise for patients in their 30s in particular before they start losing bone so that they can

841
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,320
build up their bone density. And so the body reacts. When do you lose the ability to increase

842
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:15,480
bone density through that activity? It's usually around 30 and women have an accelerated bone loss

843
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:21,320
in menopause. So the bone building is occurring through the first couple of decades of life and

844
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:28,440
then from then on it's down. But there's a big, big decrease during menopause in bone density for

845
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,200
women. And that's where pharmacotherapy is directed. Yeah, so all the hormone therapy and

846
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,920
all the exercise basically isn't to bring you back to where you were when you were 30, it's to slow

847
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:46,680
it down. Because it's an inevitable decline. What is driving that? Is it osteoclastic?

848
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,960
Well, it has to be to some degree because the osteoclasts are what are the cells that

849
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:57,240
resort bone. But how well understood is the why? Like what's the evolutionary reason that we would,

850
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,320
we're not short of any of the minerals that are in bone. We could certainly get them exogenously.

851
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,960
Why in the world would we just decide to enter a catabolic state at the age of 30?

852
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:11,080
I don't have a clue. And I don't know whether for women it's childbearing and building the skeleton

853
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,520
of the fetus. Certainly there's a transient osteopenia of pregnancy that occurs. But I don't

854
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:21,000
have the famous clue. And those are, that's a fantastic question that people are trying to

855
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,120
answer. And, you know, pharmacologically, we try and slow down the osteoclastic function, we try and

856
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,680
slow down the speed at which the osteoclastic bones are bone. I use that term technically,

857
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,960
I shouldn't have, I should have defined it. So osteoclastic is breaking down of bone,

858
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,880
osteoblastic is the building up of bone. And they're the cells that do that. Yeah.

859
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,320
And so the osteoclasts get inhibited by some of the pharmacotherapies, the fosomax,

860
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:49,720
boneva, the bisphosphonates that slow down and quote unquote build bone density. But it's not

861
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,480
necessarily building great bone. And so it's building denser bone, but there's concerns that

862
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:00,680
there may be fault lines in the bone that it may not necessarily be more torsionally resistant.

863
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,360
It's not more tension resistant. So you see tension side of failure of bone with

864
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,080
prolonged use of bisphosphonates. And so those are some of the atypical femur fractures that you see.

865
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,640
People get foot fractures with this. So it's not going to be the answer just inhibiting osteoclasts

866
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:18,680
to build healthier bone or to slow down the process of bone resorption. And is there

867
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,800
anything that's in the pipeline pharmacologically with respect to activating osteoblasts?

868
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:29,720
Great question. Most of it is focused on osteoclastic inhibition. And there are

869
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:35,320
thoughts about bumping up osteoblastic production with magnetic fields. And that's what's the

870
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,400
technology behind bone stimulators for when patients have hard to heal fractures, you can

871
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,120
use a bone stimulator, which is an electromagnetic field that seems to be stimulating to the

872
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:49,560
osteoblasts. But there's always concern that when you stimulate the osteoblasts, that you may be

873
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,880
provoking a cancer type situation, because you don't necessarily know where you're directing them.

874
01:13:53,880 --> 01:14:01,160
Right. And so we don't use these bone stimulators in patients with cancer. We purposely avoid that

875
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,600
to avoid stimulating out of control growth. So if you're listening to this and you're not an athlete,

876
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,200
so many are like most of us, you're just your sport is life at this point, you exercise mainly to,

877
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,200
you know, help you perform through life better as opposed to playing the NFL.

878
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:22,120
It's relatively easy to avoid the twisting injuries, but it's these repetitive strain

879
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,640
injuries, you know, the person who's riding the bike that doesn't have their pedals and their

880
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,200
cleats fully attuned correctly or they're running, but they're doing it so inefficiently or

881
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,200
God, I see people that ride, you know, spend hours on ellipticals and their hips are jacked

882
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:39,400
because they're just in a lousy position. Is that the case or is that just my bias that I see towards

883
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,480
it? I mean, are you still seeing people our age that show up? Like, is it just as common to see

884
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,880
the guy who's playing pickup basketball and still tears his ACL through a torsional injury?

885
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,400
No, I share your bias. I do think people exercise incorrectly and I think part of it is because

886
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:59,560
there seems to be such an emphasis on volume of exercise and the volume of exercise and intensity

887
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:06,360
or not intensity, but getting in your volume of exercise within an hour because of your sedentary

888
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:13,240
lifestyle for the other 23. I think that is what leads people to injury. They do too much repetition

889
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,200
with poor form, like you're saying, exposing themselves to injury. So there's no question

890
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:23,960
that repetitive bad form will lead to injury. And especially under load. Correct. And then if

891
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,640
you have a torsional, if you just happen to be playing hoops and you happen to put your foot

892
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,880
down on a wet piece of turf or on someone's ankle and your knee twists, I mean, those are sort of

893
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:37,960
freak accidents that can occur at any point. And if you want to keep it as safe as possible and as

894
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:42,600
helpful as possible, then you should walk. I mean, walking will give you the cardiovascular benefits

895
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,080
that most exercises, most any other exercise will. I think the Harvard School of Public Health

896
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:53,080
has done an awful lot of work at looking at walking and cardiovascular risk and near 30 to 40% risk

897
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:57,480
reduction with walking. Yeah, I mean, you won't find many people that are more critical of the

898
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,400
Harvard School of Public Health. It's a little school back east. I don't know the answer. My

899
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,640
intuition is that those studies are so biased by the people who have the luxury of being able to

900
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,200
walk. Like in other words, there may be too many healthy user biases within those studies.

901
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,320
I think unfortunately to get to do long term clinical trials with randomization here is going

902
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,480
to pose a huge problem. It's not going to happen. So we are stuck with I think some combination of

903
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,680
short term clinical studies that can show us measurable changes in short terms coupled with

904
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:36,760
I think trying to do better epidemiology, which is that's sort of like saying trying to make

905
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:42,040
toilet water taste a little bit better. But yeah, I think I struggle with this. I mean,

906
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:47,240
yeah, my view is and again, it's so unlike me to say this because it's so sort of hand wavy

907
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:54,600
bullshitty. But I really do think that there is the less time you are sitting around the better.

908
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:01,000
And I think in part it's not just the benefit you get from walking around. It's the damage that's

909
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,440
done by shortening the hamstrings, by tightening the so and the hip flexors like that stuff starts

910
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,960
to translate into these other things that set you up for orthopedic failure when you actually

911
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,920
are doing your one hour of activity or whatever it is.

912
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,200
Very well put. So when you have, again, primarily sedentary life, but you're trying to make up for

913
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:25,320
that with one hour of exercise or two hours of exercise, I think that's the setup that leads

914
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:31,400
people to injury. Yet people have jobs and families to provide for and they are sitting

915
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,960
around and so then how can you get a moving more consistently through the day? I do think that that

916
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:41,640
sort of consistent movement is what leads to better orthopedic musculoskeletal health. And it's not

917
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:47,320
necessarily having to do an hour of exercise a day. I think it's more generalized movement for

918
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,120
the majority of hours of the day. So I couldn't agree with you more. And I don't want to get into

919
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:57,320
a thing with you of all people about any sort of epidemiologic study, but I don't see a lot of

920
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,320
patients coming to me who've injured themselves walking. And I do see a lot.

921
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,080
Oh, yeah, no, that I totally agree with. I think my question is, I guess I'm not at a point yet

922
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:09,720
where I know enough, even though this is a very high priority for me to understand this, can

923
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:15,080
walking be sufficient from a cardiovascular standpoint? In other words, if you told somebody

924
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,000
all you got to do is lift weights and walk, but you can skip any of the high intensity training.

925
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,280
You can skip doing your Tabata's and med ball slams or, you know, Peloton stuff like that.

926
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,520
There's like a type of exercise that's still in the middle of those. I'm still trying to,

927
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,080
I think, come to grips with what the relative physiologic benefits are. Because the way I think

928
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,800
about exercise and like all things, there's a Venn diagram, but there are certain exercises

929
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,600
that we are doing where the emphasis is on the exoskeleton. So maintaining muscle mass,

930
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,560
maintaining functional movement, maintaining bone density and doing so free of pain. And then there

931
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,560
are some aspects of exercise, as you alluded to, where really what we're doing is talking about

932
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,040
physiologic benefits. We're talking about what it's doing to the microvascular, what it's

933
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,920
potentially doing to the mitochondria, what it's doing with other hormones, for example,

934
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,680
BDNF and the role that that plays in the brain. I mean, that I think you can make a pretty

935
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:10,200
compelling case that there is no intervention that has shown a larger impact in mitigating

936
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,440
cognitive decline than exercise. And all avenues seem to flow through BDNF and increased microvascular

937
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:21,400
composure. So those are kind of like what I put in this sort of exercise to reduce the risk of

938
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,960
disease versus exercise to increase health span. And then of course, the sweet spot is when they

939
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,600
overlap. But then the question is where do they not? This is actually probably the thing I think

940
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,680
about the most in my free time. Is that pretty good question? Yeah. So I try and ask the

941
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,520
octogenarians that I see in my practice who look like they're in pretty good health, who get around

942
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,240
pretty well. And you know, what's the secret? I ask as many of the older people as I can,

943
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:48,360
what's the secret? How'd you do it? And totally see you doing this. And, you know, commonly,

944
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,720
they not saying some people say, I have been working out every single day of my life.

945
01:19:54,440 --> 01:20:00,920
Some people say I make all my meals. Some people say I just go for a walk. And there's probably

946
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,760
such a, you know, everybody probably has their fingerprint or their metabolic foot fingerprint

947
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,480
that for some people walking is sufficient for some people, it's high intensity intervals that

948
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,640
would be sufficient to extend the life. Yeah, and it's probably a function of what's their sleep

949
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,200
like? What's their act? What's their nutrition like? And so it becomes such a, you know, huge

950
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,080
variable equation that you're trying to solve that I'm not sure it's ever going to be solved.

951
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:28,200
I hope it can be. But I do give the advice to patients, because I see a lot of injuries from

952
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,920
people trying to overdo it. That I mean, it really is important to start in increments when you're

953
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,560
just starting, it's very difficult to go from zero to 60 without exposing yourself to injury,

954
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,480
unless you are 20 years old. Yeah, that's an important point. I want to come back to the

955
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,120
joint stuff. But I, my patients will, they're pretty tired of hearing me say this, but I always

956
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,520
say sort of rule number one of exercises, you can't get injured. Right. Because if you get injured,

957
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,760
then you know, we're taking 10 steps backwards. I don't want to put you on the spot, because this

958
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,640
is a question that I should have asked you earlier to let you think about it. But top five exercise,

959
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,920
bad moves that end up coming into your clinic for adults. Let's let's take the let's not talk about

960
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,080
the high school and college kids who are doing crazy sports. But so probably the most common

961
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,920
thing I see is knee pain and knee swelling from excessive squats and lunges. And I understand the

962
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,720
core benefits and the quad benefits of doing squats and lunges. But like I said, it puts a lot of

963
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:24,360
strain on the knee. And some knees just aren't ready to absorb that strain or don't have enough

964
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:29,160
cartilage to absorb that strain or most commonly don't have enough muscle to absorb that strain.

965
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,240
And so they come in with an overloaded joint that's swollen, injured, and that

966
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,680
articular cartilage has been put under too much pressure and it might be failing.

967
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:40,680
And you get the sense that they're too anterior when they do these things, especially on the

968
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:46,680
lunges. I mean, the technique for a lunge is actually so counterintuitive, because really a

969
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:53,080
lunge, the front knee should be under no load. The front leg should be all glute based loading.

970
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,800
And my guess is if you're if you don't know that and you don't have a trainer who can put you in

971
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,120
the correct position, you end up being too far forward, you're going to load that knee. Is that

972
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,720
what you think is happening without a doubt? So and they come in with an overloaded knee

973
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:13,640
and knee pain from not using their glutes from overly relying on their quadriceps. And I mean,

974
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:20,760
look, most of the trainers in our area are kids who like to lift weights and they have their

975
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:27,240
clients. And so I mean, it's really important like you're alluding to, to have a trainer who knows

976
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,120
what they're doing, because it makes all the difference in the world. But I see a lot of

977
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,600
patients for having trouble with their knees from repetitive squats and lunges that are again,

978
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,120
probably done with poor form, which is what we were talking about earlier about repetitive

979
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:46,120
injuries being a result of poor form. And then I see patients with shoulder injuries using weights,

980
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:51,400
and again, being in significantly disadvantaged positions. And you know, when you're using weights,

981
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:56,280
you're you're trying to the ultimate weight training would be to activate the muscle without

982
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,880
loading the joint. And you can do that you can activate the muscle and not load the joint when

983
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:08,440
you use very light weights, but enough weight that the muscle gets challenged to just even the most

984
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:14,120
minor degree because once it's challenged, you can then over flex that muscle, you can voluntarily

985
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:20,360
flex the muscle beyond. So you need just enough weight to initiate the muscle activation and

986
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:25,960
contraction. And that's usually not very much at all. And then the joints not being loaded,

987
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,560
the muscles being activated, and you're getting a much safer workout.

988
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:35,800
Do most shoulder injuries occur from loading the shoulder above the plane of the neck? In other

989
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:41,160
words, an overhead type resistance? I think so. I mean, I can't say for certain, I'm not sure anyone

990
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,400
can, but it seems that most people when they come in with shoulder pain will have commented that the

991
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,600
biggest problem has been that they're having trouble with overhead, you know, they were doing

992
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,600
an overhead press, and it's usually a press over a pole, it seems like the bench pressing the

993
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,480
military pressing the inclines are causing a little bit more trouble than for instance, the pull downs

994
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,880
and the bench rows. So I think the, again, the joint load is much higher when you're doing a press

995
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:07,480
compared to a pole. So when patients are recovering from shoulder injuries or have sustained a

996
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:12,600
shoulder injury, I sort of generic advice sort of take home advice is, you know, try and emphasize

997
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,280
more of the poles and the presses as you're recovering. So what are the most common injuries

998
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,720
you're seeing for elbows, wrists, hips, ankles, that kind of stuff? So elbows and wrists are

999
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:27,080
typically tendinopathies, again, tendon overload, tendon inflammatory injuries. And I'm not sure

1000
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:31,400
whether they happen because of inflammatory changes, just biologic and age related changes,

1001
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:36,280
blood flow related changes. So around the elbow in the 40s and 50s, I see, you know,

1002
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:41,800
endless it seems like epicondylitis, which is tendonitis around the forearm muscles that flex

1003
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,800
your wrist and straighten your hand or bend your wrist and curl your hand. And those tendinopathies,

1004
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:54,360
whether they currently wrist, the shoulder, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, I'm absolutely certain

1005
01:24:54,360 --> 01:25:01,000
have the same biologic mechanism. And I do think the blood flow to these tendons as they decline

1006
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,920
between the fourth and fifth decade of life, that loss of blood flow, that loss of reparative

1007
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:14,840
mechanism is what leads to this sort of, again, uniform biologic problem in these very joints.

1008
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,920
So I don't consider elbow lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow, golfer's elbow that much different

1009
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,560
from shoulder tendonitis or impingement or that much different from patella tendonitis or achilles

1010
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,880
tendonitis. From a biologic standpoint, I'm pretty certain they're exactly the same thing.

1011
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,320
And I think, again, the common pathway is probably loss of microvascular to the tendons.

1012
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,320
What about ankles?

1013
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:42,840
Well, ankles. So ankles, again, it's usually the achilles tendon. That's the key to the foot.

1014
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,720
It's the achilles tendon. That's the key with the foot. The most common sort of acquired

1015
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,760
problem is poster tubialis tendon deficiency where there's attenuation and stretch of the

1016
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:58,040
poster tubialis tendon. And that's the tendon that supports the arch. And over time, that

1017
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:02,520
just starts getting stretched out, as you can imagine. It's a mechanical issue. And unless it

1018
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,440
can keep itself in prime shape, it's going to stretch out over time just due to the forces that

1019
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,520
it's under. And when it does, the foot starts changing shape. The foot starts changing how it

1020
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:17,640
loads. And pain is the most frequent presenting problem with a poster tubialis tendon deficiency.

1021
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:22,360
And you can help support that with orthotics. There are some very complex foot reconstructions

1022
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,360
that can be done to help reconstruct the foot in such a way that the poster tubialis tendon isn't

1023
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,680
playing as much of a role. But you know, those are difficult reconstructions to undergo. You're

1024
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:36,520
non-weight bearing for six weeks strictly, and then gradually weight bearing. You're taking a

1025
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,480
big chunk out of your life. And you're definitely knocking yourself down to build yourself back up

1026
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:46,040
again. And whenever you do that, there's always a risk that you knock yourself down and you don't

1027
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:51,000
bounce. That's the problem with a lot of the surgeries that we do is that we do set people

1028
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,400
back. And not every single person is going to bounce back better than what they started. And

1029
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,560
that's sort of the challenge and the difficulty. And what about the hip? It's a simpler joint in

1030
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,680
the sense that it's a ball and socket. So it tends to just wear down, not to oversimplify it. Now,

1031
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,680
there are some muscles around the hip that act like that we're much more familiar with because of

1032
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,000
the accessibility of it, like the rotator cuff. So a lot of the abductor muscles around the hip

1033
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,240
can act like a rotator cuff does in the shoulder. But because of the, again, the weight bearing

1034
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:23,160
nature of the hip, the congruency of the hip, it tends to just wear down and that labral cartilage,

1035
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,800
which is the soft cartilage of the hip can get frayed, but it's the articular cartilage that

1036
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,040
really makes a difference. Now, there are some conditions around the hip that we can change the

1037
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:37,320
natural history to. It seems that we can, where we can reshape the hip a bit so it's not banging

1038
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:42,600
into itself as much. That's called femoracetabular impingement. And that seems to be a place where

1039
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:48,520
we can make a difference in terms of long-term outcomes of those patients by reshaping the hip

1040
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:53,160
to some degree. And, you know, labral tears, I think the jury's out a bit. It strikes me as one

1041
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:57,560
of those things that's sort of a little bit like lumbar disc herniation where someone can have hip

1042
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,880
pain. You do an MRI, they've got a labral tear. You're no further ahead than you were before. You

1043
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,520
don't know if that's the cause, right? You're exactly right. So you and I can go on an MRI scan

1044
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:11,960
and both of our hips are incredibly likely, 90% likely to have labral tearing on MR. And you put

1045
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,640
a 20 year old in there and it's not 90%, but it's about 80%. So the odds are that high, it's very

1046
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:22,600
high. So you're going to see some sort of labral malady on an MRI and nearly everybody put in. So

1047
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,440
then you're basically right where you started from. You don't know much more than what you did.

1048
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,600
So a lot of people will be given the test of time. They'll be put into physical therapy.

1049
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:36,200
They'll see if this remains an issue. And for those people who fall out, then some type of

1050
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,280
correction can be helpful. But again, you know, our experience with the meniscus is kind of a

1051
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:46,520
good example of that where, you know, having a meniscus injury on MRI is essentially, you know,

1052
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,320
in a 40 or 50 year old isn't very meaningful. It's much more meaningful that if you suspect

1053
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:56,280
there's a meniscus that the patient hasn't been able to sort of write it on their own. They haven't

1054
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:01,160
been able to use physical therapy or time to their advantage to get their knee right. And then those

1055
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,760
people will typically benefit a lot from a procedure. Let's talk about this in a little bit

1056
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:11,400
more detail. So this is still a kind of controversial area or is the controversy within the, you know,

1057
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,480
esteemed orthopedic surgery community no longer a controversy, but it's taking a while to trickle

1058
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:20,680
down to the rest of us. So no, I mean, it's a funny topic. So Gina Colada wrote that article

1059
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,920
about how surgeons are addicted to use the surgery. I don't know if you saw that. Oh, I saw it. I mean,

1060
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:30,280
I'm going to reserve my comments. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's fine. But she's a little

1061
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:35,320
off base on this one in particular. It's not the only thing she's off base on. Right, right, right.

1062
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:39,720
So there was a paper that my buddy did. He said, watch you Rob Brophy. He's a very accomplished

1063
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:44,920
researcher and he's great surgeon, great doc. And they did a study that was published in the New

1064
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:50,200
England Journal regarding physical therapy versus surgery for meniscus tears. And the punch line

1065
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:54,840
was that there's no difference between physical therapy and surgery. And so Gina Colada interprets

1066
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,400
that as, hey, it doesn't matter whether you do surgery or therapy. So why are we doing surgery

1067
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,560
at all? We should just do therapy for everybody. Well, turns out in one of the arms of the physical

1068
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:08,440
therapy group, there was a crossover to surgery for those patients who weren't getting better,

1069
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:13,000
but it was an intention to treat models. So they were still counted. They were still counted. Yep.

1070
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,720
They were still counted as physical therapy. So the take home message of the study wasn't,

1071
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,920
hey, it doesn't matter if you do therapy or surgery, it'll end up in the same place.

1072
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,440
It's more, hey, look, it's reasonable to try. It's reasonable to try both. Just to start with

1073
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,280
physical therapy and start conservatively, but don't, you know, there are a subset of patients

1074
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,560
that will benefit from crossing over. That's exactly right. That's exactly the message. And

1075
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,560
that's exactly what I tell my patients. They look, you have a meniscus injury. Odds are,

1076
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,720
it's probably going to get better with therapy and time and you should play those odds. If however,

1077
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,640
the odds aren't in your favor and you start having pain or you continue that pain and you're

1078
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,520
not getting any better in a month, it's go up your knee, take care of your meniscus.

1079
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,920
What year was that paper? That was pretty recent. 2016. Yeah. Okay. We'll make sure we link to that

1080
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,400
paper because I think it'll be good for people to see it. Again, we can go back and look, but do

1081
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,080
you remember off the top of your head or even, nevermind that, just clinically, what do you say

1082
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,000
to patients is how long a period of time do you want to give them on the conservative approach

1083
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,200
before you cross over? So I usually give about a month or two, but when patients come in a month

1084
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,800
later saying, yeah, I'm feeling a little better. I'll keep riding it out. Right. And even though

1085
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,440
they might be just feeling a little better, there are other people coming a month later,

1086
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:19,480
feel a lot better. I remember working with John Healy, who was an orthopedic oncologist at

1087
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:26,120
Sloan Kettering. And I mean, he's really taking care of some very, very sick patients with

1088
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:31,560
osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, they're younger, they're older, and he's an amazing doctor,

1089
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,640
an amazing surgeon. And he once made a comment about people scoping for dollars. And I hate to

1090
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,480
think that that happens, but there's no question that it happens. None of us like to think we're

1091
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:45,080
the ones doing it. But the fact of the matter is that it has to happen. There has to be some

1092
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,920
pressures for people to feel like, you know, that arthroscopy is the right thing to do,

1093
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,320
even though the data is pretty clear that someone walking in your office with a degenerative

1094
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,240
meniscus tear probably shouldn't be scoped as a first line of treatment. And so I don't know

1095
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:01,960
what's motivating that person, whether their past experience of their getting better, which is again,

1096
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,000
tainted by the fact that they were probably going to get better whether you did surgery or not.

1097
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:13,720
So that idea of doing useless surgery, the fact is, I see where it comes from. Because we kind of as

1098
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:19,000
a as a group can dig our own hole by making these decisions that are whether consciously or not,

1099
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:23,960
are being influenced by outside factors. I think this is a really interesting point in medicine.

1100
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:29,000
And I struggle with this a lot when you're not a proceduralist, which I'm not, the stakes are a

1101
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,280
little bit lower, and the opportunities are a bit lower. But I don't know if I told the story before,

1102
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:39,000
but this was a moment when I had a realization. So so one of the things that a lot of people in my

1103
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,960
type of practice do is they also sell drugs, meaning they can get a license to become a

1104
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,200
pharmacy, basically, and they can sell anything that's sort of compounded, and it becomes another

1105
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,880
profit center. So you can start to sell whatever it is that you would be prescribing to your

1106
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,160
patients. So you get to make the money instead of sending them to a pharmacy. And on the surface,

1107
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:59,720
that sounds okay. But the problem with that is, and I realized it one day when I was really on

1108
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:04,760
the fence about two different therapies for a patient, and they were they're different,

1109
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:11,080
but one of them is actually quite inexpensive. It's generic, it's basically a free drug. And then

1110
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:16,280
the other one is not. Now I was sitting there really wrestling with which one to put them on,

1111
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:20,440
because of the age of the patient and a few other factors, it really wasn't a clear cut case of which

1112
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:28,120
to do. And I remember thinking, holy shit, if I were the one selling both of these, do I trust

1113
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:33,640
myself enough that subconsciously I wouldn't lean towards the more expensive one, because

1114
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:40,600
I would make $10 on the Nothing Burger one, and I'd make like $400 on the other one. And I thought

1115
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:46,360
to myself, you know, don't be so sure. It's probably a good thing that you don't actually have to make

1116
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:52,920
that you don't have to think about that. Because it's not to say that you're a bad doctor. If you

1117
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:58,120
fall, I think that's human nature. Or a bad person. Yeah. And it's harder for you guys,

1118
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:03,400
because you're proceduralists. Yes. You get judged on this. You get judged on, you know, by the people

1119
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:09,160
like who write about medicine, who like to sort of expose the surgeons as doing things that are

1120
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:15,960
unnecessary, or the $50,000 diabetic foot that was talked about with Obama. I mean, this stuff is just

1121
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:22,280
so crazy. I mean, the fact of the matter is most, if not the highest percentage of doctors are really

1122
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:27,320
looking out for the best interest of their patient. But they're human, like you said, and

1123
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,080
they may be influenced by other factors that have nothing to do with the best interest of their

1124
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:35,720
patient. One of the things about orthopedics that I think actually makes it a little easier if done

1125
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,520
in the right setting, and I'm sure this was the case at HSS, is it's so multidisciplinary that

1126
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:45,720
you have these physiatrists who aren't getting paid to operate, and yet they're still a part of

1127
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,880
the team that's sort of saying, yeah, you know, this patient probably does do better with surgery.

1128
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:57,000
And so I don't know how prevalent that sort of that model is, but I've been lucky every time I've

1129
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,320
been evaluated for a pretty, what I consider at least significant orthopedic injury, I've had the

1130
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:07,000
luxury of not just having to talk to a surgeon, not that I can't talk to a surgeon, but it's nice to

1131
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,240
be able to balance that with taking one layer of bias away. I think that's a great point. Not

1132
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:17,000
easy to find, though. I mean, a lot of people don't even know what the desire is. Exactly. Like HSS

1133
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,080
is one of the places where you get lucky enough that you're going to be able to see a physiatrist.

1134
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,160
Yeah, or non-operative sports medicine. That's something that's been very prevalent. You know,

1135
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:31,640
labral injuries, you had a labral injury, correct? I have a right shoulder labral tear that, you know,

1136
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:38,440
I was weeks away from seeing Alchek for surgery at HSS. What's happened with it? So I was getting a

1137
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:43,880
massage with my bodywork guy, and you know, this thing had been dragging me down for probably been

1138
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,200
four years from 09 to about 13. And it was just getting worse and worse. And it got to the point,

1139
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,160
you know, it started when I was swimming marathons. And so it was anytime I swam longer than six

1140
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:57,000
hours, the pain became really unbearable to which any person listening to this is like,

1141
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,440
why are you, what? Who cares, right? Start swimming less than six hours. Okay. But the point is it

1142
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,320
very quickly turned into if I swam two hours, it hurt. If it swam one hour, it hurt. Actually,

1143
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:12,120
swimming just hurts constantly. And you know, you can do 50 pushups. Nope. You can only do 30

1144
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,120
pushups. No, actually, you can't do one push up when it hit that point. So that was four years

1145
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:20,200
after the initial injury. I, you know, I thought, okay, well, I gotta go do something about it. So

1146
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,480
anyway, so you and I spoke and you basically said, look, these are basically your two best guys in

1147
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:29,320
the country, right? I forget the Neil. Alchek and Neil Allatrache. I forgot to mention that Alchek

1148
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,880
is also one of those mentors. Yeah. I mean, a superb guy, great surgeon. Well, that's why

1149
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,640
ultimately, I was gonna go see Alchek because and also because I'm in New York, it was just easier

1150
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:42,360
to do. So I'm seeing my guy and he's working on me and he said, you know, I know you have a

1151
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,480
labral tear. I mean, I can read the MRI, but he goes, I actually don't think that's why you're,

1152
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:50,520
I don't think that's why you're in so much pain. I actually think the pain is due to the fact that

1153
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,920
the labral tear caused you to move differently. And over the past four years, you have changed

1154
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,760
the way you use this arm. And now it's actually in your tricep, your deltoid, your subscapularis,

1155
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,080
and your infraspinatus. And he said, you know, the recovery from the labral tear is going to be

1156
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,920
brutal. It's you're in a sling for six weeks. You're not going to be swimming for nine months.

1157
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:17,240
I mean, for you, that's a big compromise. He said, I think in six months with manual therapy and PT,

1158
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:24,760
I can get you better. And I said, OK, let's give it a try. And within three months, I was at 80%

1159
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:31,560
of baseline. And today I would say it's hard to say I'm 100% because I've also aged like I. So

1160
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:37,720
you're dealing with the declining curve anyway. But I there's really nothing I can't do anymore,

1161
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,440
like including like any number of push ups or, you know, sort of any activity. I have to be careful

1162
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,600
with certain things. So one thing I've learned how to do correctly is when I do pull ups, which I love

1163
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:52,040
doing, I never do a full dead hang without a scapular retraction. And so I'm always protecting

1164
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:57,240
my shoulder. I don't do any overhead pressing activities. I do a lot of static overhead stuff.

1165
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:04,680
But yeah, I consider that that along with the I.T. band injury I had that basically ended me from

1166
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:10,040
riding a bike in medical school and almost ended me from riding a bike a second time. And I was

1167
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:15,320
again right ready to have surgery on my I.T. band before this same guy was like, actually, it's not

1168
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:19,960
really. I mean, yeah, your I.T. band is Jack, but it's because, you know, the real issue is your

1169
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:25,160
glute meat and your TFL aren't firing correctly. And as a result of that, your vastus lateralis

1170
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:29,880
and your quads are moving the I.T. band in an imbalanced way. And it was the same thing. I mean,

1171
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:36,840
I think within two months I was better to have someone that skilled with evaluating balance and

1172
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,040
musculoskeletal balance. They're few and far between. I don't claim to be one of them.

1173
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,720
Yeah, these guys are gods. And I'll tell you just to give you the flip side of that story, of course,

1174
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:51,800
this guy and now his protege really work with my patients. And that's, you know, so what I basically

1175
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,200
do in my practice is try to find the people who are the best and just figure out a way to utilize

1176
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:00,680
all of their time, you know, close down the rest of their practice. They now so. So. So Josh, who

1177
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:05,160
now basically only sees my patients, you know, the flip side of that is I've sent patients there

1178
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,760
where after one appointment, they say this guy needs a shoulder replacement, like clear as day,

1179
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,680
like I could I could sit here and take a lot of money from this guy for the next six months and do

1180
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:16,280
conservative therapy, but it's not going to work. And so I've always appreciated people who had the

1181
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:21,240
ability from an out totally unbiased point of view. And that's working against his own invest interest.

1182
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,080
The other thing that I will say against this, and this is just kind of me on my soapbox about how I

1183
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,160
get a little pissed when people sort of say all surgeons are incentivized. You know, it's like,

1184
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,920
you know, when you're a hammer, everything's a nail. Great surgeons aren't looking for business.

1185
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:40,440
Right. Like the great practitioners are so overbooked. They don't have to do that. So, you know,

1186
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,840
in the case of this guy, his name is Brian. Brian doesn't need any more patients. So it's easy for

1187
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,920
him when I send him somebody who he thinks needs a shoulder replacement to say you need a shoulder

1188
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,480
replacement. And similarly, like I actually sent a patient up to Stanford recently to get an aortic

1189
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,880
root replacement, an aortic valve. And it was a huge operation. And he was a little reluctant to

1190
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:01,880
do the surgery. And he said, you know, I'm a little worried because the surgeon says I need this

1191
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:06,520
operation. But, you know, he's a surgeon. And I said, let me give you a little secret about this

1192
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:15,480
surgeon. He's God. He doesn't need you. He he he has an infinite number of patients who need his help,

1193
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,680
whether you are or are not one of them. So I promise you this guy's he doesn't make one more

1194
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:25,560
or less dollar as a result of your existence. The recommendation to have surgery is because of the

1195
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,040
physiology of your disease. But that said, I'm sympathetic to this. And I think it's I don't have

1196
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,320
a good answer to it other than this sort of multidisciplinary approach. I think there's

1197
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:38,360
something to be said when it's available to be able to be evaluated by more than one individual,

1198
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:43,160
but that those individuals are working in your best interest, not their own. And that that doesn't

1199
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:50,040
grow on trees. Yeah. Again, I like to think that most people in our profession are genuinely

1200
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:53,880
working in the best interest of their patients. And again, I think it's the overwhelming majority

1201
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,160
of physicians who do that, at least in my experience here. But there again, like you've

1202
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:05,480
also mentioned, there are some unforeseen influences or unrecognized influences that

1203
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:10,120
affect all of us because we are human and may be tainting our decisions in a way that

1204
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,280
may not be fully within the best interest of the patients. So there are a lot of things in

1205
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:19,880
orthopedic surgery now that are quite popular and they've become almost rampant. And I don't have

1206
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:25,960
enough of a sense of their value. So for example, like PRP and stem cells, like let's talk about PRP

1207
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,000
for a moment. So maybe just explain for someone who's listening to this who hasn't heard of it.

1208
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,160
What is it? PRP is a super concentrated portion of your blood. It's a platelet rich plasma. And the

1209
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:39,960
procedure itself is quite simple. We basically take a needle, put it in your vein, take some blood out,

1210
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:46,360
and then put that tube of blood into a centrifuge. And the heavy portions of your blood go to the

1211
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,520
bottom, the lighter portions go up top, the platelet rich plasma is typically in the middle. And you

1212
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:56,600
take the platelet rich plasma and you inject it into a knee, a shoulder, a tendon for healing

1213
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:01,720
purposes. And the idea is that the platelets are rich in healing factors and VEGF and platelet

1214
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:07,400
derived growth factors so that you can stimulate and accelerate vascular endothelial growth factors.

1215
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,240
So another one of these growth factors that would promote growth. So again, the idea being that you

1216
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:17,240
can accelerate healing, you can take the body's natural healing responses and really supercharge

1217
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:23,960
them to some degree or super concentrate them to some degree. So the studies about PRP are somewhat

1218
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:29,080
imperfect because there's so many different commercial preparations of PRP and there's

1219
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:36,200
sort of general categories. There's leukocyte rich PRP, so high in white cells, is leukocyte poor.

1220
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,840
Those were deliberate design choices or those are just methodology differences? Yes,

1221
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,640
yes, design choices. And then again, several different types of preparations for PRP. So

1222
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:52,200
you're dealing with a very heterogeneous starting point. And so one PRP injection doesn't, isn't the

1223
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,080
equivalent of another PRP injection. But it's hard to really know whether PRP is making a big

1224
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:02,680
difference in tendinopathies most commonly. It doesn't seem to be regrowing articular cartilage

1225
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:08,680
when you inject it into a knee or a shoulder or an ankle or hip. It may be helping to stimulate

1226
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:13,640
tendon injury, but that's a very hard endpoint to measure because most of the time we're measuring

1227
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:18,600
pain and function with that. And it might be getting better in the tendon because of the

1228
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,800
injection itself and the veg F and the platelet-derived growth factors are doing exactly what you

1229
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,000
are hoping that they're doing. Or it might be because there's a placebo effect or it might

1230
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,440
be because you're resting because it's pretty sore after you get one of these injections. And

1231
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,280
you know, again, you don't really know the answer why. But the studies seem to demonstrate that

1232
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:42,360
PRP has a marginal benefit for tendinopathies. It's not a make or break, which is why not

1233
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,320
everybody's running to get it, which is why the insurance companies aren't typically paying for it.

1234
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:49,400
And the endpoint for tendinopathy is pain or function?

1235
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,120
Pain and function.

1236
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,720
And the placebos used in these are what?

1237
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:58,520
Saline or they might be head to head of a cortisone or they might be head to head with,

1238
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,600
if you're doing an intrarticular injection with the visco supplements, the hyaluronic acid

1239
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:08,200
injections. And each of these has their own limits too, by the way, of their own efficacy.

1240
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:14,040
One of the challenges with this space is it's so nascent. And if I were going to make the case that

1241
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:18,280
PRP is better than the studies let on, and I'm not making that case because I actually don't know.

1242
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:23,880
But if you believe that PRP is better than the studies suggest, you'd probably also believe that

1243
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,040
the reason the studies are under finding benefit is that they're underpowered because of the

1244
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:33,880
heterogeneity and approach and the inconsistency in patient selection. So I suspect that with all

1245
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:38,200
new procedures, you know, if you had a crystal ball and you could look into the future in a decade,

1246
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,120
you'd say, well, actually, we now know that like a third of the patients we did this on should have

1247
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:47,160
never had it. And so now you've reduced your patient population to a more homogeneous,

1248
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:52,840
because in medicine, it all comes down to the more homogeneous the population you can treat

1249
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:59,000
and study, the better your outcomes are going to be. Now, in the end, we're all heterogeneous.

1250
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,080
So yeah, the better your outcomes will be, but also the better your science will be.

1251
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:08,520
Yes, that's my point. The better the science will lead to a better inference about who to do it.

1252
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:14,200
But so it always makes me wonder, like we're still in the wild west of a lot of these things.

1253
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:19,480
And I do wonder if, you know, will this stick around long enough to get rigorous enough to

1254
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:24,280
actually understand what are the patients that are best suited for this procedure? And is there

1255
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:31,160
a way to standardize and optimize really the preparations and the technique? And where do

1256
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:35,960
you think if one out of 10 is when it's starting and 10 out of 10 is when it's fully dialed,

1257
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:40,840
where are we? Probably three out of 10. And we're still I think there's a long way to go on the

1258
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:47,720
biologics. But I mean, they are the most promising intuitive avenue to go down. How do you think

1259
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,720
about it personally when you're treating patients? So patients ask me every day about stem cells and

1260
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:57,880
PRP every single day. And I think the issue with stem cells is that we don't know why it works for

1261
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:03,000
the people who it does work. But it doesn't seem to be working because it's regrowing their cartilage.

1262
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:08,520
So that's the big issue. Now, it might be working as an anti-inflammatory, it might be working as a

1263
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,400
placebo. And it turns out, as you're aware, the sort of the bigger the procedure, the better the

1264
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:20,120
placebo effect. So the more you're digging, the more you're extracting, you are harnessing a larger

1265
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:26,680
placebo effect. What is the placebo effect with that procedure? Is it viewed as about 15% benefit?

1266
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,520
Because that's the all in typical placebo benefit. Yeah, I could have given you the number. I actually

1267
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:35,800
don't know the number. But I think with stem cells, there is a lot of promise. And I hope it works,

1268
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:42,280
because I'm going to need it myself. And we'll I'll need it. But right now, there are people who

1269
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:48,840
I think are particularly in the orthopedic form, are taking advantage of the fact that we don't

1270
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:53,240
have great treatments for arthritis, we don't have any reversal for arthritis, we have ways

1271
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:58,920
of managing arthritis and maybe slowing down the pace of worsening arthritis. But we don't have

1272
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:04,440
anything that reverses the course of arthritis, it turns your older knee into a younger knee,

1273
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:09,640
your older hip into a younger hip. And the stem cells seems to be that sort of molecular fountain

1274
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:14,520
of youth that people have glommed on to, they have this idea that they can regenerate their

1275
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:19,960
hip, they can grow their native hip back to what it was when they were 20. And a lot of it, there is

1276
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:23,800
promise in this, there's no question that there's promise in it. And the animal studies really

1277
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:29,080
demonstrate it. But for instance, there's a local group that's doing stem cell injections here where

1278
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:35,000
they take a bone marrow biops, a bone marrow aspirate from your posterior iliac crest, they take a

1279
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
slurry of fat from from your abdomen, they take some PRP from your arm, they put it together, and

1280
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,560
they inject it. And they charge five to $6,000 per for this procedure, cash. And talk about

1281
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,880
incentives. I mean, they're highly incentivized to do this. And they will have patients come back to

1282
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:54,040
them saying, I feel better. But again, there's no rigor. Are they feeling better because of the

1283
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,480
placebo effect? Are they feeling better because there's an anti inflammatory effect, which you

1284
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:03,560
can get with cortisone for 25 bucks? Or, you know, what's really the deal? But I don't think it's the

1285
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:08,680
cartilage we're growing. And when they do those injections, those preparations, they're putting a

1286
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:13,720
couple hundred stem cells in the studies that showed some benefit in rats and small animals.

1287
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:18,520
It's about 10 to 20 million. So you know, we're orders of magnitude. Yeah, we're orders of

1288
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:24,040
magnitude often. So I, and this is one story I do tell my patients as well. I had a woman who said,

1289
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:29,080
I went to a stem cell talk, they offered a free steak dinner. And I listened to the clock, and I

1290
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:34,200
decided to sign up for it. And I ended up paying $13,000 for three stem cell injections for the

1291
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:41,000
steak. Right. Exactly. I'm like, how do you feel? And she's like, I feel a little better. And she's

1292
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,200
like, what do you think? And I didn't have the heart to tell her, like you said, that she paid

1293
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:50,520
$13,000 for a steak dinner. $13,000 or $1300? $13,000 for three stem cell injections. So these price

1294
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:55,880
tags that come with it are so exorbitant. And I think there's some exploitation that's going on,

1295
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,920
because again, we don't have the solutions. And it doesn't take a lot of anecdotes out in the community.

1296
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:03,880
And I got this, I feel a little bit better. I feel better. I can do things I couldn't do.

1297
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:08,440
And that's all great. But we don't know why you can't do the things that, why you now can do the

1298
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:14,120
things you couldn't do. Is it because the stem cell is doing what is being advertised growing

1299
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,040
new cartilage? Or is it because of an anti-inflammatory effect or a placebo effect?

1300
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,600
Are there randomized trials going on looking at this?

1301
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:24,680
Yeah. And most of the time they show some clinical subjective benefit, but again,

1302
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:29,880
not a single radiograph or MRI showing rest, reconstituted cartilage.

1303
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,760
And that's with not just PRP, but stem cells exclusively.

1304
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,160
Correct.

1305
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,920
There are RCTs that are ongoing.

1306
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,480
There are randomized controlled trials. Now the randomization process might be a little bit.

1307
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,920
Well, because I mean, this is the exact reason you actually have to have double-blinded.

1308
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,560
Yes.

1309
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,560
So these have to be complicated trials.

1310
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:45,960
Yes.

1311
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,400
You're not doing this in Johnny's mind.

1312
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:51,000
And again, there's nothing that's come through that says we should be doing this at this point.

1313
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,400
I struggle with this. I get a lot of patients that ask me about this,

1314
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:57,000
and I've had probably half a dozen patients that have had it done and swear by it. And

1315
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,920
sort of like you, I have a hard time sort of having a straight conversation with them,

1316
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:05,000
because deep down, I sort of think it's bullshit, frankly. But at the same time,

1317
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,520
I'd like to think I have the humility to say I have no clue. And my first question is,

1318
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,600
is it doing harm? And I say that specifically with the IV stem cells. So that's the one that

1319
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:17,240
I'm most skeptical of. So question one is, what's the probability of harm?

1320
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:22,440
And let's bracket harm as physical harm, financial harm. Like let's actually break this thing out.

1321
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:26,760
And then we talk efficacy. In other words, you want to think about it through the lens that you

1322
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:33,240
would think of drug development. Phase one, safety, phase two, efficacy, phase three, effectiveness.

1323
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,960
I don't know. I hope that that level of rigor is being applied to this because I do feel really

1324
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:43,160
bad. Like again, I don't know how wealthy your patient was that bought the $13,000 stake, but boy,

1325
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,840
that would break my heart to think that that was a meaningful chunk of change to her.

1326
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:54,120
Yeah. And in her case, she didn't get a big benefit. She felt a little bit better. And she

1327
01:50:54,120 --> 01:51:00,440
had a problem that pretty clear that it's a surgical issue. It's a surgical issue. But she

1328
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:04,760
doesn't want any more surgery. She really wants to try everything prior to surgery. And so again,

1329
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:10,280
the do no harm part is, again, I don't discourage when people ask, I just try to

1330
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,960
steer them towards one of the academic medical centers where they are doing trials.

1331
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:19,080
So that yes, they may get a placebo. Yes, they may get the stem cell, but they won't get fleeced.

1332
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,160
And eventually we'll get an answer whether or not this is effective.

1333
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:28,520
We talk about placebo effects, and particularly in orthopedics. There was a recent paper published

1334
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:35,000
in the British JBGS, I think it was, regarding subacromal decompression, which is a very common

1335
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,320
procedure used for shoulder pain, for shoulder tendonitis and impingement. And for patients who

1336
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:44,040
don't have rotator cuff tearing, but have shoulder dysfunction and pain, traditionally,

1337
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:48,920
subacromal decompressions have been a procedure of choice where you shave a little bit of the

1338
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,720
undersurface of the acromion, remove the bursa, and allow for more space for the rotator cuff to

1339
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:57,960
move. And it generally leads to pretty good outcomes as a result of the surgery seem to

1340
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:02,600
be pretty good. Well, I was having dinner with a law professor at University of Chicago, Todd

1341
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:07,720
Henderson. And the paper that was done looked at subacromal decompression versus sham surgery.

1342
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,240
And there was no difference between the shams. Can you tell people what a sham surgery is?

1343
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:16,200
Yeah, you make the incisions, you don't do anything. So, and you blind it to the, to the.

1344
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:19,640
So it's a single blind, obviously the surgeon can't be blinded to a sham surgery.

1345
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:23,640
Correct. But all the therapists and the patients, everyone downstream from the operating room is

1346
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:29,800
blinded. And the results were the same between a sham surgery and the decompression, which would

1347
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:34,760
speak to, you know, the decompression being worthless, except that both groups got better.

1348
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:40,840
And so when both groups get better, his argument was the only ethical thing you can do as a surgeon

1349
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:45,960
is to offer the sham surgery. The problem is, if you offer it as a sham, you might lose the benefit.

1350
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:52,760
Right. So you can't do that. But then you are duping the patient, taking them to an operating

1351
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,280
room for what they consider to be a procedure. That's a procedure when in fact.

1352
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:02,920
Unless you explain to them that, look, the reason we would explain the equivalence of the sham to the

1353
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:08,280
procedure is the post-operative care that you got. It's the PT, it's the, or it's some combination

1354
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,480
of the rest, the post-operative. The forced rest from the surgery.

1355
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:15,560
The forced rest and the forced PT, because you're going to take PT way more seriously

1356
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:20,360
when you're in a sling and you've had surgery. Right. But then, so I will say that the patient

1357
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,600
sometimes with meniscal injuries, Hey, let's cut out the middleman. It's probably the rest

1358
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:29,640
and the therapy that's helping you. So why don't we do that? But you are also withdrawing the

1359
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:35,960
placebo effect of the procedure. I would look what seems to be a placebo effect.

1360
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,600
Now I do subacroma decompressions. I've done them and I probably will still do them because I,

1361
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:45,960
yet the science, that's a reasonable study of randomizing patients and finding not much of a

1362
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,080
difference. And so, and these studies have been done with meniscus.

1363
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:52,920
How much better did the patients get? Do you recall what the absolute improvements were?

1364
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,920
I don't know the absolute improvements. I don't recall.

1365
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,480
Because that's the other thing that kind of has to be weighed into these things. I mean,

1366
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:01,320
people who listen to this podcast have heard me sort of rant about the difference between absolute

1367
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,720
and relative improvements and those things have to be.

1368
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:09,400
Well, they're relative improvements by definition when you're doing shoulder surgery, but it is,

1369
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:15,320
look, I, again, I thought that was a very interesting point. The most ethical thing you

1370
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:20,440
can do is the sham surgery. Let's talk about what I consider the elephant in the room when it comes

1371
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:24,680
to orthopedic injuries, which is lower back injuries. I, you, I don't, you probably remember

1372
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:28,520
what happened to me. I totally remember what happened to you. You had a, you had a caught

1373
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,760
Aquana. Yeah. I mean, I had that free fragment, the L5S1 free fragment stuck in the canal. I mean,

1374
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,480
the whole thing was a disaster. I hate even talking about it. And then you got infected

1375
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,760
afterwards too, right? I did have a little infection after. The bigger issue is that

1376
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:42,440
he ropped around the wrong side. The first procedure he went, he did a left side.

1377
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:42,840
I didn't know that.

1378
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,040
It was a, or he, yeah, it was the left side of injury. He did a right side of decompression

1379
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:49,160
and dinged the right side of nerves. So I came out with a right sided foot drop,

1380
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,840
even though I went in with a left sided injury.

1381
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,120
Fuck, I did not know that.

1382
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:57,080
Yeah. Yeah. And had a bunch of redos. So it's something that's near and dear to my heart for

1383
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:02,440
personal reasons. Cause I spent basically a year of my life recovering from a back injury,

1384
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:07,000
three months of which I was debilitated, meaning I was, I couldn't move. My mom had to fly down

1385
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,240
from Toronto to feed me. I mean, literally I couldn't even make a meal. And you know,

1386
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:14,520
my roommate Matt was like, you know, he's still a med student. It's not like, you know,

1387
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:19,400
he can sit there and feed me and wipe my ass. So yeah, I'm still partially sort of traumatized,

1388
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:24,120
I think from that. But also I now realize that it was, and I've talked about this in the past,

1389
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,680
it was the best worst thing that ever happened to me, right? It was the worst thing that ever

1390
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:30,840
happened to me because it's just a year of being hooked on opiates and all this other crap that

1391
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:36,120
comes with it. But it's also where you learn how to move again. And in many ways, I think

1392
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:43,800
I feel very fortunate now that that happened to me when I was 27, 45 today. Never really had a

1393
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:51,160
back issue ever since. Because it hurt for so long, I learned how to redo everything that you

1394
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:55,640
wouldn't be able to relearn if you only had two weeks or a month of pain. So for example, like

1395
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:01,240
I learned how to sneeze while protecting my back. I learned how to brush my teeth

1396
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:06,440
while bracing myself over the counter so that I'm not just completely placing, you know,

1397
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:11,720
a torque on my lower back by bending forward like little things. I remember a friend of mine

1398
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:18,120
was over at my house and I was putting the dishes away and I put a fork in the thing and I did a

1399
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:23,320
squat to bend down to put the fork in. And he's like, dude, what's wrong? Is your back hurting?

1400
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:29,000
And I was like, no, it's exactly the opposite. My back doesn't hurt because I do this because I

1401
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,440
never get caught picking up that piece of paper. Because so many people when they throw their

1402
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:37,240
back out, quote unquote, throw their back out, it's usually the tiniest insult that does it.

1403
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:43,960
It's not always the, well, I was doing the 400 pound deadlift, right? So that said, you can't go

1404
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:48,280
far in life without running into a friend, a family member, a patient who's really suffering

1405
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:54,840
from lower back pain. And I got to say, I'm not convinced that surgery is, there are clearly some

1406
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:59,000
amazing cases. I've seen some spinal stenosis cases that, you know, the moment this patient

1407
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,960
comes out of surgery, it's like, that's changed their life. But more often than not, I want to

1408
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:09,800
say, and maybe I'm biased in my sampling, patients probably would get better without doing, you know,

1409
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:15,400
a lumbar discectomy, for example. But again, that's now me speaking with a bias. I'm curious

1410
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:19,320
as to your thoughts on this, even though I know you focus on joints and within the field of

1411
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:23,800
orthopedic surgery, this is sort of like, it's a subspecialty. It's its own subspecialty of spine.

1412
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,560
But, you know, look, you're, you know more than I do. So that's kind of go, if you go to an

1413
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:31,800
ophthalmology conference, and you ask how many people do LASIK, most of the hands go up in the

1414
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:35,960
air, and then how many would happen on themselves, most of the hands go down. If you go to an

1415
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:40,600
orthopedic conference and ask how many people have done or would, or have done spine surgery, and

1416
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:44,200
we've all done it, and we raise our hands, how many people would have it on themselves, and the hands

1417
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:49,240
all go down. Because we see some of the very poor outcomes that can happen with spine surgery and

1418
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:53,480
the difficulty that people can have with it. And low back pain is ubiquitous. It's the number one

1419
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:59,400
reason people go to the doctor, not the orthopedist, but the doctor. And I didn't realize that.

1420
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:04,760
Yeah. So it's the number one reason. And so when people have low back issues, there may be

1421
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:09,640
mechanical issues, like you mentioned, a slipped disc, which the majority will resolve with time.

1422
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:14,920
But when patients have neurologic compromise, weakness, there tends to be a greater urgency

1423
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:20,280
to do something about it. Especially cervical, right? Correct. And because it can affect, you

1424
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:25,160
know, people's balance, people's ability to walk, not just their hands. And I can show you,

1425
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:31,560
I will show you, my friend Nick Horrigan moved to London and he was new to the area,

1426
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,280
new to the healthcare system. And he calls me out of the blue. He's like, hey, they had,

1427
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:41,640
and that's what you got, they had, I got a little problem here. And I got this disc and they're

1428
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:46,600
telling me not to fly anywhere, not to go anywhere and have surgery on Monday. So I asked Nick to

1429
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:51,800
send me the worst picture on the MRI that he could see. And he sends me the picture and he has

1430
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:57,640
this massive disc herniation with signal within the spinal cord called myelomalacia, which means

1431
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:03,960
that he's getting injury to his spinal cord and will lose neurologic function in short order.

1432
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:09,880
And I said to Nick, Nick, do not fly like they told you. Do not go anywhere. You go into surgery

1433
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:15,160
when they tell you to and sooner the better. And he underwent a successful cervical decompression

1434
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,640
infusion. And he had a vertebraeectomy at the time and a big graft. And those type of spine

1435
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:24,200
surgeries are life altering and life saving. And there are other spine surgeries where the

1436
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:30,360
problem isn't so dramatic, but the intervention is so dramatic. And you've mentioned this to me

1437
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:36,200
before you sort of introduced me to the concept of asymmetric risk, where, you know, when people

1438
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:43,560
are functioning 70% and you do something as dramatic as a spine operation, you could take someone

1439
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:49,560
from 70% to 90%. But you could also take someone from 70% to 20%. You can really drop them out

1440
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:56,600
with a spine operation. And because it's your core, it's your axial skeleton. And if things go

1441
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:03,000
awry there, they go awry for your entire body. If I have a shoulder surgery where I'm trying to take

1442
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
someone who's 80% functional and make them as close to 100% as I can, I probably knock them down to

1443
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:16,440
20%. And so again, if anything, they'll be a little bit worse or the same, but it's rare for

1444
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:22,280
when you're working on the extremities to take someone way, way down like that can, but it's rare.

1445
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:25,560
In the spine, it seems to happen more frequently. And again, you're taking people who are

1446
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:31,720
reasonably functional, but not happily functional and trying to make them better.

1447
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:37,880
And in the instances where you don't, you can make them all hell of a lot worse. And it's kind of why

1448
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:42,120
I think joint replacement is such a successful subspecialty in orthopedics. You have people who

1449
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:46,520
are 20 to 30% functional. They can't walk more than four or five blocks without pain. They have

1450
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:50,760
pain all day long where they're sitting. None of the anti-inflammatories are working. Their life

1451
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:55,960
is completely dominated by their hip or their knee pain. And you do a joint replacement and you make

1452
02:00:55,960 --> 02:01:01,000
them 70% functional. And they're the happiest people you're going to meet because you made

1453
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,360
them from 20% functional to 70% functional. And you have an incredibly wide margin to improve them.

1454
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,240
If you're in sports medicine where people are about 85% functional, I mean, you could do

1455
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:15,480
everything except swim and do pushups, but you could do everything else in your life without pain.

1456
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:21,000
And you're taking someone who's 80 to 85% functional, you're working with a very small margin.

1457
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:25,240
And so it's harder to get the satisfaction that you can get.

1458
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,720
Yeah, there's so much more downside than upside.

1459
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:33,960
There's the potential. But again, because with the work that sports medicine surgeons do,

1460
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:39,160
you rarely make someone from 80% to 20% yet in the spine because it's the spine,

1461
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:44,680
you can take someone from 80% way down. So I think that's, I'm not sure if that's making sense.

1462
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:52,680
No, it does make sense. What can people do? Obviously, you're my go-to guy for any orthopedic

1463
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:56,920
question. I'm always calling you and I'm always sending you MRIs on my patients and stuff like

1464
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:00,600
that. And you're always like, okay, what city is this person in? And you're always a phone call

1465
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:06,200
away from the best person in that city, or if they're willing to go see the best person, period.

1466
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:11,160
In that one case, we got really lucky that person had a foot injury, needed an ankle replacement,

1467
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:15,400
and the best guy in the country happened to be one of your partners. So that's really nice.

1468
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:19,560
But your connections through HSS has always been great. But the average person listening to this

1469
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:25,080
doesn't get to call you up and doesn't get to say, Eric, here's my MRI, tell me what to do. So

1470
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:29,240
it's hard to ask because if it's anybody that is your friend or family, you're going to be able to

1471
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:33,240
do this for them. But if there's someone you can't help, but you want to give them the guiding

1472
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:37,240
principles of how should they be screening orthopedic surgeons? What questions should

1473
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:42,120
they be asking before some of the more common procedures? How would you navigate that?

1474
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:47,080
Well, I think you alluded to it earlier with your friend who doesn't need the business or that

1475
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:52,760
patient who is having the aortic root replacement. Volume does speak volumes. I mean, when surgeons

1476
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:56,760
have high volumes, that's probably generally a good sign. Now, there are some surgeons who have

1477
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:02,280
high volumes because they're scoping for dollars or other things. But in general, it's a reasonable

1478
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:06,280
rule of thumb that they have a good volume. So let's talk about a couple procedures. If you're

1479
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:11,080
getting your knee replaced, how you know, I and I, this is how when we were trying to find the best

1480
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:15,160
surgeon to do my friend's aorta, this was a big question, right? It's like you don't want someone

1481
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:20,360
who's doing one of these a month. So with a knee replacement, what do you consider the volume number

1482
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:27,480
above what? Boy, I would want it to be 200 for a week, somewhere in that range. High volume is

1483
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:33,880
considered, by the way, creating 30 in some of the studies, which is once every other week. But the

1484
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:37,960
high really high volume guys are doing several a day. Wow. And so you're saying so someone who's

1485
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:41,800
doing four of these a week, 200 a year, that's basically that should be all they're doing pretty

1486
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:46,680
much right. They'll be doing that in hip replacement, you know, between four to 600 surgeries a year,

1487
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:51,080
that's an incredibly high volume surgeon, those are the HSS type numbers. Yeah. You know, though,

1488
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:55,240
those are the people who are going to be really at the top of the game again. And that already

1489
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:59,560
introduces something interesting. You said if studies are considering anybody over 30 to be high

1490
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:04,440
volume, you've already seen a great heterogeneity now in the studies, right? Because there's a huge

1491
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:10,920
spread between 30 and 400. Right. So but I think the volume of cases that are done, obviously,

1492
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:17,560
just asking around and seeing what other people's outcomes have been have been really helpful. And

1493
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:20,840
you want to pick a surgeon who's not going to run from their complications, because we're all going

1494
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:25,720
to have complications. And again, human nature does play a role. And, you know, no surgeon likes

1495
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:30,440
complications. You don't feel good about yourself when your patient has a complication. It's one of

1496
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:35,640
the most interesting dynamics between a patient and a physician because the patient feels horrible

1497
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:40,520
because there's been a complication. The physician feels horrible because if they're even remotely

1498
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:45,160
honest with themselves, they realize that something, whether it was entirely their fault

1499
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:51,640
or some combination of things, something that they did led to this. And yet the natural tendency is to

1500
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:56,520
run not because you want to abandon the patient, but because you can't stand facing the fact that

1501
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,880
this happened. Well, there's a shame that's involved. I mean, when you have a complication,

1502
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:05,320
you definitely feel completely responsible for it. And you know that shit happens, things happen.

1503
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:13,400
But you feel responsible. It is your fault. I mean, you can't get around that. And you sometimes want

1504
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:18,040
to cower away from it. And that is your first instinct to some degree to just, you know, bow

1505
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:22,280
away from it. But obviously, when you're choosing a surgeon, everyone's had complications. And the

1506
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:26,040
surgeon you want to have as someone who steps up when there is a complication, you know, we've

1507
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:32,200
always been taught, you know, keep your patients close and your complications closer. And I try and

1508
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:35,640
do that. I mean, I've had patients who've had infections, I've had patients who've had outcomes

1509
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:40,760
that weren't expected. And they're the ones that I obviously remember the most, I can't help it,

1510
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:45,800
there's an emotional component to it. But I try and be available in every possible way that I can

1511
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:51,880
be both emotionally, being able to just call me text me directly. And I don't like to put barriers

1512
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:57,800
between my patients in the beginning. But for anybody who's had a complication, I try to create

1513
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:03,400
zero barriers, I try to make it as seamless as possible. So you want to have a surgeon who has

1514
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:10,280
a reputation of, you know, being someone who will deal with complications. And I don't know how you

1515
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:14,600
find that other. Because there's really those are two interesting traits, right? You're not going to

1516
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:18,520
advertise your complications, right? Yeah. And it's something I think that patients have a hard time

1517
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:23,000
asking physicians about. I don't have a hard time. You know, if I'm, when I'm talking to the cardiac

1518
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,280
surgeon who was going to operate on my friend, I didn't have a hard time saying, All right, let's

1519
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:29,640
talk about the complications. Like how many of your patients get AFib after surgery? How many

1520
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:34,680
rebleed? How many redos? What's your 30 day mortality? But you know, I came from that world,

1521
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:40,360
so I can talk in those terms. But for patients, is it okay to just say, Hey, what's your infection

1522
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:44,040
rate? What's your re operate? What's boom, boom, boom? I think you absolutely should do that. I

1523
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:48,280
mean, and the surgeon who can't answer those or doesn't want to, that's probably a harbinger of

1524
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,760
something worse. I agree. I think most people with their salt welcome those questions are happy to

1525
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:56,840
answer them. A surgeon who welcomes a second opinion. Yeah, please, by all means, I think

1526
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:02,040
that's someone that, you know, you don't want someone who like, who shies away from having a

1527
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:07,480
second opinion. I think that's a red flag for sure. So volume, the humility to answer questions

1528
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:12,520
about complications, the willingness to participate and have second opinions. I mean, those are three

1529
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,800
pretty good rules of thumb. Yeah, those, I mean, generally someone who's embracing those is concerned

1530
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:21,880
more about your best interest than anything else is a concern about themselves and is more concerned

1531
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:26,440
about your outcome, your best interest. But it looked choosing a surgeon is really difficult.

1532
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:30,760
There's no metric. I mean, you can go into health grades and you'll see some of the people that

1533
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:35,400
when we're in the know who we see operate who have great outcomes, who are gifted surgeons,

1534
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:39,320
have terrible health. I feel like health grades should be taken away. I got to be honest with you.

1535
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:44,360
I think there is no benefit to that service. And I, and I don't say that disparagingly about health

1536
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:47,800
grades because I think they're doing anything wrong. I think it's a beautiful idea. I'm not sure

1537
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:52,360
it translates into directing people to the people that they should do. It absolutely categorically

1538
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:57,720
does not. It is a collection. You know, you're just going to, it's a bunch of extreme selection. Yes.

1539
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:03,640
Great way of putting it. And it's like, well, my kids are huge fans of South Park and it reminds

1540
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:12,760
me of the Alper special episode. But I know I'm pretty sure Alp. We'll link to that. I'm sure.

1541
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:17,240
You should. It's unbelievable. But it's an imperfect, there's no perfect metric

1542
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:22,920
for who's the best doctor. There's just like, you know, Tom Brady is drafted in the sixth round of

1543
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:27,720
the NFL. And there are a lot of metrics for measuring athletic performance of how these

1544
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:35,560
guys are going to do. And 32 teams made the same mistake six times over when Tom Brady was drafted

1545
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:42,200
in 199. And they have 40 yard times. They have tons of film. They have, you know, pretty much

1546
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:49,080
every metric you could want. And they still don't get it. Now let's take that in the medical world

1547
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:52,920
where you don't have 40 times. You don't have how many times you can bench. You don't have any game

1548
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:58,760
film. And it's in the best of circumstances, it's incredibly difficult to measure elite performance

1549
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:04,280
or predict elite performance. And then you throw something in as complex as the medical world.

1550
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:09,800
It's even more difficult. So it's very hard for patients to figure out how to select the best

1551
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:16,680
surgeon. But then ultimately comes down to trust. I mean, I think again, there's a big trust element

1552
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:20,920
and you have to trust that that person sitting across from you who is proposing to do a procedure

1553
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:24,840
that's quite invasive, that you trust that they have your best interest, that they're going to do

1554
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:30,280
a good job for you, that they're going to be there when you need them. And so there's a lot of

1555
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:35,400
intuition that goes into it. I know that you're one of those surgeons who doesn't shy away from

1556
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:40,920
the complications. And of course the irony of it is being so good, you have fewer of those

1557
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:45,560
complications, but then you're kind of all in when they're there. I'm guessing the toughest

1558
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:51,320
complications are the ones where they're occurring in people who have lost a non-trivial amount of

1559
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:55,880
function when it's all said and done. Meaning, you know, it's one thing if, you know, God forbid you

1560
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:59,400
have an infection and that means there's an extra two weeks where you need an antibiotic and you have

1561
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:03,240
to be an inpatient and there's a bunch of inconvenience, but in the long run, it's going

1562
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:09,080
to be the way it was before or better. But have you had those complications where either through the

1563
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:15,720
complication or just the bad luck of the disease, they're worse than when they started. And they

1564
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:21,800
can't do something that they could once do before. Yes. And it's very difficult. And it kind of leads

1565
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:27,080
into something that I wanted to speak with you about and the idea of coping. And from a surgeon's

1566
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,760
standpoint, when you have people who have complications, you still have the next person

1567
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:34,840
who needs a similar procedure and you have to be able to cope with the fact that you had a

1568
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:39,000
complication in one patient and move on to the next and do the best you can for them because you feel

1569
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,280
it's the right thing. And that's not easy to do at all. For a patient who has a complication that

1570
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:51,000
has left them with a deficit, coping becomes a big part of it. Our role as physicians is to help

1571
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:57,560
patients adapt and cope with their new reality. And helping patients focus on what they're able

1572
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:04,280
to do as opposed to what they're unable to do is a big part of helping them cope. And if you can

1573
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:09,720
change the mindset, hey, from I no longer can do this because of the complication, I no longer can

1574
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:15,320
do that because of the complication to I'm still capable of doing this, I want to do this, can I

1575
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:20,840
do this more of a, again, focus on what you're capable of doing as opposed to incapable, then

1576
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:26,520
I think you can help patients adapt to a new reality that again, there's a better acceptance

1577
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:30,600
and a better way of coping. And it's not just complications. It's sometimes even without a

1578
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:36,360
complication, you know, the natural history of the disease. Yeah, the natural history can be

1579
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:43,160
just on a down slope and again, trying to help patients cope with that limitation. And again,

1580
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:47,880
I think it's so critical to help people focus on what they're capable of doing as opposed to

1581
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,640
incapable what they still have ahead of them as opposed to what they've lost from behind.

1582
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:56,120
And again, it's very difficult. I mean, I've been, you've been in that situation when you've been

1583
02:11:56,120 --> 02:12:00,360
laid up and thinking about all the things you were unable to do. And now what you were able to

1584
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:04,920
recapture, but some people don't recapture, but still have to look forward to what they're,

1585
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:13,160
what they can do. And I kind of was exposed to this coping idea through the care of a family

1586
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:21,240
member who has a form of cancer that requires ongoing treatment. And this family member through

1587
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:26,680
this illness, I was exposed to a physician at Dana-Farber, one of the leading cancer centers,

1588
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:33,320
who's a breast oncologist, Eric Weiner. And Dr. Weiner was the recipient of a lifetime achievement

1589
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:39,480
award in breast cancer treatment. And he gave a lecture, it's the McGuire Memorial Lecture in

1590
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:47,640
San Antonio in 2016, I believe 2016, December of 2016. And he talks about the state of breast

1591
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:53,400
cancer and research and developments and reasons for hope and reasons for optimism. But he also,

1592
02:12:54,120 --> 02:13:01,240
for the last 15 minutes, he tells a very personal story about his own interactions with medicine and,

1593
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:06,280
and what he feels his primary role is as a physician. And fundamentally believes it's

1594
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:12,200
our role to help patients cope, whether it's with an illness, whether it's with an injury,

1595
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:19,240
whether it's with a psychological, it's about coping and helping patients manage and helping

1596
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:25,000
them continue to live their lives so that they focus on what they're capable of doing. Again,

1597
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,320
he delivers it such a powerfully, and I don't want to spoil it. I really want people to listen to

1598
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:33,320
this. I think everybody who wants to be a physician or is a physician should listen to it. I think

1599
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:38,760
anybody who's receiving medical care has an ongoing issue should listen to this. It's an

1600
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:44,280
incredibly inspiring message that he gives. And again, his own personal example is it's just,

1601
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:50,840
it's tremendous. And his message is spot on. And so I see many patients who are in knee purgatory,

1602
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:56,600
I call it, who aren't ready for joint replacement, who don't have a bad enough, aren't at that 20 to

1603
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:01,240
30% point of dysfunction that they would benefit from a knee replacement, if they're sort of 60%

1604
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:05,320
functional and you give them a knee replacement, they're 70% functional. They're not typically

1605
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:09,960
happy with that because they have to go through hell to get it. So in that knee purgatory, sort of

1606
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:16,520
60 to 70% functional, where we don't have a lot of options, it really is the emphasis on treatment

1607
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:21,320
and management is on coping. Let's take an example of that. So the athlete who's in knee purgatory

1608
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:26,760
probably can't run anymore. Yeah. Well, the athlete usually isn't in knee purgatory. It's usually

1609
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:31,560
someone my age or above is in knee purgatory with a degenerative condition. Yeah, that's right.

1610
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:35,640
I'm so used to calling patients athletes because I try to get this idea of like everyone's an athlete,

1611
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:38,520
like you're an athlete when you're 90, you're an athlete for life. But yeah, I see your point. Okay,

1612
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:45,400
so this person could be a 45 year old who's been athletic and all of a sudden now she just can't

1613
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:51,480
run anymore. Like she, you know, she used to be able to run marathons and now the 5k trot with her

1614
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:55,400
daughter at school is unbearable. Right. And then we don't have a lot of treatment options for that

1615
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:00,440
person surgically and they are 45 years old. So you want to get them to 55 or 65 as we talked

1616
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:04,840
about earlier. So I want to get them to a hundred. No, but yeah, no, no, I'm saying you want to get

1617
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:08,760
them to there to do the joint replacement, but the long, long view is to get them to 100. You want to

1618
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:15,000
get them to 100 and still mowing the lawn. Right. So coping is somewhat of managing the expectations

1619
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,920
of what you will be capable of doing, but also not setting limits, allowing patients to try the

1620
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:26,200
running and allow sort of the joint or their problem to limit them as opposed to you imposing

1621
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:31,800
any artificial limits on them. So I draw a graph where I talk about thresholds and, and, you know,

1622
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:35,480
above this threshold, if you're developing pain or swelling and below this threshold, you're not,

1623
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:39,240
you want to be up against that threshold with your activity level as much as you can be.

1624
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:45,880
And you can modulate your threshold. You can strengthen your leg. You can lose weight. Even

1625
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:49,720
the person who weighs a hundred pounds and loses five pounds is going to benefit from weight loss

1626
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:53,160
if they have a painful or extremity joint. Well, I'm glad you bring that up because I was going to

1627
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:57,800
ask you about that and then we got off and I forgot about it. So even me, you know, I'm not overweight,

1628
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:02,280
but if I lost 10 pounds, presumably it's going to be a little easier for me. Yeah. Things will feel

1629
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:06,600
better. And I feel the same thing. I know when my knee, I almost know my weight by the pain of my

1630
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:10,920
knee. I can gauge it that precisely because I know what weight I feel good and don't have pain and

1631
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:16,120
what weight I don't. But there's typically a threshold. It's kind of a binary issue. And so

1632
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:21,240
again, I try and get people to do what they can and then let them know that they can modulate

1633
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:26,600
that threshold through effort. I mean, really through strengthening, through weight management

1634
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:32,360
and through education. And the more you learn about your condition, your illness, your injury,

1635
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:36,760
the better you'll be able to cope with it. Period. And what are some of those things that you will

1636
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:43,560
recommend to those persons? So, you know, that 45 year old mother who's a star athlete, great runner,

1637
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:49,560
probably played tennis in college, whatever. Do you say, if they keep hitting that threshold

1638
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:54,520
so often, do you just say, look, I want you to try swimming or biking? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. And

1639
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:59,560
again, if people are focusing on what they can do versus what they can't do. So if she's focused on

1640
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:04,760
what, okay, I can swim and I can bike as opposed to I can't run anymore. That mindset makes a huge

1641
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:09,720
difference in managing that and coping with that. And so helping to cultivate that mindset is a big

1642
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:16,920
role of what we do in terms of, again, helping patients cope. It's not a biologic, it's not an

1643
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:21,560
injection, it's not a cure, it's not a Jetsons approach to good health of being able to take

1644
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:26,360
this pill and you're okay or take this injection, you're okay. And we're not pursuing the molecular

1645
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:31,240
fountain of youth through this approach. But on the other hand, you can help people still live

1646
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:37,320
better and move better if you can focus on what you're capable of doing as opposed to what you're

1647
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:42,840
lost. Yeah. And this could be especially valuable if by switching to a different track,

1648
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:48,680
you can slow the decline. You know, one of the fears that I have in that type of a patient is

1649
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:55,160
they stop running because it just becomes simply too difficult, but they don't replace it with

1650
02:17:55,160 --> 02:18:00,360
something else. And all of a sudden they have a really precipitous decline in their physical

1651
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:05,240
quality of life. Now, look, for a 45 year old to get sedentary doesn't mean that much. But by the

1652
02:18:05,240 --> 02:18:10,440
time they're 65, the difference between them having pivoted to a new sport or having done

1653
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:14,440
nothing becomes enormous, especially for that woman because in five years she's going to go

1654
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:18,920
through menopause and she's going to have another accelerator thrown onto it. And these are the

1655
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:23,960
things that really, this is the problem that keeps me up at night. I was leaving my building

1656
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:29,720
the other day, this was in New York and I came out and I saw a guy who I recognized because he's in

1657
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:34,280
the building and he was in one of those sort of motorized scooters. And I was just coming back

1658
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:39,000
from the gym and I was sort of running up the stairs because I live on the, you know, whatever

1659
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,720
fourth floor. And there's a part of me that kind of felt guilty. I was like, God, I can't believe

1660
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:50,120
like there's ever a day that I bitch about anything. When I just ran past a dude in his motorized

1661
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:55,880
scooter and ran up the stairs and I thought, you know, he didn't look that old. He's probably 75,

1662
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:01,320
truthfully, you know, maybe 80. But look, in today's world, you know, that's just not that old.

1663
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:05,240
And yet he, you know, he has to get a doorman to hold the door open. He can't go through the

1664
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:10,680
revolving door, not that going through a revolving door matters. But the point is like, I thought,

1665
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:16,040
boy, once you get to that point, like, what would you give to go back in time if somebody says,

1666
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:21,560
look, man, go back to when you're 45 and do these seven things different, you'll be on a different

1667
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:28,200
trajectory there. And I wonder how much of it is this adaptability that you talk about, which is,

1668
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:33,320
hey, you can't run. Great. You're going to learn how to ride a bike. Can't do that. That's fine.

1669
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:36,680
You're going to learn to do X, Y, or Z. Or even again, changing the technique.

1670
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:42,520
Oh, of course. Right. Right. And so whether it's barefoot running or getting analysis of some sort,

1671
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:46,280
getting lighter on your feet, taking shorter strides, I mean, whatever it is that you lose

1672
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:56,600
20 pounds. And right. And so aging is such a big part of what we treat in orthopedics. And we do a

1673
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:02,040
tremendous job with traumatic injuries and the traumatic injuries that don't involve the joints.

1674
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:06,840
Again, we do a terrific job with those. We can realign the bone. We can get the bone to heal.

1675
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:12,200
We can get people's function restored. The injuries that involve the joints specifically into

1676
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:19,800
the intraarticular portion of the knee or the hip, the ankle, or any of the joints. And we have a much

1677
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:25,480
harder time. And those are the injuries that linger for a lifetime. So a long bone fracture

1678
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:28,680
in the middle of femur, you'll pretty much recover from or in the middle of your tibia,

1679
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:33,080
you'll pretty much recover from and not have much of a deficit, if any. But the moment you have an

1680
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:38,520
intraarticular injury to the joint, it puts you on a different trajectory. And how to sort of

1681
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:44,200
manage that trajectory and keep it as close to what it would have been had you not been injured

1682
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:49,560
is obviously one of the goals and difficult to do. But then also when that trajectory prevents

1683
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:53,560
people from doing what they want to do, having them focus on what they're still capable of doing,

1684
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:58,280
I think will help them cope. Because if they keep thinking about the trajectory they were on

1685
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:03,640
and compare that trajectory that they were on to the trajectory that they are currently on,

1686
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:08,280
that can be a tremendous source of frustration. And so in the end, if they can just focus where

1687
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:14,760
they are and realize what they're capable of doing, I think that's a big part of just preserving

1688
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:20,520
health. And that fall must be bringing it back full circle to the guys in the NFL that you worked

1689
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:27,480
with. That's got to be one of the greatest deltas between the former track of performance

1690
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:31,800
and the current track when these guys retire. Well, you see all those horrible videos of like

1691
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:37,640
Earl Campbell and these tremendous athletes who are aging so prematurely and so difficulty,

1692
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:44,280
and they really have no quality of life. But you ask them if they do it all over again,

1693
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:48,360
the majority of them will say yes. Yeah, it's so funny. I was actually just thinking about that

1694
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:53,000
today on a totally different tangent, but I was in my hotel and there was a silent auction going

1695
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,560
on and it was a picture of Muhammad Ali with the Beatles and I'm a big boxing fan. I remember,

1696
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:03,080
I was up, so I go up my lobby, I'm shaving because I wanted to look good for you.

1697
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:03,800
You do?

1698
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:11,560
Thank you. And I remember thinking to myself, God, from about 1960 to 1980, Muhammad Ali had

1699
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:17,960
about the most recognizable face on earth. You could argue that no athlete existed on a larger

1700
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:23,240
stage than Muhammad Ali in those two decades. And yet in many ways he died very prematurely.

1701
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:30,120
I mean, he died a few years ago, but given how magnificent his star was, all that he could have

1702
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:36,200
continued to have done, his quality of life really began to decline precipitously in the mid 80s.

1703
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:44,600
And I remember thinking to myself, so he was at his best from age 18 to 38. If someone waved to

1704
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:48,840
magic one and said to me, you could have that life from age 18 to 38, but then it's going to

1705
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:54,760
be a pretty quick decline. Would you take it? I guess for me, the answer is no, but I realized

1706
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:58,920
that having never been there, I don't know what that high would actually be like, but I think

1707
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:05,480
I'm just such a conservative person who's mostly optimizing on the back end of life. Perhaps that's

1708
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:10,760
wrong, but it gave me a great sense of sadness to think about what would it have felt like to have

1709
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:17,480
been Muhammad Ali when you were 60 and to realize that you were once the most gifted physical

1710
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:23,160
specimen that ever walked the face of the earth. And now you couldn't tie your shoes. And similarly,

1711
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:29,960
as you said, you look at these guys who are in their mid 50s, who were an enormous part of our

1712
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:35,400
lives growing up watching football and now even ignoring the CTE issue, which is its own separate

1713
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:39,960
tragedy, but just the orthopedic injury that I don't think gets enough attention. I mean, I think

1714
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:43,960
CTE is very important. I'm so, I mean, nothing makes me happier than to see the attention that

1715
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:49,080
is getting, but we don't see a lot of these guys whose brains are intact, but whose bodies are

1716
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:55,160
destroyed. Yeah. And look, I'd never had a brightly lit star like that, but I played sports and I had

1717
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:59,800
a great time doing it, but I'm carrying around the injuries now that I sustain then that aren't going

1718
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:05,160
to go away and affected my quality of life and what I'm capable of doing. But I can't dwell on

1719
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:10,280
what I wish I could be doing at age 50. I have to really focus on what I'm capable of doing now

1720
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:17,560
and maximizing it and in essence, not giving a shit what gave up. And I have to say, even for

1721
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:24,920
the sort of small time, good times that I had with athletics and where it's left me now,

1722
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:29,480
I still want to trade it. And this is like the small time stuff because it led me to a group

1723
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:33,960
of friends and a long list of memories that I wouldn't really trade for anything. So I guess

1724
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:39,160
I would still make that deal. If I could take back that one cut that tour me sale, or if I can

1725
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:46,600
take out that one jump that tour my rotator cuff, I mean, sure, I would do it. But if I had to give

1726
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:50,840
up everything else, so I wasn't exposed to that risk to do, I don't think I'd do it. It makes sense.

1727
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:55,080
And so it's a great question that you ask. I mean, I always admire the way you ask questions. You ask

1728
02:24:55,080 --> 02:25:01,240
the best questions. I remember one time you asked, I wonder what the first human being thought when

1729
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:09,240
they ate an avocado. I don't even remember asking that. What was the context? Were we eating

1730
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:14,520
avocados? No, you and Lynn were talking about health. And I think Lynn was talking about some

1731
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:18,840
of the community health projects that she's doing. And you said, yeah, you know, I often think about

1732
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:25,000
what the first human must have thought when he ate an avocado. I'm like, who the fuck thinks of these

1733
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,880
questions? But these are great questions. And I actually just said this to my kids. I was like,

1734
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:33,640
hey, the people who really make the world different aren't the people with all the answers,

1735
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:38,360
they're the people with the questions. So, you know, think about some things that, you know,

1736
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:42,600
how can I change this? What, why does it work this way? If you're asking the right questions,

1737
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,960
you'll be making a difference. It's not necessarily that you have to have the right answers.

1738
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:52,760
You always ask them. Great question. Speaking of questions, I will wrap this up because I'm

1739
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:59,320
really excited that tonight is my first Yom Kippur break fast. I've only had a handful of these two,

1740
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:03,560
by the way. When you told me that I had the opportunity to join you for that tonight, I

1741
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:08,520
stopped eating a day and a half ago in anticipation of this. So normally, I would easily go 18, 24

1742
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:13,960
hours without eating. But this time I'm going 36 hours because I just can't wait. Do I get to wear

1743
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:21,480
a Yom Kippur by the way, or is that not cool? This is a non-Yom Kippur. It's a pretty low key. It's

1744
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:26,120
my in-laws who are terrific. It's one of their very close friends who Lynn and I have become

1745
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:30,200
friends with. She's been hosting it for the last, I think, eight, nine years that we've been here.

1746
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:31,080
But they know I'm coming.

1747
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:33,480
They do know you're coming, by the way. I did send an email saying,

1748
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:36,440
I know this is not my place to invite a buddy, but can I invite a buddy? She's like,

1749
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:41,080
of course. She's awesome. She's great. You'll enjoy it. I'm going to enjoy it. This is the first time

1750
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:46,200
I've actually fasted for Yom Kippur and I haven't eaten since six o'clock last night, which is a

1751
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:50,120
new for me. Fantastic. Isn't it amazing? It works. Yeah, it does. I feel pretty good.

1752
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:55,560
Evolution at its finest. Last thing before we go, you alluded to it earlier and it's,

1753
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:59,000
I can't believe we haven't given more lip service to it during this discussion, but

1754
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:05,400
you introduced me to probably one of the three most important parlor tricks of my life,

1755
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:10,600
which are the Dr. Bucks. How did you, and by the way, just for the listener, and we're going to

1756
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:16,680
link to it, of course, it's Dr. Buck B-U-K-K. In medical school, you were walking around with the

1757
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:21,960
Buck original. I became pretty obsessed. By the time I was in residency, I had at least five. I

1758
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:26,920
had the Buck original, I had the cow catcher, I had the speed teeth. I still remember all of

1759
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:34,520
these things. I think I had the gnarlies, but my Owen, our undersecretary of defense,

1760
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:38,600
was the one who introduced me to the buck teeth. And I wish I could say I'd come up with it,

1761
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:41,880
but Owen was the one who introduced me to it. Remember he had the bite in the styrofoam cup.

1762
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,840
Oh my God.

1763
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:47,720
Photo copy it, send it to him, and then you get your pair of bucks.

1764
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:51,400
And back then, they were 40 bucks. I don't know what they cost today, but at the time,

1765
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:52,920
for me to go low-

1766
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:54,600
No, that was a massive chunk of change.

1767
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:58,360
That was a huge chunk of change. When I was dropping, because I'd be buying multiple copies

1768
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:03,800
of these. I wanted at least two of each of them, because I wanted to keep them everywhere. And

1769
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,120
I don't know if you know this story, but when I got to residency,

1770
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:12,840
this is kind of a ridiculous story. Makes me sound like I'm more of an idiot than I am.

1771
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:19,880
I would wear the bucks everywhere. And I had convinced the entire pediatric tower at Hopkins,

1772
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:23,320
which is called CMC, that there were two Dr. Attias.

1773
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:25,880
The one with the good teeth.

1774
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:31,560
The one with the bad. And we were twins. And when we were kids, our parents wanted us to get braces.

1775
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:38,680
But Peter, me, I did. And my brother, I forget what his name was, Patrick, he didn't. We're

1776
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:43,080
identical twins. We're the same in every way. We're both now doctors at Hopkins. But when you

1777
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:46,360
page Dr. Attia, you got to be careful because you don't know which one's coming. It could be the

1778
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:52,760
good teeth or the bad teeth one. And I was so egregious in my desire to do social experiments

1779
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:57,240
with these things that the day I got to Hopkins, when we were doing orientation and filling out

1780
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:02,520
our forms, I found the dental clinic. And I went in with my teeth and I said, Hey, I just, hi,

1781
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:08,600
my name is Peter Attia. I'm the new dental fellow. Did you guys get my records? And you cannot

1782
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:13,640
believe the discomfort in that room. Yeah. Because they're so real, right? Like they're so,

1783
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:17,720
like if you're listening to this and you are even half curious what we're talking to,

1784
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:24,600
sight unseen, just go buy a bunch of bucks. And I don't think you could be more amused for 40 bucks.

1785
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:30,440
No. So you remember Ellen from medical school. Yeah. So she had a faux pas party. You might

1786
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:34,840
have been there. I don't know if I can remember. I might've been too inebriated to remember it.

1787
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:41,000
So I had the bucks in my pocket and I show up at her faux pas party and she's there. I said,

1788
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,640
Hey, Ellen, we're in their kitchen. I take the milk out of the refrigerator and start drinking

1789
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:52,440
from it. I put the milk back. I lift up my leg. I let one rip. And Ellen goes, it's a fashion

1790
02:29:52,440 --> 02:30:02,520
faux pas party. I'm like, Oh. So anyway, I had my bucks in later on and I was talking to someone

1791
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:06,600
and I, you know, when you, when you flash the smile, you have to keep your lips pursed, but once

1792
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:11,480
you flash the smile, the look on people's faces is priceless. And you taught me the look. Yeah.

1793
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:16,120
You just, it's, it's the sort of shy koi. Yeah. And then you flash those teeth and oh my God,

1794
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:20,600
Owen taught me the look. I have to say he's sort of the buck master. And then when I would take a

1795
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:25,480
bite out of something like a piece of the ham, I purposely have pain. Oh God. And you know,

1796
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:30,760
Oh, are you okay? Oh, I'm okay. And so Lynn was at the party and she goes, Oh Christ. She goes,

1797
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:37,000
she goes, I overheard someone say, yeah, yeah, I saw him and he seemed okay. But then he smiled.

1798
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,960
Oh, that's not the worst of it. He's at the dental school.

1799
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:46,520
So I would, I got to the point where I would wear these, there was probably a three year period

1800
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:50,920
where I wasn't not wearing them. I couldn't go more than 12 hours without putting them on.

1801
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:56,360
And it drove everybody in my life nuts. Yeah. Because the very first time I met my wife's

1802
02:30:56,440 --> 02:31:02,680
father and grandmother and brother and sister was at like Easter, you know, one year, right? Or

1803
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:06,680
whatever. Like after we'd been dating for six months or something like that. And as we're

1804
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:11,240
driving over there, she's begging me. She says, please, Peter, I know you want to put the teeth

1805
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:18,200
in, but just don't. And I was like, look, Jill, you got to let me be me. Like you got to let me

1806
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:22,760
be me. I got to put the teeth in. And she's just, she's like, fine. I'm not even going to,

1807
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:28,440
I'm not even going to acknowledge it. So we get there, put the teeth in. And her dad is a really

1808
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:34,360
shy. He can't make eye contact with me. Like he gets one glimpse of this and he is in pure discomfort.

1809
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:39,400
He's just, oh, uh, uh, you know, like not looking me in the eye and trying to talk to me. And it's

1810
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:44,760
super awkward. So we're sitting down to dinner. They're still in and it's artichoke is the

1811
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:51,800
appetizer. And her grandmother's legendary Italian grandmother makes these amazing artichokes.

1812
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:56,920
And she's unfazed by my buffoonery. She just, she just, it hasn't registered that it is that

1813
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:01,000
unusual. And so she picks up a big leaf out the artichoke and she goes, look, Peter, this is how

1814
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:07,000
you do it. And she yanks it out with her teeth. And I'm like, oh, I got it. Okay. Let me do that.

1815
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:12,440
And her dad at this point is under, like he's beside himself in discomfort.

1816
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:16,520
I had a joke containing, how did she not like spill the beans?

1817
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:19,800
Well, because at this point we've been dating six months, she had seen every minute of it every day.

1818
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:24,920
Like she just like, this was like, it was more just annoyance with this. And then her brother

1819
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:29,480
figures it out and he can't take it. So he gets up and walks away and he's laughing. And then

1820
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:34,040
finally, like I decide, she says, look, she pulls me aside and she goes, you're not leaving here

1821
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,680
without coming clean. So you can do it on your own terms, but you're coming clean before we leave.

1822
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:45,080
So I do. And her grandmother says what everybody has said when I come clean, which is, yeah,

1823
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:50,760
we couldn't understand how your parents had the money to help you go to college and loss or

1824
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:55,800
whatever medical school, but you never got braces. Oh, okay. It makes more sense now.

1825
02:32:56,840 --> 02:32:58,760
You remember Carlos Carvero?

1826
02:32:58,760 --> 02:32:59,320
Oh, yeah.

1827
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:04,840
I put the box in when he was my chief resident at UCSF, we were rounding in the ICU and

1828
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:11,480
I was presenting a patient and he was in town a couple, like two years ago when he was telling

1829
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:16,120
the story and goes, dude, I was looking at you with those fucking teeth. And I'm trying to

1830
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:20,120
remember what you're saying about this patient, but I'm just focused on your fucking teeth. I'm

1831
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:28,520
like, what's wrong with this guy? Anyway, they are an incredible, incredible device.

1832
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:32,040
Yeah. Yeah. And so I remember when I was interviewing for residency, because that's

1833
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:36,440
at the time that most I'd ever flown in my life because you were doing a round trip

1834
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:42,040
every weekend, basically. And I it wasn't purely randomized, but I would just decide

1835
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:47,160
on one leg of the trip with the teeth, one leg of the trip without the teeth. And I wanted to know

1836
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:52,200
how I was treated differently. And I got to tell you, I was treated differently. When I walk around

1837
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:55,880
without the teeth, the flight attendant was nice to me and she wanted to talk to me and blah, blah,

1838
02:33:55,880 --> 02:34:00,360
blah, blah, blah. When I had the teeth in, nobody, everyone was so uncomfortable around me and I

1839
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:04,760
felt like a second class citizen. Oh, that's really well. Again, you ask all the good questions.

1840
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:10,920
What's life like with the teeth? What's the people that we should do a second podcast just on the

1841
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:16,120
teeth? Yeah, we should do it a video podcast. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I also I would get to the

1842
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:21,320
point where I I liked the way I talked with the teeth because you you you get a different talk.

1843
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:25,560
You sort of have a funnier way of talking, which I love. Yeah. Your essays are a little bit more

1844
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:31,080
prolonged. Yeah. Work around it. Yeah. And it got to the point where in residency I would wear them

1845
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:36,040
during surgery under my mask, even though nobody could see it just because I liked the way I talked

1846
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:43,800
with the teeth. And that's a little fucked up, but I love it. I never warm it. The best part of this

1847
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:50,120
story is at my engagement dinner, which you were at, weren't you the night before the wedding? I mean,

1848
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:54,440
you didn't get there in time. I don't think I was actually. Or not engagement. What's the night

1849
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:59,000
before the rehearsal, rehearsal dinner? Yeah. The rehearsal dinner. The best part of it is

1850
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:05,000
total surprise to me. Jill shows up with a set of teeth of her own. Yeah. And you know which one

1851
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,240
she went with? No. Which were the funniest. Snaggle teeth. She went with you to man. Oh,

1852
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:15,000
all one word. You know, the you to man. That's good. That's great. Yeah. For her.

1853
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:22,280
Eric, thank you so much for setting aside three hours on a Wednesday afternoon or whatever it is

1854
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:26,600
here to talk about this stuff. I know that, you know, for many people listening, we probably didn't

1855
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:30,600
even scratch the surface of some of the really deep questions, but I also think that we gave

1856
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:36,120
people probably a really good overview of this, this profession of yours, which is in many ways,

1857
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:41,160
probably one of the few professions that deals disproportionately with health span versus

1858
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:46,920
lifespan. So much of medicine is really geared towards how do you extend life? But orthopedics

1859
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:50,840
is one of these professions that certainly disproportionately thinks about how do you maintain

1860
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:53,960
that quality of life. And you know, I wish everybody could be lucky enough to have an

1861
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:58,760
orthopedic surgeon like you. My hope is that unfortunately that while that's not likely or

1862
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:03,640
real, you've given people some metrics by which they can at least evaluate for their own doctor.

1863
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:07,880
No, hey, Peter, thank you. I love talking to you anytime. First time I've talked to you with

1864
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:12,120
headphones and a microphone, but you know, we're very lucky to be able to do what we do. We have

1865
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:18,280
a medical degree, we have a means of helping people, and we see a window into people's lives.

1866
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:24,760
It's a very privileged view. And you know, you take that responsibility incredibly seriously.

1867
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:30,360
I like to think I do as well. And I admire all the work that you do. You do incredible work for so

1868
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:35,800
many people. And many of the principles that you have advocated over the years, we've adopted in

1869
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:44,440
our practice to try and help people. And so your legacy and your tree spreads far and wide and

1870
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:49,080
helping lots and lots of people. So I again, I have an incredible amount of gratitude to you

1871
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:54,760
personally for how you've influenced my practice and my ability to help patients, again, cope with

1872
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:59,160
their conditions and their injuries and live their life to the fullest. So it's a great opportunity,

1873
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:03,000
a great privilege. And it's always great seeing you at any time. But thank you for allowing me

1874
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,120
to share my perspective on my profession. Well, thank you, Eric. And that feeling is mutual.

1875
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,600
My appreciation for you is as deep as yours is for me. Thank you.
