00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:20,040
Paul, amazing to be back here in person with you. It's been way too long. And the only thing I miss,

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,180
well not the only thing, but one of the things I miss the most about going to New York frequently

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,180
was that we got to see each other constantly. And now that we don't really travel that much.

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,220
It's mostly phone calls, but we got to spend so much time together and I do miss that too. And

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,860
it's just really wonderful to see you. And I so appreciate you having me here and spending

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,340
time with you and family. It's wonderful. Well, I'm going to start to talk about your book,

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,780
of course. But I think even though a lot of people have heard you on the podcast before,

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,140
because we did, we sat down probably three years ago, I'd probably take the assumption here that

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,940
a lot of people are also coming to you and hearing about you here for the first time. So let's tell

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,260
people a little bit about who you are. What's your day job? What is it you do?

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,500
Sure. I'm trained as a psychiatrist and a big part of my day job is being a clinical psychiatrist.

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,460
I also do some consulting work along the lines of understanding brain function and how brain

14
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,820
function can impact us in personal or professional settings. But by and large, my work is really

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,100
grounded in the clinical. And I do have a clinic, about 15 really great people I work side by side

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,940
with in trying to meet the needs of people who bring us whatever mental health question there

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,180
may be, which sometimes is clinical care and sometimes is just trying to understand themselves

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,340
and the world around them better. And when is it in your journey of medical school and prior

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,820
that you sort of had this inkling that you were interested in mental health?

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,180
Yeah, I think around the time in the clinical rotation part of medical school, probably into

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,420
the last year when I realized that you could really be a doctor and understand medical things

22
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,540
and how they impact people and really kind of be grounded in that aspect of practicing medicine,

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,940
but also trying to understand people's experiences of life. What people think and feel as they're

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,100
going through their day and that you could combine these two things and then be grounded

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,380
to all the things one learns about life, just going through it and really help people in that

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,820
way. And that just had such tremendous appeal as a sort of widely encompassing way of approaching,

27
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,380
trying to be of help. You of course didn't come to medical school in a typical way. You were not

28
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,100
a pre-med, you had been out and working for four years or so before medical school if not more.

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,980
So what were you doing first of all before you made this decision to go to medical school?

30
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,540
I worked for a consulting firm in New York and really enjoyed a lot of aspects of the work,

31
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,220
the business and the financial aspects of it. But there was just something I kind of wanted

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,620
more. I wanted to know more and learn more and be more directly involved with people. And it was

33
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,460
kind of a nebulous sort of theoretical set of thoughts, but it led to medical school to try

34
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,700
and learn more and explore like what might that be able to bring.

35
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,740
So we've spoken about this obviously before, you write about it in the book. There are a

36
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,460
handful of events that occurred during your upbringing, your adolescence that I think

37
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,900
ultimately shaped how you now think about this thing called trauma. You want to talk about some

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,260
of those things? Sure. I had a really interesting course of life in the sense that in kind of the

39
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,340
first half of my life, there weren't major traumas. So I was fortunate to have a stable

40
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:06,380
family system around me and to develop a pretty stable sense of self, which is much easier to

41
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,460
do if there aren't big traumas. And then in the second half of my life, there started to be some

42
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:21,220
very major traumas. And to experience the traumas after having developed an orientation to myself

43
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,340
and to the world that had been free of them was very, very striking. I think it put me in a place

44
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,040
to see, even though I didn't completely understand them, but like what was going on in me and what

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,800
was changing in me and what were the impacts of the trauma on me in a way that was distressing and

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,640
surprising. And I think that's also part of what led me towards mental health. We're seeing like,

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,000
wow, these things are happening in me. And then there's a set of thoughts that come from that of

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,520
like, well, what happens if you experience these traumas and you don't have the fortune to have a

49
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,680
good fortune ever stable family system around you and have developed a strong sense of self? Because

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,640
my sense of self was really thrown off by the traumas that happened, even though I had gotten

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,220
through those formative stages without that. How old were you when your brother committed

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:19,200
suicide? So I would be 24, 24 at the time that he committed suicide. And at the risk of asking

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,880
an obvious or maybe not so obvious question, how shocked were you at that time? Because you hear

54
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,640
these tragedies of someone commit suicide and everybody around says, well, it was just a matter

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,280
of time. This almost seemed inevitable. And then you hear these other stories where everybody around

56
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,560
is in such disbelief. So they're really coping with not just the loss, but the feeling blindsided

57
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,800
and guilty and how do we see this? And so where on that spectrum were you and I guess by extension,

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,720
your family? In the disbelief, in the shock and disbelief side of the spectrum, which I think

59
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,200
a lot of families that go through this, if one stood from the outside and looked at the development

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,640
of events, and what was really going on and what was changing in my brother, he had had a huge trauma

61
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,520
a few years before where he had a very significant medical issue that had come out of the blue and

62
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,920
was life threatening and really shook his sense of self. And he was very different after that in

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,960
ways that I could see in some sense, but not fully understand. So I think from the outside,

64
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,560
one probably could have seen that there were these changes in him that would have meant it

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,360
was not necessarily that shocking. But from the inside, we often don't see that or we have our

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,360
mechanisms of denial or of rationalization that tell us like, no, things are pretty okay when

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,800
really they weren't. And then the shock of it happening and then of realizing, oh, like,

68
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,160
what could I have seen? Would I have seen? I think it contributes to a lot of the guilt and the shame

69
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,880
that people feel. It's a bad combination, an immense amount of shock. And then immediately

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,240
thereafter, a sense of guilt and responsibility and also a sense that if there haven't been big

71
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,640
traumas that, oh, like they don't happen, right? Like, that's not something that happens to me or

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,280
happens to us. And I think we can get into that mindset because it sort of psychologically

73
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,320
protects us a little bit, but it can make the shock of a trauma like that in a sense all the

74
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:39,160
more difficult because we start to feel cursed or unworthy or like there's some mark of stigma

75
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,680
that I think is just very, very frightening. How did your other brother, your parents cope

76
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,680
with this and how did you talk about it with them or what was discussed and how did you all

77
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,480
move on in the immediate aftermath of that? I think my other brother and I were sort of built

78
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,200
in somewhat the same way of like kind of continuing to persevere and trying to find

79
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,600
something new that can make life feel better, which often means working toward achievements,

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,320
applying ourselves, right? Which can be quite a good defense against trauma. I think in my

81
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,480
parents, it was a little different. My father is a morse of outgoing, gregarious person and was able

82
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,600
to fall into a social network that was really supportive of him. Whereas my mother who has

83
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,480
passed away was more of a private person, less socially connected and I think ultimately

84
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:42,000
suffered from a lot of depression without her or us really understanding it. And I think that's

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,760
part of what pushes so strongly towards my interest in trauma is the realization of like

86
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:57,320
all the things we didn't understand or understood enough to know weren't good but didn't have the

87
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,200
words or the understanding to really talk about it and to talk about like what it happened and

88
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:11,120
what it meant and the changes to all of us that we don't have a ready lexicon, right? Or a ready

89
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,880
environment to be able to talk about things and then people at times sort of retreat into themselves

90
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,960
and then the trauma stays very, very immediate even though that immediacy can play out over years

91
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,760
and years. So I think we were very ill-equipped like I think most people, we were ill-equipped

92
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,920
to handle a massive trauma and its impact upon all of us individually let alone the greater

93
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,320
complexity of all of us as a family. Is it more common that in a situation like that where a child

94
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,000
commits suicide and the parents and siblings are left picking up the pieces that very little is

95
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:01,840
spoken explicitly? I mean, I think about the stories in my life of people I grew up with for

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,160
whom suicide was an issue. So I had a girlfriend in college whose mom committed suicide, had a very

97
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,760
close friend in high school whose dad committed suicide, had another girlfriend in high school

98
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:20,080
whose dad committed suicide. And one of these had a very tragic outcome. The one there was a friend

99
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,440
whose dad committed suicide, he later committed suicide. And that was an example of where I

100
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,600
thought to myself and it's something I felt very guilty about because I was in college and my mom

101
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,240
called me to tell me he wasn't doing well. And it was in April and it was during finals and she said,

102
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,480
and his dad had committed suicide two years earlier and she said, look, he's really,

103
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:51,040
just doesn't seem like he's doing well. And I said, well, to this day, I just feel so ashamed over

104
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,320
this. I said, I'm going to be home in like three weeks. I'll connect with him then. But at that

105
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,800
moment in my life, nothing seemed more important than graduating first in my class and anything

106
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,520
that was going to stand in the way of that was, I couldn't go home for a weekend at my mom's

107
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,280
request. And of course, by the time I got home, it was too late. He was dead. And I just wondered,

108
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:26,680
like, it's so obvious and yet I did nothing. What was talked about? What else was being done?

109
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,240
So not to dwell on this too much, but I'm just curious how much you remember in the months after

110
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,240
your brother's death, was there a time where you sat around the kitchen table and said, boy,

111
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,640
it would really be great if we had a therapist here that could help us process what's going on?

112
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,680
Or after the funeral, was it sort of like, nope, we're all kind of going to do our own mechanism

113
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,520
of coping? I mean, there was some discussion about it and I think partly because maybe the

114
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,720
generation, right? I mean, I hadn't been to medical school yet, so I had no knowledge of anything,

115
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,720
but I'm maybe a little more inclined to want to talk about things. I could tell, like, we all

116
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,640
seem not to be doing well, but I didn't know the words to put to it. I mean, we don't in a sense

117
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,880
give ourselves permission to have words of immensity, right? Of impact, of, oh, my whole

118
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,120
existence feels different, right? Like, we don't quite know or feel a sense of permission to say

119
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,560
those things. And then often the reflexive nature of shame, right, causes us to go inside.

120
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,720
And I think that's a primary point that I wish to make about trauma is that there is a reflexive

121
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,680
shame that comes of being traumatized, right? The same shame we see if someone is assaulted and

122
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,440
then presents talking about the assault through the lens of their shame that it happened, right?

123
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:59,600
These powerful stories that reinforce the reflexive nature of a sense of shame that drives us

124
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,760
inward. So we don't have the words for it, and we feel very, very bad about it. Even your own,

125
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,280
you know, even the trauma that you felt as a result of not going home. Like you say,

126
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,800
oh, it's so obvious, but it's obvious only in retrospect, right? At the time, it was not

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,120
obvious, right? Because those words of desperation and of immensity were not being used, right? And

128
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,280
we sit within a social context around us that in a sense normalizes not really talking about it in

129
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,520
those big words or the words of like, everything has changed and I don't know what to do about

130
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,160
that or what that means. And, you know, then we kind of move forward as best we can, but we're sort

131
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,440
of limping forward without really talking about the things that matter, which really starts with

132
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,480
how differently we feel about ourselves. That I think we all felt a sense of shame and a sense

133
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,360
of responsibility of what should I have seen? What should I have done? And, you know, he was

134
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,520
living at home at the time. So for my parents, the thought of, you know, their thought of how

135
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,360
they could have, would have, should have, right? Seen something, known something, right? That sense

136
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,160
of shame drives everyone inside. And now we're trying to communicate and we don't have the words

137
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,560
anyway, but we're like a muffle. They're trying to communicate, you know, while being sort of

138
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,400
glogged or all of it. And we don't know, like, I don't know the words to say, and I'm driven inside

139
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:30,320
too. And then I think the things that we do often fail to give us what we need. And then you do see

140
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,240
that cascade of trauma where one suicide, you know, follows upon the initial suicide or the

141
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,440
people around the person feel so guilty and ashamed that they, their lives had in different

142
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,840
directions. You know, I think my mother became depressed and more isolative and it really changed

143
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,880
the course of her subsequent life in a way they think was very negative without any of us really

144
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,760
knowing how do we understand this and what do we do about it? And I think that's among the biggest

145
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
aspects I'm fighting against of saying, like, look, we need to be able to talk about these things.

146
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,800
Like what's more important and what's more worth the time and effort to put the right words of

147
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:15,080
understanding to, then what happens inside of us after trauma. So you were living in New York,

148
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,280
obviously at the time, I'm guessing this was probably a very significant factor in your decision

149
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:29,000
to kind of take an orthogonal turn in your career towards medicine. Yes. But it's interesting that

150
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,920
it turned you to medicine, but not necessarily to psychiatry immediately. That it was, you know,

151
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,680
it would take a few years within medical school to realize that psychiatry became the vehicle

152
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,040
through which you wanted to help someone. I mean, everybody goes to medicine for the same reason.

153
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,360
Generally speaking, everybody has some desire to help in one way or another. And then of

154
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,840
course the purpose of medical school is to figure out the avenue in which you want to do that. What

155
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,600
other thoughts did you have as you went to medicine as it pertained to your brother or

156
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,560
were there other factors that shaped that as well? Yeah. I see in retrospect in myself what I often

157
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,200
have seen in my clinical work over these past 20 years, which is, there's a sort of bifurcation

158
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,960
often after big trauma. And, you know, I had wanted to serve other things in my life before

159
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,960
my brother's death. I wasn't completely happy with my career and I thought, well, maybe I want more

160
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,920
education. And I had a lot of thoughts about that. And the idea of doing those things was really

161
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,680
based on some sense of faith and confidence in myself. They're like, Hey, I could go do that. I

162
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,000
could apply myself. I could learn new things. I could take a different path and figure it out.

163
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,760
Right. But after Jonathan's death, there was a bifurcation where I start to feel very differently

164
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,360
about myself, to feel incompetent, right? To feel incapable. I mean, how could I even hope to take

165
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,640
care of myself if I couldn't be a brother to my own brother, right? And my thoughts about myself

166
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,040
changed in this way that I now I write about in the book and I think about and talk about a lot,

167
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,480
which was sort of forgetting that I had a sense of confidence in myself, right? And, you know,

168
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,520
I was going in a negative direction of becoming less healthy and drinking too much and just

169
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,360
wallowing in my own unhappiness through a sense of guilt and shame over what had happened. And

170
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:28,040
and it really came to a point of realizing like this is not going well, right? And I'm sort of

171
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,320
forgetting who I have always thought I was, right? And I got a little bit of therapy, which was a very

172
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
a kind of wild thing to do. Like, you know, no one went to therapy, right? And there was a sense

173
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,720
of stigma even around needing mental health help after my brother's suicide, right? But even in

174
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,400
that little bit of therapy, it helped me ground again to like, like, no, I don't actually feel

175
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,000
differently about myself. And if anything, then I felt more of a drive. Like I want to go do this

176
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,120
good thing. And yes, it was a drive to help people, but it was really based in a drive of self that

177
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,920
am I going to take care of myself in a way that says, if you're not happy and you want more of

178
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,960
your life, right? In the way that you see it, are you going to go do that, right? And that's where I

179
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,280
think helping ourselves and helping others kind of comes together. I mean, if I had no confidence

180
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,360
in myself, that I could guide my own life or be worth having in anyone else's life, right? How

181
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,480
would I go off and do something to help other people? And I think that's often what we see after

182
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,320
tragedy is, you know, in a very seductive and evil way, the consequences of trauma beckon us

183
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,680
to limit our horizons, to see ourselves in a different and very negative way, which leads to

184
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,240
bad things, right? It leads to depression, at least to panic attacks, it leads to substance abuse.

185
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,960
It just, it leads to not being who we want to be, right? And often juxtaposed to that is,

186
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,320
is seeing the trauma through a lens that makes us redoubled in wanting to be who we can be.

187
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,280
And our understanding of trauma, whether it gets the best of us and the guilt and shame wins the

188
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,680
day and the changes to our memories of who we think we are, is it going to be that or are we

189
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,400
going to be lodged into life in a way that lets us move forward? And I was very fortunate to have

190
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,480
to have gone the good path, right? Instead of where it could have led me. And going to medical

191
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,920
school was, although, yes, I wanted to help people, you know, it was about me and my sense of

192
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,360
confidence in myself that ultimately wasn't taken away by my brother's suicide, but man really

193
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:48,600
could have been. So when you think back to your residency, you stayed at Stanford after med school

194
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,280
for the first part of your residency before going to Harvard. You think back to those first couple

195
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:01,640
of years, what stands out in terms of what you learned and how one teaches psychiatry? Because

196
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,960
in some ways it strikes me as a more difficult discipline to teach than say surgery. You know,

197
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,360
in many ways, if I think back to my residency, it was, you know, there's a knowledge base you have

198
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,240
to glean and then there's a technical set of things you have to be able to do and they're

199
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,640
relatively easy to mirror. But at least from my vantage point, teaching somebody how to

200
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,160
make a psychiatric diagnosis might be less challenging than teaching somebody how to

201
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,000
talk to someone and elicit information that would allow you to make that diagnosis or more

202
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,840
importantly, communicate with a person in a way to help them. In other words, using words

203
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:53,720
seems harder than using a needle and suture. So what is the process of education in a psychiatric

204
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,240
residency program? There's lots of learning of facts, right? Of course, around neurobiology

205
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,800
and around medicines and around different modalities of therapy. So I think in that way

206
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,680
it's probably similar to other fields of endeavor. But then there are the less tangible aspects

207
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,920
that are the most important, right? Like how do you establish rapport, right? How do you really be

208
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,680
present with someone? And I think that's where the training in the field, I think across the board,

209
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,320
often fails us. And I think part of that is sort of the world, the society we live in in the world

210
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,880
of modern medicine. I was very, very struck and I can continue to be over these past 20 years,

211
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,840
so much of what I learned, say as a second year psychiatry resident, I think we should be teaching

212
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,240
people in elementary school, right? And I really do mean that about like just how we respond to

213
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,240
the world around us, right? Even the idea that bullying comes from a sense of shame in the person

214
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,480
doing the bullying and then creates a sense of shame and inadequacy in the person on the receiving

215
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,080
end, right? And how does this all work in our brains, right? And how the logic and emotion clash

216
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,320
in our brains and emotion wins over logic, yet we're taught that we're logical creatures, right?

217
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,200
Things like that, I was in some sense actually quite incensed at a whole education process

218
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,560
that doesn't prepare us to like live life by telling us the basics of what goes on

219
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,600
in our brains, right? So I was very struck by that and also struck that as I was learning it,

220
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,600
it wasn't necessarily being directly applied in the field as mental health has tried to kind of

221
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,920
fit itself in with the rest of medicine, it wants to have very clear diagnostic paradigm. So this

222
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,520
trend away from describing someone in a narrative, you say, well, how would you diagnose that person?

223
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,360
Right? You know, years ago, it would be in a narrative, you know, you would talk about who

224
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,240
that person was and in at least a couple of paragraphs, right? And that's by and large

225
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,440
gotten reduced to a number, right? And in trying to regiment itself in a way that I think is

226
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,840
overly rigid and serves the field's interest and desire to integrate with the rest of medicine,

227
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,200
we start losing the truth of really sitting with people and being present with people.

228
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,600
And a lot of what I learned about how to be a psychiatrist was about boundaries with other

229
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:30,360
people, right? Which do in many cases make sense, but the boundaries were put forth in a way that

230
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,520
was often about eliminating the realness of presence with someone. And I think that's the

231
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,480
part that maybe is the intangible or the harder aspect of the field that I think doesn't really

232
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,600
have to be that way, right? If we realize that we're going to help people through understanding,

233
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,360
through really being with someone and trying to understand their experience. And of course,

234
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,840
having it be about the other person, but being a real person with them, right? That I did find in

235
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,520
my training process, but I didn't find in the field, which is largely moving towards these

236
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,520
brief appointments and just giving people medicines instead of trying to understand what's going on

237
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,000
with them. A lot of what I often describe as polishing the hood, when it's very clear there's

238
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,520
something going on in the engine, right? And while I learned a great deal and I learned from

239
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,480
some wonderful people who role modeled for me how to be with people you were trying to help,

240
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,880
there was also a great deal of disappointment with a field that often in its training and its

241
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,680
interaction with patients ignored the crucial point of realness of the experience of the other person.

242
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,880
I want to think about kind of the differences between these two programs you trained in,

243
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,560
because you did half of your training at Stanford and half at Harvard, which are

244
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,200
generally regarded as two of the finest psychiatry training programs in the country,

245
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,400
but they have a very different method of training. So what did you find as you moved across the

246
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,400
country for the second half of your training and how did that impact the way you practice today?

247
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,440
Because in some ways you have a luxury of having seen two very different approaches to psychiatry,

248
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,240
more sort of biologic and a more clinical, more of a sort of Freudian view versus a more,

249
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,160
I don't know how the way you would describe the one at Stanford, but it seems to me more of a

250
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:26,440
neurobiology view. Yes. Both of which strike me as having huge benefits if they can be integrated.

251
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,400
Yes. Was it received that way by you? I think I didn't understand,

252
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:40,280
it's certainly not at the beginning because Stanford is so neurobiology based. So the medical

253
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:49,080
and neurobiological approach to psychiatry is just really among the finest points of that program.

254
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,080
And I was lucky to learn a lot of neurobiology, neurochemistry, function of medicines,

255
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,880
aspects of the different parts of our brain and how they communicate amongst one another

256
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,000
to generate our perception of reality. And at times the problems that can afflict us,

257
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,080
I learned a lot about that. But I think I didn't realize how little I was learning of the psychology

258
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,720
of being a psychiatrist, of the unconscious motivations in us, of this rich history of

259
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,720
understanding human beings that is so tremendously important to being able to help people.

260
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:53,900
And it was only when I got to Harvard and Dr. Marian Batarac

261
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,520
was a very good person. And I think that's a lot of what I really needed to know. And then the way

262
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,880
how do you put the rubber to the road of that is by being a real person with the person that you're

263
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,560
trying to help, which I think is the way I approach the field and then the people that I work with,

264
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,960
we approach the field the same way. But we're really the instrument through which all of that

265
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,160
comes and hopefully helps somebody. So that maybe is in one's personality or where you just

266
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,640
realize that when I'm being more rigid in a certain way, I'm less helpful. And if I'm less

267
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,200
that way in a more existential therapy approach to realness with a person, then I can use all of

268
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,880
what I've learned, the neurobiological and the psychological, to really make a difference to

269
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,800
someone. And I think that I figured out through practice and through learning what really helps

270
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,240
one, just like I found my way to trauma. I didn't decide, I'm going to be a trauma person. I'm going

271
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:03,800
to write a trauma book. I saw it was undergirding a very, very high percentage of everything that

272
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,320
I was trying to treat. So the things like that, I think we learned by trying to apply what we know.

273
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,240
And I ended up being very fortunate to have had the brain biology knowledge and the psychological

274
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,600
knowledge, although it was a little bit distressing to realize when I got to Harvard, how little I

275
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,720
knew. And I probably wouldn't have known how little I knew, right? Unless I had had that experience

276
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,680
that really exposed that. So when was the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

277
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,240
published? I don't know where this fits in the evolution and history of psychiatry.

278
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,880
1948, somewhere in the late 1940s, I think 1948, but in that range.

279
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,400
And as you alluded to earlier, the DSM as it's abbreviated is really, at least in part,

280
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:57,320
a way to catalog and create crisp diagnoses around psychiatric illness, correct?

281
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,000
That's what it has evolved to. In the initial versions of the DSM, it was describing in a sense,

282
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,280
the phenomenology of like, what is this particular diagnosis like? What are the aspects of it? What's

283
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,360
felt or experienced by the person and what's seen from the outside? And then there were sort

284
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:26,600
of clusters of symptoms that would then lead one to think that that diagnosis fits, right?

285
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,360
Which acknowledges, it says the unique aspects of human beings, that if we get too rigid about that,

286
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,240
right, we start serving in a sense, the manual, right? Instead of the person. And in many ways,

287
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,680
the DSM evolved as a way of allowing for research criteria to say, okay, we want to be

288
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,400
calling a diagnosis sort of the same thing if we're going to communicate among clinicians and do

289
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,600
research. But in my very strong opinion, that has come to a place that now is so overly rigid that

290
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,680
you now you have this very, very thick book that could give everyone multiple diagnoses, right?

291
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,400
Because it's kind of designed to do that. And then come up with a number that justifies the 15-minute

292
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,760
appointment, right? In which the person has no hope of actually being understood in any way,

293
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,040
because you can't do that in 15 minutes, right? And we're at the DSM-5 right now, correct? We're

294
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,680
in the fifth generation of this manual, which seems to get updated about every 15 or 20 years.

295
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,040
Yes, it's the fifth generation, there are technical revisions in between, but it's really

296
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:35,880
evolved to something that I think is so rigid that it in many ways works against the clinical

297
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,240
care that we're trying to achieve. And again, I'm all for criteria and being able to have

298
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,880
descriptive language and research criteria. But we've gotten to the point where it often gets

299
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,400
called like a Bible, right? Which I think is like a very unfortunate word to use in many

300
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,360
ways. It implies that there's something in that book that actually tells you what mental health

301
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,760
problems are and what they are not. And some of the criteria really make no sense. So for example,

302
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,880
someone who has sort of vicarious trauma that they're experiencing, but not in an occupational

303
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:19,240
framework, doesn't meet criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, which has come to mean like everything

304
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,680
trauma. So if you have trauma that's real or legitimate, you have PTSD. And if not, you don't,

305
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,200
right? Like this clue makes no sense, but the field often views it that way and then applies

306
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,600
criteria that are not the be-all and end-all of the human experience, and then becomes very,

307
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,880
very rigid in a way that I think trivializes often what's going on with someone and trend

308
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,560
towards that symbolism of capturing everything in a number as opposed to in a human experience.

309
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,560
And I think we've gone so far away from the realness of human experience and how to sit

310
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,960
with a person and be helpful that the field has in many, many ways let itself very, very far

311
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,640
astray. And I think that the evolution of the DSM is both a driving cause of that and also

312
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,640
a resultant symptom of that too. So outside of post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD,

313
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:25,000
how often does the word trauma appear in the DSM-5? Well, it appears in other places, but it

314
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,320
doesn't appear in a foundational way, right? Because if the book is descriptive, then the book

315
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,040
is looking to take an inventory of signs and symptoms, right? It's not looking at causality,

316
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,360
right? And that is a problem, right? Because so much of the depression that I see,

317
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,600
so much of the anxiety spectrum disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, for example,

318
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,360
abuse of substances and addiction or alcoholism, right, is undergirded by trauma, right? And trauma

319
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,280
changes that person's experience of life to a place of fear and vulnerability, right? And then

320
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:09,720
that drives the subsequent problems. But if we're not looking at what's at the root of the things

321
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,000
that we're describing, then we're just taking a descriptive inventory and that's how we end up

322
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,240
polishing the hood, right? I can't tell you how many people I've seen with very severe substance

323
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,240
disorders that haven't been helped by three, four, five, six courses of treatment, right? And they're

324
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,720
then often labeled as quote unquote failing, right? The treatment. And very often the treatment is

325
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,720
never taken to trauma inventory. And it is trauma that is driving the substance use, right? It's

326
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,120
trauma that's changed that person's internal dialogue towards something that's extremely

327
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,440
negative that tells them that they're not worthwhile and they'll never get anywhere in life. And why

328
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,960
try for a new job or a new relationship, right? Because nothing ever works out for you. And,

329
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,320
and, you know, this wasn't that person's belief in themselves before trauma. It's undergirding

330
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,360
everything and then it's spinning off these symptoms. And then we take inventory of the

331
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,440
symptoms as if they are the be all and end all. And then somehow we're surprised when the treatments

332
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,080
don't work, right? So, so the fact that we're not looking to etiology, right? And, and I think that,

333
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,120
I think that's a huge problem and it fits with not actually paying attention to people that,

334
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,320
you know, I would get handoffs that would describe a person in a number like, Oh,

335
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,920
who's the patient I'm taking over? That's a two nine, six point four, four with a three

336
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,680
or nine point eight one. And they're like, Oh my goodness, right? We're talking about

337
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,800
human beings here, right? But we've somehow reduced that to numbers that indicate a set of

338
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,840
symptoms. And it's hard for me to see how one could argue the field hasn't been led astray.

339
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:53,000
If that's become the standard. So let's define trauma as broadly as we can, because

340
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,680
there's probably somebody listening to this right now who's thinking,

341
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,240
okay, trauma could be an injury. And if they can extrapolate from that and say, well,

342
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,280
psychological trauma, we talked about PTSD. I can see how a soldier coming back from Fallujah,

343
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,680
having watched people getting blown up, both civilians and soldiers. I can see how that would

344
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,560
be traumatic. Obviously the story with your brother. Yep. I can see how that's traumatic,

345
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,520
but trauma includes much more than that. So how do you define for somebody who's really hearing

346
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,080
about this for the first time, what trauma means? Yeah. Trauma is anything that pushes our coping

347
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:47,240
skills to and beyond their limits. And then results in a set of feelings inside that could

348
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,400
be acute terror, or it could be, for example, a chronic sense of denigration, right? But it

349
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,920
creates these feelings inside that then change the functioning of our brain, the communication

350
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:09,000
within our brain among the various parts, right? In a way that shifts the lens through which we

351
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,880
see ourselves in the world around us. So it pushes our coping skills beyond the limits,

352
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,680
and then it changes the ways that our brains function. And that's identifiable in modern

353
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:28,520
science. We can see the changes in space-aged neuroimaging, right? That shows how the connectivity

354
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,920
in the brain shifts, or even the fact that trauma changes the expression of genetically

355
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,680
determined characteristics in us, because genes are either on or not on, and that changes as a

356
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:48,200
result of trauma and can be passed down to children even years after the trauma occurs. So someone can

357
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,520
have the trauma occur, change the brain, and then have a child years later, and the child is impacted

358
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,480
by the trauma that occurred years before. So these are real changes inside of us,

359
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,800
identifiable by modern science, that happen when our coping skills are pushed beyond the limits.

360
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,720
And our view of trauma comes through this history of seeing trauma through the lens of combat,

361
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,080
right? Because it's sort of the most obvious way to see it, right? Like that person went off to war,

362
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,800
and they experienced terrible things in war, and they came back, and it's so clear that they are

363
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,480
different, right? So that's how we look to acute trauma, because it's the most obvious, right? And

364
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,200
as you said, if, okay, there's a suicide, and gosh, the family members are traumatized, again,

365
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,760
we can see that, right? But what we pay less attention to and less heed to are two different

366
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,600
factors. One, the variables inside of us that determine what pushes our coping skills over the

367
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,400
limits differ, right? It differs by genetic characteristics, it differs by early life

368
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,440
experience, it differs by, for example, how finely tuned one's emotional compass is. It differs by

369
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,400
the chronicity of trauma. So the sort of multiple hit hypothesis, which we've seen that if there

370
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,760
are multiple traumas, it might be, oh, it's the fifth trauma that now pushes that person into a

371
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,920
post trauma syndrome where the brain is different, even though the fifth trauma might seem less

372
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,120
traumatic than the first four, but the weight of the first four are there, right? So we tend then

373
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:22,520
to paint with this broad brush that ignores, right, the richness of human diversity, right? And how we

374
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,760
are impacted differently by different things, right? And then it also ignores that not all trauma

375
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,600
is chronic, sorry, is acute, right? That there are traumas that are chronic. So you think of the

376
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:42,760
trauma of neglect, right? The neglect of a child is not defined by an acute incident, right? It's

377
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,360
defined by the impact upon that child of the neglect over time, right? The same thing with

378
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:55,000
with the aspect, for example, of systemic racism, right? Of a person who gets messages over time

379
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,680
that they're less than, right? That they look different, they dress different, they worship

380
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,880
different, whatever is going on in them is less than. And that's inculcated into the person over

381
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,360
time. And that can have exactly the same effects on the brain. And the same is true with vicarious

382
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,120
trauma. I mean, we are fortunate, of course, as a species that we can be empathic with one another,

383
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,600
right? We can experience the emotions of another person, right? In a way that's connected as if

384
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,280
they're our own, right? But the other side of that coin is we can be traumatized by what happens

385
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,640
to other people, right? And sometimes that might be someone we're very close to, right? Or it might

386
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,720
be a person who develops such a strong interest because they're sort of horrified by things they

387
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,560
see going on around the world. And then are paying very, very close attention in a way that overwhelms

388
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:51,240
that person's brain's ability to cope with that. And then, for example, a person who was so deeply

389
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,240
impacted by the crisis in Syria, right? That then it develops post trauma symptoms, right? And that

390
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,200
person never left their home in the United States, but was so appalled and so distraught by what was

391
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,480
going on and didn't know to divert their attention. There was too much attention to something coming

392
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,200
from a good place in their heart, but that ultimately leaves that person manifesting the

393
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:23,640
same post trauma signs and symptoms as people who suffer from an acute assault. And whether the DSM

394
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:31,000
likes that or not, it is true. It's true and it's identifiable in human experience, right? So the

395
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,680
truth of human experience reflects the diversity of how we can be traumatized in acute, chronic,

396
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:44,040
and vicarious ways. And that how traumatic things impact us and whether they push our coping skills

397
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,440
over the limits is also unique to each human being, which doesn't mean we don't follow patterns. And

398
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,160
of course, the discipline of psychiatry following patterns and identifying patterns is very, very

399
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:01,480
important, but we also need to acknowledge that we're different and we can't understand what's

400
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,000
going on inside of a person without paying attention to that actual person.

401
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,760
Using that example, it seems that at the risk of oversimplifying, there are at least two

402
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,080
variables at play. There's the individual's susceptibility, and then there's the event or

403
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,560
events, which again can be acute, chronic, or experienced by others that you witness.

404
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,640
Maybe circumstances. I would think of that as circumstances, right? Because events still in

405
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,920
my mind implies something more acute, right? As opposed to circumstances, which could be an

406
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:42,600
acute event or something chronic or vicarious. So using that extreme example of a person who

407
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:50,520
witnessing events in the news rises to the level of the definition of trauma, those events,

408
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,760
which are not being experienced by this individual over a prolonged period of time, produce the state

409
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,520
you described, which is to say they are pushed beyond their manners of coping and they themselves

410
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:10,120
begin to internalize shame and these feelings we're talking about. So when you, I mean, does the DSM

411
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:16,680
look at that and say that's not trauma or it says there's something wrong with that person because

412
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,840
they shouldn't be feeling that way based on that event? I think it just excludes them because they

413
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,240
just don't meet the criteria for what validates the trauma, right? Which is interesting. So the

414
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:36,520
book has to validate the trauma, right? And like that doesn't really make sense, right? I mean,

415
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,920
we should be looking at people and saying, do you present with the signs and symptoms of trauma that

416
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,200
has pushed your coping skills over the limits, right? Is your mood chronically lower? Is your

417
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,440
anxiety chronically higher? Are you having panic attacks you didn't have before? Is your sleep

418
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,920
disturbed? Are you more hypervigilant? Do you feel less safe in the world about maybe yourself

419
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,040
or people that you love? Like these are clearly identifiable things, right? And if we're taking

420
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,120
stock, like what is your human experience, right? And has something changed in you? Then the idea

421
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,160
is we would honor that, right? And I wouldn't say, well, oh, wait a second that that happened to you,

422
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,160
but you were vicariously traumatized in the course of something occupational. So now, okay, so you get,

423
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,200
I'm going to put the stamp of approval on you. Wait, would that happen to you? But you were just

424
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,640
so horrified by what was going on, say in Syria, that you couldn't take your attention away from

425
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,760
it. And it woke you up in the middle of the night and you went on the computer for two more hours.

426
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,920
And now all of a sudden you really can't sleep well. And you're fearful about your children in

427
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,680
ways you weren't, wait a second, that wasn't occupational. Now we're not, now you don't get

428
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:47,320
the stamp of approval, right? I mean, the idea is we have to anchor to the truth of human experience

429
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,000
because it's not that extreme that people are traumatized by vicarious things. I mean,

430
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,400
and I absolutely see this. I mean, I've written many more times than I can count on a prescription

431
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,400
pad. Like I'm going to write your prescription and the prescription I'm writing is no more news,

432
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,520
right? Because I see that that person's health or maybe that person I've known for years,

433
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,560
their health has really deteriorated over a couple months of paying attention to something

434
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,680
so intensely distressing. And we've had more, you know, that we can shake a stick at, right? In

435
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,640
recent years that you could pay attention, you know, to the point of like utter despair, right?

436
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,480
And then who is that person? Like is that person someone who's had three or four really acute

437
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,440
traumas, but they don't have a post trauma syndrome, but boy, they're really a setup for it.

438
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,120
So they start paying intense attention to traumatic things they're seeing in, you know,

439
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,320
in the world around them. And now they have a syndrome, right? So we're not doing justice to

440
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:51,960
that. If we're making a set of criteria that try and treat us like robots or machines instead of,

441
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,680
Hey, like these are human beings. And we have to know like, what's come before in your life,

442
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,280
right? Where were you at when you experienced an acute or chronic or vicarious trauma? And if we,

443
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,800
if we look at the manifestations, what's going on in a person and how do we help them understand it,

444
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,200
then we can help people. I mean, part of the message of the book is this is not rocket science.

445
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,840
There's a lot about this. That's very simple and very grounded to common sense,

446
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,440
which is pay attention to what's going on in people and help them understand it. And if we

447
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,160
have an entire paradigm of helping that's around symptom inventory and putting a label or not

448
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,280
putting a label and then schlepping some medicines at someone without really trying to understand,

449
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:40,360
then we often, even the first step we take down helping pathways is misguided. And then it is a

450
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:47,320
really a surprise that the mental health treatment system is not serving well the majority of people

451
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,480
that it is supposed to serve. And I think it's very clearly true. I don't think this is a

452
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,640
overly strong or exaggerated statement that accessing mental health help often leaves

453
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,920
someone feeling worse. And I'm not trying to be over critical of the people working in the system.

454
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,640
There's so many good people that are trying to help other people, but the system often doesn't

455
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,600
let them do it. I mean, you have panels of more patients and you can count in 15 minute appointments.

456
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,680
How are you supposed to understand and help someone? So I think the entire system is misguided

457
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,120
towards this, how little money can we spend in the short term? How can we get human beings out

458
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:31,080
of the equation? Because human beings cost more money to deploy than medicines. We are misguiding

459
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:38,680
ourselves in a way that's away from common sense. And we do often leave people worse than when

460
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,760
we found them. A classic example being going to a hospital and trying to get help,

461
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,400
where maybe 15 or 20 years ago, when a person I was taking care of might be in crisis, I would

462
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,280
think if I don't send that person to an emergency room, that would be malpractice. They're in crisis,

463
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:01,880
they need help. Now I have to stop. And the vast majority of times I do not do that because I worry

464
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,960
or I know for sure if they show up at a hospital, they're going to wait 36 hours, 40 something hours

465
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,360
before they see someone. They're going to be put in a place that's going to feel very shameful and

466
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:19,000
very stigmatizing. There's a locked room and people are watching that person in a way that makes them

467
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,720
feel like they're being treated like they're crazy when they're in distress. And when they

468
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,080
finally get help, there's some short term stabilization, give them a little medicine,

469
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,960
they fall asleep, they wake up, they feel a little better because they slept, now send them home.

470
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:39,480
And we're not serving people well with this short term view of how we're supposed to help them.

471
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,880
I mean, there are not enough beds in emergency rooms in mental health units. There's not enough

472
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,280
time with practitioners. I mean, the fact that the system is broken is to me as obvious as one

473
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,720
plus one is two. I mean, I just see it in front of me day after day. Where in the last 20 years

474
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:05,880
did the sort of matrix come together for you with respect to trauma? I mean, the first time you and

475
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:17,800
I ever spoke about this was four years ago, 2017. And not surprisingly at that time, I didn't really

476
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,720
know what you were talking about. I only thought about it in the most literal sense, which is

477
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:33,080
something that is so obviously physically harmful that that could be traumatic. But it was clear you

478
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,560
had been thinking a lot about this because you had a lot to say on it and you had already

479
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,720
been sending patients to inpatient facilities, residential care facilities that specialized in

480
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:55,880
trauma care. So when did this occur for you? When did you start to integrate these other

481
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,440
modalities? When was the first time you sent a patient to a residential program that specialized

482
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:06,520
in trauma such as the bridge to recovery or a place like that? I would have been sending patients

483
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,400
to residential facilities for trauma since very early on in my career, but not having the

484
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,680
understanding. When you do anything for a long time, you internalize aspects of doing it that

485
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,040
become reflexive and then it frees up parts of your brain to learn more. And as I got,

486
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,960
I think just learned more and got more experience and more ability to spend more time with people

487
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,400
and try and just always have a venue where I could try and understand that person. It led me to

488
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:43,000
realize that I'm doing the same things all the time. If you present to me with panic attacks,

489
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,880
you present to me with obsessive compulsive disorder, you present to me with depression,

490
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,000
you present to me with addiction. What I'm ultimately doing is the same thing. I'm trying

491
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,760
to help you understand why, because that's what's going to make the difference. And maybe along the

492
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,760
way we can treat symptoms. Maybe I have you on a couple of antidepressants or even someone who has

493
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:11,000
psychosis, something so dramatic that we're trying to decrease that with medicines, but ultimately,

494
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,240
how to really help that person is to try and understand what their experience is of it and

495
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:21,400
their sense of vulnerability is of it. And I realized I'm doing this all the time, is trying

496
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,560
to help people understand where the problems are coming from, because that's how they get better.

497
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,040
Which is the same as what I saw in myself. There was anger, frustration, resentment,

498
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:41,640
underlying depression. All of these problems were in me and a very negative and oppressive

499
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:48,040
internal dialogue. And in my own psychotherapy of exploring this, we weren't trying to treat

500
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,800
like, what symptom is it spinning off now? We're trying to understand what's going on inside of

501
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,520
you, that you're doing this. And so I saw in my own, the process was to help me, my own psychotherapy,

502
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,120
and what I was doing with others, that it was all about the same thing, which were the roots of what

503
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:14,200
ails us. And those roots are the seeds of trauma falling into a soil that lets those seeds grow and

504
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,960
trying to understand what is that soil inside of you? How is it unique to you? How does it follow

505
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:26,760
patterns that impact all of us? What was that seed? How has it grown? I at some point realized,

506
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,040
oh, that's what I do. That's what I'm doing. And I stopped thinking, oh, like how many depression

507
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,160
cases do I have? Or how many? Think about that. I said, oh, I kind of have all trauma cases.

508
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,040
And that was such a revelation. And then in the practicality of starting to do my work more

509
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,240
intentionally that way, I could see that it was more effective. It was very, very clear that it

510
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:55,000
was more effective. And then I started working with really great like-minded people and their

511
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,920
knowledge and experience with what I was learning really came together in a way that this lens of

512
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:07,000
trauma seemed not like, oh, some esoteric discovery, but just rooted back to the obvious.

513
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,000
Right? It rooted back to the obvious, which it's really some of the older literature and describing

514
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,680
human behavior that we knew all the time, right? But just wasn't at the forefront of the discipline

515
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:25,080
in terms of its education and training. If you had to hazard a guess, what fraction of mental

516
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:31,160
health providers, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, et cetera, have never referred one

517
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,080
of their patients to a residential trauma facility? What would be your guess? It's an unknowable thing.

518
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:43,640
Probably a pretty high percentage, right? Because trauma gets defined as does that person have PTSD,

519
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,360
right? And people aren't going to even say all the things that would leave them to be diagnosed,

520
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,880
right? Because they're ashamed of the symptoms, right? I mean, the role of shame is so huge.

521
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,320
When you go to one of these facilities, and I've been to two of them,

522
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:05,960
the word PTSD almost never comes up, right? It's usually, hey, you have this addiction,

523
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,840
you have this maladaptive coping strategy, you're angry, you're depressed. Let's find out why,

524
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,800
let's find out what's underneath the surface. So given that the facilities themselves don't

525
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,360
position themselves as PTSD treatment centers necessarily, although there are people there with

526
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:28,600
PTSD, but it's just another group. It's interesting to me that practitioners aren't

527
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:35,560
more aware of this tool, but let's take something like an eating disorder, right? You take care of

528
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:42,040
many patients with eating disorders. What fraction of those patients would you say have an underlying

529
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:51,960
trauma as a significant contributory factor in their illness? Approaches 100%. Even if you look

530
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,520
at trauma through that appropriately broad lens, right? Because we're looking at what causes the

531
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,960
outcome. So I'm not trying to look at what factors do I want to be part of it. I'm looking at the

532
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:09,400
actual truth of what causes the outcome. So the chronic trauma of immensely high expectations of

533
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:17,320
self, right? Often placed upon self by self, but often that process being aided and abetted by

534
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,280
external forces, right? Which sometimes are the expectations of the people around that person or

535
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,880
just the expectations of society of how you're supposed to look and how you're supposed to act

536
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,880
and how you're supposed to present yourself to the world and what you're supposed to achieve

537
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,320
can create immense senses of insecurity and of vulnerability. And people laboring under that for

538
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,520
long periods of time can find an outlet for control. I mean, in many ways, that's often what

539
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:48,760
the signs and symptoms of so many mental health issues are, right? It's an attempt to find control

540
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,240
and maybe somebody finds control by tapping five times when they think they have a negative thought.

541
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,480
Someone else finds control by restricting what they eat and they can control what goes into their

542
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,360
bodies, right? And what are the roots of that? The roots of that are always trauma. I can't think of

543
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:11,240
an eating disorder situation. A person suffering from an eating disorder who did not have trauma

544
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,840
as a root of that eating disorder with the trauma being discovered and talked about and addressed at

545
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,800
least to some degree during the treatment. And that's why the facilities understand this. I mean,

546
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,440
it's interesting. The facilities know because when you show up at a trauma facility, right,

547
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,560
they want to understand and treat your trauma, right? They're not concerned. Do you have the

548
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:36,040
magic card of entry of PTSD, right? But because medicine, you know, how many times this gets said

549
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,280
so often, but it's true, right? If the doctors are treating the computer, the chart, right? The

550
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,960
paperwork, right? That like so much of it is about, because that person have trauma or not

551
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,000
to have trauma. I got to turn with that PTSD. Like, you know, it's, it's so busy around with things

552
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,560
that don't matter that are about establishing a diagnosis. So the insurance company will pay for

553
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,080
the 15 minute appointment or will pay for the medicine that's going to treat the symptom,

554
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,680
but not the problem, right? That there then become a gating mechanism. And like PTSD is some magic

555
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,800
gating mechanism, right? That doesn't get talked about when you're actually treating trauma

556
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,760
because it actually makes no sense as a gating mechanism. And I think what you're pointing out

557
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,200
is very, very powerful that, you know, the, the world we live in says, we have to have PTSD and

558
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,200
meet these criteria where you don't have trauma. But what happens if you get to somebody who's

559
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,080
treating trauma, they never talk about that, right? They talk about the reality and truth of what

560
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,400
you've lived and, and what that has done to you in ways that are then counterproductive to your life,

561
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,720
right? And like that's the truth and the realness of it as opposed to, as opposed to a false

562
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,600
sense of surety that comes from all those guidelines and box checking that is really

563
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,920
divorced from the human experience. It seems to me that part of the problem,

564
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,680
I mean, there's so many problems to the recognition of this, right? The first is there's,

565
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:06,600
you know, medicine works in the, in the sphere of biomarkers and objective measures of illness or

566
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:12,520
disease, right? So we can look at a biomarker like a person's APOB or LDL cholesterol or a

567
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:18,040
hormone level and it's subjective. We can understand what that implies or we can look at a CT scan that

568
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,640
shows an injury here, there, but you know, psychiatry has none of these things, right? Psychiatry,

569
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,280
you know, doing an MRI of a person's brain offers you no more insight into their plight or their

570
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,840
suffering than, you know, rubbing a towel on their head and dumping some hot wax on it. You know,

571
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,480
again, there are exceptions of course, there are exceptions where, you know, certainly, you know,

572
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,880
a nutritional deficiency, like a B12 deficiency or something that can show up in a biomarker can

573
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,400
explain a psychic realist, but for the most part, that's not the case. So that's sort of, I call that

574
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,640
kind of macro problem one. I think macro problem two is the heterogeneity of the soil

575
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:03,480
that you'd describe, right? You could take 100 individuals and simultaneously expose them to

576
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:12,360
the same traumatic event, but without knowing what their antecedent history is, right? So what have,

577
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,040
what else has this person experienced? And so in other words, what else has been dropped in the

578
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:25,080
soil and without knowing the composition of each of their soils, you really have no idea how those

579
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:32,760
100 people are going to react to an identical stimulus. And that of course is very uncomfortable

580
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,920
for medicine when, you know, it's uncomfortable for science, right? Like you think of Koch's

581
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:45,080
postulates, like we really love it when we can say, add this microbe, get this disease, subtract

582
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:51,480
this microbe, subtract this disease. Like, you know, medicine is so good at that type of thinking.

583
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,640
And it's like, we don't have the, and again, I'm not saying this to be critical of medicine or to be

584
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:02,360
critical of psychiatry. It's just an observation of maybe this might explain to somebody who's

585
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:08,600
listening to this, who thinks you're out to left field. This is a very hard problem to quantify

586
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:15,000
because of these, A, again, the obvious, the lack of biomarkers, et cetera, the lack of diagnostic

587
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,840
criteria and the incredible heterogeneity of the individual and their history. And those are

588
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:26,520
actually not the same thing. Yes. Anything on the one hand, look, we need to acknowledge that

589
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,640
complexity and also that lack of specificity, right? But on the other hand, there are aspects

590
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:40,920
of that, that I think simplify in ways that are very, very compelling, right? So, you know, in

591
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,680
the book I interview Stephanie von Gutenberg, who's an expert on the prevention of understanding

592
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:52,360
and prevention of child abuse and Darren Richard, who's a professor at Stanford, who's done a lot

593
00:59:52,360 --> 01:00:00,040
of trauma work around trauma work and trauma research around the impact of trauma on identifiable

594
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,960
markers and what that means, right? So for example, his work draws at times from the field

595
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,520
of epigenetics, which shows that gene expression changes after trauma. And he was, his testimony

596
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:21,480
was instrumental in jurisprudence on an international level, recognizing that, for example,

597
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:28,840
rape as a tool of war, right, is not like a one event criminal act, right? Which was how it was

598
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:35,240
being viewed. Okay. That thing happened on that day, right? In a way that circumscribes it. And

599
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:42,520
the epigenetic research around trauma shows that not only is it not a one event limited to a day,

600
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:48,600
right, experience, but that it carries on throughout that person's life, right? It impacts

601
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,920
the society in which that person lives and it gets passed on to the next generation, right?

602
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,200
So now we start having that kind of powerful science that can show that woman who was raped

603
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,800
as a child three years later and the genetics that are expressed in that child are impacted

604
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,480
by the trauma that happened three years, say, before conception. So we do have, in a sense,

605
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,160
the scientific proof to hang our hats on these days. We do have that in a way that tells us,

606
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,320
right, we kind of knew all this was true because we saw it obviously in front of us.

607
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:27,720
Now we do have what science wants to have to hang our hats on, right? And even though, like,

608
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:33,240
say, those hundred people have different soil and will be affected in different ways, we can

609
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:39,000
understand how that may sort of disperse across those hundred people, right? Like, what is the

610
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,240
trauma? You know, a certain number of people, a percentage of people are likely to respond in

611
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,120
certain ways if it's a dramatic trauma. Like, if there's some dramatic acute trauma, it might not

612
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,360
matter so much what the soil is. People are going to be, you know, the majority are going to be very

613
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,640
deeply affected, right? Or there might be other kinds of trauma where you can only understand by

614
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:05,960
really understanding that person. So, like, we do fit patterns and we can understand how those

615
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:11,640
patterns unfold just like we can understand the aspects of basic science that we've learned now

616
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:17,160
in a way that says, yes, this is very, very complicated. That's why it can't be deployed

617
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,120
in some checkbox kind of manner, right? But we can understand it well enough to say, okay,

618
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:28,120
it's actually not that complicated, right? To try and understand like, what has your experience

619
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,080
been or what's going on inside of you, right? If you present as depressed, like, well, what's your

620
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:38,120
history, right? And what are you saying to yourself inside, right? And has that shifted over time? Like,

621
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,760
we can understand that in a way that says, do I think that your brain is different because of

622
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,160
trauma? It's like, it's not that hard to do that. And then to say, well, let's try and understand

623
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,640
your trauma so we can help make it better, right? So, there's an aspect of this that's also

624
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,880
kind of simple too that we don't deploy because we're lost in the complexity of all those other

625
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,320
things, all that box checking and, you know, we don't know, we don't understand, and psychiatry

626
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,680
wants to be like the rest of medicine. And then we get lost in the complexity and that complexity

627
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:13,560
very often prevents a person from being understood, feeling understood, feeling help, getting any help

628
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:21,720
at all. Are there checklists that provide value? So, for example, the adverse childhood event,

629
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:27,640
is that what it's called? ACE? It's a series of questions, right? It's 10 questions, 20, how many

630
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,200
questions is it? I don't know. There are different versions that get utilized in different realms

631
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,240
that I'm not, I don't know what the standardized version is now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's in that

632
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:44,280
ballpark. So, sometimes these tests are really good at catching, they have a high positive

633
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,600
predictive value, but they seem to have a low negative predictive value. In other words,

634
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:55,960
there's lots of people who don't score highly on the adverse childhood event score, but nevertheless,

635
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,600
they are, there is significant trauma in their lives, but it might only account for one of the

636
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:10,360
10 checks, but again, for them, it was very instrumental in how their identity was formed.

637
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,440
So, is this something that can be automated or is this something that can only be done by

638
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,480
someone who has the ability to dig and really get deep into it? So, let's take an example, right?

639
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:31,640
So, let's take a person who grew up in a family where they simply weren't paid attention to,

640
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,560
right? So, they would check the box of neglect, but none of the other boxes would get checked.

641
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:45,160
Now, let's say there were multiple kids in that family, five children neglected because the

642
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:51,000
parents are working like crazy or for whatever reason, those five kids could completely

643
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,760
internalize that in different ways, right? Right. Some of those kids could go on to become

644
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:01,080
the most successful people in the world because, at least externally, because of a drive that gets

645
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:08,360
instilled in them to prove their worth. Right. One of their siblings could easily go in the

646
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:13,880
exact opposite direction and turn to a life of substance abuse and addiction. We see this all

647
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,760
the time. Exactly. Let's explore that a little bit more because, again, there's two things I

648
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:26,760
want to explore there. One, something as innocuous as neglect can produce such vastly different

649
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:34,120
phenotypes. And secondly, the heterogeneity of the soil problem, which is how is it that

650
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,560
two siblings, and you and I have both seen scenarios like this, two siblings in the exact

651
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:46,760
same family exposed to the exact same stimulus or environmental factor, in this case, neglect,

652
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,080
can have such vastly different responses. Right. And one of them, society frowns upon,

653
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:58,040
and the other one, actually, society is pretty impressed with. Right. So, you're getting

654
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:02,840
questions around the heterogeneity of it or how do we understand it? Well, I think it's both,

655
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,520
right? It's how do we explain the heterogeneity and two, how would both of those people even rise

656
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:14,600
to the level of coming to the lens of trauma given that, again, I'm using this very specific

657
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,880
example where on an ACE score, neither of them would rise to the level of concern.

658
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:27,720
Right. We are different even if we are siblings. Right. I mean, the genes are different and their

659
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,760
manifestation can be very different, right, based upon aspects of early childhood experience that

660
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,680
may have nothing to do with trauma. Right. So, I think where it leads us is inventories of signs

661
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:44,040
and symptoms can be useful, but they're just one element of data. Right. I mean, one aspect of it

662
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:49,640
is accuracy of reporting. Right. People will often under report because trauma creates

663
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,840
shame in us. Right. I mean, I can't tell you the number of times, say someone comes to care with

664
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,720
me and they're checking or they have depression and panic attacks and say there's some intake form

665
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:06,360
and they don't check the trauma box. Okay. And maybe I meet with them and maybe there is like a

666
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:11,560
purely biological depression. It comes out of the blue. Right. And I can't find trauma associated

667
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,760
with like that happens. Right. It's rare, but it happens more often than not. When you start

668
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,800
talking to the person, it's remarkable. Sometimes I've, you have three sessions worth of trauma

669
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,080
history. Right. That's, that's intrinsic to all aspects of that person's life. And they check no

670
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:31,320
on the trauma box. Well, because they didn't really think this was trauma. And they really think

671
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,720
that, that seems, that was too long ago to be trauma. And like, that's not as bad as what other

672
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,080
people have to deal with. So that can't be trauma. I mean, this happens all the time. Right. So the

673
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:49,320
what you just described strikes me as the norm. Right. It is. Yes. The majority of people who

674
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:55,640
come into kind of a trauma diagnostic scenario with, with, with an astute caregiver,

675
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:04,520
maybe caregiver is the wrong word, a provider, but it's the, the comparisons. Right. I mean,

676
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,640
come on. That's what happened to me is not that bad. Look at what happened to so and so.

677
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:15,400
That can't be trauma. Right. And it's too long ago. Right. All the time. Absolutely all the time,

678
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,760
because, and this is really a crux of the messaging of the book, because

679
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,120
trauma changes the instrument that we use to understand our trauma, right? Like it's

680
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:32,600
changing our brain, right? So, so you can combine that with how much shame is evoked, right? And how

681
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,440
hard it can be to discuss that, right? Because if we're ashamed of something, we don't want to

682
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,960
reveal it to somebody else. And we often don't know just because it's a professional, is that

683
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,880
person going to feel okay about me? Or are they going to look at me differently because they see

684
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:49,080
that shameful thing in me? Like we feel this. And absolutely. I felt this after my brother's death.

685
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,760
I'm going to go see this therapist. I don't even know this person. And you know, what's she going

686
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,560
to think of me? Like, you know, here I, you know, here I wasn't around enough. I only lived two

687
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,840
hours away and I wasn't home enough to see this. And like, you know, I, I thought maybe, you know,

688
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,640
she was going to say, shame on you for what happened. Like I didn't know, right? And I think

689
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,880
that is the norm, which is why like we can't replace humans, right? Like we kind of understand

690
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,000
this, that we can't replace humans in our helping endeavors with like something that's computerized,

691
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,360
right? So we're mechanized in some way. So, so sure. We want to take inventories and like,

692
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:29,080
if we can leave, it makes sense. Like to take a, an inventory of trauma scientists, but realize

693
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,840
it like you have no idea what that data means until you sit with the person, right? And like,

694
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:40,840
it's, why should it be strange to say that human beings are a necessary part of this helping

695
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:46,680
process, right? Because often I may look at all the data I have from someone. And a lot of times

696
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:52,120
I have data even from other providers or other facilities, right? You know, I have a lot of data

697
01:09:52,120 --> 01:10:00,840
and like, okay, it tells me something, but I really don't know anything really about that person

698
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,040
until they sit in front of me, right? Because once they sit in front of me, I can anchor that data

699
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:12,520
to something, right? And, and very often what I started seeing over, you know, getting more

700
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,960
experience in the field was when you talk more with a person about what's going on in them,

701
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,080
it is indeed linked to trauma, whether they've checked that box or not. And it's all those

702
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,200
barriers. It was too long ago, or they feel ashamed of it. That lead them not to recognize

703
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:33,880
that the trauma is driving all of the problems. And I think that the last story in the book about

704
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,960
the woman who is a true story who 10 years later was 10 years younger. And I got her permission

705
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,120
before writing it because I didn't, you know, I didn't, that's not a composite, right? It's this,

706
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:53,240
this person who just didn't understand like how her life had changed. So she had had a tragedy in

707
01:10:53,240 --> 01:11:00,120
her life and it was years before. And just standing from the outside and hearing the story,

708
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:06,360
there was such a disjunction of how she felt about herself and felt about her life and was

709
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:13,000
living her life that changed after the trauma in a way that was so stark. This is the woman whose

710
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:23,720
daughter died. Yes. Who without realizing it, was living this life that was so changed. And her

711
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:32,200
thoughts about herself were through such an unfair lens, right? Who really had no, despite being

712
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,080
intelligent and personable and like all these wonderful qualities, couldn't see it, right? And

713
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,600
like that's not the exception. That's the norm, right? And those rationalizations inside of

714
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,200
herself, no, it was too long ago or, or even feeling so badly about it that, that being

715
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:54,760
unable to let it to the surface enough to see what it was doing, right? What had driven all of this

716
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:00,280
change in her. So despite attesting to not having trauma, it was 100% of the cause.

717
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,200
How did she come into your care?

718
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,480
There's three other things to treat some of the symptoms that had spun off, which is often the

719
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,160
case, like, oh, this person is depressed or, you know, there's so many things. I'm like, okay,

720
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,640
that's, that's just the card of entry. Like maybe that I will find there a pure biological

721
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:20,280
depression, right? But I've ceased to believe that that is what I will find because 20 years of doing

722
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,400
this intensively has taught me differently. So then the place case, the person comes in and I see

723
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,680
whatever the presenting, I don't remember, right? Because like, that's not where the money was at,

724
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:35,320
so to speak, right? Where the money was at was in trauma, right? And is this that leaf at the end

725
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,480
of the tree that caught the person's attention? I want that leaf to be a little healthier that,

726
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,600
that a little bit better, right? That then brings her in where we look at what's going on in the

727
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:50,680
roots that's affecting all of the leaves, right? And it then gives us a chance of actually getting

728
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,800
at it and developing an understanding of trauma and of reflexive shame and what that does to us

729
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,920
and what a change in internal dialogue from, from feeling a sense of pride in oneself as someone

730
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,080
who works hard and does good things for other people in the world around her to someone who

731
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:10,600
didn't, couldn't see her own worth anymore. And you want to see an absolute disjunction of oneself

732
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:17,480
from a before and after that will do it. And by understanding it, it could get better, right? Does

733
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:24,200
it take away the grief? No, in fact, it lets her begin, it let her begin to process the grief,

734
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,480
right? Because if we're blaming ourselves, we can't grieve. That's why it can be 50 years later

735
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,360
and be just as immediate as when it happened. Because if the grief gets walled off, right,

736
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:39,160
under this layer of shame, like an abscess medically would be in the body, then it can spin

737
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:44,520
off symptoms for years and years and years without anything ever getting any better. And in fact,

738
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,920
with things getting worse, because the trauma then brings new trauma, right? It brings the shame of

739
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,880
like losing jobs and losing family and, and, you know, all the ways in which feeling bad about

740
01:13:53,880 --> 01:14:00,440
ourselves makes us feel worse about ourselves, right? So the, it's a great example, but it's not,

741
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,960
oh, that's one in a million. It's just a great example of something that I see all the time,

742
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,040
which is like, let's get to the truth of what's going on in the person, help them understand it

743
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,600
and things get better. And it's not that hard and complicated, but it requires an approach that

744
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:21,240
actually wants to understand what's going on. Actually, I've always found the analogy of the

745
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:28,120
abscess to be quite helpful, especially for folks who understand what an abscess is, how it's formed,

746
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,800
and what the implications are of it, right? So for maybe folks who aren't familiar,

747
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:40,520
an abscess is a walled off infection. So a great example of how one might get an abscess is if they

748
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,920
had a ruptured appendicitis. And, you know, a ruptured appendicitis carries with it a very

749
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,840
high mortality, but there are some ways to survive it without antibiotics, without anything. And this

750
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:57,480
was even known hundreds of years ago when people were making long haul journeys across the ocean.

751
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,760
If you had a ruptured appendix in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, when you're halfway between

752
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:07,800
Spain and the Americas, kind of SOL. But what they realized was if you put the person on their

753
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:14,280
right side down, tilted slightly head up, all of the pus that was coming out of that ruptured

754
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:19,720
appendix would at least wall off in the lower part of the right abdomen, as opposed to spread

755
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:24,360
throughout the entire abdomen. And there was at least you'd increase the odds that it would form

756
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:30,360
this fibrous capsule around it that would wall off. So you'd have all the pus and all the nastiness

757
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,480
inside there, but it was sort of walled off. And if you could get this right, that person might just

758
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:42,360
might survive. Now, they weren't going to be perfectly healthy, but they'd survive. Now,

759
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:47,160
today we still see people that show up with abscesses from a ruptured diverticulum or something

760
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:54,680
like that. And they're not well. They're not dead though, but they're just not well.

761
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,920
Well, the first thing that has to happen is they have to come into the medical system for treatment,

762
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:07,880
which I guess the analog would be here. They have to at least present for help in some way. The

763
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:13,240
second thing is they have to be willing to get help. They have to acknowledge, I have an abscess.

764
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:19,320
Now, it's a lot easier with an abscess because we have a CT scan that is stark. I mean, an abscess

765
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,560
is an unmistakable thing that you don't even need to be a radiologist or even a medical student to

766
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,200
spot the abscess on a CT scan. It's the easiest thing to see. Literally, there's nothing easier

767
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:34,600
to see on a CT scan than an abscess. But nevertheless, there's got to be some component

768
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,120
of convincing the person that you have this abscess. But what's interesting is the treatment,

769
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,480
you often get a little worse before you get better because when you open that abscess and you

770
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:51,880
release all of the bacteria, even though you're doing it in a manner to clean it up, the patient

771
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:58,680
will initially have an inflammatory response to that that is probably worse than the condition

772
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,280
that brought them in. Now, of course, you have the luxury of doing this in the hospital. You're

773
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,320
giving them antibiotics. You're giving them IV fluids. You're monitoring them. So this is rarely

774
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:14,040
a fatal event, but it's nevertheless uncomfortable. And in many ways, that just strikes me as a great

775
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:19,240
analogy for what has to happen here, except it's harder in the case of trauma because one,

776
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:26,920
they might be less likely to come in and seek help. Two, you have a really big hurdle to

777
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:33,880
actually convincing the person that you have this abscess. And three, the treatment is much harder.

778
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,040
In many ways, the treatment of the abscess is really quite simple. You're going to be under

779
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,320
anesthesia for the next couple of hours, and we're going to do all this stuff, and we're going to

780
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:46,920
give you a bunch of antibiotics. Well, it's a lot harder to do what you did with that woman

781
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,360
than what I would have done with that patient. Yeah. And I think as I'm listening to what it

782
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:59,880
makes me want to focus on is the really big hurdle. Because I think the abscess, it's a remarkably

783
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,400
good analogy. Because the re-sledges- It saved you. Your response to the trauma

784
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:12,120
saved your life. Right. We're built to recoil and protect ourselves from dangerous things,

785
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:18,680
which is why if you think about trauma leading to avoidance and hypervigilance, and people become

786
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:24,360
more afraid of the world and less likely to engage and less likely to take chances, even if it's the

787
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:28,920
chance of a job that seems better or the chance of dating someone who seems like they could be a

788
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:37,400
great partner, taking chances in good ways, that a person becomes much less likely to do that.

789
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:43,080
Right. And if you think about how these systems grew in us, that trauma raises a lot of negative

790
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:50,040
emotion in us, and then we recoil to protect ourselves. And it may be that even a depressed

791
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:56,280
mood or panic attacks and disturbed sleep, this may all go hand in hand with hypervigilance and

792
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:02,840
avoidance to say, look, that is better than death. Right. And when these systems grew in us,

793
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:09,240
where a lot of the trauma that happened did tell you to stay close to home. Right. And human

794
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,240
development, right. And we're in small groups. And if you eat something that makes you sick,

795
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:18,280
like never, never, never eat that again. Or if you go over that hill and someone from another

796
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:23,400
tribe attacks you, like don't go there again, right, to stay closer to home. They're there for

797
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:29,720
a reason, right. They're part of the evolution of human beings psychologically, right, over time in

798
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:36,280
order to stay alive. Right. But then in the modern world, those things don't always make sense

799
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:42,200
anymore. Right. And that walled off, say, psychological abscess, right, that is indeed

800
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:47,560
better than death is spinning off symptom after symptom, right. It's making that tendency towards

801
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,040
a little too much alcohol soothing that that person, you know, does a couple of times a year.

802
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,320
Well, now they want to do a little more because there's a desperation in them,

803
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,480
right, to not feel so terrified or have panic attacks when they're falling asleep. And

804
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,600
now they're drinking three, four, five, six, seven days a week, right. Or that that tendency

805
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,680
towards avoidance is now they can't get out of bed or leave the house. Like these are things I see

806
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:15,880
all the time. And, and often what brings a person to care is a symptom, right. Just like the person

807
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,680
with the abscess might come to care because. They don't know they have an abscess. Exactly.

808
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:26,520
They just don't feel well. So, so the parallel is so strong there, right. And I think the difference

809
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:32,280
is in the hurdle, right. That even though I might say, okay, wait, I'm going to feel a little worse

810
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,920
before I feel better. But like, Oh, I see that bright thing on the CT scan. And you're telling

811
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,840
me you're going to go in and take it out. And I'm going to feel a lot better, not just this thing

812
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:46,680
that brought me in, but 50 more things I didn't know about. I'm much more likely to say yes to

813
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:54,280
that, right. And the problem I think is in how high the hurdle is for trauma. And I guess actually,

814
01:20:54,280 --> 01:21:00,920
I think the problem is twofold. It actually is, and it's not as easy to recognize as the abscess,

815
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,160
but I think that it should be, right. That our mental health methods of coping, of helping,

816
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:15,480
sorry, should look for this. In looking for abscesses, we have 256 bit CT scanners that

817
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:22,280
can produce a resolution of one by one by one millimeter. And the analog of what you have in

818
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:30,120
psychiatry to do this is pre-CT scan era when you have to just palpate somebody's belly and surmise

819
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:35,320
that they have an abscess. I mean, there's a huge, I mean, I don't want to use the word technology to

820
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,680
imply that you will need technology to do this, but it is effectively the difference between a

821
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:48,440
catapult and a cannon. But I think maybe the beautiful answer to this is in this example,

822
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:54,360
we're setting forth psychiatry is choosing to use the, let's palpate the abdomen instead of the CT

823
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,120
scan, right? I completely agree. Yes, yes, yes.

824
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:01,880
Because the human brain has more sophistication than even that finest CT scan, right? That's right.

825
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,640
So if we apply the trained human brain to say, look, I want to try and understand what's actually

826
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,720
going on in you instead of saying, oh, oh, you're depressed. You checked all the depression boxes.

827
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:16,040
Let me give you an antidepressant and I'll see you again in two months and we won't make eye contact.

828
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,240
I mean, like that's not helping. That's not understanding, right? But if we apply the

829
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,840
human brain, like we apply the CT scanner, right? Then we will identify way more trauma and say,

830
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:33,000
look, how many times I tell a person, like here's the great news is you do not have five problems,

831
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,760
right? Because people will present saying, you can't help me. There's no way you're going to

832
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:41,560
help me, right? There's been going on me for years and I have four different problems, right?

833
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,160
How are you going to help me? Right? So here's the great news. We've been going on for years because

834
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,560
it's never been looked at, right? So it's not surprising it goes on for years.

835
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,720
And you don't have four problems. You have one, right? You don't have depression and sleep

836
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:59,000
disturbance and panic attacks and alcohol abuse, right? As entirely different problems, right?

837
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,400
They're arising from trauma. And I may be, why would I be saying that? Because we've had a couple

838
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,560
of conversations where the person told me how none of those things were present before the trauma

839
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:13,160
and all of those things are present after the trauma, right? And then that's not rocket science,

840
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,120
right? So we could stop palpating the abdomen and bring in the equivalent of the CT scanner,

841
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,920
even better, right? The human brain, right? And then we can identify what's going on

842
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:29,320
and we can also decrease the hurdle. Like why is it so daunting to get help for trauma, right?

843
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:34,440
I mean, in many ways it is scary, right? Because the person often has been keeping it inside and

844
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,240
then I hear this all the time too. Like, I can't talk about that because then they realize and

845
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,520
often they knew all along, not always, but often they knew all along that that's what was going on

846
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,920
because they get told the whole world inside of me is different now. But look at what it's doing

847
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,800
to me and I'm not even talking about it, right? They don't realize, look at what it's doing to

848
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:59,400
you because you're not talking about it, right? But when you can get someone to understand that

849
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:07,800
and often that comes already, that's right there waiting because you're talking at least enough

850
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,680
about it that the person has disclosed that there's been some trauma. They put words to something.

851
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,800
They maybe never put words before and guess what? The world didn't end, right? And I didn't lean

852
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,280
across the table and say, what? Like get out of my office. Things that people are afraid of,

853
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:27,240
like I was afraid after my brother's death, right? Already there's an excuse. People,

854
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:33,000
this happens all the time. I'm saying, I feel better now, right? I already feel better because

855
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:38,600
literally after just 40 minutes say of talking about like, yeah, you know, I really have felt

856
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:45,240
different since that car accident or even since that thing happened to my friend's child, right?

857
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,840
They know, right? They know, but because of the shame and the idea of what are you going to do

858
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,640
with that, right? They don't know that there's helping resources. So we don't put it out there

859
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:00,440
that there's helping resources, right? And people have way too many experiences of going to get help.

860
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,800
And then they come out with a prescription for an antidepressant from somebody who didn't really

861
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,560
talk to them. And they know that's not going to help or they've already done it four times and

862
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:13,080
it hasn't helped, right? So we create these barriers by like so many things in modern medicine

863
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:19,240
by stepping away from common sense. Like let's use the right helping mechanism. Let's use the

864
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:24,680
equivalent of the CT scan to find the abscess and let's make the barrier lower so the person

865
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:29,800
doesn't have to feel that it's utterly terrifying to go through this helping process. Once people

866
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:35,320
start doing it, even though it's difficult, people feel good about it, right? They feel good about

867
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,520
it. Like you feel good about doing something that's hard for you. Like, you know, like working out

868
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,280
is really hard, right? But like, you know, you're getting healthier so you don't mind going and

869
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:48,120
doing it. And that's often how the experience is. It's not miserable. And it often surprises people

870
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:54,360
that like the clinic that, you know, the whole group of us have together, like it's not a

871
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:59,400
miserable place to come, right? And people are often surprised by that, that, you know, this is

872
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,480
supposed to be miserable. It's supposed to make them feel bad. And if you come to a place that's

873
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,960
like just reasonably nice and you meet people who are like, hey, I'm in the soup with you too,

874
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,800
right? Like I know things I'm trained, that's why I can help you. But, you know, I have the same

875
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:18,840
problems. In the short term, it can be quite distressing to go back and revisit these things.

876
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,280
I mean, I think that's been more my experience than not, both personally and with others, that

877
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:31,560
it can, it really does feel a little bit like that abscess where in the days after that surgery,

878
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:38,200
in that case, the patient actually looks worse. Yeah, absolutely. Like, absolutely yes. But

879
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:44,600
because you know why and you know that it's helping you, it's much more tolerable, right?

880
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,280
This happens in my own therapy. I'll think, gosh, I've got to talk about something from the past

881
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:53,880
that is now being triggered, right? Like something happens in my present and it links me to a trauma

882
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,080
of the past that like really shook my confidence and like now my anxiety level is higher. And I

883
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,480
know it's going to be hard to go in and talk about that. I know it. I know it's going to be painful,

884
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:09,560
but I'm not afraid of it, right? Because I know that it's helping me just the way that

885
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,920
people perceive pain differently in medical settings if they know why, right? And I saw

886
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,400
a study you probably have seen around like gunshot wounds, right? And like people's pain

887
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,560
being so different if they see that there's something, that there was some reason, right?

888
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,240
Like they're trying to help somebody, right? And now they know that like, even though like this is

889
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:31,160
terrifying, like they're going to survive it, right? And their level of pain goes down, right?

890
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,480
So yes, it's painful, but the perception of the pain is this pain that threatens me,

891
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:41,800
menaces me with destruction, right? Or is this pain that although painful is in the service of

892
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,680
like doing right by myself, right? And that's often what we'll anchor to of like, look, I don't see a

893
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:52,360
reason for you to have a dialogue running in your head where 500 times a day you tell yourself that

894
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:58,120
you're worthless. Really, that doesn't seem fair or right to me. You know, not even sometimes you

895
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,560
joke, I don't know if you've been kidnapping buses of school children I don't know about, right?

896
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,360
Like, is this it? That this, you know, there's something to feel ashamed about here, but it's

897
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:10,920
the person who did that thing to you, right? Maybe there's nothing to be ashamed about here because

898
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:16,680
like something just happened in life, right? And it's that change inside the person that gives us

899
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:22,760
all the bravery to go and do difficult things because we see that it's aligned with truth.

900
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,320
And I think often people see psychotherapy as like, oh, we're trying to shift towards something

901
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,880
that feels better. Like that's not the purpose of it, right? The purpose is to shift towards

902
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:38,200
something that's true. Oh, and by the way, that true thing feels better. What do you think are the

903
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:48,440
impediments to a person once they're presented with a plausible explanation for their symptoms

904
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:55,000
in the roots of trauma? What are the impediments to them doing the work that's necessary? Because

905
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:01,880
again, here's the second huge difference from the abscess. The abscess, you get to basically

906
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:08,760
put an IV in your arm, take some propofol and wake up and have it be over. When you're confronted with

907
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:16,520
these events of your childhood, though seemingly completely disconnected from the problems you're

908
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,280
having today as an adult are probably causally linked. And we need to go back and talk about

909
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:26,760
them and we need to go back and process them. And we need to go back and disconnect your shame

910
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,760
from those things. There's a lot of resistance that's met there. I mean, last night over dinner,

911
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:42,360
you and I were talking about common patients whom you get the feeling that they might not

912
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:48,840
take treatment. Right. I mean, I think the biggest problem, because he says, what are the problems?

913
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:57,960
The biggest problem is presenting to a system that is not looking to throughput and minimal

914
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:05,880
short-term cost as the primary metric of success. That brings the frustration of not finding what's

915
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:11,160
needed. And what's needed, of course, are skills that are learned through education and training,

916
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,680
their neurobiological knowledge and pharmacological knowledge and psychotherapeutic modality knowledge.

917
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:21,880
But most importantly, it's presenting in a setting where there can be what's called a

918
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,920
holding environment. The reason that we can do these things that are very, very frightening

919
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:32,840
is because we establish rapport with someone who we feel and believe wants to help us,

920
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,440
is capable of helping us, doesn't want to look down on us and can help us hold the distress of it.

921
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:43,640
Right. And that's the commonality. Psychotherapeutic modalities are so very, very different. But if you

922
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:49,560
look at primary predictors of success, it lies in the rapport because of the rapport, the trust,

923
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:53,960
the mutuality that's generated is what creates that, again, that thing that's called the holding

924
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,880
environment, which is like, I'm really scared of this and it's intimidating, but like, I'm going

925
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:02,200
to come here and this is a safe environment and you're a safe person and you want to help me.

926
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:07,880
Right. And I don't feel bad when I'm sitting across from you, which is why me and most of the

927
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,440
people I work with, if not all, acknowledge our own trauma. I mean, we're not talking about it in

928
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:16,520
a way that serves ourselves when we're supposed to be serving someone else, but I'm not pretending

929
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:22,440
that I'm not a person for whom trauma isn't deeply ingrained in my life. Right. And that sense of

930
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:28,680
mutuality leads a person to feel the trust and to be able to tolerate the distress because they're

931
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:33,640
not tolerating it alone. And when I pack up my trauma at the end of my psychotherapy sessions,

932
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:39,400
I'm going to carry that until the next time I'm going to go back in part because the person I go

933
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,200
to for therapy makes me feel helped and understood. And I know that he's going to carry it with him

934
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,880
and he wants to help me. And he feels a sense of respectful camaraderie in the work that we're

935
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:54,600
doing. And then I can bear the distress of it. I can take it home with me, even if it causes me

936
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,360
some symptoms thereafter, right? And know that I'm going to come back next week and I'm going

937
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:03,880
to make more progress. But our helping systems have to be set up to do that for people. Otherwise-

938
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,880
Let's assume those are in place. Okay.

939
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,720
Let's assume- Big assumption though, right? Big assumption.

940
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:15,160
Big assumption. But let's assume that that is in place. Why is it that 10 people who have

941
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:21,480
childhood trauma or early life trauma that is producing very maladaptive responses in their

942
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:28,120
lives, either with respect to self-care, care of others, any of the other manifestations of trauma,

943
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,320
what are the things that stand in the way of them accepting that information and moving forward?

944
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:41,080
First three answers are shame, shame, and more shame, right? That trauma makes a reflexive shame

945
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,520
in us. And that's what tells us to make the abscess, right? What's interesting is in the appendix

946
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:51,800
example, the abscess happens because a biological process happens and now the appendix bursts,

947
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,680
right? And then maybe the body can figure out a way, especially if the person is leaning on

948
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:01,560
the right side, it can figure out a way. So like that walls off. But the difference here is like

949
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:07,080
the creation of that abscess occurs inside of us, right? Through our defense mechanisms, right?

950
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:11,480
That's I've got to wall this off, right? I can't think about this. I can't talk about this. I

951
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:16,760
didn't want to go to therapy after my brother's death because I was ashamed to go to therapy

952
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:24,520
on top of the shame I felt about his death, right? So we do it to ourselves because that's what seems

953
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,520
like the course of action that's safest, right? And that's very, very powerful when we're promoting

954
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:35,880
that process. And then because things aren't going well, we sort of wall off that abscess more

955
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,600
and more and more, right? Because other shameful things happen. Like after my brother's death,

956
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:46,120
when I was functioning super well and I didn't feel like I was taking good care of myself,

957
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,320
I felt ashamed of that too, right? Which then makes it harder to get help, right? So shame,

958
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,840
which is like the primary henchman of trauma, right? In my view comes along with all these other

959
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:02,360
accomplices. Like shame loves alcohol excess, right? Shame loves an internal dialogue that

960
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,560
tells you that you're not worth anything. You're not going to get anywhere, right? There are all

961
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:12,120
these things that shame loves that we then cultivate in ourselves and we apply to further

962
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:20,200
walling off, further pushing that problem down. And that's why the best route is not just,

963
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,520
okay, let's shift how we're handling the care. So if you go to see someone about whatever your

964
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:30,360
symptom is, that person is actually thinking about you. But we do need in my very strong belief

965
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:36,760
to change the sociological aspects of this, right? To look and say like, look, many, many, many of us

966
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:42,760
have really significant trauma that has overwhelmed our coping skills, changes how we view about

967
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:47,560
ourselves and the safety of the world around us. And it really behooves us to look at this.

968
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:52,840
And there's no shame in this, right? I remember this was a bunch of years ago, but I was talking

969
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,160
to a group of about 300 physicians, right? From mixed backgrounds, mixed disciplines.

970
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:04,360
And I said this, right? I said that I've had really significant trauma in my life and psychiatric

971
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:09,240
care and psychiatric medicines have really helped me, right? And I could see out in the audience,

972
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:14,120
like probably about a third or so is a rough estimate of people like, look, shock, like that

973
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:20,280
I had said something that was so shameful, right? As if the next thing that was going to happen is

974
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:24,600
someone's going to fly through the air and tackle me, right? And pull my medical license out of my

975
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:31,560
pocket and put me someplace where people go who need those things. And I said, look, this is a

976
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:38,360
problem, right? Because I can see, and I hadn't planned on this, right? I said, it's a problem

977
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:45,160
because I see a lot of you really recoiling from this, right? And I'm saying something that I don't

978
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:50,920
think takes away from my ability to be a competent physician or a competent person in the world,

979
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:56,920
right? And I think in fact, being able to say it is what helps me navigate the world, right? But

980
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:02,120
if we recoil from like, oh, you might need help, right? Or you might need medicines, like what is

981
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,760
going on inside of us? That means how likely are any of those doctors to get themselves help,

982
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:12,040
right? And how likely are their patients to feel comfortable if they broach something traumatic,

983
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,280
right? To hear something back that even if the person is not in mental health, right? But just

984
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:21,880
say, wow, okay. Look, we know that way more than 50% of complaints to general medical providers come

985
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:27,240
from mental health conditions, right? I mean, the studies show, you know, a bottom of 50% and a

986
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:33,640
ceiling that's significantly higher than that. So non-mental health providers have to be aware and

987
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,520
not respond in this way. And again, I'm not trying to be critical, but you see that response even in

988
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,360
mental health, like some of those people who were coyered were almost certainly in mental health,

989
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:47,000
right? And we have to change the so to speak, the soup we're swimming in toward the soup that says

990
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,880
like, what do we have? Why should we be ashamed of this, right? Like, don't we have to acknowledge

991
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:59,400
this? Otherwise, the negatives inside of us, including the anger and frustration that I think

992
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:04,520
promotes all the dysfunction in our political discourse, for example, like all of this comes

993
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:12,280
to the fore in sociological ways. So if we don't look at this, how likely are we to help people get

994
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:17,880
help? And then if we don't do that, do we make everything worse in our inability to come to even

995
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,480
a decision about like, what's factual and what's not factual, as we all as a society try and navigate

996
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:30,280
things like racial issues or discrimination based upon gender or sexuality or the climate crisis?

997
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:35,240
Like, how are we going to look at that if we don't look at what's going on inside of us that often

998
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,720
involves the anger and frustration that make people just say need to be right? And like I'm

999
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:44,920
not saying this is always where it goes. A lot of the dysfunction and the misery, most of it gets

1000
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:52,120
turned inward in people, but some of it does get turned outward. And I think we see the manifestations

1001
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:58,680
of that in the real degeneration of our discourse as a society. What is the antidote to shame?

1002
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:05,000
The antidote to shame is understanding. And I view the lancing of that aspect,

1003
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,920
sorry, the lancing of the abscess or the surgical excision of the abscess, that's the equivalent

1004
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:18,600
of shining a light on shame. That shame is so powerful. It's like the old, it kind of gets

1005
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:24,680
told a lot, but it actually happened when I was a kid. There was a clothes tree in the room where

1006
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,760
my brother slept. And if you turn the lights off, it could look like a monster. And I know it was a

1007
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:34,280
clothes tree, but as a little kid, it gets scary. And is that really a clothes tree? It looks like a

1008
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:39,320
monster. It gets scarier and scarier and scarier. And then if I start screaming and crying, my

1009
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:45,320
parents come in and turn the light on, oh, I see that it's just, it's not a monster. And that's

1010
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:51,880
shame. If we turn our eyes away from it, which is exactly what it tells us to do, you can't share

1011
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,160
that even with yourself, let alone with someone you love, let alone someone professional. It's

1012
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,840
your fault that that happened to you. You should have dressed differently. You should have not

1013
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,600
been in that place. You should have been better and someone wouldn't have hurt you. You should

1014
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,680
have been different and people wouldn't have treated you so poorly when you were way back when in

1015
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:14,360
school. These are the things that shame tells us, like the devil on the shoulder telling us why we

1016
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:19,160
have to hide it away. And then it gets scarier and scarier. And when we go and shed light on it,

1017
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:25,480
we have never worked with one person. I cannot call to mind a single case where shedding light

1018
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:30,680
on shame and all around it, looking at all the dark corners of it and really bringing it to light

1019
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:37,880
in a process that has its moments of fear and misery, but also has its moments of levity. And

1020
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:43,240
also has its moment of bringing good memories to the fore. Being able to shed the light on that has

1021
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:50,920
never been anything but extremely helpful to the person doing it. But all the impact of shame

1022
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:56,040
tells us not to do that. And society really kind of goes along with that. And the health systems

1023
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:01,080
that want to shuttle us through with a prescription for Prozac, we collude in that, right? So society

1024
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:08,840
colludes with shame in preventing way too many of us from ever getting a handle on our trauma

1025
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:14,280
when it's actually not rocket science to do so. So if you shine that light on shame

1026
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:25,400
and the person now realizes why they feel a certain way, right? The reason I feel so inadequate

1027
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:33,960
is because of these events or this event. And because of this inadequacy, I go and do this

1028
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:42,520
other thing. How do you change the feeling? So step one is understanding why, but then step two

1029
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:48,440
has to be, you have to actually change that feeling, don't you? Yes. The answer to that is you work on

1030
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:54,200
it across time, right? We live in a society that so wants rapid results, right? And it's why we

1031
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,360
throw medicines at so, so many things and throughout the whole field of medicine that we should

1032
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:02,600
infrow medicines at, right? Or you're not healthy. Well, take this medicine, this medicine, this

1033
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,200
medicine, we don't say like, how to change your diet, exercise, I mean, things that you, you know,

1034
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:11,960
you understand as well as anyone on the planet, right? We don't do that. So we look to short-term

1035
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:18,200
fixes, right? And we all, well, we know for our just even basic education in brain biology, right?

1036
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:24,040
That the neurons that fire together wire together, right? So if you and I picked a word out of the

1037
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:29,960
blue and we decide, let's say it over 500 times, right? Then of course, like we'll each be saying

1038
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:34,200
like tonight, right? It'll be in our heads tomorrow morning, right? What if we say that word

1039
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:41,000
5,000 times, right? It'll be in your head next week, right? So, so if we say things to ourselves

1040
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,840
and we have a way of conceptualizing ourselves that we've overly reinforced, it will not go away

1041
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:52,920
overnight, right? But we don't tell people that, right? So when a person comes to it, like a really

1042
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:58,760
say an understanding milestone, like, oh my God, right? The shame is it mine? Like I was six years

1043
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:04,120
old. The shame is that person who hurt me, right? That part of how I make sure we end that session

1044
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:09,800
is all those thoughts and the feelings attached to those thoughts and it's the feelings that make the

1045
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:16,040
difference, right? Are not going to go away, right? They will still be there with you because the only

1046
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:22,440
way they go away is they attenuate over time, right? And you've scored a victory today that

1047
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:27,080
disempowers them, right? That when those thoughts come like, oh, you're worth nothing and that was

1048
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:30,040
your fault. And if you'd been better, that wouldn't have happened to you. Like, okay, you say, wait a

1049
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:34,360
second. I don't actually believe that, right? I can't keep it out of my head, but I'm going to put

1050
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:38,440
you back thought. I'm going to direct my thoughts away from you more quickly. And there's a whole

1051
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:42,520
bunch of strategies around that. And then I'm going to put you back a little bit less powerful

1052
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:50,120
than how you came. And we don't, as a rule, we do not talk to people in that way. And then people

1053
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:54,840
feel terrible and they feel ashamed. And often their practitioners think they failed the treatment

1054
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,680
and like everyone now looks at this negatively because, oh, two, three, four weeks later,

1055
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:01,800
they're not better. There's no way on God's earth they were going to be better after two,

1056
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,360
three, four weeks. Like something that's developed over years doesn't go away that quickly, right?

1057
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:12,120
But if we engage in that process and we take away what? The fear, right? Because otherwise,

1058
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:16,680
if the person feels better, they have this aha moment, right? And then they go home and they're

1059
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:21,240
getting in bed and the same thought goes, you know, tomorrow's not going to be better than today

1060
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:25,240
because you're not worth anything. No, now they feel awful that that thing that happened today

1061
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,120
doesn't mean anything, right? So you have to prepare that person and like, absolutely,

1062
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:34,360
you can be better, but it's going to take place over time. You don't have to be afraid when those

1063
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:39,400
thoughts are still in your, in your minds. I've had people I've worked with who say started their

1064
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:45,160
treatment even before I met them, right? And they had among the most severe repeated negative

1065
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:50,760
thoughts and feelings inside of them. And they may have been doing really well for 10, 20 years,

1066
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:55,400
right? But you put them under enough stress and enough triggering and it'll still come in

1067
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,560
that, oh, you're nothing and you should kill yourself still comes into their mind, right?

1068
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,640
But now they know well enough. They'd be like, wow, that stuff dies hard. There's one person said

1069
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:08,840
that stuff dies hard, not afraid of it. One little bit, because that person understands that he said

1070
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,200
that to think to himself a hundred thousand times. And guess what? It's still going to come back

1071
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:16,440
every now and then. It doesn't mean anything. Because if anything to say to that person doesn't

1072
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:20,680
carry one little bit of information, right? And now that person isn't afraid of it. Not saying,

1073
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,000
oh my gosh, am I going to hurt my, they don't, they, they know, but you, we have to educate

1074
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,280
people and the mental health field doesn't, doesn't put very much value in what's called psycho

1075
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:35,800
education. Let's help, let's help you understand yourself. And I think that's also a lot of what I

1076
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:40,600
do psycho education through the lens of understanding trauma. I think if you told me I could only do one

1077
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,760
thing, I can't, maybe I can't prescribe medicines anymore. I can't do depth psychotherapy. I can't

1078
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,880
use multiple modalities. I can only do one thing and I got to choose. I think I would choose psycho

1079
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:55,240
education about trauma because then man, you arm people with knowledge they didn't have before and

1080
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:59,240
they can go help themselves. They can get help from people who are close to them. They can maybe get

1081
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,800
professional help, but it's that knowledge that helps us even if there's no professional help to

1082
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:08,760
be had, which is also a point of the book that I want anyone who picks that book up to be able to

1083
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:14,280
read their way through it and to end up on the, on the end of it with knowledge and education. They

1084
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:20,200
didn't have before because that I think is what is most impactful and whatever a person does with

1085
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:24,840
that, which may be limited by time, circumstances, resources, all sorts of other things, they're,

1086
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,240
they're now equipped to do something good with it and the field generally does not do that.

1087
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:39,000
You know, when I think about our practice, I think about all of the dimensions of health span. So

1088
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:44,440
when I use the word longevity, I'm referring to two things, lifespan, how long you live and

1089
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:49,160
health span, how well you live. And within health span, there's really three dimensions. There's a

1090
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:53,720
cognitive dimension, which I think most people kind of understand, right? How sharp is their

1091
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:57,320
brain? And most people can understand what the extreme loss of that looks like in the form of

1092
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:03,720
dementia. Then there's a physical dimension, the structural dimension, you know, your ability to

1093
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:07,720
be free of pain, your ability to carry out activities of daily living and your ability

1094
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:12,840
to do the things that you enjoy doing physically. And then there's an emotional component to this,

1095
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:18,040
right? So even though some people would touchy feely, call this mind, body, spirit, I really like

1096
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,400
to think of it as cognitive physical slash exoskeleton and emotional. I think this is the,

1097
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:30,280
I think it's that emotional bucket that is the hardest one for us in our practice to help

1098
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:38,200
patients with because one, we don't have a great set of screening tools. We have really good

1099
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:42,520
screening tools for these other ones. And by the way, on the whole lifespan side, we have lots of

1100
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:48,920
great screening tools. We have biomarkers and MRI scanners and liquid biopsies and colonoscopies. I

1101
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:55,960
mean, we're very good at trying to identify the things that will end your life in a binary

1102
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:03,880
fashion from a cardio respiratory standpoint. We're not very good at identifying the things

1103
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:10,200
that are going to end your life emotionally. You know, I'm working on a book that's a day late,

1104
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:15,240
a dollar short. It'll be out there eventually. But in it, I talk about four types of death.

1105
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:20,040
The first one being the one that people think of cardio respiratory pulmonary death, like the,

1106
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,880
what I call death certificate death. But then I talk about these three other deaths,

1107
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,680
cognitive death. So the really the death of the ability of the brain, the decline of the

1108
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:34,920
ability of the brain with respect to processing speed, short-term memory, long-term memory,

1109
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:41,800
executive function, the physical or exoskeleton death or demise, which is basically that which

1110
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:47,720
leaves a person in pain and unable to carry out these activities of daily living. And then this

1111
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:55,480
emotional death and these three types of other death, types two, three, and four often precede

1112
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:02,280
one. In some ways, the perfect life would be a long life that just goes straight to type one death

1113
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:08,120
without detouring through type two, type three, and type four. But tragically, that's almost never

1114
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:15,720
the case. And so we think so much about how to identify and treat type two, type three, and type

1115
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:21,960
four, but by far the one in which we are the most limited is this identification of type four.

1116
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:28,680
And part of it is, I think shame, there's no question, right? Part of it is inadequacy of

1117
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:34,920
tools. So for example, when it comes to identifying type two or type three, let's use the physical one,

1118
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,480
we have so many ways that we assess people for movement and strength and balance and stability

1119
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:46,760
and stamina and all of these things. And usually once people are confronted with how

1120
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:51,880
bad they are, because almost always relative to our standards for where we want people to be,

1121
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:58,520
most people fall woefully short, but they can see, oh, this is where I should be. If I subscribe to

1122
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:05,960
your ethos that to be a really kick-ass 100-year-old, I need to be a doubly kick-ass 50-year-old.

1123
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:10,040
And here are the steps that we're going to take to train to get you there.

1124
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:18,680
But for years now, I wanted to think how could we do that same sort of screening around emotional

1125
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:26,760
health? And how would it be received? And how would we then implement therapy? Because really,

1126
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:32,120
a person who's doing very well on the type one, type two, and type three, meaning they have no

1127
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:36,600
chronic diseases, they have no acute diseases, their mind is sharp, their body is great,

1128
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:44,520
but they're a slave to some shame that's rooted in trauma. They can often have the most miserable

1129
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:51,480
life. And really, how long they live becomes completely irrelevant. In fact, it almost becomes

1130
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:59,400
paradoxically a curse. It's just more time to suffer. A lot of these people, of course,

1131
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:06,600
are not obviously suffering. So it's very easy to see a person living in a crack house

1132
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:14,280
with needle tracks in their arm and say, are you suffering? Yes. That's not a huge cognitive

1133
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,400
leap for that person. There are enough external markers that we can make that conclusion with

1134
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:22,760
a high degree of... Sure. And they're probably self-aware enough. But when you take somebody

1135
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:28,200
who's actually quite successful by all the metrics of the external world, they're successful

1136
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:33,640
financially, they have a wonderful family, all these other things, it usually takes a bit of

1137
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:41,720
prodding for them to acknowledge. And you have to be astute enough to prod and realize that actually

1138
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:54,200
all is not well. So I'm not a psychiatrist. How do I bring our evaluation of what I call type four

1139
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:58,200
death or demise up to the level of our ability to evaluate the other three?

1140
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:03,480
So the first thing I have to say is you've been kind enough to share with me some excerpts from

1141
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:09,320
the book. And when your book comes out, it will be anything but a daylight and a dollar short. And

1142
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:16,520
I think you're talking about these aspects of life that are just so, so important in ways that

1143
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:22,200
we can understand. Like, am I taking care of myself in the way I want to? Am I paying attention to my

1144
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:29,800
life in the way that I want to? And yes, that emotional aspect of it is the hardest to identify.

1145
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,400
As you said, there aren't serological markers for it. And often the truth of what may be going on

1146
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:43,160
is underneath the surface. And I would say that actually, you already do the things there are to

1147
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:49,000
do. And we could talk about how might it be formalized. But I think of when you may refer

1148
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,120
someone to me, right? And like, why is that, right? And when you tell me if this seems right,

1149
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:59,480
but my thoughts. I guess I would say this, I think we do a better job than most.

1150
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:06,840
I guess what I'm really getting at is, why can't we be doing better? Why is it that there are some

1151
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:13,480
patients whom I suspect there's an issue, but as I broach it, there's complete denial.

1152
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:20,680
Or there's other patients who on the surface will accept it, but then we can't get them to

1153
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:27,800
engage in it. Right. See, I think the processes that you're going through, so again, what do I

1154
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:32,520
think you're doing? And you tell me, does this make sense? I think that you're looking for people

1155
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:39,640
whose actual behavioral choices are running counter current to what they're presenting for.

1156
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,480
And people are presenting to you because they want to be the healthiest they can be.

1157
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:48,520
So it's a little bit maybe the health systems are less like that. People are presenting us with

1158
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:54,200
problems. So you will see if someone presents to you, say, the reason I'm here is I want to be as

1159
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:58,280
healthy as I can be. And then you see that they're not actually behaving that way, right? Or they're

1160
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:04,680
behaving in a way that affords that. And then that will trigger like, ah, something is going on here.

1161
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:09,000
Because otherwise, why would those vectors not all be heading in the same direction?

1162
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,800
Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity in all of us. Right. So if I would

1163
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:19,560
like to be healthy and I come to a healthy health assisting resource, one would presume I'm going to

1164
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:23,560
act in ways that assist that resource and assisting me pretty straightforward. Right.

1165
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:28,040
If we're not acting that way, then it points like there's something going on that's not consistent

1166
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:33,720
with that sort of simple, almost common sense understanding of how to make our lives better.

1167
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:37,800
And that will point towards something in the mental health spectrum, right? Which,

1168
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:44,040
the vast majority of times has its roots in trauma. So if you see people running countercurrent to

1169
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:50,920
their stated goals, right? Or the second, I think there are kind of two occasions on which we see

1170
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:55,960
people coming from your practice, right? The other might be if on discussion, the person is sharing

1171
01:53:55,960 --> 01:54:00,120
something about their inner world that's not consistent with what you're necessarily seeing

1172
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:06,200
on the outside, right? And then their sharing of that dissonance, right? Then leads to, ah, there's

1173
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:11,240
something going on here that it's affecting them emotionally, right? Even if they are still trying

1174
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:15,960
to be healthy, right? But there's some toll that's taking them under the surface that you want to

1175
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:22,120
understand better and guide in the right direction. And the thought would be we could deploy that in

1176
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:28,760
sort of formalized manners in our medical health settings, right? So the person who really wants to

1177
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:34,040
stay alive because they love their grandkids, but they have diabetes and this is their third hospital

1178
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:39,240
admission in two years, right? And you say, okay, like that person doesn't want this to happen. Like

1179
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,520
they like through life and they're grounded to these reasons of like being healthy and staying

1180
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:50,680
alive, but they can't act that way, right? And to look at that and say like maybe there are logistical

1181
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:56,360
barriers, right? Like maybe there are non trauma related barriers to them, like getting to care,

1182
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:01,000
taking medicines, like we can look very hard at that. And then very often I think where that

1183
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,520
process can arrive at is there's something that's preventing that person from taking care of

1184
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:11,080
themselves, right? And then there's the light bulb that says, ah, there's something here for the

1185
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:18,200
mental health, for the mental health aspect of helping, right? Or if, and actually talking to

1186
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:23,640
someone whose life appears to be going well on the outside, but like is your inner world consistent

1187
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:28,760
with your outer world, right? And there are ways of formalizing this potentially in your own practice

1188
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:35,000
setting, right? But then in the broader settings of sort of non-mental health helping, right? So

1189
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,840
look for vectors that run counter current to the person's stated and healthy intentions, right? And

1190
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:46,120
try and get some assessment of what's going on in the person's inner world, right? Because even if

1191
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:50,760
things are going well in the outer world, but these problems are there in the inner world, they

1192
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:57,960
represent risks for the future, right? And again, I come back to like, it's not that hard to do. And

1193
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,200
I think that you're just reflexively doing this, right? Because you're in a sense applying common

1194
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:07,400
sense of, you know, in the practice is if there's something here that seems outside of the fold I'm

1195
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:12,440
operating in, that seems mental health, then you make a referral, right? But the health systems in

1196
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:19,320
our society as a whole can be doing this to help people because it's not that hard to take stock of

1197
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:23,080
someone's interstate. If you, if, you know, if you sit down and talk with them and you establish the

1198
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:28,120
right rapport, or to call out when they're acting counter current with their stated intentions. And

1199
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:33,000
a lot of times the general medical systems kind of push that under the rug because they don't know

1200
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,320
what to do about it, right? So they keep trying to treat the diabetes as best they can with some

1201
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:42,120
knowledge in their head that like, you know, this, this lovely person who wants to be healthy isn't

1202
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:47,000
really on board with this, right? But if you don't know what to do about that, or the last 10 referrals

1203
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,440
you've made to mental health, haven't yielded anything because three months down the road,

1204
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:55,640
the person got a Prozac prescription and they're no better, right? Then there's a sense of futility

1205
01:56:55,640 --> 01:57:01,560
to it. And again, I think if we come back to well-grounded common sense approaches, it does,

1206
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:05,960
it's not all that complicated and it doesn't have to be that esoteric.

1207
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:14,760
Do you, do you think there will be a day when shame is out in the open, right? Because I mean,

1208
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:19,480
that's really what this comes down to, right? You have the stigma of trauma and then you have the,

1209
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:27,080
the, the vector of shame that works so effectively at keeping it in the dark.

1210
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:33,960
Right. And what does a world look like in which the light switch gets turned on and shame has to

1211
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:40,360
retreat to the corner and cower as opposed to let its cape sit over that, which needs to be exposed?

1212
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,040
I mean, I think a big part of that is an education process in our societies, right? That I think you

1213
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:49,080
should start with. And when you say education, what do you mean? Does this, is this something

1214
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:53,560
that occurs in schools? Is this something that occurs in medical schools? Is this something

1215
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:58,440
that is for doctors only? I mean, where, you know, should police be aware of this? I mean, like,

1216
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:04,200
how, how broad a net do you cast? Sure. I think you cast a very broad net and I think it's not

1217
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:09,240
that hard to do that. So I think it starts in early education, right? When you, when you talk

1218
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:13,400
about what goes on in people, when they feel bad, right? When something makes them feel good,

1219
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,800
what happens inside of you? What do you do with that feeling? Right? Help the bully understand

1220
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:22,360
why he or she is bullying, right? When we're, when we're in first or second grade, it goes,

1221
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:26,120
let's help that person understand and look at that person. How would that be done? I mean,

1222
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:32,040
that would require teachers now understanding this, right? Yeah. I think we, we do educate

1223
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:36,280
the professionals. Like we educate the doctors, we educate the teachers. I mean, there's so much

1224
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:41,960
that we do in the education processes that I don't think I'm saying, well, let's bolt on some

1225
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:47,000
process that tries to turn everyone into a therapist, right? But, but there's so many

1226
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,840
things that are done. Think about in medicine, like how many checklists, how much paperwork,

1227
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,880
who's done this utterly and completely non-contributory and everybody knows it, right?

1228
01:58:55,880 --> 01:59:01,720
Why not an approach that's not paperwork intensive or time intensive, right? That just looks at,

1229
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:06,680
look at part of trying to understand somebody is thinking about them through this framing,

1230
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:11,720
right? And, and structuring the mental health resources so that there is a place to send

1231
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:15,080
someone, right? There's a place where we're going to have basic conversations about what's going on

1232
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:20,520
inside of them that then gates the care, right? There are ways we can do this that involve pretty

1233
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:25,720
basic education that can change again, this idea of the whole soup that we're swimming in,

1234
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:30,200
right? Where we start with early education, right? And we run that through educating

1235
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:35,080
professionals, right? Educating police, educating legal systems, right? There are mental health

1236
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:39,640
courts now. I mean, they're, they're not nearly as widespread as they should be, but we are trying

1237
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:45,720
to educate doctors in the legal process and the education process, but we're not prioritizing it

1238
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:52,280
with a sense of urgency, right? It can be different, but we've got to look at it and we've got to say,

1239
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:58,600
yeah, this is worth paying attention to, right? Is this what's in large part or in very significant

1240
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:04,760
part, driving that we have now over 100,000 drug deaths in this country over the course of a year,

1241
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:12,280
like why do we not feel a sense of urgency and want to look at our, the way that we provide help,

1242
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:17,800
right? And to say, do what we're doing, does what we're doing that drives doctors to burnout,

1243
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:24,120
right? Which is a term that I can't stand. I mean, when I grew up, burnout was a negative term to say

1244
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:28,360
about somebody. Oh, they couldn't handle it, right? And now they're just in a corner smoking cigarettes

1245
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:33,320
doing their own thing. Like that was an insult to someone. And now we level that at doctors

1246
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:39,800
who are often traumatized by the health systems that they work in and the unreasonable expectations

1247
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,800
and that they're treating charts and computers all the time and don't have enough time with their

1248
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:49,400
patients. Like why do we not look at this and say, has this gone mad, right? That we spend more money

1249
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:55,000
than any developed country on healthcare, yet we have the worst outcomes. And we're the worst

1250
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,560
about things that involve direct contact with humans, preventive aspects of healthcare,

1251
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:05,000
treatment over time. Like why can't we look at this with a sense of urgency that says, oh,

1252
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:13,480
this isn't working, right? And then I think at the other end, people who other people look to and

1253
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:19,480
have a sense of respect for that will talk about their own trauma, right? As, you know, in some

1254
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:24,920
very small way, like I'm trying to do, right? And you do, right? And Tim Ferriss has done and even

1255
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,760
Stephanie Germanata, so Lady Gaga, who is kind to write the forward for the book, that she talks

1256
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:37,720
about her humanness, right? That we all, no matter who we are, are susceptible to this. So from the

1257
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:43,560
one end, people who have any power whatsoever and authority need to not shrink away from this. So if

1258
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:48,600
I'm giving a talk to a bunch of doctors, right, I'm not going to pretend that I don't have any trauma,

1259
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:54,520
right? So yes, we need, I think have a responsibility to be open and honest about the

1260
02:01:54,520 --> 02:02:00,040
things that have impacted us if we have any public presence whatsoever, right? Let alone if a person

1261
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:05,320
has a big public presence, if that can be done safely and reasonably for the person, of course.

1262
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:11,800
So that's one aspect of it. And the other aspect is the most important is on this grassroots level

1263
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:20,040
of changing how we frame mental health in the world around us and starting to get us curious

1264
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:28,840
about it at very early stages of life. When that bully tells you that you're lousy because of what

1265
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:34,360
you look like or where you come from, right? Then what does that make you feel? Let's start looking

1266
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:39,320
at that reflexive sense of shame, right? Okay, can you stop and think about that, right? Like you

1267
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:45,160
feel bad, right? When that happens and what happens next? Well, you feel bad about yourself,

1268
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:50,280
right? Okay, let's put a full stop there, right? Like that person's hurting you because he feels

1269
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:55,160
bad about himself, right? Like, and you don't, so then you start to put a barrier, right? Between

1270
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:59,960
the reflexive shame, right? And the person feeling bad about themselves. Because how many people

1271
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:06,680
don't actually logically feel bad about themselves, right? But they do actually feel bad about

1272
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:11,480
themselves and it's the feeling that matters, not the facts, right? And we've got to start looking

1273
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:16,040
at that because that is the plain and obvious truth that pervades the society around us. And

1274
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:22,120
we are doing a very poor job of developing understanding in us as individuals at any stage

1275
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:29,320
of life and as a society. And I can't believe that we're not seeing the dysfunction in the social

1276
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,920
rifts that we're having in the ineffectiveness of the whole of our medical system, right? These are

1277
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:40,280
big all-encompassing aspects of our society and we see, hey, these things are not going well,

1278
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:45,640
right? And if we look at the roots of it, I think it's clear where a lot of it is coming from and

1279
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:50,200
also what we can do about it. Which is why I feel the book is ultimately uplifting. I mean, I'm

1280
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:54,760
pointing out problems, but I'm not pointing them out in some way of like pointing them out and then

1281
02:03:54,760 --> 02:04:00,600
we'll, we don't want to do about it, right? I mean, I'm pointing out solutions that I think

1282
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:04,680
are quite simple and well-grounded. And if we just follow them through, that's resonating with

1283
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:09,880
people because I think it does resonate with common sense. A moment ago, you alluded to a

1284
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:15,720
statistic that I think for many people is just almost impossible to fathom, which is the United

1285
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:23,640
States has just for the first time ever surpassed a 100,000 person mortality for a 12 month period.

1286
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:29,720
So 100,000 people have overdosed in the United States for the first time in 12 months. Do you

1287
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:40,120
see this as an epidemic of trauma and shame, or do you see this as really just a new escape valve

1288
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:45,880
for it based on the availability of cheap and unfortunately highly potent opioids?

1289
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:51,000
Yeah, I think it's a combination of both. And I think the data tells us that more and more people

1290
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,400
are feeling desperate and disenfranchised, right? Are feeling like, look, I can't make my way in the

1291
02:04:55,400 --> 02:05:01,000
world, right? Whatever my chosen route of endeavor is, I can't make a living in that, right? I can't

1292
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,280
support a family in that. I can't get ahead. I can't feel good about myself, right? And we see that in

1293
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:12,200
aspects like almost the entire service industry, right? Which has changed to a place where people

1294
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:18,440
can't have careers that then support their lives and support a family, like was the case even 20

1295
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:24,520
something years ago, right? We see that even people who have good jobs, right? Who feel like,

1296
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,840
okay, I finally got my way for work on if I have a good job. That often that job is running them

1297
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:31,640
ragged in a way that they can't take care of themselves and they can't take care of their

1298
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:37,000
families. And they feel the same desperation as a person who doesn't have a job, right? And this

1299
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,120
desperation builds anger and frustration and resentment and all these other symptoms, depression

1300
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:48,680
and panic that spin off of it, right? And that makes it much more appealing to soothe in the

1301
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:53,960
short term. Like that's a basic psychological fact of human beings, right? The more pain you're in in

1302
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:58,680
the short term, the more you're going to choose a short term solution without any consideration to

1303
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:03,480
the long term, right? I mean, if I'm absolutely desperately miserable and you've got something

1304
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:08,680
that can make me better right now, I'm not going to ask what that may do to me tomorrow, right?

1305
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:16,920
So we have developed a society that has become more and more and more hardhearted, right? Towards

1306
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:21,400
people's attempts to make their way in the world, right? And I think we see that with the response

1307
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,400
to the pandemic of, you know, I'm going to respond in the way that I want and I don't really care

1308
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:32,200
about you, right? And like we've seen enough of that, that, you know, cringe at times at our, like

1309
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:38,280
our inability to even have basic compassion for others, which of course isn't everyone, right? But

1310
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:42,680
like, I think that's present in society in ways that it wasn't before. And I think it's reflected

1311
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:48,920
in the rhetoric and the dialogue that's acceptable, right? That not that long ago, the way people often

1312
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:54,520
behave who have a public presence, right? Would have led to censure by everyone that would say,

1313
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:59,480
Hey, I don't even care that you're advocating for what I want or even for me directly. Like,

1314
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:04,040
I can't support you if you're going to behave that way, talk that way, denigrate people that way.

1315
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:11,480
Like we've moved far away from that, right? And we need to look at what are we doing in the world

1316
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:20,680
around us, right? How are we handling ourselves and are we indirectly promoting this ethic of

1317
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:26,440
not really caring, right? That leads to the desperation that leads people to soothe with

1318
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:33,080
drugs, right? There's a very macabre, it's not even a joke, it's a tragic

1319
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:41,000
atrocity, right? That people will say, Oh, I'm, you know, gosh, I have four people who are drug

1320
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,080
addicted in my practice. I'm going to see this afternoon or, you know, or 10 people, right? And

1321
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:49,880
you know, it's not who it used to be, right? Because before it was people who'd sifted down

1322
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:53,960
to places in society where societies really turned their backs on them. Now it's people from all walks

1323
02:07:53,960 --> 02:08:00,040
of life, right? And we see that socioeconomic demographic, educational demographic, geographic,

1324
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:09,800
demographic, racial, religious, ethnic concept, we've gone beyond that, right? Where now we're

1325
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:15,480
all menaced by this, right? Because there's often a desperation to soothe that there wasn't that shot

1326
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:21,880
through every demographic we have. And if we continue to turn away from that fact, then we

1327
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:27,880
continue to look at statistics like that and say, Oh my gosh, how horrible. Okay, right? Like we

1328
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:33,800
don't do anything about it, right? Which is a tacit acceptance of it, right? If we don't look at what

1329
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:37,880
are we doing to people that drives them to desperation, right? Then we're not going to

1330
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:42,520
make that statistic better. And how much is going on behind closed doors in the pandemic? How much

1331
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:47,320
violence behind closed doors, neglect behind closed doors, drug and alcohol abuse behind closed doors,

1332
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:51,400
are we going to look more at this or are we going to just pay lip service to looking at it,

1333
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:55,160
right? While we don't actually change anything. And then we'll be going, Oh my gosh, it's so

1334
02:08:55,160 --> 02:09:01,240
terrible. It's three years from now that number is 140,000, right? Well, if we don't really care now

1335
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:05,240
as a society, we just want to marvel at the number and say how bad it is and do nothing.

1336
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:08,600
Well, it's exactly where we're going to go. That's why the number has been increasing, right?

1337
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:12,920
I mean, it's not rocket science to say that either. You just extrapolate that line ahead

1338
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:17,560
and that gets worse and not better. Unless we look at it in a way where we accept like,

1339
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:25,800
we got to do something different, right? Because this is staggering in the human misery that it

1340
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:31,480
speaks to not just a hundred thousand people lost, not just, right? I mean, not just a hundred

1341
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:35,400
thousand people. What about all the people who love those hundred thousand people? Like,

1342
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:40,280
what are we doing? Right? Which is why when people would say, Oh, sometimes I'll get approached,

1343
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,400
I'm doing something that's very niche, right? Like I'm interested in trauma, right? And I say,

1344
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:50,920
well, this is not a niche, right? You get up to numbers like that, right? There's a cascade

1345
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:56,280
through the population, right? And it doesn't have to be like this that our burdens of trauma just

1346
02:09:56,280 --> 02:10:04,680
grow and grow and grow. We should be appalled by that number, appalled enough to do something

1347
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:13,720
about it. Paul, a lot of times we treat people based on the symptom of their trauma or we at

1348
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:19,080
least categorize them that way. And this is even within the lens of helping people and acknowledging

1349
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:24,840
their trauma. So for example, addiction is a very common manifestation of trauma. And

1350
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:29,800
the most obvious of those, or at least the one that probably gets most people's attention would

1351
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:35,640
be substance addiction, right? Alcohol or drugs, but there's work addiction. There's process

1352
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:38,920
addiction. There's gambling addiction. There's sex addiction. There are actually lots of other

1353
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:47,080
types of addictions, but we could bucket those as addictions. There's codependencies. There's anger,

1354
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:53,240
perfectionism, other means of control. We talked about eating disorders.

1355
02:10:55,720 --> 02:11:03,080
It seems that one way to think about this is treating people together who have similar end

1356
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:10,520
states. So you go to a 12 step meeting because if it's AA, it's people with alcohol. If it's

1357
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,160
Al-Anon, it's family members of people with alcohol. If it's NA, it's narcotics. If it's

1358
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:20,440
essay, et cetera, it's sex. Has anyone ever thought about doing the opposite, which is

1359
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:28,360
rather than take everybody whose issue is alcohol addiction and having them come to a meeting, which

1360
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:35,240
by the way, I'm not advocating against. What if we bundled people together through the common lens

1361
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:40,280
of what the trauma was? Is that something that's ever been thought about? And would that be more

1362
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:46,520
or less efficacious than the current approach? In other words, you have a meeting which has lots

1363
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:50,840
of people in it who have very different manifestations of their trauma. You're going

1364
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:56,440
to have someone who's addicted to alcohol, someone who's a workaholic, someone who's a rageaholic,

1365
02:11:57,160 --> 02:12:01,080
someone who's a completely codependent, someone who's got debilitating anxiety, someone who's got

1366
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:06,360
debilitating depression. But what they all have in common is they were completely neglected by their

1367
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:10,760
parents. That's their common thing. Would there be any advantage to doing that or is it better the

1368
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:15,560
way we typically think of doing it? Yeah, I think there's a huge advantage to that. And

1369
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:23,400
at one point I was medical director for a clinic and we had programs running for helping groups.

1370
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:30,360
And it was by and large, it was all around substances, but I wouldn't separate it by

1371
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,760
what the substance was. I think we even get that fine. Now we're going to separate by what the

1372
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:41,880
substance is. Alcohol versus narcotics. Right. And even at that level, let alone at the higher

1373
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:47,080
levels of this person is angry, this person is addicted to unhealthy foods. Right. There's so

1374
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:52,680
many ways in which the addictive processes can take hold of our brains in order to provide some

1375
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:59,160
short-term sense of control or short-term relief from the desperation of feeling out of control.

1376
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:03,720
Right. And when we parse that out too much, then again, we're just trying to check

1377
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:10,600
boxes and we're telling that person that what you have, this thing that is in a sense your burden

1378
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:16,760
to carry is so much about you. Right. Well, I'm an alcoholic and I'm a rage-aholic. Right.

1379
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:22,840
And there's just the very language we use about that is often so stigmatizing. That's the thing

1380
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:27,400
that's bad about you. Right. Like that's often the message. Again, not always, but that's often

1381
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:33,560
the message that it sends as opposed to like none of us comes out of the womb. Right. And alcoholic

1382
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:37,880
or rage-aholic or addicted to unhealthy foods. Right. They have like, look, what's happened to

1383
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:42,440
us along the way, right, that leads us to this place. And that's how we make a search for

1384
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:49,400
commonality. Right. So, so we have a set of processes that want to further parse things out.

1385
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:55,720
Right. We're so overly reductionist. Right. That oftentimes we would see where the person who was

1386
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:59,400
an alcoholic would feel like, well, I don't want to sit in a room with it with the person who's

1387
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:03,720
addicted to cocaine. Like we don't, as if there's like nothing in common. Right. As opposed to like,

1388
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:08,360
yeah, what's what is in common? Because I knew the health histories of those people, right?

1389
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:13,080
Because I was the medical director of the clinic. Right. And, and I would say, right, what, what is

1390
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:19,160
80% commonality as a driving force amongst everybody is trauma. Right. And, and, and that's

1391
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:26,200
just here. If you step further back, you see that across the things that we, we get short-term relief

1392
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:33,000
from at the expense of our long-term health. And the over reductionism, I think is a facet of

1393
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,760
wanting to just put things in little buckets and then gaining some satisfaction from that.

1394
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:41,640
Right. But now, okay. Now all it is is in a bucket and actually being in that much of a bucket,

1395
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:45,640
right? You know, like a marble that goes down, right? Is like, now you can't get to it. Right.

1396
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:50,280
Or you can't get to what's real about it instead of like, you know, what's going on in a lot of

1397
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,160
people say at least is trauma. Can we put those people together and look at trauma, which

1398
02:14:55,160 --> 02:15:01,160
ironically is what the real sophisticated helping resources around trauma are doing.

1399
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:04,360
Right. I mean, that's often what say the bridge to recovery is doing. It's looking at like,

1400
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:10,760
Hey, what is your trauma? Right. Okay. Now let's go forward from there. Right. But that's because

1401
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:15,400
they're bringing a sophistication to it. And people who do that work just reflexively know that they

1402
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:19,560
know that that, that that's not different. You can look at people who are addicted to one thing

1403
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:25,000
versus another, and you're not finding massive differences between them. And, you know, the

1404
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,640
aspects of art, the science of it all catching up with it shows that, right? It's hijacking the

1405
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:33,800
same machinery in the brain. And you know, you can't tell the difference. Not like one substance

1406
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:38,360
looks different from another in the brain or one thing a person is addicted to for relief of

1407
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:44,440
distress. So it's like, we know all of it, but we have these entrenched ways of looking at it

1408
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:50,600
through the lens of, of how medical care is or how society views it. And we're so far beyond the

1409
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,560
science, right? And I will say this that, you know, say this a fair amount that if you're in

1410
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:03,560
a very well-defined field of medicine, let's say cardiology or so, where we kind of know

1411
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:07,320
how to assess people, how to understand people, there's a lot of data behind the interventions.

1412
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:12,440
If you're practicing, like, you know, even just a couple of years ago, like that's not okay. And

1413
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:17,560
one will identify that, right? And, and that's not okay, right? We'll have to change that, right?

1414
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:24,440
But in mental health, the practice within individual practitioners and the systems

1415
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:29,800
can be antiquated by a half a century, right? Or, you know, or a couple thousand years in some

1416
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:35,240
cases. And like, we don't come in and look at that, right? There are programs that are taking care of

1417
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:40,600
people for opiate dependence that don't even talk to them about a medicine that you can get a shot

1418
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:45,640
of that prevents you from overdosing when you leave, right? Like it's somehow okay not to even

1419
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:53,400
talk about that, right? Because we let all of this lag behind. And yes, part of it is, I think,

1420
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,880
how the field has handled it and the science isn't as well developed, but it's not like there's no

1421
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:05,080
science and it's not like there's no obviousness to what we could be doing that we're just simply not

1422
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:10,040
doing. And I think a big part of that is the stigma, the shame that we don't want to come in and look

1423
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:15,240
at all of it and say there's an obvious here that we're just not paying attention to. Because if the

1424
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:19,560
shame is shot through humans, then it is also shot through the humans who are making those

1425
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:27,480
decisions around resource allocation and how do we approach the helping process?

1426
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:32,520
Changing gears for a second, Paul. The final thing I want to kind of ask you about is

1427
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:40,440
the role of two substances in particular psilocybin and MDMA, both of which I've talked

1428
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:46,280
about in previous podcasts as they pertain to trauma. I'm curious as to what your experience

1429
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:53,720
is with this and maybe more importantly, what is your optimism around these two molecules,

1430
02:17:54,520 --> 02:18:01,960
both of which are really moving quite along a pathway towards a clinical approval, a legalization

1431
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:12,680
for clinical use. In the case of MDMA, it is for in fact PTSD. So kind of curious as to whether you

1432
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:21,400
see that as an amazing adjunct to what we're talking about or a slight adjunct or potentially

1433
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:31,960
less. I see it as among the brightest sort of shining hopes for the future. And I think the data

1434
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:39,000
both from decades ago and the more recent data and the clinical experience in trials and the

1435
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:47,080
firsthand reports tell us things that are so incredibly powerful and that fit with a lot of

1436
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:52,840
what we've thought about and understood about brain biology and about psychology. There's a way

1437
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:59,800
in which it provides so much greater potential for understanding and helping. And of course,

1438
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:06,280
the process is in place so that these very, very powerful tools can be understood and deployed

1439
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:11,880
safely and effectively. And in the context of all of that, I think that the hope is immense.

1440
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:18,440
A story I'll tell sometimes to try to capture that is where I grew up was close to the Delaware

1441
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:24,120
Raritan Canal. In colonial times, it ran between New York and Philadelphia. It was part of a network.

1442
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:30,120
I was always fascinated that artifacts would be found. There's somebody to be fishing and find a

1443
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:34,840
vase or something. And I was amazed. These barges went up and down. I'm like, what's in there?

1444
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:40,680
And people would find things and that was interesting. But then at some point in time,

1445
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:44,920
they drained a whole section of it. And when the section was drained, my goodness,

1446
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:50,840
what they found and what they saw. And it's the same analogy that I think the helping powers of

1447
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:58,760
these substances are so strong that they can get us to places of really seeing what's going on

1448
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:04,040
inside of us and shifting how those brain pathways, which have been so changed. And again,

1449
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:10,200
the science tells us this, this is not esoteric. We have more science that is similar to what

1450
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:16,840
the CAT scans can do for the appendix to see that being able to do that with these helping

1451
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:26,120
modalities allows for understanding and is so predisposes to and is permissive of change

1452
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:31,960
in ways that can let people reorient much, much faster. So I think there's a potential here for

1453
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:38,520
even a revolution within the field, but we have to safely and effectively incorporate those arrows

1454
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:44,440
into the quiver. And then we see, of course, what is often seen, which is many of the people or

1455
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:50,760
organizations wielding that have the magic amulet of like, I am the source of the helping resources,

1456
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:56,280
don't like this. So we see some aspects of traditional psychiatric care that don't like

1457
02:20:56,280 --> 02:21:02,200
this. And I think that's through a sense of threat that I think the power of these resources

1458
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:09,560
make a lot of the tools that I wield seem maybe a little bit paltry in comparison. Now, that's not

1459
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:16,520
always the case. And if that is the case, wonderful. There are new powerful tools coming to the fore.

1460
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:23,720
We need to approach it, those of us in Western medicine, through a lens of being respectful of

1461
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:29,640
what that is and wanting to understand the new modalities and approaching it from a lens that

1462
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:34,200
says, look, if I'm going to help people, I'm going to hold myself forth as knowing how to do so,

1463
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:39,400
then I better know what all the arrows in the quiver are and understand them enough that I can

1464
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:45,960
either deploy them or I can understand who can deploy them in a way that does justice to the

1465
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:50,440
person coming in the door, right? If I'm coming in the door for help, I don't care what it is.

1466
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:55,720
I want the person who's going to help me and have all the possible arrows in their quiver. And I

1467
02:21:55,720 --> 02:22:01,400
think we can get to a place of incorporating this. But again, society and the helping systems have to

1468
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:08,200
bend a little bit to acknowledge the incredible potential. And then we work towards integrating

1469
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:12,840
instead of splitting. And we're in a societal mode in this country that's very much splitting,

1470
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:19,320
whether it's sociological, it's political, and even medical, right? And I think, again, I come

1471
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:24,520
back to the basic theme of, I think it's trauma that leads us to reject new helping resources

1472
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:30,120
because they may be threatening to our power within a discipline, right? And that by regrounding to

1473
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:36,200
really the first principles of knowledge and of helping, then I think we again come back to an

1474
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:41,560
urgency to ground ourselves to the basic common sense of understanding everything that could be

1475
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:47,240
helpful and having all of those arrows in the quiver of health systems or of, to the extent

1476
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:53,960
possible, individual practitioners. Paul, as always, it's great to sit down with you. And especially

1477
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:58,920
in a case like this where it's not just me you're talking to, but so many other people who I suspect

1478
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:05,000
will really benefit from this. Tell people again the title of your book and other places they can

1479
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:11,080
look to find resources. Sure. So the title of the book is Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic. And you

1480
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:16,040
can find it if you just Google me, Paul Conti, or the clinic I work in, which is Pacific Premier

1481
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:21,080
Group. You'll come up with links that talk a little bit about the book or the principles

1482
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:28,280
contained therein. And there's so many good helping resources around. NAMI is one of them

1483
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,320
that across the country has- And sorry, is that NAMI? What's that?

1484
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,760
Yeah, so NAMI. Okay, NAMI.

1485
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:41,000
I say so. A great access to resources often on a local level. There's so much help to be

1486
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:47,240
had. And some of that help we can access in our own homes. We can access through people that we

1487
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:52,680
love and who love us. We can access by thinking about what's going on inside of us and others.

1488
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:58,360
And I think that's such a part of the message that I want to deliver that it just isn't esoteric.

1489
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:03,320
And if we ground to what's really going on inside of us and paying attention to it, and

1490
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:10,600
in a sense being brave enough to face it because we see hope in facing it that we can begin a

1491
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:16,200
process of really helping ourselves and others. And I've just seen that unfold so, so many times,

1492
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:21,400
including in myself, that I really believe in it. And I'm so glad that we've had this conversation

1493
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:28,600
that is about some of the real big picture of it and some of the more kind of rarified

1494
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:33,400
medical aspects of it. And I think a real understanding of it runs the whole gamut,

1495
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:39,640
but is ground in that simplicity of what's really needed and what's important to help

1496
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:45,240
ourselves and to help other people. And I so appreciate you having me on and having such a

1497
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:50,520
good friend who's also such a good colleague and helps this discussion unfold in a way that really

1498
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:55,880
helps get the message out there because we all need the message. Thank you, Paul. You're welcome.
