00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,600
Matt, it's great to finally be able to do one of these in person with you. We've done a lot of

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,920
these remotely. We're taking advantage of the fact that you're in Texas for filming a documentary

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,840
about aging, which is pretty awesome. So when we knew that this was going to happen, we said,

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,680
well, let's take advantage of you being here and let's come up with something that we both talk

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,880
about so much over email, which is to say, I don't think a week goes by that we aren't exchanging

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
an email about some aspect of the relationship or the interspace between nutrition and longevity.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,640
Does that speak to our ignorance? Does that speak to the ubiquity of such content? I don't know.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
What does that say about us?

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Yeah. I mean, well, I think it's an area that a lot of people are really interested in, and it

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,960
certainly intersects with popular culture. So having been in the aging field for a long time,

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,560
I certainly recognize how complicated that biology is. And I think the biology of nutrition is equally

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,440
complicated. And when you get at the interface of those two, it's really hard, I think, sometimes

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,720
to draw a definitive conclusion. So a new paper will come out, and you usually read the papers

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,080
before I do, and you're like, hey, what do you think about this? And then we throw it back and

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,400
forth. But I think it's hard sometimes to get to concrete answers. So certainly we'll try to do

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,000
that today. But I also think this will be a little bit of a theme that there are many things we don't

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,600
understand yet about optimal nutrition and how that intersects with optimal health span.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah. And you and I have spent so much time on the podcast speaking about the molecules,

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,320
the molecules, right? Of course, our favorite being rapamycin, but all sorts of them, right?

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,240
We recently talked about NMN, NR, NAD, we've talked about metformin. And basically, it's easier

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,080
almost to ask the questions from the standpoint of geoprotective molecules, because the

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,120
intervention is much cleaner. Yeah, absolutely.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,400
Like, are you taking this drug, yes or no? And of course, what's interesting about that, and I think

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,080
it speaks to what we're going to talk about today, think about the one drug among those that stands

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,680
out, which is rapamycin. Even within that, just I think yesterday or two days ago, you and me and

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,720
David Sabatini had a back and forth about timing of the dose, frequency within the dosing schedule,

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,840
the dose itself. I mean, even with a drug, it's still very complicated to say, well, what about

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,600
during this fate? Because the study I think we were talking about was looking at mice and it was

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,480
asking the question of early exposure of rapamycin later in life, constant dosing, intermittent dosing.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,880
That's for a drug and we're still struggling to piece it together. Now imagine trying to ask

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,080
that question of your food. Yeah, and I mean, I think we'll obviously talk a lot as well about

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,320
the animal models and what they can tell us about what might affect human aging, but the big piece

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,520
that gets lost with the animal models on top of all that complexity is the environment, right? So,

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,520
we keep these mice in a well-controlled environment, usually relatively pathogen-free, and they live

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,560
in that same environment their entire life. Now you think about the human experience where our

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,960
environment is extremely complicated. We're constantly getting bombarded with all sorts of

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,680
challenges and infectious agents, and our environment changes dramatically throughout

39
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,120
our lives. In fact, maybe this is something we want to touch on. A lot of the epidemiological

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,240
studies on optimal nutrition are from 20, 30, 40 years ago, right? The average human environment is

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,960
very different today than it was when those studies were done. And how does that potentially

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,960
change the interaction between nutrition and health outcomes? I think it's a really interesting

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,880
but challenging question to address to anybody's satisfaction, honestly. Yeah, that's actually a

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,200
great point. And I made a similar point on a totally different topic, which was all of the studies

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,040
that talk about cancer screening are very backwards looking by definition, right? You

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,360
have to look at controlled trials that were done in the past, but the technology of radiology is

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,880
changing so much. Radiology is a very physics-based field of medicine. And so when you read a study

48
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,960
that talked about mammography for screening, well, and it was a 15-year study, right? So,

49
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,960
it's a great study. Well, by definition, it was done sort of based on 30 to 20-year-old technology

50
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,160
that by the time the study has been completed, you have the follow-up data, you write up the paper,

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,360
it doesn't necessarily represent what's happening today. And that's a huge

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,560
challenge of evaluating that type of data. Yeah. And in people, because we age so slowly,

53
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,840
there's really not a lot you can do about that if you want to try to do correlative longitudinal

54
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,320
studies of aging, right? Because people age so slowly, the people who are in their

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,120
70s today were in their 30s 40 years ago. And so the environment that they were in

56
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,160
is probably quite different than the environment that 30-year-olds are in today. So, there's not

57
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,680
a great way around that. I think the key is to recognize that limitation and be potentially even

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,400
more careful about assuming causation from correlation over many decades. Yeah.

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,480
So, as a bit of a mea culpa on the topic of nutrition, which is really my least favorite

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,400
topic despite the fact that it keeps coming up on this podcast and it's unavoidable,

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,560
as I reflect back on my own understanding of this topic, the strength with which I held

62
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,400
convictions over the past more than decade, I would say I've gone in reverse, right? I have looser

63
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,360
and looser convictions as time goes on and I view fewer and fewer things with certainty as time goes

64
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:07,960
on. And when I think about this problem clinically, I have what I would consider to be an incredibly

65
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,400
simple framework, which is if I'm looking at a patient, I'm asking a question, are you over

66
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,160
nourished or under nourished? Are you under muscled or adequately muscled? And then on... So,

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,640
that's a two by two, right? And then are you metabolically healthy or not? That's sort of my

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,760
first order question. Now, one of those spaces doesn't really have too many people in it. The

69
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:45,000
adequately muscled, under nourished, metabolically unhealthy bucket doesn't really exist. So,

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,800
it's not... People aren't uniformly distributed in those buckets, but it's a pretty good way to sort

71
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,480
people. And you can't sort someone by looking at them into that bucket, but by looking at them,

72
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,840
doing some functional testing, looking at their biomarkers, and that might include also doing

73
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,920
things like a DEXA scan where you can actually get some objective data, you can pretty quickly

74
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,040
figure that out. And the reason we think that's important is it helps us understand,

75
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,880
do you need an energy deficit? Do you need an energy surplus? What's your protein intake need

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:28,440
to be to achieve that in combination with your calorie needs? And the hardest of those to treat

77
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,520
by far is over nutrition, under muscled. And unfortunately, that's a very common phenotype.

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,680
That's a lot of people these days. Yeah. No, I mean, I think that as a general approach,

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,000
first order approach, that makes a ton of sense. And I think one of the things that that allows

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,680
you to recognize, right, is that the optimal strategy is... There's no one size fits all,

81
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,000
I guess would be the way I'd say it, right? Different people are going to have different needs

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,880
nutritionally, and what works really well for one person, may not work at all for another person.

83
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:09,480
And so I think kind of looking at that level allows you to not have to try to say,

84
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,600
everybody should be doing X, right? So I think that is pretty similar to the way I think about

85
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,160
it. Obviously, I don't practice medicine, and I try not to make recommendations for what people

86
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,600
should do. But in my own life, that's generally the way that I try to approach it as well, and I

87
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,400
hope I'm doing okay. You haven't tested me yet, so you can't tell me which bucket I'm in. But I

88
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,320
think I'm doing okay for my age with my nutritional strategies. And the other thing that I sort of have

89
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,880
realized, similar to what I think you were saying before, is that it's an ongoing learning process.

90
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,200
And so I think it's really important that we be willing to change our beliefs about

91
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,320
nutrition and other aspects of health as more data comes in. So I think if you take that strategy,

92
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,040
then you can be open to the possibility that what you believed 10 years ago,

93
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,120
might not have been exactly right. And maybe we need to tweak it a little bit.

94
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,720
My personal view on nutrition, I'll be honest, I have real trust problems with nutritionists.

95
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,800
And I think it, in part, it stems from, I remember very vividly when I was,

96
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,680
I think it was probably in my early 20s. And I read one of these diet guru books, and it was

97
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,080
the theme, this was, I'm going to date myself, but this was early 90s, I guess.

98
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,640
The theme back then was, you could eat anything you wanted as long as you cut out the fat.

99
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,840
You could have this really high, simple carbohydrate diet, just keep it low fat,

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,960
and you'll be fine. And we now know that's exactly wrong. So I think I can't help but

101
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,120
look at a lot of what people, you know, the what I would put sort of on the fad diet side,

102
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,320
the diet gurus, what they're saying today, how do we know 10 years from now, we're not going to look

103
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,120
back on that. And again, be like, that just makes no sense. I think some of us today can look at

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,200
some of what's out there and say, that just makes no sense. But, you know, I think, again, this gets

105
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,760
back to the, to what I was saying before, it's not that I, it's not that I would say nutrition

106
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,480
sciences across the board, low quality, I think they're actually really good scientists doing

107
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,920
really good work in this area. It's just a really hard problem. And I do think to some extent,

108
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,880
the biology of aging, and the biology of nutrition do share that, and that they are these are

109
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,680
extremely complicated biological systems that we're, we're trying to understand in the, in the

110
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,240
context of sort of this, this changing environment over time, right? And so, so I don't, I don't

111
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,960
blame the scientists, I just think we have to be really careful to recognize what the limitations

112
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,920
are and not draw really strong conclusions. Like everybody should eat, you know, a low protein

113
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,600
diet, right? That's kind of one of the fads that are out there today. I think that's, that's a

114
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,320
mistake to recommend across the board, you know, nutritional strategies for everyone. I guess the

115
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,400
last thing, sorry, I'm talking a long time here, but I guess the last thing that what you said,

116
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,680
you know, makes, makes me think of as well. And I think this is really important because people

117
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,560
lose sight of this is, you know, exactly what you said, if you can be, you know, somewhere close to

118
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,920
optimal nutritional intake, right? We just say total calories, regardless of composition,

119
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,720
body composition is somewhere close to where it should be. That's, that's a big chunk of what you

120
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,360
need to give yourself the best chance of being healthy going forward, right? You don't have to

121
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,400
optimize every single thing. Now, I know you're all into optimization, and I respect that about

122
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,320
you. I think if you can do that, that's great. But you don't have to to get most of the benefits. And

123
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,360
so I think starting from that big picture perspective, allows you to get most people,

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
most of the way there. And then when they're most of the way there, you can focus on how do we get

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,880
that last 10, 20, 30%, whatever it is. Actually, I couldn't agree with you more, Matt, and I would

126
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,640
argue, and I do argue now in a very different way from where I used to be a few years ago.

127
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,280
You know, there are most things in my life where I don't like the 80 20 principle, you know, my good

128
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,080
friend Tim Ferriss, like he's the king of this, right? He's the king of how can I get 80% of the

129
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,080
learning with 20% of the time. And I've never seen anybody who can do it like Tim, like the guy can

130
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,320
learn a language in a month, he can be 80% proficient in a language in a month, right? I'm

131
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,520
the opposite. I'm the guy who loves the tail. I love the asymptote. I love the perfection of

132
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,360
something. I would say in nutrition, that is exactly not where my interest lies. I agree

133
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,600
that you can just get 80% of this right by focusing on, you know, exactly what we've talked

134
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,600
about and the details, the complete optimization are not worth it. And it's instead better to put

135
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,920
that effort into exercise. That's where I think if you're going to really go down the rabbit hole

136
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,720
and put more of your mental energy, more of your time and more of your focus into something,

137
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,880
you have far more of an ROI on the exercise front than eking out incremental value on the

138
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,840
nutrition front. And I've joked about this before, other guests on the podcast, Lane Norton and I

139
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,760
have had riffs on this back and forth. The people who sit there on Twitter, which I realize is not

140
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,960
a representative sampling of the world. It's simply an annoying vocal group of people

141
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,200
who will waste endless hours debating the finer points of their dietary pet peeves,

142
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,800
who can't do 10 pull ups is amazing. I mean, there should be a rule that says, if you can't deadlift

143
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,000
twice your body weight and do 15 pull ups, you shouldn't be allowed to pontificate endlessly.

144
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
You're not allowed to be on Twitter.

145
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,320
About the finer points of nutrition.

146
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,160
You know, we can talk to Elon about that. Maybe that can be a new rule.

147
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Okay, so let's look, I think we've established nutrition matters here. I mean,

148
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,720
but I think at the same time, you know, I think David Allison said it once to me.

149
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,040
It's amazing how little we know about this subject matter, kind of rehashing what we said.

150
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,440
We know that too much and too little are bad. And for most of our existence, we were worried

151
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,040
about the too little problem. The too much problem has become a relatively recent phenomenon.

152
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,920
And they're bad in different ways, like acutely, chronically, they have different limitations.

153
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,120
We know that certain things are toxic, right? Cutely or chronically. Not a lot. We know,

154
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,600
I mean, with definitive clarity, there's not a lot we know beyond those things.

155
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,320
So one thing that seems to be true is, at least from the animal literature,

156
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,640
caloric restriction seems to reproducibly improve lifespan. And so let's kind of talk

157
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:10,520
about how that came to be as an understanding. Sure. Yeah. So I mean, this area of research is

158
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,000
actually quite old. So that's a hundred years ago. Yeah. The first experiments were published

159
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,040
in the early to mid 1930s, right? Which means they were probably started in the 1920s, right?

160
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,280
So almost a hundred years ago, people were going down this line of thinking of asking,

161
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,480
you know, what is the effect of significant restriction of calories on the aging process

162
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,920
in mammals? So the early studies were all done in rats. And actually, if I remember correctly,

163
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,320
these studies were originally designed from a developmental perspective. So they were really

164
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,600
thinking about malnutrition and its effects on development. And as a byproduct made the observation

165
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,000
that, yes, when you restrict calories in a rat early on in life, they have a smaller body size.

166
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,920
But then if you let them live out their entire lives, this is in the laboratory. And I think

167
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,600
that's really important to keep in mind. You know, they live 40, 50% longer. So we're talking really

168
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,560
significant increases in lifespan. And then the other thing that was appreciated pretty quickly

169
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,760
was not only are they living longer, but they seem to be healthier as they're living longer. So,

170
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,240
you know, this concept of health span and the period of life that is, you know, spent in good

171
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,920
health, free from disease and disability, it seemed as if caloric restriction was not only

172
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,400
increasing lifespan, but also extending health span. So, you know, that led to obviously a large

173
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,960
body of literature since then studying the effect of caloric restriction in not just rodents,

174
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,840
rats and mice, but also all sorts of simpler organisms, invertebrates like fruit flies and

175
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,280
C. elegans and yeast. And the common theme seems to be that, again, starting from laboratory

176
00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:00,600
conditions, if you restrict nutrients by a whole variety of different methods, you can increase

177
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,280
lifespan and apparently increase health span proportionally, at least proportionally. So

178
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
there's a lot of nuance there, a lot that we can dive into and to unpack. But I think that's

179
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,320
generally the take home, right? Is that over and over and over again across, you know, the

180
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,360
evolutionary distance we're talking about is much, much greater than the evolutionary distance between

181
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,400
rodents and humans, right? So, over a very wide evolutionary distance in pretty much every

182
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,480
organism where it's ever been studied, you can find evidence that caloric restriction slows aging.

183
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,280
Again, there are cases where that didn't happen, where lifespan wasn't extended, where lifespan

184
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,520
was shortened. Maybe we want to talk about this at some point, the interaction between genetics and

185
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,640
environment and caloric restriction. But in general, that is the take home message is caloric

186
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,480
restriction can slow aging in laboratory animals pretty much everywhere where it's been studied.

187
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,200
The one, I think, question that some people have is whether that's true in non-human primates.

188
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,840
Yeah, so I was just about to say, I was going to say before we get to NIA Wisconsin, which is

189
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,760
perhaps the single greatest experiment that's ever been done to test this hypothesis,

190
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,120
both in terms of its duration, level of control and proximity to our genome.

191
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,400
Let's spend a moment on that. Before we do, any things that come up from the rodent studies that

192
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,960
are worth talking about. So, for example, one of the things that I think is always important to

193
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,880
point out is there's a very particular death that tends to fall on laboratory mice. They have,

194
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,720
you know, if you look at the death bars for humans, there's much more heterogeneity.

195
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,160
But the leading cause is atherosclerosis. Now, that's true in the United States.

196
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,720
It's true across the globe. So, when you mix in, develop and undevelop, it doesn't matter.

197
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,600
Laboratory mice aren't that way. They die of pretty much one thing and one thing alone.

198
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,040
Actually, it's euthanasia, but I know where you're going.

199
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,000
Cancer, right?

200
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
Yeah, cancer. They all die of cancer.

201
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,640
Certainly, every old mouse at time of death will have cancer. And again, because of the way animal

202
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,080
studies are done, usually you have defined endpoints where when a mouse reaches that

203
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,120
endpoint, they have to be euthanized. But the expectation is that if they hadn't been euthanized,

204
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,200
they would have died from the cancer. So, I think you're absolutely right.

205
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,160
Yeah, they're not dying from atherosclerotic. When you look at their arteries, they're not

206
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,320
littered with plaques the way ours are.

207
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,760
At least the commonly used inbred mouse strains. That is definitely true for it. There are,

208
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,640
you know, this is maybe getting in the weeds a little bit, but there are certainly

209
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,800
mouse strains that have been designed either transgenically or through selection

210
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,120
to develop other pathologies that will shorten their lifespan. But if you let a typical mouse

211
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,200
strain in the lab live out its natural life, it will have a very high tumor burden at the end of

212
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,080
life. And most likely, you know, I guess I should know this. I don't know exactly. I'm guessing 80%

213
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,200
of the animals would die from cancer. So, it's different from humans in that way.

214
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,640
And I actually think this is, you know, this is a legitimate criticism to some extent of the

215
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,240
interpretation of the caloric restriction literature that is, could it be the case

216
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,280
that really what caloric restriction is doing is preventing cancer. And that's why you see these

217
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,800
big increases in lifespan. And I think that's really difficult to definitively answer one way

218
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:39,320
or the other. What I would say is, you know, mice do develop functional declines in every tissue

219
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:46,280
and organ as they age, very much like people do. So, you know, a person may die from cardiovascular

220
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,280
disease, but at the same time, if they're in their 80s, their kidney isn't functioning as well,

221
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,400
their heart isn't functioning as well, their brain probably isn't functioning as well.

222
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,800
That's right.

223
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,400
So, mice show all of those same declines in function with age and caloric restriction

224
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,920
seems to delay or outright prevent those declines as well. So, yeah, maybe the lifespan effect is

225
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,680
primarily due to cancer, but caloric restriction is having an effect apparently on the underlying

226
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,640
biological aging process in all sorts of different ways. And I really like the functional measures.

227
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,960
A lot of people in the field these days are really enamored with, you know, the aging clocks,

228
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,280
epigenetic clocks, biochemical markers. I think those are all useful and important.

229
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,840
But from my perspective, what really gets my attention is if somebody shows that the heart

230
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,560
is still functioning like a young heart or the immune system is still functioning.

231
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,920
I wasn't planning to go down that rabbit hole, but since you brought it up,

232
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,720
can you convince me of the utility of the clocks absent the type of data that would actually

233
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,440
demonstrate longitudinally their benefit, which to my knowledge, we really don't have yet?

234
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,200
Yeah. So, I would say a couple things on that. I think we need to be precise in what we mean when

235
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,680
we talk about the clocks because there's lots of flavors of clocks, right? Most people these days,

236
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,560
if you just say aging clock, what they really mean are the epigenetic clocks that are showing,

237
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,240
you know, the characteristic changes in the epigenome, epigenetic marks that are seen with

238
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,920
age. Again, in every organism where it's really been studied, you do see these characteristic

239
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,040
changes in the epigenome with age. And so, I would say one place where their utility is clear,

240
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,080
at least to me, is as a chronological measure, right? Now, you might ask, okay, why would I ever

241
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,640
want to use an epigenetic clock to tell my chronological age? I know how old I am, right?

242
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,680
But forensics, for example, might be a place where that's useful. Their crime has been committed. They

243
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,640
want to know with some level of precision how old the perpetrator is. You could use an epigenetic

244
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,000
clock for that reason. In my world, as part of the dog aging project, there are many dogs

245
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,040
that are rescued, an owner might want to know their age. So, I think that is a real use,

246
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,880
and clearly the clocks will work for that. I think really what you're asking, though, is

247
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,640
can I convince you that the epigenetic clocks and potentially other types of clocks are actually

248
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,120
measuring biological aging, right? And that's a harder, in my mind, that's a harder thing to

249
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,120
prove. And personally, I have no interest in convincing you of that because I'm not convinced,

250
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,560
right? So, I think this is an area where the field is in flux a little bit. And there are certainly

251
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,760
scientists who I respect a lot in the field who believe at their core that these epigenetic clocks

252
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,040
tell us about biological aging or can be used to tell us about biological aging.

253
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,360
Then there are people like me who want to see the proof. And I think that the proof is really

254
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,360
being able to show at an individual level, that could be in a mouse, could be in a person,

255
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,840
could be in a dog. At an individual level, you can predict someone's biological age at some point in

256
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,160
their life and with some level of precision, predict what's going to happen in the future.

257
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,000
What are their future health outcomes? How long are they going to live? Nobody has done that yet.

258
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,680
What they've done comes close, I guess. So, what has been done is to look at longitudinal studies

259
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:17,000
in people where we have samples from people 10, 20, 30 years ago, measure the epigenetic profiles

260
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,080
of those people 10, 20, 30 years ago and ask how well does that correlate with mortality outcomes,

261
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,960
for example, in the future. And they do work to some extent. I think people will debate how

262
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,840
well they work. Are they any better than other markers you could look at in predicting mortality?

263
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,640
I think that's unclear, but there is some correlation there. So, again, I think it really

264
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,760
depends to some extent maybe on how skeptical you are. I'm a skeptic by nature and I want to actually

265
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,520
see the proof. I guess the last thing I would say about this, I'm talking mostly about the

266
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,760
epigenetic clocks. Maybe it's worth talking about other types of clocks that people can make.

267
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,680
The other thing I want to caution people on though is assuming that the epigenetic clocks

268
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:13,880
are the only important thing about aging. There is, again, a small number of very vocal and popular

269
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,840
people in the field who talk as if changing the epigenome is going to change everything about

270
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:28,040
aging. We have no data to support that. I just have to say it, that is not true at this point.

271
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,840
We have no data to support it. What we know about the biology of aging is that epigenetic changes

272
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,560
are one of, depending on how you categorize things, eight or nine or 10 molecular processes

273
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,800
that seem to contribute, that the field has reached consensus on. It's only one of those

274
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,640
things. Is it possible that it is sort of in a hierarchy the most important and drives a lot of

275
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,480
those other changes? Yes, that's possible. We don't have any data to support it. So, this idea that

276
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:06,920
reversing the epigenome is reversing aging is at best an exaggeration, at worst an outright lie.

277
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:14,600
I mean, it's just not true. How could that be? What a set of experiments technology-wise would

278
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,840
you need to be able to do to even test that hypothesis in a mouse, right? We're close.

279
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,960
Well, maybe close. I guess I should qualify that a little bit. Conceptually, we're close. So,

280
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,680
there have been these factors called the Yamanaka factors that can reprogram the epigenome. So,

281
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,880
this has been done in cells. So, if you take cells in culture, in a laboratory, and you passage them

282
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,920
many, many times, you can see changes in the epigenome, just like you might see changes in

283
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,840
the epigenome in an animal, in tissues. And you can put these reprogramming factors into the cells

284
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,920
and turn them on. Now, there are four Yamanaka factors? There are four Yamanaka factors, but

285
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,000
people are trying different cocktails, adding some other stuff in, taking some stuff out. But yes,

286
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,360
there are the four classic Yamanaka factors. And what those factors do is they basically

287
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,680
wipe clean the epigenetic changes that have happened over time. And also, what's amazing

288
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,480
is that they restore those cells back to a, if you take it far enough, back to a pluripotent state.

289
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,520
So, essentially, you get virgin new cells that could differentiate into any cell type in the body,

290
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,880
right? So, this has been known for many years. What is relatively more recent over the last

291
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,080
eight or nine years are people are trying to express these reprogramming factors in an animal.

292
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,800
So, instead of doing it in cells in the laboratory, do it in an animal. And I think the most compelling

293
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,600
work is work in a premature aging model of mice, so it's called a progeroid model,

294
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,640
where they're very short-lived, they're very sick. But these reprogramming factors can extend lifespan

295
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,720
by, I don't remember what the exact numbers are, but a significant amount, maybe 40, 50%,

296
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,200
which seems like a lot, except you have to recognize these mice live maybe 25% of the length

297
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,880
of a normal mouse, right? So, they're very sick. But there are impressive changes that happen that

298
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,440
are consistent with the idea that you fixed or made something better. So, the experiment to do

299
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,440
would be to express these reprogramming factors in an old mouse and make that mouse young again.

300
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,560
And this is where I think the exaggeration, I'll use the nice word, has gotten ahead of the actual

301
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:35,800
data. So, what has been done is showing that in one or two, maybe three tissues, you can see an

302
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,200
improvement in function. The most impressive, I think, is work from David Sinclair's lab, where

303
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,120
they use this optic degeneration model. So, degeneration of the eye showed that they could

304
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,800
reverse that with these reprogramming factors and then tried to do the same thing in an old mouse.

305
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,880
And there was at least, the data was mixed, but I think pretty compelling that you could,

306
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,040
to some extent, regenerate the optic nerve in an old mouse. So, that's certainly impressive, I think,

307
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,360
exciting. But nobody has ever taken an old mouse and turned it into a young mouse. So,

308
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,720
when people start talking about reversing aging, that implies that you have taken an old

309
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,080
animal or person and, to some extent, biologically made them young again. That hasn't happened.

310
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,960
So, what I would say needs to happen, to really convince me, there are two things. So, I would be

311
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,800
convinced that this is useful, potentially therapeutically and important. I'm actually

312
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,360
already convinced it could be useful therapeutically. But I would become really excited if somebody

313
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,760
could do as good as rapamycin in a mouse. So, I'm not asking for much, in my view, right?

314
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:49,480
We know rapamycin can extend lifespan 25%, at least. Again, a dose hasn't been optimized,

315
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,760
but 25%, let's stick with that. And you can reverse functional declines in many tissues, right?

316
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,320
So, show me you can do that with reprogramming and I'll be excited. Nobody's done even that yet.

317
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,640
Show me you can take a two and a half year old mouse, make it look like a one year old mouse,

318
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,720
and then it lives to be five years old. I'll be really excited. Look, I'll be all on board.

319
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,040
I might even come on your show and apologize for saying that people were exaggerating,

320
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:25,320
although they are exaggerating now. But I think the enthusiasm has just gotten so far ahead of

321
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:33,160
where the science is. Let's go back to the maybe help folks understand what the Yamanaka factors

322
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:42,680
are doing and how one can be sure that even if you fix the aging problem, you don't create a new

323
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,800
problem. So, if the objective is I want to take the DNA as I had it when I was young, right? So,

324
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:58,040
when I was 20, this is what my DNA looked like. Now that I'm 50, it looks different. It has

325
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:05,800
literally these methyl groups that are sitting directly on the cysteine residues. It's literally

326
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:13,480
on my DNA. Okay. We want to take those off. Maybe? Well, so first of all, it's important to understand

327
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:22,120
why that's even a problem, right? Why is my 50 year old crappy DNA not as good as my 20 year old DNA?

328
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,160
So, again, this is taking a step back to sort of basic biology, right? So, the DNA is where all the

329
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,920
information is, but then that DNA has to get turned into RNA. That's called transcription or gene

330
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,240
expression, we'll just call it gene expression. And then that RNA has to get turned into protein.

331
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,480
In general, it's the protein that does the work, right? So, what these epigenetic changes,

332
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:51,480
the methyl groups that you were talking about do primarily we think is affect expression of the

333
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,280
genes. So, basically what you're seeing with aging, we think, is a shift in the epigenome that

334
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,480
leads to certain genes being expressed that shouldn't be and certain genes not being

335
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,240
expressed that should be. And I think there's a little bit of a debate about which is more

336
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,760
important right now, but it probably doesn't really matter, right? So, the idea is you're

337
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,320
getting things turned on and turned off inappropriately as we get older. So, there's a

338
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,360
loss of regulation, which probably contributes to a loss of homeostasis. And homeostasis is,

339
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,520
I think, a really useful way to think about aging, right? If you're healthy, your body is

340
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,800
generally in homeostasis, right? And what happens as we get older is it becomes harder and harder

341
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,120
for our body to maintain homeostasis. When you get out of homeostasis, if your defense mechanisms

342
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,200
are working right, you can get back in, right? So, you get COVID, for example, your immune system

343
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,120
works, you're out of homeostasis, but you come back in and then you're okay again. I think as

344
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,720
we get older, it gets harder to come back into homeostasis and that's why we start to see

345
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:57,560
pathology and mortality. So, let me differentiate two states of pathology. My five-year-old son

346
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,600
was on his scooter two weeks ago going down the steepest hill in the world, which I had no idea

347
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,800
how I didn't see that he was about to do that, like face planted. And when he came up,

348
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,280
all I could think is how quickly can we get to the hospital? I mean, it was a blood bath.

349
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,860
Yeah.

350
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm not making this up, Matt. Six days later, there was one little tiny scar, eight or nine days later,

351
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:31,720
you would have had no idea this kid ripped his face off on pavement. He's five. I get a cut,

352
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,960
it's like nine months until the scar is gone. So, there's a very clear distinction between a

353
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,600
five-year-old's DNA and a 50-year-old's DNA in terms of how he can literally make new proteins

354
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,120
that are better than my proteins.

355
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,400
Yeah. Let me stop you there just for a second because I think this is actually the crux of the

356
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,280
question, right? You said it's a difference in your DNA.

357
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,160
Well, I'm asking. I think what I'm trying to get at is, yeah, how much of... Because that's a clear

358
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,440
case of the protein that he makes is better than my protein, right? He's making much better protein.

359
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,560
Certainly functions better.

360
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,720
Yes.

361
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,320
Absolutely. Yeah. So, I guess what I was getting at though is the question... One question I think

362
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,480
that's really important here is there can be changes to the DNA to the sequence, right? So,

363
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,760
the sequence of the DNA is the information, right? Those are called mutations and those accumulate

364
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,400
as we age and that's honestly what drives a lot of cancer, right? So, we've known this for a long

365
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,240
time. The epigenetic changes are sort of on top of that, right?

366
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,800
Yeah. And while it more regulates expression, I'm wondering how much that factors into the

367
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,000
example I just gave. Does it?

368
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,560
It's a good question. I'm sure it does to some extent. Absolutely.

369
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,400
Like what else explains why his collagen is so much better than mine? What are the other

370
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,440
factors that go into that?

371
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,320
I mean, I think there are probably many reasons why healing declines with... Our ability to heal

372
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,000
declines with age. I actually, again, I mean, I know we've talked about this before. I think

373
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,720
inflammation is a huge driver of our loss of ability to recover as we get older. So,

374
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,600
all sorts of things go wrong if you have a high level of sterile inflammation in your body,

375
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,800
including the ability of stem cells to function. And a lot of injuries require stem cells to

376
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,000
function to build back what's been broken. So, it's complicated, I guess I would say.

377
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,960
But the question is...

378
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah, it could be that I have more senescent cells and more senescent cell

379
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,440
factors that are impairing the ability of cells to heal.

380
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,520
Just to throw a wrench in that though, there's actually a body of thought that senescent cells

381
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,280
actually promote wound healing. So, it's again, this is where the biology is so complicated.

382
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,440
But I think the crux of the question we started from is, if you only fix the epigenome,

383
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,800
do you fix everything?

384
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
How do you know you fix all these things?

385
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,400
Do you fix everything? And nobody knows, I think is the fair answer. I think I would be

386
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:52,360
shocked if that was the case, that epigenetic changes drive all of aging. But it's possible.

387
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,280
I think we have to be open to that idea that epigenetic changes sit on top of or upstream of

388
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,840
the other hallmarks of aging. First of all, let me say one thing. It won't fix everything.

389
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:10,760
You will not fix mutations by fixing the epigenome. The question is, do mutations,

390
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:18,840
do they happen with enough frequency to be a major contributor to functional declines that

391
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,480
go along with aging? Certainly cancer, you can point to.

392
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,800
Cancer for sure. But let's now talk about something else, which is near and dear to your

393
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,480
heart, no pun intended, but ejection fraction. Again, because you study dogs.

394
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,000
Not only is cancer a big problem, but so is heart failure. So, now we're dealing with a muscle,

395
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,880
a set of cells that really aren't being turned over the way skin is. So, when we think about the

396
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,040
example of my son, when you think about your gut epithelium being sloughed off when you get sick,

397
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,960
when you think about your fingernails and your hair, boy, it's really easy to think about those

398
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,800
things as rapidly being turned over. But neurons, cardiac myocytes, these things don't get turned

399
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:03,640
over a whole heck of a lot. So, what is it about reprogramming that we think is going to fix

400
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,680
an aging neuron or an aging cardiac myocyte? Yeah. So, I mean, again, I think, again,

401
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,720
this is an area where the biology of what's really happening, at least to my knowledge,

402
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,800
is so poorly understood that I think the real answer is we don't completely know.

403
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:25,320
I'm going to give a very simplistic answer, which is that what people are trying to do

404
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,080
is not reprogram all the way back to the pluripotent state. So, it's called partial reprogramming.

405
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,560
Right. Which would be pretty dangerous.

406
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,000
Well, that's what I was going to say. If you're a single-celled organism, no problem going back

407
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,040
to the pluripotent state, right? You can then start over. In a complicated animal, if we

408
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,400
reprogram you back to the pluripotent state, that's not going to end well for you.

409
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,560
No.

410
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:55,800
Right? So, I think the idea is to go back far enough that you restore the epigenome to its

411
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,800
pristine state, young state, and then hope that when you do that, you restore gene expression

412
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,160
to where it's supposed to be. Maybe one way to think about it is you restore the homeostatic

413
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,440
mechanisms to a more youthful state where then the homeostatic mechanisms that all of

414
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,400
our cells have can basically clean up the rest of the mess. Right? Because we know as we get older,

415
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,960
for example, we all accumulate damaged mitochondria. Right? Changing the epigenome,

416
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,040
which is the nuclear genome, isn't going to fix anything that's wrong with your mitochondria

417
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,120
directly. But maybe by fixing the epigenome, you restore the homeostatic mechanisms that then

418
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,120
maintain mitochondria in a healthy state, and you can fix the damage to the mitochondria. Right?

419
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:48,360
So, that's the concept. And again, I would say the evidence is suggestive that if you do it just

420
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:56,520
right, you can improve function in at least some aged tissues and organs by partial reprogramming.

421
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:03,800
I've yet to see anything that convinces me that anybody has made an old heart into a young heart

422
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,440
in an old animal with partial reprogramming in the heart. But you can't improve function. I

423
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,800
would also say the same thing is true with rapamycin. Right? I would not argue we see that

424
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,800
short-term treatment with rapamycin in mice makes an old heart function functionally to some extent,

425
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,920
more like a young heart. I would never argue that we have taken that heart and now it's young. It's

426
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,800
just in an old body. We don't know that, and that's hard to prove. But I think you can see some

427
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,240
evidence that it should be possible with partial reprogramming to do that. And the question is,

428
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,520
will it work everywhere? Will it work in some tissues and organs and not in others? We don't

429
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,440
really know. The brain is the one. So, let's just say 10, 20 years from now, people have figured

430
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,040
out a lot of the complexity. We're starting to move these things into the clinic. Maybe we will see

431
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:00,440
really large effects on lifespan and healthspan in mice. What I've yet to hear anybody give a

432
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,040
convincing explanation of is how you do that in the brain. Because so much of who we are and what

433
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:14,360
we are comes from our experiences and our memories. And so, how do you ensure that you can reprogram

434
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,240
somebody's brain in a way that isn't going to change that? And I just think that's going to

435
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,840
be a really hard problem to overcome. But maybe somebody will figure it out. There are tons of

436
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,480
really smart people working in this area. Lots of resources going into this area. So, I think it's

437
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:39,880
exciting. Again, my big concern is that we don't mislead people into thinking that we're close to

438
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,120
reversing aging. And I think it's a problem from the perspective of the general public. I think it's

439
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,800
a problem from the perspective of the scientific community. Other scientists look at that and

440
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,120
they're like, this is snake oil. This is just not true. Yeah. And my concern with it is actually

441
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:01,400
in terms of the impact it has on people, which are, hey, this is awesome. This thing's going to

442
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,120
get worked out. I can do whatever I want. I can do whatever. I mean, literally, it's like, I can

443
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,560
sort of do what I want because in 10 years they're going to reprogram me. And my view on that is,

444
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,480
even if that is true, or even if you have a high degree of confidence that that is true,

445
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,680
how would you not hedge? Right? Again, hedging is such an important part of how companies manage

446
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,800
risk. So, the difference between good companies and bad companies when it comes to risk management

447
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,800
is everything. That's why some companies do really well in economic downturns and others don't.

448
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,360
It's basically about risk management. And a very important part of risk management is indeed hedging.

449
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,120
So, if we think of ourselves each as little companies, so if you're the CEO of Matco,

450
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:53,960
I'm the CEO of Peatco, I can't think of a more important asset within my company to manage

451
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:01,560
than my own life. Yeah. Right? Like, sure, do I have enough money yet? Do I have enough fun? Yeah,

452
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,440
those are all important assets, but existing would be the number one asset. And to not take

453
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,520
a risk management approach of hedging to that is insane. And yet what I see is so many grand

454
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,440
promises of this stuff and nobody's sort of paying attention to what they eat or how much exercise

455
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,520
they do because I don't need to, this is going to be worked out. So, the thing that I always find

456
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,960
amazing is some of the most vocal advocates for this stuff, like don't have an ounce of muscle on

457
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,920
them, don't have their overweight or whatever, like they don't look healthy. And I'm like, guys,

458
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,360
you can do both, right? You can believe that in 10 years we're going to fix this problem,

459
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,400
but you could still actually care about your health. Yeah. Now, I think that's a really

460
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,640
important point. And having, again, been in this field for a long time now, I think you can just

461
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,640
look back over the last 20, 30 years and look at predictions people made on how fast these things

462
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,680
were going to come along and get into the clinic. And none of that has happened, right? So, I totally

463
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:10,520
agree with you. I guess also being in the center of it, I take a view of, again, pretty strong

464
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,920
skepticism when people say this is going to happen in 10, 15 years. I honestly have not appreciated

465
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,080
that there are maybe a lot of people out there looking at what they read in the New York Times

466
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,560
or on CNN and thinking to themselves, oh, I don't have to worry about this. This is going to get

467
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:36,760
worked out. So, my advice would be don't expect major changes in treatments to improve lifespan

468
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,800
and health span in the next 20 years. And that doesn't mean I'm not optimistic. I think there are

469
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,000
opportunities there. It would not surprise me if we do see some of these things get into the clinic,

470
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,360
but I certainly wouldn't expect it because there are so many barriers that we don't yet appreciate.

471
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,960
There are lots of barriers just in moving something through the clinical trial process.

472
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,520
I think the reprogramming stuff is a perfect example. So, you actually alluded to this earlier,

473
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,120
right? Are there potential side effects, right? Absolutely. You push it too far, right? You

474
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:12,520
reprogram too far, you're gone. We know that certain types of cancers are a side effect of

475
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,320
this partial reprogramming in mice. Again, it doesn't mean it can't be worked out, but there

476
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,040
are really reasons, I think, to be concerned that this is going to be hard to implement

477
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,840
therapeutically. The other thing I would say, even if those things can be worked out, the FDA

478
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,520
is going to be extremely skeptical of this kind of approach. So, as people move these through the

479
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:39,000
clinical trial process, they are going to have to show with really rock solid compelling data that

480
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,640
these reprogramming strategies are not going to cause significant side effects. So, I think it's

481
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:50,200
a long road before we have reprogramming strategies that get into the clinic. Maybe somebody will

482
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,360
identify a small molecule that can do some of this, and I know people are working on that. Maybe

483
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,960
that'll be an easier path, but for now, I think it's going to take a while. That's the best case

484
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,320
scenario. That's if we really can partially. I'm going to say partially reverse aging, reverse

485
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,760
aspects of aging. It's still going to be a long road. I wonder if the first wins are going to be

486
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,040
things like what David Sinclair has done where you've got one very niche application. I think

487
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,240
another one that would be amazing would be osteoarthritis. If you could figure out a way

488
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:29,480
to regenerate human cartilage without joint replacements, those are huge wins that seem

489
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,640
at least a little more feasible. But again, I agree with you. I think this stuff takes

490
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,120
four times as long and costs four times as much as we think. Like building a house.

491
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,000
You and I are, honestly, we're pretty lucky because we know about a lot of this stuff. We

492
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,280
actually can start practicing some of this stuff like rapamycin before it gets out there. Again,

493
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm not recommending anybody take rapamycin necessarily without talking to your physician

494
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,200
first, but we know this stuff and we, I think, have at least a pretty good idea of the relative

495
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:12,840
risk reward. But before it gets out to where it hits the mainstream from a clinical perspective,

496
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,000
it's a really long path. I totally agree with what you said though about specific indications

497
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,680
where you can target it very precisely, hopefully, and where there's no other solution currently.

498
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,080
I think those are opportunities. That's exactly the strategy that people have tried to take with

499
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:37,480
Cenalytics, these molecules that will clear senescent cells. Even that's been hard. Unity

500
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,840
is the largest company in this space and their first clinical trial for osteoarthritis failed.

501
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Now they're looking at the eye because again, it's a nice indication where for some of these eye

502
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,960
diseases, there isn't any solution and you can, in principle, target it quite precisely to the eye.

503
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,920
I think that is exactly the strategy that people will be taking and hopefully it'll be successful.

504
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,840
I want this stuff to work. I try to be a realist at the same time.

505
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,040
I guess the way I would describe this to people is if you want to bring it back to a financial

506
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:20,440
analogy, it's a lottery ticket. If your entire financial planning system is based on winning

507
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,360
the lottery, the odds that you're going to win are pretty low. Instead, if you're going to play

508
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,240
the lottery, play it in the context of an otherwise great saving and investing strategy.

509
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,480
I guess the other thing I would add to that is that, and this is what we talked about before,

510
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,960
you don't have to do everything right. Get 80% of the way there, which nutritionally,

511
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,320
I don't think is, for some people, it's very challenging, but I think most people could do

512
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:52,920
that. Exercise, you don't have to optimize your physical activity. Do something and that'll get

513
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,680
you most of the way there. The exercise curve, which we've covered a lot in previous podcasts,

514
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,680
you get most of the benefit going from, I would say literally 50% of the benefit based on at least

515
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:15,880
the so-so epidemiologic data, about 50% of the full benefit of exercise is captured going from

516
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:26,200
nothing to about 15 met hours per week. That would be depending on, 15 met times one hour would

517
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,280
be one way to get there, but in reality, that's no one who's that unfit is going to do 15 met,

518
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,160
but that would be like three hours a week of five met to put that in perspective. Five met

519
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:42,360
is like a very, very brisk walk or a slow jog, something to that effect. You get a sense of like

520
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,080
15 met hours per week is by extension, I do about 100 met hours per week of exercise. I think of

521
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,080
everything in terms of met hours, but the point is that you can get, depending on the study, 30 to

522
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:01,240
50% of the benefit going from being completely sedentary to 15 met hours per week is pretty

523
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,680
amazing. Which is a big benefit. Again, it's remarkable that that information isn't out there.

524
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:14,360
Most people in the general public don't know that. I don't know what the solution is. I think you're

525
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,000
obviously doing a great public service by trying to get that information out there, but it's

526
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,640
unfortunate because I think again, if most people understood how much benefit they could get

527
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:31,240
from just getting out and moving a little bit, maybe a lot, maybe three hours a week is a lot

528
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,600
for some people. But the magnitude of the benefit compared to the effort that you put in,

529
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,200
I think most people just don't know that and it's unfortunate.

530
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:48,840
Let's go back to the CR stuff. What do we know about the effect of CR in the laboratory animals

531
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:57,480
on the immune system? It's a little bit complicated. First of all, laboratory animals

532
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,280
in the laboratory are kept in what's called a specific pathogen-free environment. That doesn't

533
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,640
mean there's no pathogens, but it's a relatively low pathogen environment where they are not

534
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,720
obligated to really use their immune systems against all the challenges that we would face

535
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,680
in the real world. One question has come up. Are animals that are on calorie restriction immune

536
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,120
compromised? Again, I think the data is a little bit mixed, but certainly there have been studies

537
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,760
where people have done pathogen challenges on CR animals and they respond better. At least the

538
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,600
old animals respond better than age matched ad libitum fed control. Ad libitum just means eat as

539
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:43,240
much as you want. But then for certain types of challenges, the caloric restriction clearly

540
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,080
causes a deficit. Yeah, the sepsis experiments are pretty clear. The CR animals compared to

541
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,880
controls, when you induce sepsis in them, the CR animals die much more quickly. Right. Of course,

542
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:00,440
the obvious implication of that is that maybe CR would impair immune function in people and lead

543
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,800
to higher risk of all sorts of infectious diseases. This gets additionally complicated

544
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:12,200
though by the question of CR with optimal nutrition. You might sometimes just see this

545
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,640
CRON, C-R-O-N, caloric restriction with optimal nutrition, or CRAN, caloric restriction with

546
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,560
adequate nutrition. That can be done in a mouse. We can control all of that so we make sure that

547
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,200
they get all the micronutrients and vitamins that they need when they're on this CR diet.

548
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,680
When you move into the real world and people start practicing caloric restriction, that all goes out

549
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,520
the window. Right. Like I wouldn't, if I wanted to do caloric restriction off the top of my head,

550
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,680
I wouldn't even know what to do to make sure that I'm getting optimal nutrition. Right.

551
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:49,000
And so in that state where you are CR without optimal nutrition, I think that's where I really

552
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,680
become worried about the side effects, particularly as you raised immune deficits, because

553
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:03,880
you may not be getting the nutrient value or the specific micronutrients and vitamins that you need

554
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,880
to maintain a functioning immune system. Sure. You may affect some aspects of the biology of aging

555
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,560
in a way that you're aging biologically more slowly. That doesn't matter if you get influenza

556
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,040
and die. Right. So again, I think that's an additional complication that comes into play.

557
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,200
When we start talking about, we haven't talked about all the other anti-aging nutritional

558
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:31,400
strategies. When we start talking about recommending those nutritional strategies to the general public,

559
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:39,160
based on solely on mouse studies, I get really concerned because of this environmental complexity

560
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,520
that humans live in. And we haven't even talked about the genetic complexity. Right. So there's

561
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,960
all sorts of things that are just different about laboratory animals compared to people living in

562
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:59,240
the real world. And then what- Can we say about frailty, sarcopenia as it changes in an animal,

563
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,960
in a CR environment, and can that be extrapolated also? Yeah. So I think it's pretty clear, I think,

564
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:13,800
that much like rapamycin, most functional measures of aging seem to be preserved in

565
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,760
calorically restricted animals, including measures of frailty and measures of sarcopenia.

566
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,720
And the same thing, again, is true with rapamycin. This actually surprised a lot of people when the

567
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,720
first studies were done because the expectation was because mTOR plays such a big role in muscle

568
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,600
synthesis, that if you inhibit mTOR with rapamycin or caloric restriction, which is a potent

569
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,960
inhibitor of mTOR, that you would actually see accelerated sarcopenia. And that just isn't the

570
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,600
observation in laboratory animals. Again, we have to be careful not to extrapolate to people,

571
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:51,880
but it doesn't seem to be the case that you lose muscle mass and function in the way that people

572
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:58,520
would define sarcopenia. I think the important complication here is that all of the caloric

573
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,000
restriction studies that I'm aware of, when they look at muscle function, normalize the body weight.

574
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,200
And the calorically restricted mice weigh substantially less than the ad libitum fed

575
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:14,360
mice. Usually, I think it's on the order of 30, 35% less. So it's usually grip strength normalized

576
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:21,560
to weight. Right. So what you're actually seeing is that the calorically restricted mice have

577
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:28,360
maintained muscle function proportionate to their body weight. And I don't know the answer to this,

578
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:34,040
but it's something that I thought of when we were talking about this show. Let's just say you did

579
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,600
that in a person. So you would be able to answer this. I'm sure you've got a 60-year-old person who

580
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,480
needs to lose 30% of their body weight. But of course, you want to maintain their muscle mass,

581
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:53,480
their muscle function. Would you view it as a good thing or a bad thing if they lost 30% of their

582
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,600
body weight? And 30% of their muscle. And 30% of their strength? No. I don't think we would. And I

583
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,840
don't think we would view it as a good thing if that... Because again, if you're telling me that

584
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,080
someone needs to lose 30% of their body weight, presumably their body composition isn't great to

585
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,880
begin with. So no, I think you would view that as maybe a better thing than where they started,

586
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,040
but not optimal either. Optimal might be you would lose 30% of your body weight,

587
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,760
but it would disproportionately be adipose tissue. And you might only lose 10% of your strength or

588
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,160
none at all. Right. So again, this is just... Depending on the change in lean body mass.

589
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,240
This is just a complication of the CR studies. And again, it's hard for me sometimes. It takes me

590
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,800
20, 30 minutes of trying to dig through the paper to really figure out

591
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,000
what normalization did they do to look at metabolic rate or muscle mass or lean mass

592
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:56,600
or fat mass or muscle function. But usually these studies will be normalized to body weight. This

593
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,840
actually comes up also in some of the intermittent fasting studies where the question sometimes in

594
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,240
these studies is, are they isocholoric or are they calorically restricted when they're put on

595
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:14,040
intermittent fasting? And people will claim they're isocholoric, but the mice lose weight.

596
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,480
And what they really are is isocholoric when normalized to body weight. So they're really

597
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:26,920
calorically restricted, but you have to dig to get how the normalizations were done to really

598
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,560
understand. Now, when we think about what we know in humans, there was a study that looked at

599
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,720
the difference in bone mineral density in people who underwent equal amounts of weight loss,

600
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,600
one driven by a caloric restriction strategy, one driven by an exercise driven strategy.

601
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:51,000
And the exercise driven weight loss group did not experience a reduction in BMD, but the CR group

602
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,520
did. Yeah. So, you know, that's interesting. That's yet another thing that makes you think there's a

603
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,480
little more nuance to this, which is not to say CR from a weight loss perspective isn't valuable,

604
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:09,560
but it begs the question, you know, is CR the right tool for longevity? Once you've achieved

605
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,840
optimal weight, is additional CR beneficial? That makes the assumption we know what optimal

606
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,200
weight is. I mean, I think that's kind of the crux of the question, right? We're asking,

607
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:24,520
does CR impact longevity positively? We know if you go on CR, you're going to lose weight. So if

608
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,680
the answer to that is yes, then by definition, optimal weight is lower than what we think.

609
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:36,440
Right. I know, but we don't, I would say we still don't really know what optimal weight is. So,

610
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:43,560
so again, this I think just reflects the challenges in coming to definitive answers. And I mean,

611
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:50,360
I think maybe the way I think about it more so is, you know, what are the concept? So, so what are the,

612
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:56,040
what are the downsides potentially to caloric restriction? And if we don't know that caloric

613
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:03,960
restriction has big benefits in terms of health span and perhaps lifespan, what are the downsides

614
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,480
and do those downsides outweigh the uncertainty we have about whether caloric restriction is

615
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,080
beneficial? And unfortunately, I think this is something that not very many people in this field

616
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,680
pay attention to, right? People are, you know, we all expect if you do a clinical trial of a drug,

617
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:25,720
you're going to report adverse events and, and you're going to look at side effects. Very rarely

618
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,600
do people think about that before they write a book recommending that people should do diet X,

619
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,600
right? Even in the clinical trials, some of the nutritional clinical trials,

620
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:40,680
they don't really carefully monitor adverse events. And I think it's just, again, it's a bias

621
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,960
in the way we think about interventions. We feel like nutritional interventions are by their very

622
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:52,360
nature safe. And I think, you know, certainly for extreme nutritional interventions, that's clearly

623
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,920
not true. So I think we should be thinking about what are the risks associated with significant

624
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,320
caloric restriction in people as a therapeutic strategy.

625
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:07,240
Let's go back to the sort of the study that will never be done again, right? The

626
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,160
NIA Wisconsin Rhesus monkeys. So boy, if I can get my facts straight on this one,

627
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,200
I want to say that this study started in the late 80s.

628
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,760
Ah, it sounds about right. It might have even been, might have, which would have been probably

629
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:27,000
the early 80s. I think. Wow. Okay. So we're talking Rhesus monkeys. You know, these are

630
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,320
animals that are going to live what, 30 years potentially? Yeah. 40. I think the average was

631
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,880
close, maybe closer to 40. Yeah. So let's talk about the experiment, end all experiments with

632
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,920
respect to caloric restriction, which is the very famous one we alluded to earlier at the University

633
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,440
of Wisconsin and the NIA. So, and I, I've read this study a thousand times. If I can get the

634
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,800
details right once I'll be happy, but between the two of us, I hope we can do this. You had two

635
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,960
groups of animals, one at the University of Wisconsin and one directly in Bethesda, Maryland.

636
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:06,200
This was obviously a huge NIH funded effort. It ran for a couple of decades given the lifespan

637
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:14,200
of Rhesus monkeys. The Wisconsin animals were fed, the controls and the treatment,

638
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:21,560
CR animals were fed a very processed diet. Right. At least after the fact, the examiner,

639
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:27,480
the investigators there suggested they wanted to more mimic a standard American diet. Of note,

640
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:34,680
I recall the amount of sugar, pure sucrose in their diet was 28 and a half percent of total calories.

641
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:42,840
So this is, this is, this is a high quality diet facetiously. The CR animals, the calorically

642
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:49,960
restricted animals were fed 25% of what the control animals were fed. And in that experiment,

643
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:56,840
we found a benefit to caloric restriction. That's right. CR animals outlived the control animals.

644
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,320
And they had fewer age related diseases. So I think if you, if you go back to that original

645
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,600
2009 paper, you know, the lifespan effect is compelling and it looks real, but, but what,

646
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,960
again, you know, is I think really indicative of, of, of that it might be having an effect on

647
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,920
biological aging is that they saw reduced rates of cancer. Again, not surprisingly,

648
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:23,720
as we talked about in mice, but also heart disease and metabolic disease. So, you know,

649
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,960
it's consistent with the idea that in that cohort of monkeys, again, given what you mentioned about

650
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,560
the dietary composition, caloric restriction was in fact having a beneficial impact on the aging

651
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:42,520
process. And those animals all came in at about the same age. Right. So that was sort of an apples

652
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:48,440
to apples comparison. Now we go down the road to Bethesda, we have a totally different experiment

653
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,280
in a way. And I don't know how much of this was deliberate and how much of it was not.

654
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,160
The diets were different. So that's, that's maybe a good contrast. These animals were actually fed

655
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:05,480
the closest diet that could mimic their real diet. So it didn't have any, you know, sugar in it,

656
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,800
really, I think it was like about 3% sucrose. You know, it was almost kind of like a, you know,

657
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:17,880
a vegetarian pescatarian sort of diet. Fish was the dominant source of protein, but it, you know,

658
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,600
it was a high quality diet relative to the Wisconsin. Higher quality for sure. Yep. The

659
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:31,160
complicating factor here was the animals didn't come in at all the same age. So you had some animals

660
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,600
that came in young, some animals that came in old. The net result of the study was there was no

661
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,800
difference. The CR animals did not outlive. And so while the Wisconsin study was first published in

662
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:49,160
2009 and it said, CR works, the 2012 publication for NIA said, CR doesn't work. At least that's

663
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,040
the lay press interpretation of it. So how do you kind of reconcile these findings? Yeah. So one,

664
01:02:54,040 --> 01:03:01,240
I think one thing to add to that is the, the NIA study at Bethesda in their paper, at least they

665
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:06,040
did show some evidence for improvements in at least some health span metrics. So if you read that

666
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,040
paper closely, you know, what they're, I think what they're really saying is CR didn't extend

667
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:15,800
lifespan, but it did have what appeared to be some beneficial effects on health span metrics. So

668
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,800
it wasn't a complete failure in that sense. So, I mean, I think it's interesting because since

669
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:26,040
then the, you know, when that, I remember when the, the, the 2011 paper came out, the Wisconsin people

670
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:31,320
were pretty upset, understandably. So I think since then they've had sort of a reconciliation

671
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:36,440
paper and where they try to figure out what does it mean that we got these different results? And

672
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:42,040
I think, you know, their conclusion, which certainly is plausible is that a lot of it comes

673
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:46,680
down to the difference in diets. And if you look at the actual body weights of the animals and how

674
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,800
much food they ate, not just the composition, but actually how much they ate, you know, you could

675
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:58,680
make an argument that the Bethesda monkeys were somewhat slightly calorically restricted. Again,

676
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:05,000
the controls, the controls. That's right. Yes. The controls at Bethesda ate less than the controls

677
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,440
in Wisconsin. Right. And that would have narrowed the gap between them and the treatment animals.

678
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,080
And so then I think as you, as you also alluded to the fact that the Bethesda study was a little

679
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,680
bit less controlled for age of onset. And I should, I don't remember the details exactly. There were

680
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:25,960
also some genetic differences in there. So there's a combination of factors that make it a little bit

681
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,120
difficult to conclude that it all is about the diet, right? So the, the monkeys in the Bethesda

682
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,920
study came in at different ages. There was at least a hint, I think that the, the monkeys that

683
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,680
came in at older ages started CR at older ages, maybe got a somewhat of a benefit. Whereas the

684
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,320
ones that started early didn't get any benefit. So it's, it's complicated to interpret. And,

685
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:53,080
you know, it's interesting because we see this a lot of times in the basic biology of age, aging,

686
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,160
basic science studies where different labs will get different results in, in what seems to be the

687
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,600
same exact experiment. And then you start to dig into it and yeah, there's all these differences

688
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:09,720
in the way it was done. It's really hard to know which of those differences contributed to the

689
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,000
different outcomes in this particular case, because it was a, you know, 30, 40 year experiment,

690
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,440
we're never going to find out, right? Yeah, I just won't be repeated both because of how long it

691
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:26,600
takes. And also because again, the, the view on primate research, these are Rhesus macaques,

692
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,640
right? The view on primate research publicly has changed, right? So I just don't think we'll ever

693
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:40,760
see that experiment done again. My gut feeling is that, that the Wisconsin study to some extent

694
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:50,760
probably does mirror what is closer to a typical American situation, at least these days. I do not

695
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:56,280
believe that they started with that intention, but where we're at today, it probably is relatively,

696
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:02,440
you know, as close as you can get for a controlled laboratory study. The question though, in my mind

697
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:09,000
is, between these two studies, do they suggest that caloric restriction, you know, slows aging,

698
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,640
and let's just start relative to the typical American diet, right? Somebody is moderately

699
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:19,880
obese, and they're eating terrible. Is it caloric restriction? Or is it just returning to, I think,

700
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,080
maybe what you would call like an optimal body weight, right? Optimal body mass. And I don't

701
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:32,280
think we know the answer, right? I think from these studies, you can't draw many conclusions.

702
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,760
I think the one thing you can do, and, and, and, uh, Roz Anderson, who's still at Wisconsin,

703
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:43,640
has really, I think, been a leader in this, is you can study the molecular signatures of

704
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:50,040
caloric restriction in the monkeys and ask, does it look similar to the molecular signatures of

705
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,680
caloric restriction in rodents? And you might ask, well, why would you do that? It seems obvious. But

706
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,160
again, a lot of the questions that people have around caloric restriction studies in mice

707
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,640
is will the, will, will it work the same way in people? And obviously,

708
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:09,720
Rhesus macaques are much closer evolutionarily to people than mice are. So if you see the same

709
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:15,560
molecular changes, it's suggestive that caloric restriction is having the same

710
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,040
molecular changes in people, certainly in primates. And in fact, that seems to be the case. A lot of

711
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:26,120
what we see in terms of, you know, changes in mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function and,

712
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:32,040
and other metabolic pathways is in fact shared between mice and monkeys. So I think that's a,

713
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:37,080
that is one important outcome from these studies that we can, we can definitely say is rock solid.

714
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:44,520
But I tend to believe that the pretty dramatic declines in age related disease

715
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,800
seen in the Wisconsin studies are telling us something. But again, is it just telling us that

716
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,920
not being obese reduces your risk for a lot of these diseases? And, and, you know, we kind of

717
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,160
already know that from the, from the human literature as well. Exactly. The other thing

718
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:08,760
that isn't entirely clear given that the NIA study didn't find a difference is we don't know how much

719
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,840
of this was the CR versus the DR, the dietary restriction. In other words, what the Wisconsin

720
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:23,720
experiment suggests is if you have an awful diet, reducing the amount of awful food you eat is a good

721
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:31,240
thing. Right. What the NIA experiment doesn't tell us is the contra positive. It doesn't suggest

722
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:36,760
that if you have a good diet, eating less of that will help you live longer. It might, but it isn't

723
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,480
definitive. Well, and it's not, we don't know, right? If the Wisconsin animals lived longer,

724
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,440
simply because they lost weight or because they lost weight and they were eating less processed

725
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:52,280
food. Right. Right. And I think the other thing to add to that is the NIA monkeys, which were eating,

726
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,080
you know, what we'll call a superior diet to the Wisconsin monkeys also ate less than the Wisconsin

727
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,760
monkeys. So yeah. So in other words, if you ate more of a good diet, would that be detrimental? We

728
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,320
also don't know that it's an, it's an interesting question actually. And, and, um, it's, it's too

729
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:13,000
bad. We don't know the answer to that. But I think if they had been body weight matched or caloric

730
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,480
consumption matched, that would have been an interesting comparison to be able to see,

731
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:22,120
are there differences there? And the other thing that just kind of gets off into weeds that we

732
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,200
don't need to necessarily go into is really have a great understanding of even how we differ from

733
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,200
the, the Reese's monkeys. So, you know, I recently read Herman Ponser's book where he,

734
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,480
I don't have you read it by the way. So he kind of goes into the ecology and evolution of, of

735
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:45,960
humans as a species and how different we are even from our closest evolutionary cousins.

736
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,560
And one of the fundamental differences are incredible capacity to store excess energy.

737
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,040
So our metabolic rate, so this is, you know, he documents this through lots of assessments

738
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:02,360
of doubly labeled water on not just ourselves, but also kind of, you know, hunter-gatherers

739
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,400
that are still around today. And then of course, all the primates is, you know, we're really kind

740
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:14,040
of unique in our energy expenditure. Our, our energy needs are far greater than anything else.

741
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:21,240
And people like that would argue, Hey, that was kind of an advantage that we took to allow our

742
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:25,800
development, including our brain development. So there's kind of a reason we're at the top of the

743
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:34,040
food chain, which is we have a much greater brain and the price we pay for that is higher energy

744
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:40,760
expenditure. And the price we pay for that is we better be able to store energy because we will

745
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:47,880
have a much harder time tolerating a low energy environment. And so he talks about how even when

746
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,360
you put these animals in captivity and you overfeed them, they're not getting that much fatter,

747
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,480
right? They're, they're actually putting on lean mass. Now they, you know, I think what you could

748
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,000
argue, and he doesn't talk about this, but knowing what we know about human biology,

749
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,960
you might argue that they're still getting metabolically sick. Right. Just as humans,

750
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,800
when you're overfed, the real metabolic sickness comes not with the inflation of your subcutaneous

751
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:19,080
fat. It's when that spills out into the viscera, into the liver, into the peripancreatic space,

752
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:25,160
into the perinephric space, into the pericardial space. It's that fat that escapes the normal depot

753
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:31,320
of sub-q fat that is truly inflammatory and truly metabolically disturbing. So I throw all that in

754
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,760
there just to say like, it's just one more confounding variable that makes it difficult

755
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,600
to compare us even to an organism as complex as a rhesus monkey. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, people

756
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,880
certainly have made that criticism of the caloric restriction literature, you know, writ large, not

757
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,960
even taking into account the monkey studies, but the mouse studies, right? That there are,

758
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:58,360
you know, all sorts of differences between people and mice and the metabolic state that people have

759
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:03,240
evolved to fill is just completely different. Having said that, you're absolutely right that

760
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,960
even mice in the laboratory as they get older will show metabolic syndrome, right? You will see

761
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:15,080
many of the same changes insulin resistance, for example, that you see in people. And I don't-

762
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,200
And do you see it absent the adiposity? Can you see it-

763
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:25,080
Well, mice gain adiposity with age. They do in fact, become obese with age, right? On a,

764
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,200
again, on a pretty crappy diet, right? At a standard, well, I don't know if it's crappy or

765
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,320
not, the standard mouse diets, right? So, and I don't remember what the number is you made,

766
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,080
but in the Wisconsin study, right? A significant fraction of the control fed monkeys developed

767
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:45,080
diabetes, right? So- Yes. I want to say like a quarter of the controls were pre-diabetic by the

768
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,880
end of the study, again, which probably speaks to even though they weren't overweight, when they

769
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,560
get a, when you get 28 and a half percent of your calories from sugar, it's probably going to impair

770
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,040
your metabolism. Yeah. So, I think though the other, you know, the other point that's maybe worth at

771
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:07,480
least just mentioning here, because I hear people, you know, talk about how certain diets are better

772
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,920
for humans because it more mimics, you know, what we evolved to eat, right? I don't know whether

773
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,840
that's true or not. You could argue both sides of that. I don't see any particularly compelling

774
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,640
reason to think that that was the optimal longevity diet that, you know, humans ate.

775
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:27,240
I think that argument is illogical on several fronts. The first is,

776
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:33,240
and I don't know who coined this phrase, but it's so ubiquitous that it's obvious, like

777
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,280
by necessity, we had to be opportunistic omnivores. Right. Like there's simply no way

778
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:45,960
about it. Like to even suggest that our hunter gatherer forefathers were sitting around pontificating

779
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,640
about what they were and were not going to eat. What they should eat. Yeah. I mean, it's just the

780
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,160
dumbest thing I've ever heard, right? Like of course, I mean, I don't think people are actually

781
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,440
arguing that. But my point is it, the argument becomes so nonsensical when you realize

782
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:06,040
our evolution necessitated the most flexibility from a nutritional standpoint. Yes. And therefore,

783
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:16,040
we ate anything and everything. And I think because we never probably existed in an environment where

784
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:21,960
food abundance was so great that we could reach the level of over nutrition,

785
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,800
it gave us even more flexibility with what we could eat. Right. And kind of where I was going

786
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:36,360
with this, and I mean, it's interesting to think about is that maybe part of the reason why humans

787
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:43,480
seem to be fairly robust towards eating really, really crappy diets. I mean, certainly, obviously,

788
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:50,600
we have an obesity epidemic and all of that stuff happening. But people seem to be able to

789
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,560
tolerate a wide variety of different diets, some of which are pretty darn bad for them for many,

790
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,680
many years before you start to really see the significant consequences. So maybe that metabolic

791
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,360
flexibility. I was going to make a totally different point that's almost orthogonal to that,

792
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:12,680
which is you can make a case that people can survive in really remarkable health with diets

793
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,320
that look nothing like one another. In other words, you can look at somebody eating a really

794
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:23,960
well formulated, strict vegan diet where they're not getting any animal protein, which clearly our

795
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:30,360
ancestors all had animal protein whenever they could. They're often protein, a little protein

796
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,080
malnourished, but they're very healthy. Yeah. And similarly, look at the opposite end of that

797
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,880
spectrum. You can look at somebody on a ketogenic diet who, you know, the only thing they would

798
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,720
have in common between that other person is probably a lot of leafy vegetables. But other

799
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:49,560
than that, it's a much higher fat, higher protein diet. They can be very healthy. That, to me, speaks

800
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,480
to the resilience of our genome in terms of its interaction with nutrition. Yeah. And that's sort

801
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:01,400
of where I started, which is that there's no reason to think that the ancestral diet is best.

802
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,040
There's no reason to think that. But the other thing that I was thinking about when I started

803
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:16,920
down this path is that like many other things, our as a species, our dietary options and the

804
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:23,720
typical diet is evolving rapidly now, right? The quality of the food, the stuff that's in it,

805
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:29,240
the preservatives, you know, is dramatically different than it was 50 years ago, right? Both

806
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:35,160
in caloric content and nutritional content. And so in many ways, humans, you know,

807
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,480
taste. It tastes right. Absolutely. Which contributes to why a lot of people

808
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,560
want to eat more, right? So high calorie, really good tasting food that's often cheap.

809
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:51,640
But so the environment that we evolved into, obviously, is completely different than it is

810
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:57,480
today. But our environment is changing at an accelerating pace, I think. And that makes it

811
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:03,480
really, again, complicated to try to get into the minutia of what is optimal. Maybe we should be

812
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,840
thinking about what's good enough first, right? Because I think it's going to be really hard. And

813
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:15,960
again, this is where I struggle with the data that comes from epidemiological studies of people 20

814
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:22,600
years ago. The environment, the food quality is just very different for most people today.

815
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,720
Well, this is where the grandmother test comes in, right? And this is where when I watch like

816
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:35,720
the extremists on both sides argue, I say two things. The first is, look, there are really good

817
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,360
and really bad ways to do your respective diet, right? So I don't want to hear somebody tell me

818
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,120
that everybody on a vegan diet is doing well because I watched a lot of those kids in college,

819
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:49,880
and they literally were going to kill themselves eating ramen noodles and crackers and cookies all

820
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:55,800
day. So you can be vegan and eat pure garbage. You could be keto and eat pure garbage. The second

821
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,640
thing I would say is if you're eating those diets well, and I'm being a little subjective

822
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:05,000
when I say well, you're all shopping on the outer part of the perimeter of the grocery store.

823
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:13,240
It doesn't matter if you're carnivore, vegan, keto, low carb, paleo, whatever. If you're doing

824
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:19,160
those diets in the way that they were at least thought to exist, you aren't going down any aisles

825
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:25,000
of the grocery store. And that's kind of this grandmother test. If your great grandmother

826
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:31,320
didn't recognize what you're eating, it doesn't mean it's not good. I don't want to say that a

827
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,960
protein bar is not a good thing to eat. You just have to acknowledge there's a little more risk

828
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:44,040
there, right? Eating a carrot is inherently less risky than eating a protein bar with 14 ingredients

829
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:50,600
in it. That's just a fact. I think this is what you're getting at. Just a little bit of humility

830
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:57,160
around what is known, what is not known. And as we push the envelope of convenience,

831
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:04,440
of nutrient density, of economics, price, shareability, portability, the ability to

832
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:09,720
preserve things, we're going to take some risks. Yeah. I think that's exactly right.

833
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,960
Let's talk about more broadly a paper you wrote. How long has it been? Two years?

834
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,280
Well, we probably wrote it longer than two years ago. I think it came out at the end of 2021.

835
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,720
So it's fairly recent. You're talking about the science paper.

836
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,400
Yeah. And I'd read it before. So I was trying.

837
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,600
Maybe November, 2021 or so.

838
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,800
All right. So talk about the impetus for that paper, which I thought was a great paper and

839
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:40,120
we should discuss it in some detail. Yeah. So I was asked by one of the editors at Science to write

840
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:44,760
a review, I think on mTOR actually. And I was like, well, lots of people have written reviews

841
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:51,720
on mTOR. I've been thinking a lot about caloric restriction and particularly other nutritional

842
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:59,400
strategies that people have been studying in the field, like ketogenic diet, protein restriction,

843
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,400
time restricted feeding, intermittent fasting. And what do we actually know about those diets

844
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:10,360
and their effects on aging? Because I was of the, before I started to really dive into it. And this

845
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:16,920
isn't something that my lab researches directly. So we've previously done work on caloric restriction

846
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:22,600
in vertebrates and C. elegans, but we never really have done a lot of dietary interventions in mice.

847
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:30,120
And so, before I kind of dove into the literature, I had this impression that all of these diets were

848
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,520
similar in some ways and had maybe comparable effects on lifespan. At least that's the way it

849
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,560
gets portrayed if you read some of these reviews. And I don't even like to call them reviews because

850
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,440
I don't think honestly, much of what gets into the literature as review articles are actually

851
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:52,200
reviews. It's more one person's opinion piece on their specific thing that they study,

852
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,080
which is unfortunate. But if you read most of the reviews on caloric restriction and other dietary

853
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:03,480
interventions, they're very one-sided and they usually have phrases like fasting is known to

854
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:10,360
have all of these fantastic benefits and slows aging in every place where it's been looked at.

855
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,320
And you can see that for all these different dietary strategies. So I proposed to the editor

856
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:21,000
that maybe we should do a critical review of this space and think about what do we know?

857
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,480
What do we don't know? Are they equivalent? And to the extent possible, can we gain any insights

858
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:33,320
into whether or not these nutritional strategies, whether there's evidence that they have an

859
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,960
impact on the aging process in people? So that's kind of where we started. And I knew it was an

860
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:45,400
ambitious thing to tackle when I said it. And I'm not sure I really appreciated exactly how

861
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:54,600
challenging that was going to be because it's a huge area of literature. And it turns out,

862
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,480
maybe not shockingly, that there are many more questions than there are answers when you really

863
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:05,240
dive into it. So we really just started. So what was your process? Yeah. So we really just start,

864
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:11,000
the first step was, and I should say I had a fantastic set of co-authors, all really great

865
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,440
early career scientists who really helped me with this and did a lot of the legwork. I just

866
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,240
want to mention them by name. Please do. So Alessandro Bito, who was a postdoc with me,

867
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,560
Mitchell Lee, who was a former graduate student with me, and Crystal Hill, who's at the Pennington

868
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:34,040
Biomedical Research Institute. And she works on FGF21 and protein restriction. So those three were

869
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:39,480
co-authors on this paper with me, all just really fantastic early career scientists. So we started

870
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:47,320
by asking ourselves, OK, what are the different popular dietary interventions that people have

871
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,680
claimed have an effect on aging? And we came up with, I don't know, six or seven. And they were

872
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,920
the ones I've already mentioned. So there's true caloric restriction, which is pretty straightforward.

873
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:04,120
That really just means limiting the overall caloric intake that an animal gets by somewhere

874
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:10,840
between 20 towards the low end. And the most I've ever seen is 65% of calories. You were doing this

875
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,120
in animals and humans, or were you trying to start? We were mostly focusing on mice. We narrowed it

876
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:21,400
pretty quickly when we realized the scope of what we had undertaken. So we could have tried to do it

877
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:27,080
and fruit flies, worms, and all that stuff. We said, let's start with mice, see what's known,

878
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:34,600
and then try to look into humans and ask, are there parallels? So caloric restriction,

879
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,440
pretty straightforward. We actually don't go very deep into caloric restriction because that

880
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:43,320
literature is huge. And other people, I think, have done a pretty good job of reviewing true

881
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:47,320
caloric restriction. But there are some points there that we probably want to touch on that are

882
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:53,000
important. And then there are variants of caloric restriction, which include intermittent fasting,

883
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,280
time restricted feeding. How did you differentiate those two? I have a definition,

884
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,920
but I want to make sure yours is clear. So in mice, I think, well, so first of all,

885
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:12,360
the first differentiator we need to put across all of these things is, is it isocaloric or is it

886
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,920
a flavor of caloric restriction? Because it turns out, I would say the vast majority of studies in

887
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:23,160
mice of all of the things that we're going to talk about are flavors of caloric restriction. And what

888
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,560
I mean by that is the experimental group ate less calories than the control group.

889
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,280
Right. So it's time restricted feeding, but it's really caloric restriction in a narrower window.

890
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,720
Intermittent caloric restriction, maybe is the way you want to think of it. And there's actually

891
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:41,160
some nuance there that we can get to. But right. So how am I differentiating between time restricted

892
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:47,800
feeding and intermittent fasting? So I would say to my view, the easiest differentiator is time

893
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:54,440
restricted feeding is limiting the number of hours in any 24 hour period that the animal or person

894
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,520
eats. Right. And there are obviously, you're aware of this, there are flavors of time restricted

895
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:03,320
feeding and people where the window can be anywhere from 12 to six, sometimes even more

896
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:09,400
extreme than that. Right. But you limit the hours per day that the animal or the person eats.

897
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:15,560
Intermittent fasting, I would put in a 24 hour or more fast. Right. I think that's a reasonable

898
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,600
definition. That's actually the definition I use basically. Intermittent fast is a fast that occurs

899
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,840
at a frequency of greater than once a day. Right. Exactly. Yeah. The other thing I would say though

900
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,480
is the time restricted feeding gets even more complicated than that. Because there's evidence

901
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,680
that it's not only about how big the window is, but where in the day the window is. And that's

902
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:40,680
actually one of the things that came out of our review of the literature is there is this

903
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:48,840
clear connection between how much we eat and when we eat that ties into circadian rhythms.

904
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,400
And that circadian biology, even since this review came out, there have been papers that have come

905
01:25:53,400 --> 01:26:00,360
out that re-emphasize the importance of when we eat and what we eat. I don't think it's either.

906
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:08,200
I think it's both. That suggests that that's probably going to be significant in terms of the

907
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,080
consequences of the long-term health effects. Right. I'm hoping I'm going to remember to come

908
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,200
back to that, but let's keep going. Okay. So then there's what people call fasting mimicking diets,

909
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:23,640
which are diets that I've been engineered to some extent to induce the same metabolic changes as

910
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,760
caloric restriction, usually very low sugar, relatively low protein, high fat, but also very

911
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:34,600
low calorie. So that clearly goes in the bucket of a flavor of caloric restriction. There's

912
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:40,680
ketogenic diets is another one. And then there's protein restriction. I think that's the.

913
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,520
Isocaloric protein restriction.

914
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:47,400
Both. So again, you really have to look, you have to take each paper one by one and figure out,

915
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:53,640
is it isocaloric or isn't it? And that's in some cases just not simply not possible because the

916
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,400
data is just not there, but you have to look closely. So there are examples of both.

917
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,360
I guess one way to think about it is, is it ad lib or not is one way to sort of think about it.

918
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:07,960
In other words, an ad lib ketogenic diet might end up restricting energy that non-deliberately.

919
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,880
That's one way to think about it, but I don't, I don't know that that answers the question of

920
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,360
whether the benefit comes from caloric restriction. So that's the complication, but I agree with you.

921
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:23,640
It's different. And you know, we don't think about this much in mice, but certainly in people,

922
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:29,640
it's true. If you are not ad lib, there are psychological consequences to not eating when

923
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:35,000
you want to being hungry all the time. Good, bad, indifferent, but there are, those are, those,

924
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,080
those have biological consequences as well. So they are different. Absolutely.

925
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:46,920
Let's go back to the circadian one. I want to kind of get the insights there. How do,

926
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:51,720
so first of all, let's talk about what you know in mice and then let's figure out if there's any

927
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,880
extrapolation. So, so when we wrote the paper, there wasn't much on this. I mean, people were

928
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:02,360
thinking about it, particularly in the context of time restricted feeding, right? That, that there

929
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,840
might be differences in the window of time restricted feeding for, for in humans, right?

930
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,160
Early in the day, late in the day. There's been a couple of papers that have come out

931
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:17,960
since we wrote the review in mice that I think make a pretty compelling case that the lifespan

932
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:27,640
benefit from say a 30% caloric restriction diet is a combination of when the animals are eating

933
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:33,720
and how much they're eating. Most of the benefit seems to come from the calories. So, you know,

934
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:38,120
let's just say this may not be exactly right, but I think it's close. Let's just say that you get a

935
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:45,320
30% lifespan extension from 30% caloric restriction that the two thirds of that benefit comes from

936
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,120
the calories. But one third of the benefit actually comes from the fact that those mice

937
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:55,240
eat all their food in a short window and are fasted essentially the rest of that 24 hour

938
01:28:55,240 --> 01:29:00,520
period. And if you force them to, I mean, and I say force, cause if you give a calorically

939
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:04,840
restricted mouse, it's food, it's going to eat it right away. So if you force them to eat little

940
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:11,160
bits throughout the day, you lose a portion of that lifespan benefit, which is really interesting.

941
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:17,320
Now a mouse eating in an hour and then going 23 hours without food,

942
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:22,680
what would we even compare that to? I don't know. Yeah. I mean, this is, I really don't

943
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,680
don't feel comfortable even speculating. So, I mean, I think that, you know, the first simplistic

944
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,840
approach would be to say, well, a mouse lives about three years, a human lives about, you know,

945
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,680
I was thinking more of like, how long does a mouse take before it dies from starvation?

946
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,160
So that's where I was going to go next. I think that sort of length of lifespan is not the approach

947
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:49,080
you take when it comes to metabolism. So I would say that, and this is total back of the envelope

948
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:56,680
calculation, but a one day, maybe it's like a one to four ratio. So a one day mouse fast might be a

949
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:02,600
four or five day fast in people, but that's not even perfectly true because a mouse, you know,

950
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:09,320
a mouse will go into ketosis relatively quickly within 24 hours, right? Sure. And a human can go

951
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:14,120
into ketosis that quickly, depending a little bit on their incoming diet. Yeah, exactly. Right. So,

952
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:19,400
so it's not a, it's not a perfect equivalency, but maybe one to four or five. I hope I'm not

953
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:24,680
saying something totally stupid here, but I think that's probably pretty close. So yeah. So again,

954
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:29,080
it's very different, potentially these kinds of studies in mice. The other thing that I think

955
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,240
most people don't appreciate unless they've actually done these caloric restriction

956
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:39,240
experiments is that if you go back to the, you know, the classic experiments of Rick Weindrach

957
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:45,400
and Roy Walford, those mice are fed a calorically restricted diet. They're also fed three times a

958
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:51,720
week. So they are in fact, you know, fasting. It's insane. It's like they're basically doing a

959
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,720
two week fast between their meals. Yeah. And so what you see, even in 24 hours in a fasted mouse,

960
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:02,520
you see pretty dramatic reductions in organ size, right? And so, you know, if the mice are being

961
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:09,080
fed three times a week, they're going through this, you know, reduction in organ size and then this

962
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:15,400
huge expansion. Right. So, and you can see that, that sort of decrease in organ size and then

963
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:21,080
rapid, rapid increase even on some of the fasting mimicking diet work that Walter Longo has done. So

964
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:25,560
again, you know, I think this just, has anybody done their reverse experiment where you try to

965
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,880
actually mimic the way humans eat and you take two groups of mice and the controls are fed

966
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:37,400
whatever, a hundred percent of the nutrient, but they're fed every two hours over the course of

967
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:43,160
the day. And the CR group are given, you know, 70% of that, but they're fed at the same time

968
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:47,400
intervals constantly throughout the day. In other words, you make it purely a calorie thing and you

969
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,960
really take out the fasting except when they're sleeping. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, I think at least

970
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:57,320
one of these two studies that I was referring to did that, right? Oh, so that's how they were able

971
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,040
to identify that two thirds of the benefit came from the reduction in calories and a third of it

972
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:08,680
came from the additional fast. Right. Right. Exactly. So, and in my mind, I think this is

973
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,800
really important because this is one of the, this is one of the points that we made in our review

974
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:19,080
is if you look at the vast majority of the literature around intermittent fasting and

975
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:25,880
time restricted feeding and fasting mimicking diets, they're calorically restricted. So there,

976
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:31,640
there's a fasting period and a caloric restriction component. And none of the prior studies really,

977
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:40,120
really teased that out in a way that allowed us to have an understanding of how much is calories

978
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:45,000
and how much is fasting and maybe how much is when you're fasted. That's still, I think,

979
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:52,760
is an open question. Okay. So what else can we say about early fruit feeding versus late feeding?

980
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:56,440
What do we know about early in life? No, early in day versus late in day.

981
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:02,360
Yeah. I mean, this is an area I'll admit I'm not, I'm not an expert in. So I don't honestly have

982
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:10,120
an opinion about which is better. And again, this is where I think mice are not going to be a good

983
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:16,840
model for humans. So I think that we really, those studies need to be done in people. And again,

984
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:23,160
that gets- Now some have suggested that an early feeding window versus a late feeding window

985
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:28,840
produces better pairing of our insulin sensitivity to our nutrient arrival. I think that makes sense.

986
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:37,320
Most people would agree that particularly if you're eating something that causes your blood

987
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:42,280
sugar to spike, that doing that right before you go to bed, it probably suboptimal. So I think

988
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:49,720
maybe that can explain most of that, the observation that has been made that it might be better to do.

989
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:54,440
If you're going to do a time restricted feeding, it might be better early or somewhere, at least

990
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:59,320
not right before bedtime, I guess I would say. But again, I think these kinds of questions are

991
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:07,240
really complicated in humans because you could ask what benefit are we looking at? So if you're

992
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:13,720
looking at overnight blood glucose levels, sure. Makes no difference. Of course. If you're looking

993
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,640
at sleep quality, maybe it's going to be different. Or maybe it's going to be different in different

994
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:24,360
people. If you're looking at other biomarkers, again, it could be different. So I think it's,

995
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,120
again, in my mind at least, maybe you have a different opinion on this. In my mind at least,

996
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:35,320
it's not even really clear how we evaluate what is better and what is suboptimal.

997
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,840
It may depend on what your endpoint is, what you're actually interested in optimizing.

998
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:48,840
I mean, clinically we see in people who wear CGM that early feeding produces an overall lower

999
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:54,840
average glucose for sure. Because even if you get the same spike, let's say, if you're doing

1000
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,480
the same meal early in the day versus late in the day, there's something about how long it takes to

1001
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,640
come down at night versus in the morning. Now that could be you're more insulin sensitive in

1002
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:09,800
the morning and therefore it comes down quicker. It could be something to do with pairing sleep

1003
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:15,480
with the nutrition that is tweaking this and that there's a feedback loop where the excess glucose

1004
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,640
creates a little more cortisol. You get a little more hepatic glucose up. But again,

1005
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,000
I don't really know if that makes sense. I mean, I've heard people argue that, but at the same time,

1006
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,840
you theoretically should have the lowest cortisol at night anyway. So that really shouldn't be an

1007
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,200
issue. I don't really know what it is other than just to say I've observed it empirically.

1008
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:37,160
Yeah. And it generally doesn't produce a great quality of sleep. But again, to me, this starts

1009
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,440
to get into, which I want to hear more about, but this gets into the minutia of like, at some point,

1010
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:47,720
you just got to focus more on other things. But I want to go down this rabbit hole just for the

1011
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:53,560
sake of completeness. Yeah, sure. So I mean, again, I think to some extent that's almost where we

1012
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:58,760
ended up, right? Was that it's, I guess, let me give the big picture answer for why I think

1013
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:06,840
this is important. So I think these nutritional intervention studies in mice are very powerful

1014
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:12,200
for dissecting the biological mechanisms that underlie the effects that they have.

1015
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:19,800
And some of these diets clearly have effects on aging, right? I'm very, very hesitant to

1016
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:26,120
suggest that people should adopt any of these diets based on the rodent literature where it's

1017
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,720
at today. And I think there are a whole variety of reasons for that. But that's kind of where I

1018
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:37,160
ended up, right? I think they're super useful for understanding the biology. I'm really not sure

1019
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:41,240
that they're going to work the same way in humans. What did you learn about the protein restriction

1020
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:46,600
in the ketogenic diet mechanistically in the mice? Yeah. So again, a couple things to say about that,

1021
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,240
the ketogenic diet studies, there have really only been two that I'm aware of that looked at lifespan

1022
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:58,520
and health span in mice. They were slightly different, but in mice, you have to go to really,

1023
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:03,960
really low sugar to actually get the mice to go into ketosis. Yeah. I mean, these are essentially

1024
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:13,160
1% or less carbohydrate diets. So again, that's a difference from people. One of the studies that

1025
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:18,440
fed a ketogenic diet lifelong saw no effect on lifespan, but they did an intermittent ketogenic

1026
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:22,760
diet. I don't remember the exact protocol, but it was something like every other day or maybe once

1027
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:28,600
every three days or something. And there there was about a, I think a 15% increase in lifespan.

1028
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,320
And I'm sorry, what did they do on the other days, the animals?

1029
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,880
Regular diet. Sorry, regular diet. So it was just back and forth between the control diet and the

1030
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,960
ketogenic diet. Yeah. And that didn't result in caloric restriction. That's the thing, the mice

1031
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:44,760
were calorically restricted. So in some ways it's a intermittent caloric restriction, right? And this

1032
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,240
is what I would say. It's also interesting because the fasting mimicking diet papers are intermittent

1033
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:57,560
ketogenic diets. So, so I think that, you know, maybe that's one thing to agree on is that

1034
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:05,000
intermittent ketogenic diets in mice can increase lifespan and seem to have benefits for health span.

1035
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:11,160
But, but the ketogenic, the effects aren't huge, right? Again, that's the other take home,

1036
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:15,560
I would say from, from our study. There are two nutritional interventions that

1037
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:21,400
relatively consistently give big effects on lifespan. One is caloric restriction

1038
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:27,160
and one is protein restriction. And they, you know, again, caloric restriction,

1039
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:35,960
the, the most extreme study that I've seen is 65% restriction. And that gave about a 65%

1040
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:42,760
increase in lifespan. So these are big, big, big sizes. I wasn't aware of that. Yeah. That's this

1041
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:51,000
Wahlford and Weindrich and Wahlford paper. Okay. And when did they start that? And how long did

1042
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,720
that restriction last? That's a good question. I don't remember. It was probably six or nine

1043
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:01,720
months. I think most of their studies were, you know, early onset caloric restriction. And they,

1044
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:06,600
this study was really interesting because they did, you know, a graded response from,

1045
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:16,920
you know, 90%, 80%, 60%, 50%, 40% of ad lib. And you get essentially a graded response in lifespan

1046
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,000
and it's roughly linear. So, so I think, you know, that's why I said about 60%

1047
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,960
So 90% animals, 90%? No, but they didn't go that far. They didn't go beyond 60 or 65%.

1048
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:30,120
And I also think this is an interesting study because I don't think you could do that study

1049
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:36,920
today because the animal care wouldn't allow you to restrict by 60, 65%.

1050
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:40,600
And an element that we don't think about enough, which is what were those, what did those mice

1051
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:48,040
feel like? Like think about how angry those mice would have been on a third of their normal caloric

1052
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:52,440
intake. I mean, you know, again, I haven't done these kind of mouse caloric restrictions studies

1053
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:56,840
myself. I've obviously talked to a lot of people who did. I think to really appreciate that you've

1054
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:02,040
got to probably be in the animal room, you know, feeding them, seeing them, right? Certainly,

1055
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,960
activity goes up quite dramatically. That's one of the remarkable things about caloric restriction

1056
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:14,840
in mice is that they are more active throughout life than ad lib fed mice are. And maybe it's a

1057
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:20,680
sort of, you know, foraging response, evolutionarily selected foraging response, but but they are

1058
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:25,400
definitely you give them a running wheel and they'll just run and run and run and run. So yeah,

1059
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:30,680
there are behavioral changes for sure, in mice that are calorically restricted. And this is

1060
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:36,360
actually one of my real concerns about caloric restriction in people. I mean, I think first of

1061
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:41,240
all, you know, we should we should be realistic and recognize you're never going to get a significant

1062
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:47,080
fraction of the population to calorically restrict, right? It's hard enough to get people to calorically

1063
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:52,440
restrict down to a healthy weight. To get them to go 30% beyond that is just not going to happen.

1064
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:00,040
But of the people I know who and I mean, being in this field, I know people who have done every

1065
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:04,840
possible, you know, anti aging intervention you could imagine. And of the people I know,

1066
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:08,280
I know a lot of people who've dabbled in various forms of caloric restriction.

1067
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:17,080
Certainly true caloric restriction has real psychological consequences. And I and I really

1068
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:22,280
would be concerned, I have been concerned for some of the people I know who've done this.

1069
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:27,720
If a lot of you know, if we if we started trying to do this in in the general public, right, I mean,

1070
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:32,120
there are there's social isolation that you get when you're calorically restricting, but then

1071
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:36,920
there's, you know, the biological changes in the brain and you're hungry all the time. So again,

1072
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:42,920
I just think we you know, we often don't appreciate those aspects of some of these nutritional

1073
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,920
interventions. But in the mice, I think it's hard to know what their psychological consequences

1074
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:51,800
are. What do we know about caloric restriction later in life in the mice versus earlier? I mean,

1075
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,920
the sort of traditional thinking is you have a window in which you can do it early. And beyond

1076
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:01,080
that, it's not as effective. I think we're going to talk about some data that counter that. And then

1077
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:07,560
of course, you have the NIA experiment we talked about earlier in the monkeys where the early fast

1078
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:12,760
didn't improve longevity, the late fast appears to have although that was sort of a subgroup

1079
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:18,680
analysis. Hard to hard to draw causation there. Yeah. So so what I would say about the mice is

1080
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:24,600
that for a long time, the sort of dogma was that caloric restriction didn't work if you started it,

1081
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,080
you know, past, I don't know, 15 months of age, which is maybe the mouse equivalent of a

1082
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:35,080
4050 year old person. So most of the early caloric restriction studies were done,

1083
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:40,040
like I said, starting sometimes pre development, the early rat studies were pre development,

1084
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:45,160
and then sometimes, you know, six, nine months of age. So that was sort of when I first started in

1085
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,760
the field, that's kind of what I was told, like this is a settled question. Late more recent

1086
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:57,480
studies that have been done in some ways more carefully, different diets, certainly. If you do

1087
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:03,800
a graded onset of caloric restriction, in other words, don't go right from ad lib to 40% restriction

1088
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:09,960
the next day, you do sort of a graded onset, you can get lifespan benefits from caloric restriction

1089
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:18,280
you know, 20, 22 months of age. So whether it's as good as starting early, I think the consensus

1090
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:24,680
is still that the answer is no, you're never going to get the same magnitude of benefit from

1091
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:31,480
caloric restriction starting late as you do starting early. But that could be wrong. So I would say

1092
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:36,920
that's the consensus. But I don't think we know we know for sure whether it's possible if you did

1093
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,360
it just right, that you could get, you know, most or all of the benefits from starting late in life.

1094
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:49,000
So Matt, on this topic of CR and mice, you know, again, the dogma has generally been,

1095
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,720
and I've been victim of this just sort of blindly assuming it to be the case that, you know, CR and

1096
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:59,960
mice only works early in life. Again, is that how applicable is that to humans? I don't know.

1097
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:05,720
But, you know, a listener of the podcast actually pointed out that, you know, in fact, there are

1098
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:11,240
some data that try to get at this question elsewhere. So there's this Hahn study 2019,

1099
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:17,720
which we'll link to that looked at 800 female mice. Now, this is a pretty elegant experiment,

1100
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:24,120
right? So for the first three months, they ran these mice out on an ad libitum diet. And then

1101
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:31,160
at three months, they were split randomized to I believe a 40% calorie restriction versus ad lib.

1102
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:37,320
They ran that out until 24 months. And then each of those groups was further split ad lib versus

1103
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:42,600
continued on. So you had one group that was, everybody's the same till three months, one

1104
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:47,160
group that spent the rest of their life on dietary restriction, one group that spent the rest of their

1105
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:54,840
life ad lib, and then you had the middle groups. 21 months calorie restricted, then to ad lib,

1106
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:00,440
21 months ad lib to then calorie restricted. Okay, so the ends of this were not interesting,

1107
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:05,320
right? Meaning the ad lib group lived the shortest. We were looking at the figure earlier

1108
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:10,600
today 1200 days, roughly, going back to a maximum lifespan. Yeah, maximum lifespan. That's right.

1109
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,840
Median lifespan would have been looking at the graph about 900 days, which is pretty good.

1110
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:19,400
So I was gonna say, how does that stack up with what we talked about on the last podcast about

1111
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:23,320
length of life of control? That's a reasonable lifespan for control. I think if I remember

1112
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:28,360
correctly, this was also done not in C57 black six, but in a little bit longer lived hybrid.

1113
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:34,280
That's right, F1 hybrid. Yeah, so it's reasonable lifespan. Yeah. Okay. Looking at the all CR all

1114
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:40,600
day mice, looks like they had a maximum lifespan of just below, they have to call it 1400 in chain

1115
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,880
with a median that I'm going to say was about 1150. Yeah, so it's good, good lifespan extension.

1116
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:50,520
Okay. So now what's interesting is the middle groups, which is really try, so I'm going to just

1117
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:53,480
give you my little iPad so you can look at that table, which we'll link to. It's okay, I got it

1118
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,800
right here. You got it right here? All right. I just love the picture. I remember the take-home

1119
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,840
message. You do? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what happened to the two middle groups? Right. So I

1120
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,320
mean, the interesting thing, well, the one thing I would say is I think this is a pretty early onset

1121
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,480
of CR. It really is three months. Yeah, this gets back to what I was talking about before that,

1122
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:15,800
it seems likely from the early studies that were done in rats where they got some of these really,

1123
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:20,600
really large effects that some of the benefits of CR come from actually being restricted during

1124
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:26,520
development itself. So I think that's useful to put into context. So then the big question here is

1125
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:32,680
what happens if you start caloric restriction late in life or what this study did that I'm not

1126
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,720
really aware of anybody doing previously is kind of the flip. It's almost like a crossover.

1127
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:44,840
That's right. Yeah, totally is. Yeah. So in this case, when they started CR late in life,

1128
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:51,880
there is a significant but not huge effect. The magnitude of the lifespan extension is

1129
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:58,600
much less than in the mice that were on CR from three months of age. That makes sense. That fits

1130
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:03,880
with what else is in the literature. There were earlier studies. I think Steve Spindler did one,

1131
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:08,840
not too many years, maybe four or five years before this one that did sort of a similar sort of

1132
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:15,480
approach that starting around 15 months of age. And they saw a significant but not as large benefit

1133
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,800
from starting late in life. So that seems to be the consensus. The thing that's really interesting

1134
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:27,800
here is what happens if you're CR'd for an earlier period in life and then back on AL?

1135
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:34,680
Do you lose the benefit? And it seems like the answer is no. Those animals actually were longer

1136
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:42,200
lived than the mice that went on CR late in life. So you could ask some questions about is it about

1137
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:48,520
the total amount of your life that you're restricted? Is it about when you go on and when you come off?

1138
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:54,200
And I think in mice, this is still an open question. We don't really know what the mechanisms are.

1139
01:47:54,200 --> 01:48:00,840
Although the early in life mice had a longer median. The median life expectancy was longer.

1140
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,120
The ones that were on CR and then switched to ad lib. Yes, that's right.

1141
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:10,040
So they lived a little bit longer, but the bigger difference was the median life expectancy was

1142
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:17,000
higher than the flipped group. Yes, although I think we have a little bit difference in

1143
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:23,000
definitions. I tend to think first about median. You seem to think first about maximum. But yeah,

1144
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,600
I think what you're saying is right. The median lifespan is quite different in those two groups.

1145
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:34,360
That's right. It is the difference. The maximum is very trivial. That's right. So I think, again,

1146
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:39,320
the real question here is, well, aside from what does this mean for humans, which I would say,

1147
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,480
we can't draw too many conclusions from humans from this, but what is the underlying mechanism?

1148
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:50,680
Is it really just about the total amount of time that you've been on CR? Or is there an interaction

1149
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:57,720
with how old you are, the developmental process, and then what happens at the end of life, which is

1150
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:05,800
mostly the degenerative process and when you go on CR? I think maybe one thing that's worth adding

1151
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:11,240
to this too is it's an interesting comparison to what we know about mTOR and rapamycin. So with

1152
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:17,880
rapamycin, the data are pretty clear that you can start rapamycin certainly well into middle age

1153
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:23,800
and maybe even into very old age and get most of the benefit. So if you compare the curve here,

1154
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:28,760
where they started the mice on CR at 22 or 24 months, whatever it is, the effect is pretty small

1155
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:35,560
compared to CR. With rapamycin, you get almost exactly the same benefit starting at 20, 22,

1156
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:41,080
24 months as you do starting early in life. So that might tell us that there's a difference.

1157
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:46,120
There's a different mechanism potentially as well. It could be that rap is doing something different

1158
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:50,440
or it's a different dose effect relative to it. Yeah, exactly. So that's an open question

1159
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:55,480
exactly why it's different, but it seems to be different. I'm really glad you brought that up

1160
01:49:55,480 --> 01:50:01,560
because we talked about that with Rich Miller on his podcast, which was a fortuitous accident

1161
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:06,040
basically because they couldn't get the formulation of rapamycin. My favorite story in

1162
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:10,200
science. One of my favorite stories in science. Yeah, tell people that story. Yeah, right. So

1163
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:18,360
take a step back. The NIA started this program called the Interventions Testing Program. It must

1164
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:23,560
have been the early 90s and the idea here was maybe it was early 2000s. Sorry, I'm dating myself

1165
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:29,480
again, losing my decades. So early 2000s. And the idea here was I think really smart. The idea was

1166
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:36,760
that we could create a tool where the scientific community could nominate interventions for

1167
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,320
lifespan testing in mice and it was set up so that it would be done in triplicate. So there are

1168
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:47,720
three sites. There still are three sites for the ITP. So anybody in the community can nominate

1169
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:54,360
any intervention. There's a selection committee that selects them every year. And if an intervention

1170
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:00,520
is selected, then the intervention testing program sites start the cohorts of mice on that

1171
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:06,920
intervention in whatever year it was selected for. So sometime back in the early 2000s, Dave Sharp

1172
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:12,520
nominated rapamycin. And in some ways he was ahead of his time because this was, I think when he

1173
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:18,120
nominated rapamycin, it was even before the first invertebrate studies on mTOR and rapamycin. It was

1174
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:21,960
right around the same time they were being published. So he I think was thinking about

1175
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:28,040
it from a cancer perspective primarily. In any case, he nominated rapamycin, it got selected,

1176
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:35,400
it went into the cohort and they typically test five or six interventions or drugs each year.

1177
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:40,760
So they have a huge number of animals at each of these three sites that are destined for these

1178
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:47,000
interventions to be tested in and rapamycin was one of them. And Randy Strong, who's one of the

1179
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,600
PIs on the high TP, who's also got a strong biochemistry background, I think recognized

1180
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,920
pretty quickly that the rapamycin wasn't stable in the food. We could actually come back to this if

1181
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:02,920
you want to, because this is relevant for people as well. And it gets broken down in the pH of the

1182
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:09,560
gut. So basically, if they just put the powder in the food, there's no bioavailability. It doesn't

1183
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:13,400
get taken up by the mice. And so they recognized that right when they were supposed to start the

1184
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,200
experiment. And you know, of course, they were like, crap, what do we do? You know, we could just

1185
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:23,640
not test rapamycin. And I don't know if it was Randy or who somebody said, well, I think I can

1186
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:29,400
figure out a way to stabilize the rapamycin, put it in the food so that we can give it to the mice

1187
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,160
and we can do the lifespan experiment. I think what they didn't recognize was that it was going

1188
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:38,520
to take 18 months or so to figure this out. So once they finally developed this in what they call

1189
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:44,600
e-RAPA, encapsulated rapamycin, it's basically designed so that it won't break down in the

1190
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:49,800
gastric pH. Once they developed that, they were now 18 months into this lifespan experiment.

1191
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,840
Before this, everybody, I think everybody, myself included in the field, thought you had to start

1192
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,840
early in life or you weren't going to get much of a benefit. There was really almost no chance a drug

1193
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:05,400
was going to increase lifespan starting that late in life. But fortunately, they went ahead with the

1194
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,920
experiment starting at 20 months of age. And what they found was that they got this robust lifespan

1195
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:16,120
extension from starting with rapamycin treatment at 20 months of age. And just to give some context,

1196
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:22,440
that's about the mouse equivalent of a 60 or 65 year old person. And I love the experiment.

1197
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:26,600
I love the outcome obviously, because, you know, first of all, nobody thought it was going to work,

1198
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:30,040
except maybe Rich Miller, maybe I'll give Rich credit, maybe he thought it was going to work.

1199
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:37,080
And it was really the first time anybody had convincingly shown that you could start an

1200
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:43,160
intervention in middle age in a mouse and get robust lifespan extension. And for me,

1201
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:47,720
honestly, I reviewed that paper. And when I first time I saw that result, I'm like,

1202
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:53,320
this changes everything. We actually have a chance for translational geroscience, because

1203
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,720
you might be able to intervene late in the aging process and have significant impact.

1204
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:03,480
So honestly, that was 2009 when the paper came out. So in the 13 years since then,

1205
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:08,760
the whole paradigm in the field has changed, right? Most people who are studying interventions today

1206
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:15,240
are studying things that they test for efficacy late in life, because that's what we need to do

1207
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:20,440
in people. So it was a super important result for the field for that reason. And it all came

1208
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:26,760
about by an accident. Nobody would have designed that study that way beforehand, right? So yeah,

1209
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:31,480
it's fortuitous for sure. Now you were going to make a point about the bioavailability of

1210
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:34,840
rapa as well. This is something that's only recently come across my radar, but I've heard

1211
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:41,400
several results now that convinced me that it's true. So I mentioned the reason why they had to

1212
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,920
make this e-rapa is because rapamycin isn't stable at the gastric pH of mice. Same thing seems to be

1213
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:53,480
true in people. So there are people who are getting their rapamycin from the rapamune,

1214
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:58,680
which is the brand name generic or the brand name cerolimus that comes in these triangle-shaped

1215
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:02,280
pills. There are also people who are getting it from compounding pharmacies. And I've heard of

1216
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:10,200
several cases now where the bioavailability is much lower in the compounded rapamycin in a capsule

1217
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:17,400
than in the actual rapamein. The white and yellow triangle. Yeah. So it's just something for people

1218
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,920
to be aware of. And I don't think most physicians are aware of it. I don't think most compounding

1219
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:25,880
pharmacies are aware of it. We've never had it compounded. So we've only prescribed

1220
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:32,760
cerolimus or rapamune. And it's not a cheap drug. So I can understand why there's a desire to

1221
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:37,720
compound it because it's got to be like five, six bucks a milligram. Yeah. I think that's about

1222
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:42,440
right. So Matt, obviously one of the other things that came out of that review article in the animal

1223
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:47,960
stuff was, as you said, the protein restriction. And I think of all the topics in nutrition,

1224
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:53,400
this is the one I'm most interested in. I really don't care that much about fat and carbs. Don't

1225
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:58,920
tell anybody. But I care an awful lot about protein. In fact, when you came over today,

1226
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:03,800
you probably saw me chasing down what was left of a protein shake. And I think I was mentioning to

1227
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:11,640
you or my wife, that's the only part of nutrition that is kind of, I don't want to say a chore,

1228
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:17,160
but it's a very deliberate part of how I go about the day, which is I really have to think about it.

1229
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:24,200
And the reason is I'm trying to eat a gram of protein per pound of body weight spread out into

1230
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:28,360
four buckets. Right. Right. Because if you, you know, I think there's reasonable evidence to

1231
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:33,880
suggest that if you consume too much protein in one sitting, and it's typically more than about

1232
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:40,600
0.25 grams per pound is the general thinking you're going to end up oxidizing some of that protein.

1233
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:45,400
So it's not that it's harmful. It's just that you're not getting the amino acids you need for

1234
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:50,200
muscle protein synthesis, which is of course our objective. So that means I'm kind of walking

1235
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:57,080
around trying to get 40 grams here, 40 grams there, 40 grams here, 40 grams there. And truthfully,

1236
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:04,200
that's not trivial if you're not willing to consume a whole bunch of crap with it. I mean,

1237
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:10,280
if you're really just trying to focus on the protein quality. So look, the RDA says I'm crazy,

1238
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:18,440
right? The recommended daily allowance of protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram. Right. Which is less

1239
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:24,600
than half of what I would consume. Why, where do you see the, and by the way, it's not just that

1240
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:29,320
I'm making up the amount that I'm consuming. I'm doing it on the basis of other data that suggests

1241
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:33,560
that this is the amount of protein consumption you need for optimal muscle protein synthesis.

1242
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,920
Right. So where does this disconnect? Yeah. So I mean, I think first of all,

1243
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:42,360
we can talk about the rodent studies, right, which is in the biology of aging. I think the RDA

1244
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:46,920
question, you know, that there, that that's a different question. It's my understanding that

1245
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:55,080
that actually was developed to be a protein balance for 95% of the population when sedentary.

1246
01:57:55,080 --> 01:58:01,160
Right. So I think what that means, first of all, that's a minimum amount, not necessarily the

1247
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:05,880
optimal amount. And it probably very much depends on lifestyle. Right.

1248
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,040
And lean body mass to begin with, even though it's sort of normalized too.

1249
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:14,040
So I think, I think, and the reason why I bring this up is I think there's a lot, again, a lot of

1250
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:20,920
confusion among the general public about what the RDA means. And it's not, it's not necessarily a

1251
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:25,400
bad thing to be above the RDA in some areas, right? Maybe a lot of areas. So I think that's just

1252
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:28,360
worth, worth, you know, expanding on just, just a little bit.

1253
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:33,320
Yeah, I think I agree completely. I, I sort of jokingly think of the RDA for protein as what

1254
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,360
you need to not waste away and wither up and die.

1255
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:41,080
Right. Exactly. Yeah. So right. So you're not losing muscle mass. Yeah. So, so then the question

1256
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:45,720
of what is the relationship between protein and aging, I think is a really important one. And

1257
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:52,120
it's gotten a lot of attention in the field. And like I think a lot of other things, there's a lack

1258
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:57,480
of clarity about what we actually know and what we should be recommending to people. So let's take a

1259
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:03,720
step back and start with the animal studies that the mouse studies. I think there it's pretty clear

1260
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:09,640
that you can extend lifespan through protein restriction. And there are actually, again,

1261
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:15,240
a couple of flavors of protein restriction. You can restrict all protein down to, you know, some,

1262
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:21,320
some percentage, some low percentage, or you can restrict specific amino acids, particularly

1263
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:26,680
branched chains, tryptophan, methionine, or branched chain amino acids are the ones that have been

1264
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:32,280
studied. And, and again, I make that distinction because it's not really clear that the mechanisms

1265
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:38,680
are the same across these different flavors of protein restriction. The common mechanism

1266
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:44,920
that, that does seem to potentially underlie all of these forms of protein restriction is inhibition

1267
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,400
of mTOR. And again, that's partly why this becomes complicated when we, especially when we start

1268
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:55,720
talking about extrapolation to human, you and I both recognize that inhibition of mTOR can have

1269
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,840
beneficial effects in the context of aging and health span, certainly in mice, almost certainly

1270
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:07,000
in people, I would say. And protein is an activator of mTOR. And we know a fair amount about the

1271
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,640
biochemistry of that, that, that particularly branched chain amino acids can directly activate

1272
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:19,240
mTOR through cestrines. And that's sort of all worked out. And so it seems counter, it seems

1273
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,200
intuitive that protein restriction would be beneficial by turning down mTOR. It seems counter

1274
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:28,280
intuitive that that what you were just talking about would be beneficial because you might be

1275
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:32,840
hyperactivating mTOR. So we can dive into that. But I think that that's kind of the, that's the,

1276
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:39,640
that's the simplest possible mechanism I can think of for why protein restriction, especially

1277
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:44,920
branched chain amino acid restriction would be having an impact on lifespan and health span

1278
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:51,960
in mice. The other player that seems to be important, particularly in total protein restriction

1279
02:00:52,600 --> 02:01:01,640
is a protein called FGF21, fibroblast growth factor 21, that is secreted in response to a

1280
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:08,520
low protein diet, and then has effects on liver metabolism and also inhibition of mTOR reduction

1281
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:14,440
of IGF-1. So that seems to be required for the lifespan extension that is seen from protein

1282
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:20,120
restriction in mice, potentially partially upstream of mTOR and, and liver metabolism.

1283
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:26,840
The interesting thing there is FGF21 overexpression by itself has also been reported to be sufficient

1284
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:32,520
to extend lifespan in mice. So, so it kind of fits that that, that could be part of the story.

1285
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:41,160
So the question then, one question is, is protein restriction always beneficial in mice? And can we

1286
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:46,600
separate it from caloric restriction? And so this is where you really have to look closely at the

1287
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:53,960
studies and determine, you know, did the mice on protein restriction eat less, eat the same amount

1288
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,320
and eat more? And it's interesting because you can actually find examples of all of those. And

1289
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:01,960
honestly, I don't really understand why that's the case, except it's something about the different

1290
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:07,880
compositions of the diet. What does seem to be the case is that when you restrict for certain

1291
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:14,840
amino acids, you're, if you're deficient for a methionine, for example, or tryptophan, the mice

1292
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:19,720
absolutely will eat more and they don't gain weight. And they do seem to live a little bit longer.

1293
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,920
So that could be a somewhat distinct mechanism there that we don't really understand.

1294
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:30,200
So tell me what was the most compelling evidence you saw when you tried to tease apart the

1295
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:36,360
relationship between protein and total intake? So again, I think the branched chain amino acid

1296
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:43,080
and methionine restriction studies are pretty clear that those animals are consuming more

1297
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:48,680
calories, more calories than certainly if you matched a weight, then they add libitum mice

1298
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:54,920
and they're living longer. And what do we think is the route or mechanism through which methionine

1299
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:59,000
exerts this effect? I don't know that that's still really being worked out. There are lots

1300
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:04,760
of mechanisms that have been proposed. I suspect mTOR plays a role. People have thought about,

1301
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:11,000
so of course, methylation, methyl donors are important for a bunch of different epigenetic

1302
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,480
modifications. So there may be a role there going back to the epigenome that we talked about.

1303
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:20,440
Methionine is the first amino acid in every protein. So there could be effects on protein

1304
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:26,440
synthesis. There's evidence linking methionine restriction to sulfur amino acid biology,

1305
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:31,640
which has been implicated in aging. So it's hard to know and maybe it's not one thing.

1306
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:36,040
And those all sound like potentially just a substrate reduction problem, right? Like less

1307
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:41,960
sulfur cross bridging, less protein synthesis. Right. Well, yeah. And again, if you look back

1308
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:48,760
in the literature in the invertebrates, inhibition of protein synthesis in some cases is enough to

1309
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:54,120
extend lifespan. And of course, mTOR is a primary regulator of protein synthesis. So when you inhibit

1310
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:59,480
mTOR, you can also inhibit protein synthesis. So that's part of the challenge here is this network

1311
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:04,360
is so interconnected that when you tweak one part of it, you have effects throughout the network. And

1312
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:09,720
it's really hard to know which of those effects are causal. So let's talk about time course, right?

1313
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:19,160
So when you consume a protein rich meal, do we have a sense of how long mTOR is being activated

1314
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:26,040
in response to that set of amino acids? I'm sure somebody does. I don't know the answer to that. I

1315
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:32,600
mean, I think again, almost certainly it's going to depend on what you eat in combination with

1316
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:37,320
the protein when you eat. Yeah, exactly. Like how active you are. I remember talking to David

1317
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:44,040
Sabatini about this through the lens of BCAA drinks. Yeah. So if you're going to pound

1318
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:49,960
branched amino acids during a workout because you want as much anabolic signal as possible.

1319
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:56,440
And this is a couple of years ago. So maybe things have changed. But based on that work,

1320
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:00,280
I think Bobby Sutton had done the work in his lab from getting his name right. Was it Bobby?

1321
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:05,400
Sutton was the guy who did that science paper that looked at the leucine sensor on mTOR.

1322
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:13,720
Right. The answer was it didn't stay on long at all. Yeah. Free amino acids were so short in

1323
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:20,040
their ability to turn on mTOR that unless you had an intravenous drip of this stuff, it was going

1324
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:28,120
to be very difficult. So much so that the idea of using BCAA analogs to treat sarcopenia was going to

1325
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:33,320
require drugs that could stay on much longer. Is that kind of within your frame of thinking?

1326
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:39,560
I think so. And I think it also makes sense in a biological context. I mean, cells and tissues,

1327
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:45,960
again, this gets back to the whole homeostasis concept. Cells and tissues have evolved to

1328
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:50,200
maintain metabolites and amino acids are metabolites. They're involved in many different

1329
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:55,480
metabolic reactions within certain levels. And there are all sorts of mechanisms to ensure that

1330
02:05:56,280 --> 02:06:02,280
at a metabolite, it's outside of that range that we soak it up. We do something else with it. So

1331
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:09,960
I think it makes sense that you're probably not going to have a persistent increase in

1332
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,000
branched-chain amino acids far outside the normal range. What I would say though, is that slightly

1333
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:22,120
elevated branched-chain amino acids chronically can have big effects on the downstream processes.

1334
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:26,920
And there are some inborn diseases of childhood where you have elevated levels of branched-chain

1335
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:34,120
amino acids. We know that there are consequences to even having somewhat modest increases in

1336
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:39,480
hyperactivation of mTOR signaling chronically. So again, I think the context really matters.

1337
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:48,200
But yes, it's my intuition that it's probably hard to get very large, persistent increases in mTOR

1338
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:55,800
simply from taking a branched-chain amino acid supplement. Doesn't mean you couldn't have some

1339
02:06:55,880 --> 02:07:02,120
effect on muscle building right after a workout. But I suspect it's hard to have long-term

1340
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,360
persistent effects on the initial. I mean, the anabolic data suggests it's not necessary.

1341
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:14,760
It's just, again, muscle protein synthesis window is open long enough that simply delivering a great

1342
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:21,400
source of whey protein in the hours after a workout seems sufficient to not restrict

1343
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:26,200
muscle potential growth. I think the other thing though that is also important to appreciate,

1344
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:30,840
and this is true with rapamycin as well. I think a lot of people get confused about this,

1345
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:37,160
is it's not only about how high mTOR gets turned on or how low it gets turned down.

1346
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:46,440
It's also about where that happens. And this is, again, people for a long time thought that

1347
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:52,440
rapamycin would cause muscle loss. We don't see that. We just don't see it in mice and we don't

1348
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,760
see it in people. And I think it's probably because- I'm guessing you're not seeing in dogs.

1349
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:02,920
We have not seen anything to suggest that in dogs. So I'm guessing that has as much to do with how

1350
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:08,920
much, maybe more to do with where mTOR is being affected than how much we're inhibiting mTOR,

1351
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,240
when we're inhibiting mTOR. And so I think the same thing's probably-

1352
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:16,040
And do we know where the selectivity of rapamycin is? I mean, is it more selective in hepatocytes?

1353
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:19,480
Is it more selective in adipose tissue? I mean-

1354
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:24,760
I don't know of any good studies that have really carefully looked at this. There have been a few

1355
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:32,120
studies in mice that tried to look at tissue mTOR signaling in the context of rapamycin.

1356
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:33,800
Again, this is-

1357
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,560
It's a very technically challenging problem.

1358
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:39,400
Well, and this is what I was just going to say, it gets even more complicated because even in a

1359
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:45,640
mouse where you can essentially control almost everything, right? What the mice are eating and

1360
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:53,160
when they last eight has, if anything, as big, maybe bigger effect on mTOR signaling than

1361
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:58,280
rapamycin, right? So there have been, like I said, a couple studies that looked at this and

1362
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:02,680
I'm not sure, and they got different answers and I'm not sure who to believe because I don't think-

1363
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:06,520
The only way I could imagine doing this is you have to be able to do subtractive studies where

1364
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:09,720
you have to be able to do it in the context of a whole bunch of different diets first,

1365
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:14,120
get kind of a baseline that you then pull out of potentially what you're seeing.

1366
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,720
Yeah, it just gets complicated.

1367
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:21,800
It's complicated. And again, that's why I often will gravitate back towards what are the

1368
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:27,160
functional consequences we can actually measure, right? Sure, I get it. You think that treating a

1369
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:31,480
mouse with rapamycin is going to cause sarcopenia? Let's do the experiment and find out. The answer

1370
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:35,720
is no, it doesn't, right? So that tells us it's at least not as simple as we thought it was going to

1371
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:38,440
be. We certainly don't understand all of it.

1372
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:45,000
Now, what about the flip side of that is more protein versus less protein activating

1373
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,960
mTOR in a way that is counterproductive?

1374
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:54,840
I think it can. I think there are certainly cases where it can. Again, I don't know that

1375
02:09:54,840 --> 02:10:00,760
anybody has really carefully done that study in mice. There was a study, it's a really interesting

1376
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:06,200
study by Steve Simpson and colleagues where they did this nutritional geometry work where they

1377
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,560
basically looked at different compositions of carbohydrates, fats.

1378
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,080
Steve Simpson, he's in Australia.

1379
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:16,120
Yeah, exactly. And looked at, I don't remember how many diets, there's a whole range of diets,

1380
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:20,600
different compositions of the three macronutrients. Tried to control for caloric intake, which is

1381
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:26,040
hard as you can imagine, but I think they did a pretty good job. And then asked, what does it

1382
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:31,240
look like in terms of metabolism, energy expenditure, lifespan? So the lifespan studies, I think, are

1383
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:39,320
pretty clear that most of the diets where the mice lived the longest were towards the low end

1384
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:46,040
in protein. But there were some things that I think called into question exactly what was going

1385
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:53,400
on there because it wasn't the case that the diets that were energetically lowest gave the

1386
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:57,560
longest lifespan, as you might expect from caloric restriction. And the diet that actually

1387
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:02,120
gave the absolute longest lifespan had like, I don't know, it was like a 40% protein in it.

1388
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:07,400
So the way I interpret that is that there are many ways to get to-

1389
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,560
And how calorie restricted was that?

1390
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:12,200
They were not calorically restricted at all.

1391
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:17,800
So you're saying that a diet that was ad lib with 40% protein had the best outcome?

1392
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:20,040
The best absolute lifespan, yes.

1393
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:23,160
Again, how do we even reconcile this body of literature?

1394
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:26,840
Yeah, and this is sort of where I was just going is I think that my view is there are

1395
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:35,240
probably multiple paths to longevity. And we really don't understand the inner relationships

1396
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:42,200
of these macronutrients in the diet with enough sophistication to get beyond sort of broad

1397
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:49,160
general predictions. And again, I sort of- This is an area where I really- I believe,

1398
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:55,640
like I can't prove it, but my intuition from the data that I've seen and just my observations

1399
02:11:55,640 --> 02:12:01,320
of people is that in humans, it's probably very- this relationship between protein and

1400
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:07,560
health during aging is probably very different than it is in mice. I think mice are able to tolerate

1401
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:12,840
a very low protein diet without some of the consequences that we see in people. That's my

1402
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:16,280
intuition. I don't know that that's true. That's my intuition.

1403
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:23,480
I mean, it's my intuition as well because clinically what we see in what I call the

1404
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:27,960
death bars. The death bars is our internal nomenclature for how people die. We just

1405
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:32,120
constantly look at death bars and we double click and double click and double click all the way

1406
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:39,880
to try to tease out everything that is reducing lifespan and health span. And the problems that

1407
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:46,680
occur in humans when they are under muscled are insane. And it ranges from the metabolic

1408
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:54,760
consequences of being under muscled. Our muscles are a sink for glucose. They are the single most

1409
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:59,400
important sink we have for glucose and our ability to tolerate glucose and maintain glucose

1410
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:05,320
homeostasis in the presence of larger, more metabolically healthy muscles is the difference

1411
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:10,920
between having diabetes and not having diabetes. Furthermore, when you think about sarcopenia and

1412
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:16,440
when you think about osteoporosis, which again, I just don't think we're talking about how these

1413
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:21,880
things impact animals. Like we don't study any animal, including primates in a setting where

1414
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:28,760
sarcopenia and osteoporosis are problematic. And yet I would ask anyone to consider the entire

1415
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:35,480
population that they know over the age of 75. And I would ask you take every person that is

1416
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:42,520
alive today that's over 75 and tell me how many of them are not suffering at least some consequence

1417
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:48,680
of one or both of those phenomenon. And if somebody did that analysis, I would be shocked

1418
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:55,400
if we didn't find at least 80% of people over the age of 75 are experiencing this. And if you look

1419
02:13:55,400 --> 02:14:01,320
at the activity, just monitor the activity level of people over the once they hit 75,

1420
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:07,640
they fall off a cliff. So muscle mass dramatically plummets activity levels dramatically plummet.

1421
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:12,360
Difficult to say which one's feeding which. But there's no question that something is happening

1422
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:18,600
to our species at about the age of 75. That is a structural problem. And none of this other stuff

1423
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:25,960
matters if that sucks, right? Like I don't care if I live to 100 and don't have cancer if I'm

1424
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:32,520
an invalid for the last 25 years and I can't play with my grandkids and throw a ball. Like for me

1425
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:35,880
personally, I'm not saying that's a, that's not a view that everyone should take in the world.

1426
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:41,160
I'm just saying that's my view. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I think that's absolutely correct. I guess

1427
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:44,760
the question, and I think this is still where some of the confusion comes from is

1428
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:52,840
how important is dietary protein in that maintenance of muscle or loss of muscle in people who are

1429
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:58,440
going to go the wrong direction? And I think the data is that it is quite important. I mean,

1430
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:06,360
there are lots of studies that have compared the RDA versus kind of the double RDA standard. And

1431
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:13,960
it's a significant difference. Protein makes a very big difference, following obviously

1432
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:18,680
the training that is necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. So I think those have

1433
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:23,400
to be coupled to some extent. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I believe there are data, and I hate when

1434
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:27,560
I have to say this, because I just, I'm going to say something and it's going to be wrong and 20

1435
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:31,480
people are going to respond. It's okay. I do it all the time. In anticipation of the fact that

1436
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:36,920
there are data that I've read and I don't have the memory I once had, I believe there are data

1437
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:42,760
that show just the protein difference alone can make some difference, but it's not nearly the

1438
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:47,000
difference you get when you pair it with hypertrophy training. Yeah. That's my recollection as well,

1439
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:54,040
right? Which brings us to the interesting question then, why is it that there is a camp? And in my

1440
02:15:54,040 --> 02:16:01,160
field, it's a pretty vocal camp in the aging field, right? That would argue that low protein is the

1441
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:11,000
best nutritional strategy for aging and health span in people. And this gets back to the point

1442
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:18,200
I started with, which is that you can find the answer you want for almost any question in this

1443
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:23,000
area that intersects with nutrition and aging. There will be a study, right? That will fit your

1444
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,160
belief. So I think you really have to be careful, or I try at least to take a global view and try to

1445
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:36,200
understand what is the totality of the data say, right? But there are epidemiological studies and

1446
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:42,360
one in the field that most people will point to when they go to humans and they talk about

1447
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:49,400
low protein. And it was this study that Walter Longo was, I think the senior author on and Morgan

1448
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:57,240
Levine was the first author on where they looked at protein consumption and all-cause mortality

1449
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:03,160
as a function of age in people. There were some studies in, I think they had some yeast studies

1450
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:08,360
in there as well, maybe some cell culture studies, but they looked at the take-home message was that

1451
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:16,200
low protein is beneficial up to about 65 years of age. And then once you get above 65 years of age,

1452
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:21,400
it kind of flips and people who ate a higher protein diet have lower all-cause mortality.

1453
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:26,600
It should be clear when I say beneficial, we're talking specifically about all-cause mortality.

1454
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:30,200
Which at the end of the day is a very important metric.

1455
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:30,920
Sure, you want to be alive.

1456
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:35,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not the most important metric necessarily. You could argue it's equally

1457
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:39,640
important to the health span metrics, but it might, I mean, that's, that's a, okay. So let's make sure

1458
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:45,640
people understand what that means. That means below the age of 65, the epidemiologic data in

1459
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:51,560
this study suggested people eating less protein had lower mortality in all-cause mortality. And

1460
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:53,480
above 65, you saw that reverse.

1461
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,600
That's right. Yeah.

1462
02:17:55,160 --> 02:18:00,920
Now, did that paper make any attempt to quantify the net impact on mortality? Because the very

1463
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:07,640
misleading thing about an assessment like that is when you look at mortality adjusted by population,

1464
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:16,520
before the age of 65, it's relatively low. Above the age of 65, it goes up very non-linearly.

1465
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:26,360
So when we do our death bar analysis, it's like, you know, this is the death per 100,000 people.

1466
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:33,480
If you're 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, like, you know what I mean? It just, it becomes insane.

1467
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:39,960
So you could argue through that analysis that you're much better off with a high protein strategy,

1468
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:45,720
even if it's throughout life, because the absolute reduction in mortality would unquestionably be

1469
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:49,640
lower as a result of the benefit you would have later in life.

1470
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:56,120
So I would, I absolutely agree with conceptually with what you said, right? The impact of a change

1471
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:01,640
in mortality late in life is going to usually swamp the impact, certainly swamp the impact,

1472
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:07,080
the same impact on mortality early in life. I think the question here is what are the relative

1473
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:14,840
effects, right? And so they did try, they did model this a little bit. And it is in their model,

1474
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:20,360
which I couldn't get the data for, like, I don't know, I can't evaluate exactly what they did.

1475
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:30,920
But in their model, the relative risk crossed somewhere, you know, in the 60s, right? In other

1476
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:40,920
words, you know, your, your total mortality benefit was lower eating a high protein diet,

1477
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:44,600
I think it was starting somewhere in the 60s. And that actually surprised me, because, because for

1478
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:51,400
exactly the reason you said the relative impact of the high protein diet early in life would have to

1479
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:56,760
be an order of magnitude greater than the relative impact of the. So I'm sorry, say what they're

1480
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:00,840
finding was again, at the age of my, I don't remember the exact number. It's in the paper,

1481
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:04,120
right? You can see the curves, you can see the curves crossed. It was much later than I thought

1482
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:09,320
it would be, given that 65 was the point that they kind of pick. I see. I would have thought maybe in

1483
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:14,280
your 50s. So I actually tried to do my own modeling of this off of the data that I that I could find

1484
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:19,320
on, you know, relative risk for low and high protein. Again, where you what you define low,

1485
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:23,320
what you define high, you know, there, and you're trying to ask the question, when should you switch

1486
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:30,040
the diet? Or maybe more formally, at what age do they does the risk equal out? Yeah, right. What's

1487
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:35,720
the crossover? Yeah. Yeah. And what did you find? So mine was closer to like 50. Yep. That that's,

1488
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:42,520
that's the point where once you get past 50, they're the benefit of a high protein diet

1489
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:48,760
on mortality seems to outweigh any detriment that you would get from. So that's odd to me,

1490
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:54,680
because whether it's 50 or 60, Matt, it's a benefit on mortality, which is really, I think,

1491
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:01,480
we're more of the argument is there's can't be any benefit on health span. From low protein? No,

1492
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:06,520
from high protein. Early in life or late? Why? Why can't there be a benefit? Oh, late in life,

1493
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:11,640
I'm saying. Why not? Well, I'm saying like, if your protein restricted late in life, I mean,

1494
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:18,600
I think low protein has no benefit on. Yeah, well, I mean, again, unless so I would agree with you,

1495
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:24,440
intuitively, but I also exclude special cases. So I'm not talking about people who have renal

1496
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:29,000
insufficiency for whom they have to, you know, yeah, I agree with you conceptually. The only

1497
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,240
thing that makes me hesitate a little bit is I've just seen like I was talking about the mouse

1498
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:37,960
rapamycin experiments where everybody who knew anything about muscle said that if you gave a

1499
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:43,000
mouse rapamycin throughout life, it was going to get sarcopenia. That just didn't happen. So,

1500
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:49,160
but I'm saying we have clinical data that suggests that when people over the age of 65

1501
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:56,040
are protein deficient versus protein significant, there's a huge difference in muscle mass,

1502
02:21:56,040 --> 02:22:02,040
which we know is going to be associated with frailty and poor outcomes. I would totally agree

1503
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:06,360
with that. I mean, I think that it's very likely to be true. I think what we don't, again,

1504
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:11,240
I don't know, do we have controlled studies where people were eating low protein and doing

1505
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:14,840
resistance training late in life? I mean, they're nuance here that could complicate.

1506
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:18,920
But I think in general, you're probably. I think the other area where this gets very

1507
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:27,960
complicated is the, I don't want to say by necessity, but just by convention, we use IGF-1

1508
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:34,600
as a biomarker for protein intake. Yeah. And it's certainly associated with protein intake, but

1509
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:39,080
you want to tell people what IGF-1 is, you know, a little bit of background of, you know,

1510
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:43,800
where it comes from and what it's a proxy for. Sure. So IGF-1 is insulin like growth factor one.

1511
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:50,120
It's a hormone that's in the growth hormone pathway. So, you can think of it as a growth

1512
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:58,120
promoting hormone. Sort of part of this central pathway that promotes growth in many, many

1513
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:02,280
different tissues. So, if you have high growth hormone levels, you'll have high IGF-1 levels

1514
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:08,440
and that, and high mTOR, right? So, this is a part of the mTOR pathway as well, upstream of mTOR.

1515
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:15,560
So, the reason why people have been really interested in IGF-1 in the field of aging

1516
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:21,560
biology, it comes, you know, from studies again in the very simple laboratory model systems. So,

1517
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:29,640
the most famous and one of the first genes that was shown to clearly from a mechanistic perspective

1518
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:34,840
affect aging is it comes from Cynthia Canyon and even Tom Johnson a little bit before her,

1519
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:40,360
which is the insulin like receptor in C. elegans called DAF2. And Cynthia published a classic

1520
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:44,760
paper showing that if you make a mutation in DAF2, you could double the lifespan of worms and they

1521
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:50,280
seem to be healthier about twice as long. And what that mutation does is it turns down

1522
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:55,400
signaling through this pathway. Now, it's a little bit more complicated in worms because it's called

1523
02:23:55,400 --> 02:24:02,440
the insulin IGF-1 like signaling pathway. So, it's not identical. And so, there's one pathway in

1524
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:06,680
worms that kind of takes the place of both IGF-1 signaling and insulin signaling. But you can kind

1525
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:11,960
of think of them as equivalent. And then there are a whole bunch of studies in mice for mostly

1526
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:19,640
mutations in the growth hormone upstream signaling, upstream of IGF-1 that lead to increased lifespan.

1527
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:25,720
So, this means GH does not activate the production of more IGF-1. That's right. So, you have

1528
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:32,840
through a variety of mechanisms. You have high GH, low IGF-1 animals. Well, low GH signaling, right?

1529
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:36,760
Yeah, but they probably are high in IGF. Oftentimes, it's the receptor that's mutated.

1530
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:43,560
That's right. Yeah. So, those animals tend to be very long-lived. They rival caloric restriction

1531
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:48,280
in terms of the magnitude of lifespan extension. And there are several different mutations in that

1532
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:55,080
pathway. The mutations in IGF-1, I guess I should know the current state of that literature a little

1533
02:24:55,160 --> 02:25:00,600
bit better. It's complicated. And there have been some controversies in the field about the different

1534
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:07,960
mutations that directly affect IGF-1 itself and the effects on lifespan. So, I'm not going to

1535
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:12,520
wade into that because I think it still hasn't been resolved. But there's no question that

1536
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:19,960
mutations that reduce growth hormone signaling in mice extend lifespan. Now, it's important to

1537
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:27,080
understand though that with one exception, those studies are all cases where the animals are growth

1538
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:34,200
hormone signaling deficient through development. So, they are very, very small animals. And then

1539
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:38,600
they have constitutively low levels of signaling through that pathway for the rest of their life.

1540
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:46,040
There's one study that I think it used a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-1 receptor in mice. This is

1541
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:53,240
from Nir Barzilai and Haseko. Where they treated mice with this antibody late in life and they got

1542
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:58,920
a reasonably sized lifespan extension. I think it was, I don't know, 14, 15% median lifespan.

1543
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:06,200
That was an antibody that did not penetrate the CNS, if I recall. I remember Nir talking about

1544
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:14,040
this and saying you would get all the benefits of IGF in the brain without the potential harm of IGF

1545
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:19,000
in the periphery. Right. Yeah. And that's another complication, right? Where the effects of IGF in

1546
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,400
the brain might be fundamental on for health span and cognitive function might be fundamentally

1547
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:29,720
different than IGF-1 in the periphery. So, that study I think is the best evidence in mice that

1548
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:35,720
you can get some benefit specifically from reducing IGF-1 signaling in middle age.

1549
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:39,560
And this is such an important question I get asked all the time. I have a lot of patients that are

1550
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:46,600
asking to be put on growth hormone. Yeah. And we just don't do it. And the reason is I just

1551
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:53,640
am not comfortable with, I don't see enough data in humans to suggest that it's necessarily safe.

1552
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:59,640
Conversely, I don't really see evidence to suggest it's not. Yeah. This is sort of the weird thing

1553
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:04,360
with growth hormone. Like if you buy hook, line and sinker, the argument that more growth hormone

1554
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:10,440
equals more IGF equals more mortality, and you look at how much growth hormone is being used.

1555
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:16,840
I mean, it is hands down the most abused drug in sports. It's like it's first, second, third,

1556
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:21,880
nobody's even within the zip code. Yeah. And this is going back 35, maybe 40 years,

1557
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:28,600
probably to the early 80s. Where are the bodies? Yeah. Like there need to be more bodies. So,

1558
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:34,680
I'm stuck with, like I don't see where the bodies are, but at the same time, it's still a bit of a

1559
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:39,880
leap for me. And I don't have the luxury of rapamycin data where I can at least point to

1560
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:46,600
all of the humans who have taken rapamycin for 23 years. And we know what that looks like. And then

1561
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:51,320
even though it's not for zero protection, and then all of the mechanistic stuff that is consistently

1562
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:55,080
pointing the right way. So, you know, there's going to be some patient of mine listening to this

1563
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:59,480
saying, Peter, you almost talked me into taking growth hormone based on your discussion. And it's

1564
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:05,240
like, no, I can't. You know, it's funny. I even took it for a week after my shoulder surgery.

1565
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:12,280
I had sort of looked at some literature using GH and anabolic steroids to help with recovery.

1566
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:17,800
And it could have been true true and unrelated, but like I felt the worst I've ever felt after

1567
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:23,160
a week of growth hormone and androlone. And I was like, yeah, I'm done. I just abandoned it. Now,

1568
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:28,760
again, I think it was I was I happened to be sick as well. But my blood pressure went up,

1569
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:33,080
my blood sugar went up. I felt like crap. I couldn't sleep. Again, a lot of confounding

1570
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:39,240
factors, shoulder surgery and a nasty virus. So again, it could all be irrelevant. But I think I

1571
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:43,160
think the point you made is actually a really important one. So first of all, you know,

1572
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:47,320
obviously, I've never given growth hormone to anyone. I've never taken growth hormone. My,

1573
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:51,240
you know, I'm not an expert in the human application of growth hormone. But I've certainly

1574
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:56,120
tried to follow that literature, you know, because based on the mouse studies, you would have

1575
02:28:56,120 --> 02:29:01,160
predicted, right, that growth hormone therapy should be the most toxic therapy you could give

1576
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:05,240
a human. Yeah, certainly should should cause increased risk for a bunch of different diseases,

1577
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:11,720
including cancer, mostly cancer. Yeah. Yeah. And my understanding of the literature here is that,

1578
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:15,720
like you said, it's not clear that there are significant benefits, particularly for strength,

1579
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:19,960
I think, I think there's some evidence that muscle mass may increase, but but strength doesn't.

1580
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,360
But it's also not clear that there's any real detriment, right, that there's any significant

1581
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:29,640
risk, which is a little bit surprising. It is surprising. And I do have a couple of patients

1582
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:36,040
who have taken it. Usually other doctors were prescribing it or, you know, they came in under

1583
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:41,960
the care of somebody else. And they all seem to claim they feel infinitely better on it.

1584
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:47,880
There may be something to that, right? It might be that in 20 years, we have enough data to say,

1585
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:53,720
you know what, by the time you're 60, you should just be on a slow amount of growth hormone for

1586
02:29:53,720 --> 02:30:00,120
all of these reasons. I'd love to see somebody do this study. Because again, it's, it's a very

1587
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:05,720
important question to be asked. And I also think we have enough data to suggest that such a study

1588
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:11,960
is not unethical, right? In other words, we don't have an abundance of data. In fact, we have a

1589
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:17,240
paucity of data suggesting its harm, that it would justify ethically doing a study like this.

1590
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:23,160
So anyway, that's, that's sort of a hope I would have because I, I really find this to be one of

1591
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:28,280
the most confusing questions in this space. Yeah, I agree. And again, I think, you know,

1592
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:33,400
this is sort of why I've, I personally have settled around the idea for now, at least that,

1593
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:41,720
that that IGF one particularly is, is probably not that informative in people, particularly,

1594
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:45,320
you know, once you get past 50 years, 50 years is arbitrary, but that's kind of where I would,

1595
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:51,320
I would put the number. Obviously, again, IGF one itself is complicated because you don't really

1596
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:56,280
know what that means in terms of IGF one signaling and downstream activity. But yeah,

1597
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:01,160
important, I guess, for people to understand that just like testosterone is mostly bound

1598
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:05,480
to sex and binding globulin, there's only a small amount of testosterone that's free.

1599
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:10,680
It's the same with IGF one, it has these IGF BPs or binding proteins that bind most of it.

1600
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:17,720
And therefore, total IGF is not really completely informative as to what's happening,

1601
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:22,520
even in terms of the quantity that's there for signaling, because it's not the unbound portion

1602
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:29,720
of it. So some people look at things like IGF to IGF BP ratio, the bigger that number is, in theory,

1603
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:34,360
the more IGF signaling you would have. But, you know, this gets to now when you look at sort of

1604
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:41,000
the epidemiologic curves, which on the x-axis would show in, you know, deciles or quartiles or

1605
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:48,440
whatever buckets IGF levels rising, and then on the y-axis would show you mortality. I've never

1606
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:53,240
seen one of those curves that just goes up. Yeah. Right. They're sometimes they're U-shaped,

1607
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:58,600
sometimes they're downsloped, sometimes they're flat, and it depends on the indication. Yeah.

1608
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:04,280
But the story seems much more complicated than IGF is bad. I agree. And again, I think, you know,

1609
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:08,840
going back to the Levine paper that we were talking about, again, I think it's an important

1610
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:16,360
paper, it's a well done paper. You really have to recognize that the population you're looking in

1611
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:21,160
might make a big difference as well, right? So we, you know, if you're talking about a population

1612
02:32:21,160 --> 02:32:27,000
of people where 30% of them are obese, some high percentage have metabolic disease or diabetes,

1613
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:33,160
you know, having high IGF-1 in that context might be very different than somebody who is,

1614
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:40,280
you know, appropriate rate, exercising, eating a high protein diet, right? And again, that those

1615
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:44,520
kinds of things don't typically come out in these epidemiological studies. The other thing I'll say

1616
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:48,920
is, you know, in kind of thinking about what we might talk about today, you know, I went and tried

1617
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:53,560
to look through the literature and see what other studies have shown, you know, that that same

1618
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:58,040
relationship and they're all over the place. You can find studies that really don't show

1619
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:04,200
any for protein, protein consumption, particularly, you can find studies epidemiological that really

1620
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:11,320
don't show any downside to eating a high protein diet in people. So it's hard to, it's hard for me

1621
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:19,080
to draw too much confidence that high protein is significantly detrimental when you're younger than

1622
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:27,560
50. And I feel pretty confident that a higher, at least certainly higher than the RDA level of

1623
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:35,640
dietary protein intake when you're above 50 is beneficial, particularly if you're exercising. I

1624
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:40,280
mean, that's where I would be a little bit concerned. If you've got somebody who's overweight,

1625
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:46,600
obese, diabetic, sedentary, so high calorie plus high protein could be problematic.

1626
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:52,840
Totally agree. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a, and by the way, I frankly think a lot of the epidemiology

1627
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:58,360
is tainted by that. Yeah. It's high protein in the context of high calorie. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1628
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:02,360
The other thing that I think is also potentially interesting to think about in human are these

1629
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:08,360
people who have mutations in the growth hormone pathway, right? So this is now maybe more akin

1630
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:12,760
to these mouse models where they have low growth hormone signaling, you know, from development,

1631
02:34:12,760 --> 02:34:17,240
even in utero potentially, they go through their entire lives. There have been a couple of studies,

1632
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:22,200
again, Walter Longo, obviously prolific in this area, had a study on these, the little people of

1633
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:27,080
Ecuador, right? There have been several studies, but the most- The La Ron Dwarfs. Yeah, that's

1634
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:31,720
right. The La Ron syndrome. Yeah. The most famous study is one that was published in Science where

1635
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:39,880
they looked at lifespan and age related health outcomes in the people with low growth hormone

1636
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:44,520
signaling versus controls in their same- Environment.

1637
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:49,240
Environment. Yeah. It's a really fascinating study. Yeah, it is. So I mean, I think that,

1638
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:52,280
again, the interesting things are there's no difference in lifespan,

1639
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:59,480
but the people with low levels of growth hormone signaling, the reduction in cancer risk is

1640
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:05,960
profound. I mean, I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think it was zero. Like I think

1641
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:10,920
they did not have any- Maybe there was one person in their cohort who developed a cancer. I don't

1642
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:14,600
remember what it was and she was treated and then she lived the rest of her life, but none of them

1643
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:24,520
died from cancer. And the rate of diabetes was lower in the little people, but Ecuador,

1644
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:27,880
at least that part of Ecuador at that time, had a very low diabetes rate to begin with,

1645
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:33,320
something 5%. So it's a little bit harder to say, but certainly cancer, dramatic reduction in risk

1646
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:37,000
of cancer. So why didn't they live longer? Yeah, why didn't they live longer? And it's a little bit

1647
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,760
ambiguous. They don't really say, but they say that there is a much higher rate of alcoholism,

1648
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:51,080
liver failure, and accidents. And so this gets back to sort of what I've alluded to in passing

1649
02:35:51,080 --> 02:35:56,360
a couple of times, which is the social and psychological consequences in humans that are

1650
02:35:56,360 --> 02:36:02,360
just different than we have in mice. The growth hormone deficient mice aren't going to be subject,

1651
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:09,080
well, it might be probably not subject to the same social pressures that somebody has very low growth

1652
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:15,000
hormone signaling in people is subjected to, which may contribute to other things later on,

1653
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,320
like alcoholism. So anyways, fascinating though, biology, which is consistent with the idea,

1654
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:27,560
I think, that you can impact at least a subset of age-related biology by being

1655
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:34,120
constitutively low in growth hormone through your entire life. What would happen if you did that in

1656
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:39,880
bursts, like post-developmentally just after puberty, say from your 20s and 30s, who knows?

1657
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:46,280
There are no naturally occurring examples of that, or very few that we could look at and actually

1658
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:55,400
evaluate. By the way, do we have examples, is there enough data to look at people with

1659
02:36:56,200 --> 02:37:00,760
acromegaly during different periods of their life to see if that's had the exact,

1660
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:08,760
do we see a higher incidence of cancer? I don't know the answer to that. Those populations would

1661
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:16,920
be relatively small, but yeah, maybe it's possible. Yeah, it seems like, I imagine somebody's looked

1662
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:21,960
at that, the incidence of cancer in people with adult onset acromegaly or something to that effect.

1663
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:29,080
The other thing I would say on the IGF thing before we leave that is the interplay with insulin.

1664
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:39,640
And so, high insulin, high IGF, low insulin, low IGF, low insulin, high IGF, these are very

1665
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:44,360
different physiologic states. Absolutely. It's very difficult to think that we're teasing those

1666
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:49,800
out when we look at broad swaths. Yeah, and again, I think this just comes back to the fact that

1667
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:56,920
these, especially these epidemiological studies are a mixture of normal people typically, right?

1668
02:37:56,920 --> 02:38:03,320
And so, the lifestyles that most people are living, right, are what gets weighted in those

1669
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:09,880
types of analyses. And that may be very different, as we talked about, if you are normal weight,

1670
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:15,480
high protein, maybe high calorie because you're extremely active, right? Then if you're overweight,

1671
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:20,280
sedentary, and eating a high calorie diet, I really think that's underappreciated and

1672
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:27,160
and probably really important. And thinking about the cancer risk, again,

1673
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:32,040
this is going to be some pure speculation on my part though, right? But there's no question,

1674
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:38,040
I don't think, that high growth hormone signaling and high IGF-1 signaling, everything else being

1675
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:45,320
equal in a person leads to a higher risk of developing cancer. You don't? I think that's true.

1676
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:49,400
Oh, you do think that's true? Okay. I believe that that's true. Everything else being equal,

1677
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:52,840
of course, everything isn't going to be equal. But if we just look at that, though, that one

1678
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:58,760
variable signaling through that pathway, higher signaling, higher risk of cancer. So then,

1679
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:03,080
if it's the case, which I think you could, you know, we could make an argument that

1680
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:08,040
that doesn't seem to be the case, at least in certain populations of people that high

1681
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:12,200
growth hormone signaling or treating with growth hormone dramatically increases the cancer

1682
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:16,040
incidence. So why is that? Or in people who are... And by the way, we should also differentiate

1683
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:23,320
between high causes it versus low removes it. In other words, just because we have a genetic

1684
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:32,680
example of where not having it creates a deficiency of cancer, it doesn't mean... So going from sort

1685
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:40,600
of 100 to 30 decreases cancer doesn't mean going from 100 to 130 increases cancer. 100 to 130

1686
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:44,440
increases cancer. That's right. No, that's absolutely true. I mean, we don't know. We could.

1687
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:48,920
Yeah. And actually, I mean, I think the word you use there is interesting because you said removes

1688
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:53,160
it. And I know this isn't what you meant, but this is, I think, something that is also

1689
02:39:53,160 --> 02:40:00,840
important to appreciate. So to go from, you know, pre-initiation of cancer, right, to cancer, to

1690
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:05,880
metastasis, to, you know, somebody dying from it, there's steps that have to happen there, right?

1691
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:09,720
And there are different defense mechanisms that have acted at each of those steps.

1692
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:15,960
My guess is growth hormone and IGF-1 is primarily acting at the very early steps, right? Where we

1693
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:22,280
know that if you promote cell division, that that is a sort of a permissive early environment for

1694
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:30,040
mutations to happen and cancers to get a foothold. But in most cases, it seems to be the case that

1695
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:37,320
those early cancers are detected and wiped out by our immune system, right? And one of the reasons

1696
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:43,480
why I think a lot of cancers become more prevalent as we get older is because the immune,

1697
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:48,520
the function of the immune system to detect and clear those cancers declines. There's obviously

1698
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:53,000
other stuff going on, accumulation of senescent cells, which contributes to this process. But

1699
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:59,320
if you are, say, I shouldn't even say this because I bother people about the biological clocks. Let's

1700
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:05,800
just say, though, theoretically, you know, you're a 60 year old person, but biologically, because you

1701
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:12,600
are exercising, eating an appropriate diet, biologically, you're 40 years old, at least your

1702
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:17,640
immune system is functioning like a 40 year old, you might have a little bit higher IGF-1, you might

1703
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:22,680
have a little bit higher of that early cancer risk, but you have a much lower total risk of developing

1704
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:26,840
cancer because your immune system has a much better chance of catching it and getting rid of it.

1705
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:31,880
And those are things we don't even think about. Yeah, that's so complicated.

1706
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:38,840
Well, Matt, I don't know that we settled anything today. It's pretty safe to say. We've probably,

1707
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:43,880
for the listener, created more questions than answers. No, I'm sure we've done some good.

1708
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:48,920
Yeah, I mean, I think, again, it's a complicated question. And, you know, we actually did not dive

1709
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:52,280
into the genetic interaction with caloric restriction. So, I mean, I think the take-home

1710
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:57,000
there is that even in mice where we can control everything else, if you look across genotypes,

1711
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:02,440
you get different results from the same diet and the effect of caloric restriction on lifespan. So,

1712
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:10,120
you know, maybe we can't answer the big detailed questions. I guess the take-homes I would have are,

1713
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:15,880
again, we've learned a ton from these nutritional studies in laboratory animals about the biological

1714
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:22,200
mechanisms. We've learned a lot about which proteins and pathways are important. And that

1715
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:30,120
has led us to things like rapamycin, right, which might be a more effective intervention in humans.

1716
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:36,360
So, they have value for that. And I think, you know, the other take-home that we've talked about is

1717
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:42,200
you don't have to worry about every little detail, right? I think, again, most people

1718
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:49,000
can get a big chunk of the way there by eating a relatively healthy diet. Don't worry so much about

1719
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:56,200
how much protein, how much carbs, how much fat. Eat good foods, right? Don't overeat and be active,

1720
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:03,000
right? Exercise. And I do worry a little bit that we, you know, society does this, but scientists do

1721
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,160
it sometimes too when we start, you know, really getting into the weeds and making recommendations

1722
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:12,760
to people that we overthink things a little bit, right? And give people anxiety about worrying

1723
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:17,000
about am I eating a low enough protein diet or am I on, you know, am I still in ketosis?

1724
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:22,440
What should my fasting window be? Should it be 16 hours versus 18 hours? Yeah.

1725
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:28,760
So, the questions are out there to what extent do any of these things have big benefits? I think you

1726
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:34,200
can get most of the benefits without worrying about a lot of that. Yeah, I agree. Well, Matt,

1727
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:36,600
glad we finally got to do one of these in person. Yeah, it's been a pleasure.

1728
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:39,000
Maybe the next one should be in person as well. Absolutely.

1729
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,480
Bye.
