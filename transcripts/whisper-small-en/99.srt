00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,640
today's episode. Welcome back to another COVID-19 special episode of the Drive podcast. I'm once

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,440
again joined by Dr. Peter Hotez, a renowned vaccine scientist, pediatrician, and an expert

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,240
on the current coronavirus outbreak. We released an episode with Peter on March 14th, which received

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,840
a lot of feedback. People were very grateful for that and wanted to have him back on with other

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,480
questions. It is difficult to immediately address questions that are posed in the aftermath of a

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,400
podcast that's five days old because five days in this outbreak is an eternity. So a lot of the

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,000
stuff we talked about today is not actually stuff I thought I would talk about with Peter at the

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,280
time that we finished our last episode. And again, that means it might not be germane a week from now,

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,760
but nevertheless, this was recorded March 19th in the late afternoon evening. And as such, it's

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,080
probably only as relevant as that timing. Given the temporal nature of things at this moment in

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,520
time, I think podcasts become pretty obsolete pretty quickly. So hopefully you're all able to

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,960
listen to this today, March 20th, or shortly thereafter. Moving forward, I will continue to

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,320
release shorter and more irregular podcasts, probably trying to get out two or three a week.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,600
Also, I'll continue to post videos on Instagram and eventually they'll make their way onto YouTube,

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,880
usually the next day. Again, everything at this point in time is open to subscribers,

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,880
non-subscribers equally. And we're also in the process of putting together a specific page on

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,760
our site. That's at PeterAttiaMD.com that will house all of the information we're posting on

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:35,640
this SARS-CoV-2 virus that's the responsible agent for the disease known as COVID-19. So again,

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,440
podcast now with Peter, please enjoy it. Keep in mind, hopefully within a couple of days,

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,560
we'll aggregate all of this stuff, all podcasts, all videos, plus all of the internal memos that

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,720
we are sending to our patients. We're just going to start putting all of that stuff out there for

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,680
everyone and that'll be on our site. So hopefully you enjoyed my discussion here today with Dr. Peter

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:05,800
Hoches. Hey Peter, thank you so much for making time again to speak. I know it was less than a

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,640
week ago that we sat down to do this, but a week in terms of this coronavirus seems like a year

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
with respect to the knowledge and insight that we're gaining with respect to everything else in

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
healthcare. I really appreciate the opportunity to be on. This was our first podcast together and

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,320
maybe it was the topic, but the response has been extraordinary. I've been getting emails and

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,880
texts from people, so many individuals and all of them really enthusiastic and supportive and

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,200
saying that we did such a good job explaining some complicated science and asking questions that

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,400
people actually wanted to know the answer to, but maybe never articulated before and

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,680
tied so many things together and connected a lot of dots. And then in a few cases, we've even gotten

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,440
people reaching out asking if they can help to support our vaccine development efforts.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,480
And we've had some a lot of really good follow-up. So thank you again for that opportunity.

42
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,760
I was really also impressed with, I expected to hear only from either physicians or healthcare

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,760
professionals, but I've heard apparently this podcast is reaching people in all walks of life

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,160
and people who just really are kind of sick of things so dumbed down in the mainstream media. So

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,440
I think we hit it at a really good level. Well, thank you. That means a lot coming from you. And

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
I agree. I've sort of always rejected the notion that people need dumbed down sound bites. I think

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,160
that's probably just an assumption that when really vetted is probably not true for the majority of

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,520
people. I think if people in medicine and science can explain things clearly and patiently, then I

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,200
don't think you need to have a great background in this to understand complicated topics. And this

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,120
is a case in point. I think that's also why I've been asked to come back and see now in Fox and

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,960
MSNBC is because I'm willing to take a little bit of time and explain complicated concepts.

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,320
And provided I can get more than 30 seconds or a minute or two, it seems to resonate well with

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,440
people. That's what people want to hear. They don't want to hear dumbed down crap. They want

54
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,600
to hear real things and want to understand the nuance and know that certain things are complicated

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,880
and that we don't have all the answers. Yeah. So Peter, I want to talk about a few things that

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,760
have sort of changed in the last week. Obviously from a confirmed cases standpoint at the time of

57
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,120
this recording, which is Thursday afternoon, March 19th, where a little over 13,000 cases confirmed

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,440
in the United States. But I think it's safe to assume that that's a small fraction of the true

59
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,800
number of infected patients. Do you have a sense of what range you would apply to the true number

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,280
of infected people? A couple of things. First of all, you're seeing every day, it's a big jump.

61
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,200
Every day is the largest number of new COVID cases that we've ever seen. When I last looked,

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,200
it was just this morning, it was just under 10,000. Now you're telling me it's 13. And before then,

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I think it was 8,500 than 7,000. So undoubtedly, a lot of that is we're finally getting some testing

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,800
underway. And it's starting to catch up with the actual population who's infected. And where this

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,360
goes, I think is going to be very interesting. I don't think we have a real sense of the percentage

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,320
of the population infected. I think what's happening is not necessarily that this is even

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,760
new transmission. A lot of this are probably areas that have been undergoing transmission for a few

68
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,440
weeks, but we're just picking it up now. So I think that's an important component. And there

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,600
are models that say for every person you identify, there's 50 more, 20 more. But I don't know how

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,960
strong the assumptions are for those models. So I think we have a lot. But I think what's more

71
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:05,600
telling is just hearing from physicians at major hospitals from all over the country, from

72
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,760
Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, and elsewhere saying they are just taking care of a lot of

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:20,080
patients and they're already feeling overwhelmed, even this early in the epidemic. And that says to

74
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,400
me that this thing is now revving up despite what the actual numbers of tested cases say. And it

75
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,920
also tells me that one of my worst fears and nightmares that I talked about on the last

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,160
podcast and I've been rattling the cage about is coming true, that this thing is rapidly

77
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,440
approaching overwhelming health systems and doctors and nurses, other health professionals

78
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:55,520
are starting to get exposed and getting sick. And with that is a lot of worry, also a lot of heroism

79
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,760
on the part of health professionals. But I'm very worried right now that we're not doing all we can,

80
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,440
even close, to protect one of our most cherished resources in this country, which are our healthcare

81
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,560
professionals. And I think we're really seeing this rev up now. And a few weeks ago, I testified

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,680
in Congress and I was alarmed at the fact that we weren't paying attention to our nursing facilities

83
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,480
and assisted care living facilities. And the fact that we've had 25 deaths in that nursing home in

84
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,200
Washington state in Kirkland, that's when I used deliberately provocative language in Congress and

85
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,560
said, this is the angel of death. And I knew it was going to get on, make a lot of headlines and

86
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,760
it did, but it got people's attention. This week felt I had to do it again. I went on CNN Newsday

87
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,520
with Zallison Kamarata and I had to do it again because I'm so frustrated that we're exposing

88
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,640
some of our nation's greatest treasures, our healthcare professionals to this virus without

89
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,840
making them feel safe or protected in any way. And I said, look, if a significant number of

90
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,640
healthcare professionals start either self-quarantining or actually getting sick, or if you have the

91
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,080
situation where colleagues are going to start taking care of colleagues who are very sick or

92
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,120
in intensive care units, the term I use it will be lights out. By lights out, I mean, this whole

93
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,520
thing is over. Things will unravel in this nation very fast. And I knew I was again being very

94
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,960
provocative, but sometimes you have to do it to get people's attention. And now I think it's

95
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,840
starting to register. The question is, can we mount an efficient response to figure this out?

96
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Peter, you alluded to this idea of do we have a sense of how many people are infected as a

97
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,800
function of how many people are confirmed. So the actual to confirmed case multiplier.

98
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
We've been building one of these models ourselves. We've looked at other people that have built them.

99
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,200
I've seen people estimate that, look, it can't be less than 45 to 50. Our internal estimate,

100
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,640
which I think is very conservative, is probably closer to 25. And what it's basically doing is

101
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,880
trying to figure out what is the assumed number of days from an infection until a fatality,

102
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,920
and then what is the assumed infectious fatality rate. And obviously, it becomes very sensitive

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,680
to both of those. But if we posit for a moment that it's on the most conservative side of those

104
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,280
estimates in the neighborhood of 10 to 20, do you consider that a positive or negative sign? In

105
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,960
other words, if right now there are, quote unquote, only 125,000 people infected in the United States,

106
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:46,000
are we in good shape? We may or may not be, because remember, those 125,000 are not

107
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,160
evenly spread across the country. Let's say it's 200,000, just for argument's sake. What that really

108
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:00,720
means is there may be 30 or 40,000 cases in the New York area, and things are getting scary very

109
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,840
quickly. And there may be another similar number in Washington or California, or the couple of

110
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,600
places where there's known transmission. And basically, just a handful of cases, maybe in

111
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Texas or places like that. So the question then is, if you're modeling how you're going to do this,

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
what you really want to look at is a map of the US, and you're going to see a bunch of,

113
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
let's say, use red as your color to mark the number of cases, you're going to see a

114
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,040
red blob, smallish red blob over New York and Seattle, maybe one or two other places. And it's

115
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,640
those blobs that are going to start to grow. And then you're going to see other small red dots

116
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
appear in the country, and they're going to start to grow. And then it's going to be the question of

117
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
whether those blobs begin to coalesce across the country. So that's how it's going to work. It's not

118
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,720
the absolute number of cases in the US. It's interesting, because the United States is so

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,040
large, you want to look at those nodes of where there's significant levels of infection, and see

120
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,320
how they grow, and intensify in color. And what I'm hearing from Governor Cuomo, he's really sounded

121
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,680
the alarm in a very effective way. And that's what we're going to be in for, for the next few

122
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,480
weeks or months, is a New York-like situation starting to pop up in other parts of the country.

123
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Let's go from that then onto some testing, because testing is

124
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,560
now going to figure into this, of course. I can't get a straight answer from anybody,

125
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,240
so I'm curious as to whether you have an insight as to why the CDC and FDA elected to go with Roche

126
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,720
for the testing kit when they were very late to this, as opposed to using one of the companies

127
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,960
in China that had already done literally millions of tests, and had pretty robust data on

128
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,600
sensitivity, specificity, etc. I don't know how they made any of their decisions around testing.

129
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,880
It's clear they should have gone to commercial kits from the very beginning. I'm getting asked

130
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,880
a lot of questions about what's gone wrong in the testing, what's gone wrong in the hospital response,

131
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,080
and I've sort of deflected the questions a bit, because right now we have to really focus on the

132
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,840
matter at hand. I think what's going to happen is when we get through all this, whether it's in a

133
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,160
year from now or 18 months from now or sooner, there's going to have to be some type of

134
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,080
independent committee to really look into the missteps. It's not for the purposes of being

135
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,640
punitive, it's for the purposes of trying to figure out how to fix this when a new pandemic

136
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,000
emerges next time, so we don't make so many of the same mistakes. I think we'll see a number of

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,080
flaws that went on with some of the agencies. I think we'll see some of the flaws that went on

138
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,760
on the communication between the federal and local governments and state governments, and

139
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,160
that may require us to enact some new legislation to fix it, but it's just been so exasperating to

140
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,000
see how this has been rolled out. We didn't have a lot of time of notice, but we did have time.

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,880
It's not like we didn't have any idea what was coming. We had at least a month,

142
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,720
arguably two months, to know what was going to hit the United States, and we also saw pretty

143
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,200
quickly that this was not going to stay confined to central China or even China. It moved pretty

144
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,440
quickly to Asian countries, and even when it was starting off in Italy, we were still pretty slow

145
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,400
on the uptake. The fact that we did not have a faster trigger is going to be really interesting,

146
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,520
and it's impossible to know right now where the fault lies. I have some suspicions, which I could

147
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,560
share in private with you, but I don't think it's going to help us right now to start pointing

148
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,800
fingers, but now it's a matter of figuring out how we rapidly fix this, because now, unfortunately,

149
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,000
now that we're starting now to fix the first phase, the testing, that we still have a ways to

150
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,680
go, we're already moved into the second phase where health systems are already being stressed,

151
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,760
and I'm worried it's going to be close to collapse in a couple of weeks, unless we can figure this

152
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,840
out. New York is already reeling. We are seeing the anxiety on people's faces in the New York

153
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,400
hospital system, and I'm very concerned. Now, Peter, what do you think is going to be the rate

154
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,480
limiting step in healthcare delivery in an area like New York or other areas that are going to be

155
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,840
sort of epicenters for this? Do you think it will be the healthcare providers? Do you think it will

156
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,840
be ventilators? Do you think it will be PPE for the healthcare providers? Where do you actually

157
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,960
think the breakdown occurs? Well, I see the first breakdown starting to happen with doctors and

158
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,720
nurses already exhausted, already demoralized to some extent, and people feeling that no one is

159
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,040
really looking after them, and they're kind of on their own. So we've already had that initial

160
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,680
breakdown of trust. Can you say more about that, Peter? I want to make sure I understand what is

161
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,120
that resulting from. Is that due to a belief that the system isn't providing them with the necessary

162
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
equipment to protect themselves or the necessary resources to take care of patients? Where is that

163
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
disdain or lack of trust coming from? Well, I think it's coming from seeing colleagues get sick

164
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,560
and inconsistency in what the plan is. A lot of hospitals have been prepared for this adequately,

165
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,080
not seeing also this disconnect from what they're seeing coming out of the state government or

166
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,240
federal governments when they're very worried about for themselves and their families.

167
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,400
They're seeing colleagues start to get sick. They're hearing stories of some colleagues being

168
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:11,280
seriously ill, and either it's the White House still two or three weeks behind, still having

169
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:19,040
the testing discussion, or state governors not really saying, we hear you, we know you're

170
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,080
concerned, hears what our plan is, is chilling, actually. I think, as I say, the only one now,

171
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,400
because it's New York, it's higher profile, and all the media outlets are in New York, the only

172
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,560
governor I'm hearing from on a regular basis is Cuomo, and he clearly gets it and has sounded the

173
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,200
alarm. But I'm concerned, and I'm also hearing about from parents of residents or residents

174
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,600
themselves. And then on top of that, now the latest story that's come out of both

175
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,600
MMWR, the Morbidity Mortality Weekly Reports from the CDC, as well as Italy,

176
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,560
is that this is no longer a disease of the old and infirm. It's significant numbers of young adults,

177
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,280
people who are residents, fellows, young attending age, actually now with severe illness,

178
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,520
and going into ICUs in this country. And that buzz is already catching on among young physicians,

179
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,960
and that's highly destabilizing. And I think that's probably our biggest link right now.

180
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Eventually, it will be the lack of respirators and lack of PPE, but I think right now,

181
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,360
it's the fact that you're seeing young physicians and nurses, people in the best years of their

182
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,800
life now getting sick, and the feeling that they're feeling abandoned. And I'm getting that

183
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,520
sense from either direct emails from nurses and physicians thanking me for speaking out

184
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,320
and echoing their concerns. And in many cases, it's parents of resident physicians and nurses

185
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,280
as well, and that we're starting to see that being a regular occurrence right now.

186
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
So what is the solution to that, Peter? Because we can't, obviously, on a moment's notice,

187
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,960
ramp up the number of doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, hospital staff,

188
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
I mean, everybody in the hospital, right? It's the people that we don't even necessarily immediately

189
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
think about, the people who clean the ventilators, the people who clean the hospitals. I mean,

190
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,120
all of these people are not going to be trained overnight. So how do we solve this problem when

191
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,320
going back to your earlier point, if you look at average numbers across the United States,

192
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,080
it's very easy to be misled. This is really going to be probably about local waves of this. So is

193
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:44,240
the solution that we are mobilizing physicians from geographies that are underutilized into

194
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
higher utilization areas? How do we actually go about solving this problem?

195
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, the problem is the areas that are likely COVID-19 are also probably underserved already

196
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,120
by physicians. I know we're all sort of thinking out loud, and I thought about that too, but

197
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,080
realistically, what do you do? Take a physician who's serving the entire county, an entire county

198
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,960
in western Nebraska, and take them to New York to help out. That's probably not realistic either.

199
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,160
Maybe not as outrageous an example. But again, I don't know what it's like in the Houston area

200
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,120
right now or in Dallas or other major metropolitan areas that are not New York. I mean, could one

201
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,200
repurpose medical staff from those areas to deal with the first wave in the places that are very

202
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,040
likely to be overwhelmed quickly? Yeah, on the other hand, it could be. But then if you actually

203
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,400
talk to physicians in areas where there's not COVID-19, it's not like they're

204
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,600
not already stressed out and already overburdened with their daily activities and the electronic

205
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,560
health records and everything else. So the whole system to begin with has been pretty fragile with

206
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:59,120
very high rates of what some people call physician burnout, which is a term I don't like at all,

207
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,720
but it's not really burnout. It's making these horrible, unreasonable demands on physicians and

208
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,120
healthcare providers to benefit the insurance companies. So you've already got stressed out

209
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:20,160
young physicians who are heavily under siege and now you're going to bring them into a COVID-19 area.

210
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm not sure. So the bottom line is I don't have any obvious solution to figuring this out.

211
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,080
One possibility that I've thought about and haven't introduced it to anybody yet is,

212
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,920
could we dramatically expand the US Public Health Service, especially with all these individuals

213
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:49,360
who are at home now and in some cases not receiving a paycheck, would there be any advantage

214
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,480
offered to have this use, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service or even the military,

215
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,240
to bring in a whole cadre? I'm not highly trained individuals, but individuals that you could train

216
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,960
like medics to help out just to provide an increase in the number of people who can help

217
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,280
manage ventilators and that sort of thing. So that's one potential possibility. And then the

218
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,640
question is, if we're not quite there yet, it's going to be very hard to persuade Congress to

219
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,160
take that kind of action. So Peter, what is the latest thinking you have on things that people

220
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,160
who are presumably not infected, so either asymptomatic or confirmed to be not infected,

221
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,240
which is a very small number in the latter category because of the dearth of testing,

222
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,680
that things can do to sort of reduce the probability of getting infected. So the obvious

223
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,280
one that we've discussed, of course, is social distancing. But let's say someone has already

224
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,080
sort of adopted that posture and now they're sort of asking the second order question, which is,

225
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,480
look, I'm basically working from home, my kids are no longer in school, what am I supposed to do with

226
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,000
my Amazon package when it arrives? What's the probability that virus is being transmitted

227
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,240
across that? How much insight do we have into the real transmissibility of this?

228
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't think we have a lot of data. You saw this week, this paper in the New England Journal of

229
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,280
Medicine that measured length of time on the virus on inert surfaces. And I actually did an

230
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,480
interview with ProPublica asking me about the US mail. Is that contaminated with virus and what

231
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,880
should we do? And maybe we know that the virus can live for a certain number of hours on cardboard.

232
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,240
That's been looked at. But then the question is, how relevant is that really? And what's the real

233
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:46,960
risk? I think for me, the priority is protecting people who are coming into contact with sick

234
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,280
individuals. And I come back to the healthcare providers and the first responders. And you saw

235
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,360
how the CDC has now managed it. So they came out with new guidelines this week, which kind of

236
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,520
loosened the criteria for exposure and what exposure means and basically saying you could

237
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,000
stay in the workforce and keep doing what you're doing, depending on the intensity of the exposure.

238
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I think it's sort of a desperation move, but it may be something that we need to do in order

239
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,280
to keep people in the workforce. I come back to what we introduced last time we spoke, which is

240
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,600
the antibody therapy, but not using it as a treatment, but using as prophylaxis. I think

241
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,120
that could potentially help a lot. So the idea is when you harvest antibodies from individuals

242
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,680
who've gotten sick and recovered, have antibodies, you aphorese their blood, you recover the plasma

243
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,120
component, maybe isolate the antibodies. If you give a big dose of that, you could potentially

244
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,560
treat someone who's sick, but a small dose of it, like a five ml dose, you could use that as a form

245
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,680
of prophylaxis and the antibody would last a couple of weeks so that a single injection can

246
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,000
potentially greatly reduce the likelihood you're going to become infected as a healthcare provider

247
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,280
or a first responder for a period of two weeks. And then you subsequently get another dose.

248
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,080
As we discussed, it's an ancient method, but now refined using better technology. So the White

249
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,680
House actually came out today in their press conference and actually talked about this. I

250
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,480
brought it on national TV on CNN and Fox a week ago. And now it's out there saying that the federal

251
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,120
government's going to do it. What's interesting is in the meantime, over the last couple of weeks,

252
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,360
a number of academic health centers have started to put together a network of blood banks to

253
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,360
actually start this. And what I've heard is that none of them have actually been contacted by the

254
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,080
federal government yet. So I think we got to resolve that, why there's that disconnect,

255
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,480
that this informal network that's already started is not better linked with the White House

256
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,280
announcement today in the comments of the new FDA commissioner, Steve Hahn.

257
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,880
What did you make of the recent study looking at blood type ABO and susceptibility?

258
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,160
Yeah, I thought it was interesting. I'm not sure what it means and I'm not sure how it's

259
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,520
necessarily relevant to developing the plasma therapy. So I think it's an interesting finding,

260
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,280
but I'm not sure how it applies just yet.

261
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,480
Yeah, I mean, I think just for folks listening, so they understand that it was looking at data

262
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,800
from China and basically observing that people with A type blood had an increased risk of

263
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,640
infection. People with O type had a reduced risk. I think the hazard ratio on the downside was more

264
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,440
impressive than on the upside. In other words, it was more about having O blood and therefore

265
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,560
anti-A antibodies that seem to be somewhat protective. So again, does that really matter,

266
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,600
as you said? Maybe, maybe not. It certainly isn't immunity. That's the point in the way

267
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
that potentially convalescent serum could be.

268
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,560
Since we spoke, there's been a few interesting observations now and people are scrambling to

269
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:19,680
understand it better. I think one of course is in parallel, the studies out of Italy and the younger

270
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,920
age group getting infected and seriously ill. And the question is, why didn't we see that in China?

271
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:33,360
I think that is interesting. This very high number of seriously ill hospitalized people

272
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,240
between the ages of 20 and 40, I think it's now in the US accounting for a third of the hospitalized.

273
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,560
Is it that high? I saw a report today that was about 25%. And I was going to ask you the question

274
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,120
you're posing, which is what on earth can account for this difference in the United States? It's the

275
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,440
most disturbing thing I think I've seen today.

276
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,240
Yeah, so I think the number that I saw was around about a third. First of all, half of those

277
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,080
hospitalized are under the age of 54, which is very different from what you saw in China. And those

278
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,440
and about a third between 20 and 44 is the number 29, 30% is the number that I saw. And there was

279
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,960
even a blip of people under 19. So that's a big question. And I think the numbers are going to

280
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,800
turn out to be somewhat similar in Italy. Now, it's been pointed out that those individuals are

281
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,280
not dying. But I said this morning that well, even if they're not dying, if they're can imagine if

282
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,920
they're being in ICUs and intubated, that is still a horrible ordeal for a young person to go through.

283
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,640
And if we have that happening over and over again, that's a huge tax on the system. I don't know. I

284
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,200
mean, the question of whether smoking is responsible or even vaping has been raised, we'll have to do

285
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:03,760
the epidemiology of that. And what the mechanism is we know smoking can up regulate the ACE2 receptor

286
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,520
for the virus. I don't know that anybody's looked at vaping, but trying to understand what it is

287
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
about young people that's different in Europe in the US, or maybe it's just

288
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,000
host genetics and genetic factor, but

289
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,480
well, there's something different. And I'll read to you something. It's a photo that was taken and

290
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,960
sent to one of my colleagues from someone he knows in London today. So the piece of paper is just the

291
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,360
ages of the people they admitted to the ICU today. This is a hospital in London. I'll read them off

292
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:49,760
to you. 46, 22, 68, 61, 51, 71, 32, 29, 28, 37, 34, 32. He then also showed me a picture of the 34-year-old's

293
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,800
chest X-ray. And it is effectively a complete whiteout. So again, will these patients survive?

294
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,640
Hopefully most of them will. But as you said, they're not out of the woods because the long-term,

295
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,000
the tail of this on morbidity is significant. I found a study yesterday that looked at 10-year

296
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,840
follow-up on the SARS-CoV-1 patients, the survivors, and the amount of cardiac disease and

297
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,400
pulmonary disease in those patients was not trivial, suggesting there was some lingering

298
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,040
effect to that virus. Yeah. And the other interesting finding, when you look at the papers

299
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,120
on MedArchive from the Chinese experience, there's a lot of what they're calling acute heart injury.

300
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,160
And it's not really clear what's going on there, whether that's a viral myocarditis or whether

301
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,600
it potentially, whether they're just having myocardial infarcts because of the ARDS and shock,

302
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,080
but you're seeing a lot of heart injury. And I suspect that's probably accounting for a high

303
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,000
percentage of the deaths as well. So the first thing people want to say is, is this virus

304
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,600
mutating? And I'm always suspicious when people are quick to claim its mutation. I'm guessing

305
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,240
not, but we'll have to unravel that. But we need really good epidemiology now on those younger

306
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,240
patients to try to understand what the differences are. You know, Peter, I've been asked this question

307
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,880
a bunch, and my usual answer is probably in the short term, but not sure in the long term. And

308
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,560
the question is, once a person is infected and recovers, do they have lasting immunity? And

309
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,560
obviously the convalescent serum experiments would suggest, at least in the short term,

310
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,680
there's immunity. Do we think we have an insight into that? In other words, just to speculate,

311
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,040
is this something in your mind based on other coronaviruses that looks like a seasonal virus,

312
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:44,480
like influenza, or more of the type of virus where once you have immunity, it's largely life lasting?

313
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,840
I think there's a paper on MedRxiv or BioRxiv out this week on non-human primates showing that once

314
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,960
you're infected, they're immune to reinfection. Whether that's applicable to humans is hard to

315
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:05,680
know, but I'm going to work on the premise that exposure infection will probably confer immunity.

316
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,240
But the flu, of course, is a different story because of all the antigenic drift and variation.

317
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,720
But then the other questions that have come up this week are around these projections

318
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,720
from the federal government in their report that they just released,

319
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,400
saying that they think this pandemic will last 18 months. And I'm trying to understand

320
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,840
what those assumptions are. I think they might be out of models from an Imperial College,

321
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,560
which look at the fact that this virus may go down in the summer, but come back in the fall,

322
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,480
and then potentially be seasonal after that until eventually enough people are infected and therefore

323
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,160
rendered immune from the virus. And I'm guessing that's how the 18-month estimate is coming from.

324
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,960
The other thing I'm hearing, and I hope it's not the case, is that I've been told that the 18-month

325
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,200
is because they're anticipating after that we're going to have the vaccine ready to go. And I've

326
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,000
really been downplaying expectations of having a vaccine in 18 months or at least a rapidly

327
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,720
deployable vaccine in 18 months. I think we have to be more realistic about that in terms of going

328
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,400
through all of the adequate safety. We just now only have the first vaccine and clinical trials

329
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,000
with a technology that's never been shown to turn into a licensed vaccine. So I think we're going to

330
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
be looking at five or six. We won't even be fully underway for a while. So even though I think we're

331
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,200
hearing numbers like a year, 18 months, from my estimate, I think it's probably more likely much

332
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,480
longer than that. So I hope that the models of ending this pandemic are not depending on having

333
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,920
the availability of a vaccine. I think we have to proceed as though we're not going to have one in

334
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,360
the near future. Now having said that, I'm more optimistic about having a lot of new technologies

335
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,440
come out like the convalescent antibody, but we're hearing some interesting things about

336
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,040
new drugs, especially some of the repurposed drugs, because the new chemical entities will also take

337
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,120
a while but not nearly as long as a vaccine. Speaking of repurposed drugs, yesterday the New

338
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,480
England Journal of Medicine published a paper looking at cholera. It was at the top level viewed

339
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,760
as a negative study, but I think many people ourselves included have looked at that and said,

340
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,000
I think the only thing we learned from that is giving cholera to people who are on death's door

341
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,040
is probably not helpful. How did you interpret that paper?

342
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,560
Yeah, it could be. People often think that antiviral drugs are like antibacterial drugs,

343
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,200
and they seldom have that same dramatic effect. Clearly, the HIV story is amazing,

344
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,640
and the Lamividine story for hepatitis C is amazing, but more typically, you don't see that

345
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,040
dramatic impact of antiviral drugs. You very well might be right. I wouldn't throw it out just yet.

346
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,640
There's been a lot of discussion about hydroxychloroquine, and there's some interesting

347
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,160
in vitro data on showing hydroxychloroquine inhibits replication of the virus. Also,

348
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,120
it has some anti-inflammatory effects. Then Didier Raoul from Marseille, who I've known him for years.

349
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:30,720
He's amazing. Infectious disease microbiologists mainly focused on rickettsial-like pathogens.

350
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,320
Published a small study showing maybe there's some effect of hydroxychloroquine. I think people

351
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,480
are over, maybe hyping it a little much, saying we have a cure. We clearly have to do much larger

352
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,320
studies, but if hydroxychloroquine could ever work out or have an impact, it would be perfect.

353
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,920
It's cheap. You can make a bucket of it. It's orally bioavailable. The nice thing is you could

354
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,680
use it not only for the US and Europe, but it'd be relatively straightforward to use in

355
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,920
low-income countries, especially if this virus is now in Africa. We don't even know about it,

356
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,560
or parts of Asia. If I had a wish list, and it would be ixne on wishing for my vaccine,

357
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,280
it would be around something like a chloroquine. We've also been reading about some of the

358
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:30,240
ACE2 inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers. We're getting a mixed picture about

359
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,240
that, depending on what paper you're reading. Especially around the ARBs, the ARBs, as they

360
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,480
sometimes call them, claiming that some of the common antihypertensives that we use, where

361
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,120
they're saying, well, on the one hand, it has the ability to interfere with the ligand detachment

362
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,640
of the virus to the ACE2, and therefore, that blocking effect should have an antiviral property.

363
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,720
Others saying, no, no, no, it's actually going to upregulate the receptor and make things worse.

364
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,840
I got an interesting email, and I want to talk to a professor at Nova Southeastern University.

365
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,960
Robert Speth is in the School of Pharmacy, has been looking at this, and he actually thinks

366
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,200
that it could work for a totally different reason, that a lot of the ARBs don't bind

367
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,440
actually to ACE2, but other components of the angiotensin pathway, and they have anti-inflammatory

368
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,760
effects. I think we're in a steep learning curve about these class of drugs in terms of their

369
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,360
effect, but we certainly should be evaluating them, especially now that we're starting to get

370
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,960
mouse-adapted virus and maybe transgenic mice with the receptor. I think it's going to be a

371
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,360
high priority to look at some of these drugs. Have you looked at all at Camostat?

372
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,480
It's a pretty esoteric drug. It's a serine protease inhibitor. I think it's only used in

373
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,760
Japan to treat pancreatitis, but some of the preliminary work looks really interesting. It's

374
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,800
a transmembrane protein, and it appears to interfere with the ability of the virus to gain entry.

375
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,640
Actually, I think it sits right next to the ACE2 receptor and impairs binding.

376
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,720
Because there's a protease that's involved in SARS-CoV-2, and it's a subtle

377
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,520
lysine-like protease, which means it's a serine protease, and known as furin, F-U-R-I-N. So,

378
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm wondering if that molecule works by interfering with the furin. So, that'll be an

379
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,560
interesting story, and that's potentially a good drug target. So, there was a paper that

380
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,680
came out not too long ago about the furin from this, and it's relatively unique among the beta

381
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,240
coronaviruses that this virus has. And I can't remember if SARS-1 has it as well or not.

382
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,440
The homology between SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 is similar, but not enough. I mean, there's enough

383
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,400
commonality to them in the spike protein, isn't there? That if you had an effective target for

384
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,200
one, you might have luck against others, which I guess is really less germane to the question

385
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,800
today and more about the ongoing probability that these viruses aren't really going away, are they?

386
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah, and we're starting to think about what is the kind of vaccine that we want to develop. We

387
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,600
have this SARS-1 vaccine that looks great against SARS-1, and we think it could be repurposed against

388
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:32,160
SARS-2. And then the question is, what should be the goal? Should we be focusing only on SARS-2 or

389
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,840
should we really start thinking about a universal SARS vaccine? And I think before SARS-2 came along,

390
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,320
we saw how all these other beta coronaviruses were emerging out of bats, and we wrote a grant to the

391
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,240
NIH. And I don't know if that one even got scored, but I think that's going to be an important

392
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,240
approach. I mean, we have to learn our lesson. Now, this is our third coronavirus pandemic in the

393
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,080
21st century, so we have to reconcile the fact that these are going to come out on a regular basis.

394
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,600
Although technically, really, SARS and MERS probably weren't really constituted as pandemics,

395
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,920
were they? I mean, they were probably closer to epidemics, and this being a true pandemic

396
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,120
potentially, yes? I don't remember how they were classified. So SARS-1, of course, emerged out of

397
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:24,720
southern China and severely affected Canada. So maybe it wasn't classified as a pandemic, and

398
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,480
MERS coronavirus emerged out of the Arabian Peninsula and then affected Korea, where it

399
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,480
decimated hospitals in Korea. Which brings us to the other point, as this is the modus operandi

400
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,080
of coronaviruses. They tear through hospitals, causing a lot of death and destruction to hospital

401
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,480
personnel. This is what they do. This was true of SARS-1, it was true of MERS, and now it's looking

402
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:00,080
like it's true of this one as well. That nosocomial transmission is a huge factor in this group of

403
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,240
viruses. And if I were going to design a vaccine, which we're doing in terms of the target product

404
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
profile, I would say a highest priority are healthcare providers. So I think, again, to

405
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,240
revisit this, and we started the discussion on this, but to revisit it, unless we can deal with

406
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,040
the healthcare provider issue and making hospitals safe places, we're going to be in very deep

407
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,960
trouble. So I think that has to be a national priority, and maybe the White House needs to

408
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,000
create a specific task force around this, is what are we doing to protect our frontline

409
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,680
healthcare providers? Is it the antibody therapy? Should we be looking at angiotensin receptor

410
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,360
blockers? Should we be looking at other chloroquine for prophylactic purposes? If we can't fix this

411
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,240
problem really quickly, I said on CNN it's lights out, but you know what I mean. I think

412
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,000
there's just no way we'll be able to manage this epidemic. Speaking of designing, we touched on

413
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,480
this very briefly, I think the first time we spoke, or maybe it was just on a time when we spoke and

414
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,200
it was not part of the podcast, but I've had discussions with some of the most intelligent

415
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,960
people I know, and they've asked, not in a sort of conspiracy theory way, but they've asked,

416
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,800
isn't it possible that this was a virus that was designed for biowarfare that was either

417
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,360
inadvertently got out of the lab or something? I have my own logic for why I find that theory very,

418
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:36,160
very implausible. What's your response to the implausibility or plausibility of that thesis?

419
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,200
Well, when the epidemic was unfolding in China and I started hearing these conspiracy theories,

420
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,000
it was easy to debunk it. Who's going to design a bioweapon that's going to kill grandma and

421
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
grandpa? I mean, that's not an effective biowarfare strategy, but now that we're seeing,

422
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,600
now I don't have that pat answer, not that it's an appropriate answer anyway, but now that we're

423
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,520
seeing a number of young people affected, the plausibility goes up, but not by much. I just

424
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,080
like to say, you don't have to. Why go in that direction when we already know mother nature is

425
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,680
one of the best bioweapons producer there is? We know that these viruses, it's not like we didn't

426
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,880
know where these viruses were before. We've seen a whole family of these viruses that we actually

427
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:35,600
call them SL viruses, SARS-like viruses in bats. Even before SARS-2, we were investigating our

428
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,800
vaccine to see if it cross protected against the various SARS-like viruses that were emerging out

429
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:52,480
of bats. Sometimes it didn't others. We knew that there was this whole family of bat coronaviruses

430
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,400
that are emerging on a regular basis. If you don't have to postulate a bioweapon, why do it

431
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,720
when it's so obvious that we've got all of these viruses, the enzoatic viruses that are circulating?

432
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,920
My response was probably a little more theoretical, but it was the best bioengineers

433
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,880
of the past two decades can barely get a crop to grow any better using GMO or insert gene vectors

434
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,960
through genetic engineering into adenovirus. It's not like genetic engineering and GMO crops have

435
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,320
been a robust success. If that's the best and the brightest for 20 years, I don't know where they

436
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,320
found the people that could make such a good virus. For being diabolical, let's think for a minute.

437
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:47,760
If you were designing a bioweapon, most people would design SARS-1, a highly lethal virus.

438
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,600
We actually saw that even though it was a devastating disease in people who got it,

439
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,680
if you were infected, you were sick pretty quickly and you were going into the hospital and you

440
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,720
weren't walking around the community infecting others. That's why I think SARS-1 snuffed out

441
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,680
pretty quickly. This one is really problematic because it's not as lethal as SARS-1, but it's

442
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,760
number one. Number two, it's more transmissible. Number three, there is a large group of

443
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,040
asymptomatic individuals. That's what creates a toxic mix for this virus because it quickly

444
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,480
spreads throughout the community and infects. It kills a small number of people, but still

445
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:41,680
five to 20 times more than influenza. It is that very toxic combination of not being the most

446
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,800
lethal, not being the most transmissible, but high enough in both categories and all those asymptomatic

447
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:53,280
individuals. In some ways, it's hard to imagine one that's more diabolical, but I can't imagine

448
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,200
anybody being that clever to think about designing it in that way.

449
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,920
Peter, you mentioned something on Twitter today that just assume that when your mail is delivered

450
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,320
to your house, basically assume it's been delivered by someone who's carrying the infection,

451
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,520
whether they realize it or not. What does that mean practically? What can we tell people who are,

452
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,920
again, getting their Amazon packages, getting their mail, trying to limit their exposure? What

453
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,640
actually can be done to dramatically reduce the risk of transmission through these fomites based

454
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,560
on the study you just quoted from the New England Journal of Medicine that came out, I think, last

455
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,280
Friday or this week and other things we've learned just through the field of virology?

456
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,760
Well, we don't have a lot of data. My gut tells me that the risk is still pretty low. Things that I

457
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,520
worry about, I just don't worry about getting the mail. Right now, I'm not doing anything. I think

458
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,040
if you're concerned, you can certainly take a Clorox. First of all, who gets mail anymore? I

459
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,960
guess we get Amazon packages. If you get your Amazon package, wipe it down with a Clorox wipe

460
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,200
or one of the approved alcohol wipes, you can certainly do that. I don't see any harm

461
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,960
in doing that. My sense is what's your real risk? Your real risk is close personal contact with

462
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,000
somebody with this virus. I still think that's probably the most likely mode of transmission.

463
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,280
What about food? A lot of people these days are in the process of ordering food. Now, whether that

464
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,800
be if you live in a city like New York, you're doing takeout. What do we know about the

465
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,400
temperature that it's required to be confident you've killed the virus? Then what about when

466
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,360
you're talking about groceries, things that are very difficult to wash like lettuce or strawberries?

467
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:43,280
Is this just a time to say, don't eat these things or do we think that pay if you leave it out of the

468
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,040
fridge for a couple of days, it's probably fine. Although not that you'd want to eat your lettuce

469
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,840
if it's been sitting out of the fridge for a couple of days. Right now, I personally have not

470
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,040
really been doing much with produce that's different from what we usually do. I mean,

471
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,960
maybe wash it more with water. Has the CDC put out any guidance about that? I haven't even.

472
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,720
I have not seen it. Yeah, the only thing I've seen is from the WHO looking at SARS-CoV-1. They

473
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,400
published some data on temperature. Again, that basically suggested that 56 degrees Celsius

474
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,000
for 15 minutes was about required to kill that virus. You could extrapolate from that, hey,

475
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,640
if you get your takeout and you at least heat it up, or if you're cooking food that you can't speak

476
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,480
to how it's been handled or it hasn't been otherwise sitting in your freezer for a month,

477
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,000
you want to make sure this is north of 140, 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

478
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
For me, I just think it's the produce that strike me as a little bit more concerning,

479
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,160
just because the virus is going to survive a little bit longer in the cold based on the WHO

480
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,720
report I saw. Again, maybe this is marginal. Maybe this doesn't matter compared to what you

481
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,880
said a moment ago. Maybe just not being in close proximity to other people or people who are not

482
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,440
inside your bubble is first, second, third order reduction strategy. It also becomes a point. I

483
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,440
mean, we're already living under such austerity measures as it is with the social isolation,

484
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,680
gets to the point where we're going to have such a huge percentage of the population having their

485
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,040
mental health affected by this. I think there starts to be diminishing returns by doing this.

486
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:28,480
So unless we get some clear guidance from the CDC or FDA saying, this is what we found and we're

487
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,360
particularly concerned about that, at this point I'm not doing this, which gets to the whole mental

488
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:41,680
health aspect. Just the thought of people being in their houses day in and day out. It's been great

489
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,920
for my TV ratings, but quite honestly, I would not want to be watching Peter Hotez day in and day

490
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,760
out. It's such dreary news that I have to believe we're going to start seeing some significant

491
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,400
psychological impacts. I'm worried about suicide rates. I'm worried about, and I hope we're looking

492
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,880
out for that because especially this drags on. So I think it's really important for the government

493
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,280
to be a little more clear when they said it could be an 18 month pandemic to specify this doesn't

494
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,480
mean that you live like you're living right now for 18 months. I just don't think that's doable

495
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:26,480
for a large population. So there's going to have to be some kind of assessment there. And I'm almost

496
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,400
as worried about the mental health status of millions of Americans or people all over the world

497
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,920
as I am the actual virus. And I'm starting to hear from colleagues and family members that it's

498
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,560
already creating a lot of hardship. And also people of certain categories, for instance, I have a

499
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:53,200
special needs adult daughter and now her routine is totally halted now. And this is putting a huge

500
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:00,080
amount of stress on her and then our family as well. So I would imagine people with special needs

501
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,400
family members in the house are really struggling right now. And I don't think we're too consumed

502
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,000
with the actual infection to even think about this. And should we as a nation start thinking

503
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,760
about some kind of low cost mental health activity, and I don't know what that would be,

504
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,920
whether we create a network of providers, some mental health counselors who make themselves

505
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,480
available, mental health counselors without borders, something where people can maybe either

506
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,800
it's for free, or maybe just at some really low cost where they could Skype with somebody

507
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,600
and have that discussion. I think that potentially could be a national priority as well, or have the

508
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:48,160
academic health centers take this on. I can't agree with you more, Peter. I've been commenting

509
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,040
to my wife for the past few days that the days seem to be going by very quickly in isolation,

510
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,720
but that overall time seems to be going very slowly. And the irritability within me is

511
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,640
unbelievable. I mean, I'm not the most sanguine guy to begin with, but I think the lack of control,

512
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,680
which is probably what every person on some level feels right now, I guess different people

513
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,880
internalize that in different ways. But certainly in me, it just comes out as incredible irritability,

514
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,080
which may pose a greater long-term risk to my health than any coronavirus could.

515
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,200
Well, it's interesting. My reputation is being someone who never gets angry, never gets visibly

516
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:34,320
upset, or seldom does. And within the last month at a lab meeting where I wasn't happy with the way

517
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:41,120
things were going, I got pretty upset. And sort of an important meeting with colleagues, I also got

518
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,600
very upset and reacted in an emotional way that afterwards I kind of sort of scared myself. I said,

519
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:54,080
wow, I can't believe I did that and sent an apology. And I said, what's going on here? In my case,

520
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,200
I'm not sleeping. And not sleeping because of the anxiety. I'm not sleeping because we're trying

521
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,840
to get this vaccine started through into clinical trials and all the teleconferences and documents

522
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,880
that we have to put together. And then all the media stuff, because I'm doing a lot of early

523
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,920
morning and oftentimes late night. And then when that happens, you're only getting three or four

524
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,600
hours sleep and you're doing that several days in a row. But I think being given the opportunity by

525
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:29,120
Fox News and CNN and MSNBC to talk to the country and explain things about this virus in a way

526
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,680
that we're not necessarily hearing from our leaders, I think that's an important opportunity.

527
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,800
So I'm doing it. But that in itself is stressful, also threading the needle because

528
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,440
all three of the cable news networks are fairly politically charged. And you're being asked

529
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,960
provocative questions all the time about this and that and trying to thread that needle to

530
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,600
say things in a way that goes beyond the politics and really addresses the virus.

531
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:00,720
I think it is taking its toll. I'm sort of lucky because at least I have two really big activities

532
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,640
that I'm doing that keep me occupied with my wife Ann. She's at home and with Rachel,

533
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,720
our special needs adult daughter. And I think in all she's got on all day is the cable news,

534
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,920
which is so dreary. And I just imagine that happening millions of times over,

535
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,880
this is not going to be good for our country. And so one of the things I've started to announce,

536
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,600
that's a small thing, but I've been trying to in my messaging, talking about the science and a few

537
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,880
times I've been doing this, I think I'm going to be more of it is to be upbeat about certain things,

538
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,760
not to drift into the happy talk that's not backed by data, but just talk about the fact

539
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,240
that the United States has got this great history in times of adversity of taking on big audacious

540
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:56,400
goals and building out new technologies for this virus is one of them. And that's where America

541
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:03,200
shines is those big audacious goals and taking on complicated projects and coming out ahead at the

542
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,960
end. I think those kinds of things, I think we need to hear more about. And again, it's not some

543
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,280
people say, Oh, I mean, you're going to do, you're going to do the happy talk thing. I said, no,

544
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,880
that's very different. I think it's, it's a realistic goal. And to say that we don't have

545
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,920
to be passive about this, simply just hunkering down in our apartments or houses there, we still

546
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,040
can do great things. And there's probably better messages out there than just that. But I think

547
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,760
it's going to be important to hear more of that. But again, the psychological devastation

548
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,920
on the United States, I think is going to be almost as big as the damage from the infection.

549
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,760
Well, on that, Peter, I wanted to, it's almost like you read my mind. I did want to end with

550
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,240
something sort of positive. What are you most optimistic about? I mean, we've spent a lot of

551
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,520
time talking about things that concern us with respect to the burden on the healthcare system,

552
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,720
the properties of the virus that make it especially troublesome if you're trying to fight

553
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,680
it. But if you think about where we are today versus where we are a week ago, even, what are

554
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,600
you optimistic about? What's moving in the right direction? What trend do you see that you want to

555
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:18,080
see continue? There's a few things going from not very impressive sounding to more impressive things.

556
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:25,200
I think just from a not selfish side, but I think we're seeing scientists being put in higher

557
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:31,680
esteem. We were trending the wrong way for a long time because of this anti-vaccine movement. But

558
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,400
when you hear the esteem that people like Anthony Fauci have in the country, because he is a

559
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,840
scientist, I think that's kind of reassuring that in times of stress, people are looking to scientists

560
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:54,000
for guidance, not only to solve problems, but also for leadership roles. And I think that could be a

561
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,160
positive outcome of this. And people writing letters to our team of vaccine scientists trying

562
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,840
to develop the vaccine. We just had this thing. I was very moved. Our vaccine scientists are still

563
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,040
working through this because they have to, because they have to make this coronavirus vaccine. We just

564
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,760
had a massive donation of Girl Scout cookies for the scientists, really showing that the community

565
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:26,560
is out there behind us. So that for me was really positive. Also, science communication

566
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,480
was already starting to trend in the right direction, but I think it's really taken off.

567
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,240
The data sharing that's going on, putting things up on bio archive, on med archive,

568
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:43,600
these pre-print servers, has now become a routine form of science communication. It was already

569
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:51,360
starting to take off, but now it's done regularly. And the fact that even the established journals

570
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,520
like JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, are putting their stuff out there quickly in the

571
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,800
public domain. If we keep doing this, it's going to change the way we do science publishing.

572
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:12,160
I often say our model of how we publish science was invented in the 1850s by the German scientific

573
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,920
institutions. And it worked for a while, but believe it or not, communicating science,

574
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:26,640
according to the rules of 1850, Germany is probably no longer adequate. And I think we started to see

575
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,040
this with SARS-1 and MERS and then Ebola. And I think it's going to reach its full fruition

576
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,160
through this epidemic. So the fact that scientists are being held in higher esteem recognizes

577
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:45,520
important people, the way scientific communication is done. I think, and the same is true of our

578
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:52,160
physicians and nurses. I think the fact, the heroism we're seeing of physicians and nurses,

579
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,440
and you saw those stories from Italy of the whole nation standing out in the balcony and

580
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,360
cheering for physicians and the nurses and the healthcare professionals. I think there's maybe

581
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,040
going to be a new awakening of the humanity behind the medical profession that I think we're

582
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,920
starting to hear. And it works both ways, not only just people standing up and cheering,

583
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:20,880
but more and more doctors and nurses telling their story of sacrifice and knowing that when

584
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:28,320
they go into work, saying goodbye to their kids or their significant others, knowing that they may

585
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,200
have to be in a unique kind of quarantine after that, not knowing if they're going home or going

586
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,600
to get sick. I think people seeing the sacrifice that physicians and healthcare professionals and

587
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,760
nurses make, stuff that we do every day that gets unnoticed is now being noticed. So I think that's

588
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,480
also going to be a potentially very positive outcome of all this. I mean, the worry of course

589
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,240
is out of sight, out of mind. We might've said some of that after SARS-1 and MERS, I said the

590
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,520
whole vaccine infrastructure will change. We'll be able to change the whole vaccine ecosystem

591
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,000
on the basis of those epidemics. And really not all that much happened. A few things happen,

592
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,320
but not much. I always think maybe this will be the one that will happen. In terms of more immediate

593
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,680
successes that you might see, what can we look for for things that are going to work?

594
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,160
The one thing that I saw was last Sunday morning when Andrew Cuomo, Governor Cuomo wrote that,

595
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:32,560
what I thought was a very courageous op-ed piece in the New York Times saying what was on my mind

596
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,960
for a while, but I didn't want to say, and he just said it, we're going to need to bring in the Army

597
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,440
Corps of Engineers. And I think that was an important piece to this, recognizing that we may

598
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,800
need to bring in our military and maybe sooner rather than later. So we're already hearing about

599
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:55,440
National Guard units being called up. I think we're going to need our military to build temporary

600
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,280
hospitals and facilities. Maybe some of the human capital we're going to need for this is going to

601
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,320
become an important piece to this as well. Well, Peter, on that note, we've gone a little over the

602
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,560
time. I know we both set aside for this and we've got a lot to get done, even though we're sort of

603
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,520
late in the day. But I want to thank you again for the time and obviously for the hat you're wearing,

604
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,120
which is sort of being one of the important faces of this in the public. I do think it's important

605
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:27,120
that people have sort of credible information and you're speaking to a lot of people, not just to

606
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,320
the public, but also to policymakers. For what it's worth, I'm a little bit more optimistic

607
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,840
this week than I was last week in terms of the seriousness with which this is being taken,

608
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,040
especially inside government based on a number of personal discussions and some secondhand

609
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,640
discussions. So I guess that's the thing I'm personally most optimistic about. I mean, there

610
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,160
are some people on the federal side who've definitely been doing this and people like

611
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,520
Deborah Birx have been good and Tony, of course, is always great. And Brett Giroir is not a

612
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,200
household name, but he's Assistant Secretary of Health and was with us for a while here in Texas.

613
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,240
And he's been the one assigned to finally ramp up the testing and he's been doing that. I think

614
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:16,160
been doing a great job. To me, I think the profile that Governor Cuomo has had is the one that really

615
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,600
woke us up and who got on has been getting on there every day and saying, what the hell's going

616
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,200
on? Where are my respirators? Where are my beds? These are the projections. These are what we're

617
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:34,320
going to need. This is what's going to happen to our hospitals and being overrun. So I give a lot

618
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,200
of courage points to the governor in New York on that front. All right, Peter. Well, thank you very

619
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,080
much. I want to let you get back to work and I know we'll be in touch again soon and we'll pick

620
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:49,840
it up then. I think what impresses me about our discussion today is how different it was compared

621
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:56,960
to a week ago and shows you how quickly this thing is moving. And so always happy to do this again.

622
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,320
At some point, we'll see how this thing continues to change because I said it last week. I'll say

623
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:07,760
it again this week. The stuff we're saying today may look totally ridiculous in a few days or a week

624
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,920
because this thing is moving so fast. These virus pandemics emerging threats set you up to make you

625
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,800
look bad. And they do that with our federal leaders, our state leaders, and even doctors

626
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:25,440
and scientists who go on TV. So you continue to need to refresh. Yeah, I hope they make us look bad

627
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:32,160
by saying we over responded then we under responded. I'll say amen to that. All right. Good night,

628
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,480
Peter. Thanks again. All the best. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.
