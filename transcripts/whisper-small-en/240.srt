00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,760
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,160
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,800
today's episode. I guess this week is Dan Rader. Dan is a professor of molecular medicine at the

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,280
Perlman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where he conducts translational

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,200
research on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. The particular focus on the metabolism and most

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,400
importantly, function of high density lipoproteins, HDLs. Dan has received numerous awards and has

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
been elected to the American Society of Clinical Investigation, the Association of American

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,760
Physicians, and the National Academy of Medicine. He also currently serves on the board of directors

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
of the International Society of Atherosclerosis, the board of external experts at the National

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the advisory board for the clinical research of the NIH. In

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,000
this episode, we focus our entire conversation around high density lipoproteins or HDLs. Now,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,520
as any listener of this podcast will know, we have no shortage of content around lipids. We

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,360
focus a lot of that energy on the ApoB side of the family. That is, to some extent, VLDLs and,

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,760
of course, LPLitLA, which is a subset of LDL. However, this is the first time we're doing a

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:02,000
dedicated podcast on HDLs. Now, the reason for that, in other words, the reason for that disparity

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,200
is largely because HDL biology is so much more complex and we know so much less. I mean, at the

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,280
highest level, I think people generally think of HDL as, quote unquote, the good cholesterol, but

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,440
you've no doubt heard me rail on the stupidity of such a designation. But there is clearly something

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,160
good about HDLs as in the lipoproteins, not the cholesterol. And in this discussion, we really

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,000
talk about everything from the biology of the HDL, its genesis, its origin, its metabolism, its

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,080
life cycle, and, of course, its function. We also talk about why it has been so complicated to use

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,920
pharmacologic interventions on the HDL side of the equation to impact atherosclerosis. Conversely,

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,160
of course, it's been the easiest thing, I would say, in medicine and perhaps the greatest success

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,440
of modern medicine, especially as it comes to cardiovascular disease, has been our ability to

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,960
manipulate the ApoB side of the equation as opposed to the ApoA side of the equation. That's one thing

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,320
that's going to be important here when we get into the terminology. When we talk about ApoA in the

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,120
context of HDLs, we're talking about ApoA as in a big A, which has no bearing whatsoever to Apo

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,840
little A, the thing that, of course, defines an LP little A. But I digress, that is simply one of

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
the many details we get into. So, as I said, we're going to talk here about the genesis of the HDL,

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,880
the structure, its metabolism. We talk about the differences between HDLs, LDLs, the difference

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,480
between the HDL measurements. So what exactly is HDL cholesterol versus ApoA concentration versus HDL

38
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,960
particle number? We talk about the idea that having a high HDL means you don't need to worry

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,280
about cardiovascular disease and how that's obviously going to be bunk. I'm just going to

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,880
let the cat out of the bag on that one. We speak about CTEP inhibitors, which are a class of drug

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,400
that have been repeatedly used to try to increase HDL cholesterol with the hopes that that would

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,400
reduce cardiovascular disease. And finally, we end the conversation around some of the new thinking

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,760
around HDL and neurodegenerative disease, something again, I learned a lot about. So,

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:06,400
without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dan Grader. Well, Dan, thank you so much for

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,840
making time to join us on the podcast today. Tom Dayspring really recommended you highly. And

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,360
anytime Tom Dayspring says to me, you should have so and so on the podcast to talk about anything

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,880
that has to do with lipids, I immediately pay attention. Tom's an amazing guy. Now, in particular,

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,360
the subject matter I want to explore with you today is probably the area of lipidology that I

49
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:38,080
personally am the least familiar with. And that has to do with kind of one half of the lipid family.

50
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,960
I explain this to patients as they're broadly speaking two families, the ApoB family and the

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,000
ApoA family. We spend obviously so much more time talking about the ApoB family based on, I think,

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,080
two things. One is our clearer understanding of it and two, the direct and causal relationship to

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
pathology. But I often sort of waffle a bit when I'm talking about the ApoA side of the house.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
That's really why I'm excited to be sitting down with you today. But perhaps for the person

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,880
listening to this who doesn't even understand what a lipoprotein is yet, never mind what the

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
two families are that we're talking about, can you take it back to the beginning for where do

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,680
these things fit into the broader architecture of our existence? Lipoproteins are these big complexes

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,680
that really are evolved to transport lipids within the blood. Lipids are like oil. They don't mix

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,040
well with water. Oil droplets float to the top of a puddle. We wouldn't be able to transport lipids

60
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,160
in the blood if we hadn't evolved a mechanism to do that. And lipoproteins are basically the

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,600
mechanism to do that. As their names suggest, they're lipoproteins. They have lipid in the core,

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,400
and then they have proteins that dot the surface. That allows them to be transported in very

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,200
complex and sophisticated ways within the bloodstream in terms of how they're metabolized,

64
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,600
in terms of the receptors they bind to, and in terms of the specific proteins and lipids that

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,080
they carry. You've talked a lot about ApoB lipoproteins. I've listened to several of those

66
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,120
podcasts. They're really fabulous. And of course, the ApoB lipoproteins really primarily transport,

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,880
or evolve to transport triglycerides as a source of energy, both from the gut to adipose and muscle

68
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,800
and heart, as well as from the liver during times when we're fasting. You've talked a lot about that

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,000
and, as you pointed out, they are very important in terms of causal relationship to atherosclerotic

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
cardiovascular disease. HDL, which we're going to be talking about today, is also a lipoprotein.

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,200
It's a very complex lipoprotein. It doesn't have this key protein, ApoB. That's what differentiates

72
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
them. That's why we often refer to the ApoB-containing lipoproteins, and then HDL is the

73
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,760
other half, as you said. And HDL really is characterized by a different protein called

74
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,560
ApoA1. HDL also transports lipids, especially cholesterol and some other complex lipids,

75
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,280
and we'll be getting into that more. But essentially, lipoproteins are lipid transport

76
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,280
vehicles within the blood and really evolve to do that function.

77
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,120
A couple of things I'll just throw in for folks, again, maybe new to some of this,

78
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,120
which is all of this stuff we're talking about is so important in terms of these lipoproteins,

79
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,560
because unlike glucose, electrolytes, things that we kind of take for granted that are water

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,080
soluble, we use our circulatory system as the freeway to move these things around.

81
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,760
And unfortunately, as you said, because of the insolubility of both cholesterol,

82
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,080
triglyceride, lipids, et cetera, we have to come up with this more complicated system.

83
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,120
I think the second thing I'll throw in just for folks, because it could get confusing with the

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,440
nomenclature, when you talk about ApoA, I want to make sure people understand we're not talking

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,000
about LPa, which has another ApoA, so maybe just clarify for folks the difference between those two,

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,320
because we'll do our best to not talk about ApoA today at all.

87
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,640
Yeah, LPa is really important, not the topic of today's discussion. I think, as Peter already

88
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,880
said, the main thing to remember is that that A is lowercase, whereas the A we're talking about

89
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,240
today is uppercase. I know it sounds crazy, it's just the way things evolved historically,

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,760
but we're talking about ApoA, uppercase A, and the most important one has a 1 after it, so ApoA1.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,200
So you're going to hear us refer to ApoA1 a lot, totally different than the LPa, which is also an

92
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,120
important topic, but not for today. Yeah, it's a shame that the lipid community back in the 60s,

93
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,800
70s, and 80s didn't hire kind of a PR firm to sort of help with the naming of this stuff, because it is,

94
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,000
hands down, some of the most complicated nomenclature, and if they realized back then,

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm half joking, that it wouldn't be a bad idea for patients to actually understand this stuff,

96
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
I think we could have done better. Okay, so you've already alluded to kind of different

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,440
ApoA's and ApoA1, again, that's Apo capital A dash Roman numeral one is the most important,

98
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,680
but let's go back even further than that. So again, not to draw the ApoBs into this again,

99
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
but we kind of technically now have these two lineages of ApoBs, right? We have the ApoB100,

100
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,640
and virtually all of the time that we say ApoB, we really mean ApoB100, and that's to contrast it

101
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,120
with ApoB48, the one that you kind of alluded to very briefly as transporting chylomicrons from

102
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,520
the gut for the use of energy. Can you talk a little bit about the, or not a little bit,

103
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,600
maybe a lot a bit, about the genesis of the high density lipoprotein? What is its parent?

104
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
Where is it formed? And how does it move through its evolution such that, you know, when we're

105
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
measuring HDL cholesterol, something we'll talk about in a minute, we have a sense of where it

106
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,200
came from in the same way that we understand the LDLs, IDLs, and LDLs. With all due respect to the

107
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,720
ApoB community, and I'm part of that community too, I would say the metabolism of HDL is perhaps

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,880
an order of magnitude even more complex. And that's obviously what we're going to be working

109
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
our way through today. So I'll start relatively simplistically, and then Peter, I know you'll

110
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,640
lead me to increasingly more detail about the process. And by the way, I don't think anyone's

111
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,880
going to disagree with that, Dan. I don't think anybody who spent even a modicum of time looking

112
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,520
at this literature, it is hands down the most confusing stuff in the lipid space.

113
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,800
Again, I'll start with ApoA1 as the key protein with HDL. The analogy is to ApoB, as Peter alluded

114
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,960
to. Although one big difference is ApoB, as your listeners know, ApoB stays with that particle

115
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,520
throughout its lifetime. So it gets made by the intestine as B48, or the liver as B100. It stays

116
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,640
with that particle. There's one molecule of this huge ApoB protein, and that it basically then

117
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,040
ultimately gets taken up mostly by the liver after its time in the blood. ApoA1 is also made

118
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,600
by the intestine and the liver. There's some parallelism there. It also is a core protein,

119
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,320
essentially, of HDL. But unlike ApoB, there are several molecules of ApoA1 on any given HDL

120
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,200
particle. We'll probably talk more about that, but anywhere from one to four, maybe in some cases a

121
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,560
little bit more. And also ApoA1 doesn't stay with the particle. It can exchange onto other types of

122
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,240
mostly HDL particles, but even sometimes onto ApoB containing lipoproteins. What we've really

123
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,800
learned in the last decade or so is that ApoA1 is put into the blood by either the intestinal

124
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,120
enterocyte or the hepatocyte in the liver as more or less a free protein. So it's secreted as a

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,000
protein. One of the first steps that has to happen for HDL to be formed is that HDL, once it comes

126
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,560
out of the cell, engages with a key transport protein called ApoA1. And Peter, stop me if I'm

127
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,280
already getting too detailed. ApoA1, we'll come back to that. Which its role, ApoA1's role, is to

128
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,000
take lipid, cholesterol and other types of lipids called phospholipids, from the cell and export

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,520
them to the newly secreted ApoA1. So ApoA1 has to acquire lipid, particularly phospholipid and

130
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:22,800
cholesterol, soon after it's been secreted in order for the so-called nascent or early HDL to start

131
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,080
forming. We'll come back to this when we talk about genetics, but we know this because humans

132
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,840
that lack ABCA1 have virtually undetectable HDL. And that is because they cannot, they make plenty

133
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,320
of ApoA1, but they cannot protect that ApoA1 with lipid once it's secreted and it goes out like a

134
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,440
rocket from the blood. Basically can't, almost can't measure it in the blood. So that's the first step

135
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,160
in terms of HDL biogenesis, if you will. What other phenotype do those patients have? So in the absence

136
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:02,400
of cholesterol accumulating in what would be an HDL, does it end up where more of it ends up in the LDL

137
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,160
or back in the liver? Where does it go? This is the value of studying these very rare human genetic

138
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,480
disorders. And it just tells us a lot about what specific proteins or genes are doing. This disorder,

139
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,880
which we can talk about the history, it's a fascinating history, it's called Tangier disease.

140
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,160
It's named for a small flat bizarre island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, where the first

141
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,280
patient was discovered. This disorder is primarily associated with accumulation of cholesterol in

142
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,840
macrophages throughout the body. So tonsils, spleen, places where there are a lot of macrophages,

143
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,720
the cholesterol really builds up. And they have huge sort of orange colored tonsils, they have

144
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,960
big spleens that sometimes rupture, they have big livers because there are a lot of macrophages and

145
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,880
macrophage-like cells in the liver. And they also have some neurologic type issues, especially

146
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
neuropathy, which maybe we'll leave to later when we start talking about HDL and its relationship to

147
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,520
the nervous system. They may or may not have some increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular

148
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,200
disease, but as we'll talk about that relationship between HDL and atherosclerosis is quite complex.

149
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,160
This disorder has helped to inform that a little bit. Another sort of structural question, Dan,

150
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,800
if you were to take a quasi-mature garden variety HDL particle, and again, it's more complicated

151
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,640
there because of what we're talking about, and put it next to a comparable LDL particle,

152
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,840
what's the difference in size and can you explain a little bit why they come up with this different

153
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,400
name of high versus low density? What specifically is that referring to? That's a great question.

154
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Again, this is a historical artifact of how lipoproteins were discovered and named.

155
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,040
First of all, HDLs are much smaller, I would say, in the neighborhood of 1 5th to 1 10th the size

156
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,720
of an LDL, and of course much yet smaller than triglyceride rich lipoproteins. Lipoproteins have

157
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,040
lipid. As I mentioned earlier, lipid floats, so lipids create buoyancy to particles. The way

158
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,400
lipoproteins were discovered is that when you subject plasma to spinning, the lipoproteins spin

159
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,560
to the top. They spin to the top at different rates under different forces. The low density

160
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,720
lipoproteins have more lipid or bigger, more lipid. They spin to the top more easily. The

161
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,840
high density lipoproteins still have lipid. They do spin, but they don't spin quite as quickly or

162
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,680
easily, so they're higher density than the low. Then in another artifact of the history, Peter,

163
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,320
after low density was discovered, something even lighter that spun up even more easily was

164
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,040
discovered. Of course, if low was already taken, so that had to be called very low.

165
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
There's the very low density lipoproteins that you've also talked about at length.

166
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,960
Then finally, the chylomicrons, the huge ones that come from the intestine, they're just so light

167
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,440
and so buoyant that instead of calling them very, very, very low, they were just given the name

168
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,880
chylomicrons. How long does an HDL particle last? Does it mean the same thing given that it's

169
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,440
transferring its ApoA in a way that makes it a little different from, as you said, the way the

170
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,640
VLDL to IDL to LDL always stay with one lipoprotein ApoB that allows us to track its life.

171
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Before we get into how HDL is removed from the blood, could I take a little bit more time to

172
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
explain what happens after that? Absolutely.

173
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,800
ApoA1, quote unquote, nascent HDL particle gets formed because there's actually a bunch of stuff

174
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
that has to happen first before we start talking about how the HDL then gets removed from the blood.

175
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,040
The ApoA1, or what we call the nascent HDL, has ApoA1, has phospholipids, and it has what I'm

176
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,840
going to call free cholesterol. This is a concept that you may or may not have addressed before,

177
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,560
I can't remember, which is cholesterol itself as a molecule can have a fatty acid attached to it.

178
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,520
When you attach a fatty acid to a hydroxyl moiety on the cholesterol molecule,

179
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,880
you create what we call a cholesterol ester. The cholesterol ester is even more hydrophobic

180
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,720
or oily than the free cholesterol because it has this additional fatty acid sticking off it,

181
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:21,200
which is obviously oil. It's absolutely critical for the HDL maturation process to have this fatty

182
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,760
acid attached to the cholesterol after the nascent HDL has been formed. There's another key enzyme

183
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,360
that is responsible for that, so-called lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. It's the last time

184
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm going to say that, I'm just going to call it LCAT, that's its nickname, LCAT, L-C-A-T. So LCAT

185
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,480
rides on the HDL particle, on that nascent particle, it takes a fatty acid from one of the

186
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,480
phospholipids on the particle, and it transfers that fatty acid to the cholesterol and creates

187
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
the cholesterol ester. Remember, that cholesterol ester is more oily, it actually then moves to

188
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,640
sort of the center of the particle because it wants to be by itself and not interacting with

189
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,320
the water, and it starts to form the core of the HDL particle. So the core of the mature, what I'll

190
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,160
call the mature HDL particle, is basically cholesterol esters that are entirely dependent

191
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
on LCAT for their formation. Another rare condition are people who lack LCAT genetically,

192
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,800
and as you might maybe expect from what I just said, people who lack LCAT who can't do that

193
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,800
process of esterifying the cholesterol, have extremely low levels of HDL, not quite as low

194
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,840
as Tanger disease, but very low, and simply can't form the mature HDL particles that we see in most

195
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,360
people. So again, we learn very important things about the key role of that enzyme. That ultimately

196
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,760
leads to the mature particle that then is really what we're measuring as HDL cholesterol in people,

197
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
is this mature HDL particle where most of the cholesterol we're measuring is the cholesterol

198
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,360
in the core. Just to make sure we're clear on semantics, when you say that those folks have

199
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:08,400
very low HDL, you mean low HDL cholesterol or a low concentration of ApoA1 or any of the ApoAs?

200
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,520
They have low HDL cholesterol. So again, Tanger disease, HDL cholesterol is one,

201
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,480
virtually undetectable. LCAT deficiency, HDL cholesterol is 10. Also, as we'll talk about,

202
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,240
quite low compared to normal. They also have low ApoA1 levels. And part of that is because

203
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,520
part of the metabolism of ApoA1, which is where you were going, is that it's affected by the mature

204
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,200
HDL and the cholesterol in the core. So when you don't make that cholesterol ester, that ApoA1

205
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,640
is much more rapidly removed from the blood. It's not the normal metabolism. And it basically,

206
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,440
the kidney sees that ApoA1, which doesn't have much cholesterol on it and actually filters it

207
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,720
and degrades it. Not surprisingly, the biggest issue with L-cat deficient patients is they get

208
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,440
renal disease. There's a serious progressive chronic kidney disease in these patients that

209
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,400
leads usually to kidney transplant related to something around the lipid metabolism in the

210
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,680
kidney as a result of the lack of L-cat activity and esterification of cholesterol.

211
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,360
Before we go deeper on this, I just want to ask if there are any insights we have or how parallel

212
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,640
is this system in other mammals, whether it be primates, dogs, mice, et cetera. Because obviously,

213
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
a lot of these animals have a very different ApoB side of the equation. I'm curious as to how

214
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,120
similar they are on this front. No, it's a great question. ApoA1 is pretty highly conserved

215
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,000
certainly among mammals. In many lower level mammals, the primary lipoprotein is HDL.

216
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,240
That clearly includes ApoA1. I'll just take mice, obviously a major model system for human,

217
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,200
for biomedical research. Mice, I'd say 90% of cholesterol in the blood of mice is in HDL,

218
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,680
even more than 90% in a normal mouse. That is the primary lipoprotein in mice. It's true for dogs.

219
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,920
It's true for really all mammalian species. Once you start getting below mammals, things change a

220
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,040
little bit in terms of the lipoprotein metabolism. Probably we won't get into that today. There's

221
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:21,120
even HDL-type particles in much lower species leading to one of the thoughts that HDL is like

222
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:29,200
the primordial lipoprotein and that the ApoB system evolved subsequently, but that HDL probably very

223
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,360
early evolved as a transport mechanism for lipids within circulatory systems in lower level species.

224
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,640
This to me is one of the most interesting teleologic slash evolutionary questions, which is,

225
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,680
was God just pissed off at us? Is that why we as humans have ApoB? I've never really heard a

226
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:57,120
convincing explanation for why humans have ApoB when it seems that every other species

227
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,920
gets away without it. As you said, if a mouse or a primate or a dog who clearly have similar

228
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:13,360
energetic requirements can use their ApoAs, i.e. HDLs, for lipid transport and energy mobilization,

229
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,200
why did we need to evolve with this particle that in the short term really doesn't cause us any

230
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
trouble, of course, but long enough it doesn't. One answer might simply be that evolution had no

231
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,760
concern for the longevity of our species, which is pretty true, but there is some other short-term

232
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,480
benefit from ApoB that maybe outweighs the long-term death that it brings our species via ASCVD.

233
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,400
I do want to be clear. Mice, dogs, pigs, rabbits, they all make ApoB in both the gut and the liver,

234
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,000
so it's not that these species don't have ApoB. The differences in terms of looking at the steady

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,320
state plasma levels is that their ApoB system is just really markedly revved up. They take care of

236
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,080
their business. They just must clear it up a certain way. And they make it, and it serves a

237
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,640
similar role in terms of transporting triglycerides as a source of energy to tissues in the body that

238
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,720
need energy and to adipose tissue for storing it. It's just that the rate at which they do that is

239
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,280
much more efficient, whereas in humans, for reasons we could talk about but aren't totally clear,

240
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,160
but certainly have to do partly with our lifestyle. Humans are not nearly as efficient

241
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,640
at clearing the ApoB containing lipoproteins, and they hang around, especially as LDL,

242
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,040
as a byproduct of this metabolism in a way that then ultimately leads to, of course,

243
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,560
atherosclerotic vascular disease. We do need ApoB. Honestly, mammals evolved ApoB because,

244
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,440
one, we have to be able to efficiently capture fats in the diet for energy purposes,

245
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,720
and very efficiently. That's what the chylomicrons allow us to do. And during fasting, which, of

246
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,160
course, in evolution sometimes lasted a long time, we have to be very parsimonious about

247
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,320
parceling out that available fat we have in our adipose stores back out to heart and muscle to be

248
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,040
able to have as a source of energy. That's what ApoB 100 in the liver does. We need these,

249
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,680
especially in evolution, the latter. We need it very substantially. But now, unfortunately,

250
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,200
in the modern times, the ApoB system is mostly a problem, not something we need.

251
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,680
I think the way you stated it earlier is obviously more accurate, and perhaps I want to just make

252
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,680
sure I'm restating it without being quite as tongue-in-cheek. It's really not that we don't

253
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,800
need ApoB. It's that we could be clearing it at a much greater and more efficient rate

254
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,640
than we are, and we could more mimic primates and other mammals and walk around with an ApoB

255
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,640
concentration of, call it 20 milligrams per deciliter instead of 100 milligrams per deciliter,

256
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,840
a five-fold difference, which is about, that's the difference between getting atherosclerosis

257
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
in our lifetime and never getting atherosclerosis in our lifetime.

258
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,080
I agree with that.

259
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,920
And that's the interesting thing, because even absent the, quote unquote,

260
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,840
lifestyle things that will raise ApoB, it just occurs with aging. Peter Libby has written about

261
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,280
this very eloquently, and children neonates have ApoB concentrations that are just like those of

262
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:16,080
these other animals. And all things equal as we age, ApoB just goes up, that concentration goes up,

263
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,440
as you say. We're less efficient in the way we clear ApoB from circulation. Anyway, it's a

264
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,840
fascinating topic, and I know not what we're going to talk about today because it's one of speculation,

265
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
and we could speculate, but there are actually lots of things today that we don't have to speculate

266
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,840
about as it comes to ApoA and HDL. I want to go back to kind of the nomenclature a little bit,

267
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,560
because I know I'm still kind of confused on some of this, and I think it's going to be a little

268
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,080
challenging because we're sometimes talking about Roman numerals, and we're sometimes talking about

269
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,240
numbers. But is there just an ApoA1 and 2 in the Roman numeral lipoprotein, Apo lipoprotein cover?

270
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,520
No. So it goes to two, three.

271
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,040
The two other ApoAs that at least we know about or we talk about are ApoA4 and ApoA5.

272
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,560
Don't ask me what happened to ApoA3. That's a mystery I've never been able to solve.

273
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,080
But anyway, it's another one of those. ApoA4, we don't really know what it does. ApoA5,

274
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,760
I can't remember if you've talked about, but ApoA5 has a very important role in stimulating

275
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,680
lipoprotein lipase and in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. It rides on

276
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,200
HDL, but it also rides on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. And people who lack ApoA5,

277
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,480
have really high triglycerides and are also at major risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease.

278
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,360
So anyway, again, maybe not the topic for today, but it does illustrate one point, Peter, maybe

279
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,760
that I'll make, which is that HDL as a molecule, as a lipoprotein, I think of as a platform.

280
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:54,400
It's a platform for all sorts of proteins and lipids that get transported by HDL in the blood

281
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,120
and then transfer off HDL to other things, to ApoB-containing lipoproteins. So my example of

282
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,640
ApoA5, it's named ApoAA because it was discovered on HDL, but its primary role in metabolism is

283
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,880
triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism. ApoA5 is basically kept within the blood and stored,

284
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,680
if you will, on HDL. But then when we eat a fatty meal, it transfers off to the triglyceride-rich

285
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,800
lipoproteins and it serves a role of promoting the hydrolysis of the triglycerides. So I think

286
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,960
that's a general concept for HDL that maybe we'll keep coming back to is this platform for all

287
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,320
sorts of things that are doing different things that involve not only lipid metabolism, but

288
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:45,200
host defense and other things that it evolved to do as a platform for transporting things within

289
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,280
the blood. Which I think explains, at least in part, the complexity of this system is

290
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,080
it's much more dynamic than what we see on the ApoB side. The ApoB side, as you said,

291
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,280
it's a very monogamous relationship, right? I mean, you sort of get your ApoB in the liver and

292
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,200
it's with you for life and you're not swapping, you're not trading, you're not increasing or

293
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,720
decreasing, you're just marching through life. And the HDL is maybe the monogamy wasn't the best

294
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
example because now I don't know what to come up with here because it's not just polygamy,

295
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
it's even more complicated than that. As you said, it's swapping, it's moving things around,

296
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,360
it's carrying things that it doesn't really use, but loaning them out. It is indeed a complicated

297
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,040
system. The next thing that seems to add a lot of confusion, at least to me, is some of the

298
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,120
nomenclature around the numbering of the HDL particles. And I bring this up in part because

299
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,000
various commercial labs, someone listening to this goes out and gets a really fancy,

300
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
fancy blood test. We use Boston Heart Labs with our patients. I know that this is something you

301
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,800
see with a number of other labs. It might say things like HDL1, HDL2, HDL3. What's the relationship

302
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:01,760
between that nomenclature and the ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoA4, et cetera? This is ridiculously complex.

303
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
The short answer to your question is actually, believe it or not, there's no relationship. So,

304
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,840
the numbering of the Apo-Lipar proteins or the ApoA-Lipar proteins, 1, 2, 4, 5, is totally

305
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,920
independent of the numbering of the HDL particles, like especially HDL2 and HDL3, which are the

306
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:25,120
classic two main, quote, subclasses of HDL. These are different sizes and different densities of HDL

307
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,080
that, again, were isolated by centrifugation and by their flotation properties. HDL2 is bigger. HDL3

308
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:40,480
is a little smaller. HDL2 has mostly four molecules of ApoA1. HDL3 has mostly three

309
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,200
molecules of ApoA1, but those threes don't have anything to do with each other. Then,

310
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
to make things more complicated, there are other ways of subfractionating

311
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,280
lipoproteins. I know you've discussed, like the NMR type methodology, that don't use HDL2 and HDL3,

312
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,000
which frankly is a little outmoded now, but use things like very large HDL, large HDL, medium HDL,

313
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,120
small HDL, very small HDL. HDL certainly comes in a whole series of sizes and densities

314
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,000
that can be isolated by these different methodologies. There's been a cottage industry,

315
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,040
as you know, Peter, of trying to relate these different fractions of HDL to cardiovascular risk

316
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,720
in a way that might give us some advantages in terms of trying to predict risk. We can come back

317
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,640
to that, but I would say in general, I'm not very compelled that fractionating HDLs gives much

318
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,920
clinically valuable information that allows us to predict risk. In contrast, I just want to say,

319
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:47,440
in contrast to the ApoB-containing lipoproteins, whether it's ApoB, but I think the smaller,

320
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,040
denser LDL particles do have a relationship to increased risk, as you've discussed in the past.

321
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,440
But I think the HDL fractionation is fascinating for understanding HDL biology and metabolism,

322
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,640
but is relatively unimportant from a clinical relevant standpoint.

323
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,200
I'm actually glad to hear you say that because I was wondering if I need to be changing

324
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:16,320
our clinical practice. In about 2016, we basically stopped paying attention to any of the HDL

325
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,520
fractionation metrics. Really, it had to go out of our way to make sure that the lab was not running

326
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,720
those because in some areas, we're running complicated labs. We were saying, look, we don't

327
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,240
want any of this stuff. A, we don't want the additional cost of it, but more importantly,

328
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,520
we don't think it's clinically actionable. We still get labs from other doctors who

329
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,880
might've seen our patients in the past and they're chock full of these things,

330
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320
to which I don't know what to do with them.

331
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,720
While we're on this topic of HDLs fractionation, unless you want to ask me another question.

332
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,120
No, no, go ahead.

333
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,080
I wonder if I could use this as a springboard to continuing this complex saga of the metabolism

334
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,560
of HDLs once they're formed and once they have cholesterol ester. The reason we have this whole

335
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:12,560
set of different size and density HDLs is because of the complex metabolism that occurs on the HDLs

336
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,640
once they're in the blood, once they've been made mature HDLs. I want to give you maybe a couple

337
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,080
examples of that. One is that HDLs are acted upon by so-called lipases and you've talked a

338
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,280
lot about lipoprotein lipase. It's critically important for triglyceride metabolism and energy

339
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,720
metabolism. Lipoprotein lipase has two other very close cousins that I don't think you've talked

340
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,040
nearly as much about appropriately because they're more HDL related. One is called

341
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:47,760
hepatic lipase and what is called endothelial lipase. We actually first reported a long time

342
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,280
ago endothelial lipase as a member of this family. Both of these lipases, they're made in different

343
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,960
places as their names suggest, but both of them fundamentally chew on HDL, specifically the

344
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,640
phospholipids on HDL and result in modification of the phospholipid composition of the HDL particle

345
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
in a way that does different things. It certainly changes the sizes of the HDLs and they contribute

346
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,440
to this distribution of different sizes. It changes the protein composition of the HDLs in

347
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,200
ways that we don't fully understand and almost certainly has other important biological effects

348
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
that we don't fully understand, but of course these evolve for some reason, one of which I'm

349
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,080
going to get back to later when we talk about the central nervous system. So that's one. The

350
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,480
lipases are really critical for HDL metabolism. There's also this protein that I know you've had

351
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,600
some discussion about, cholesterol ester transfer protein. Happy to go into more detail and I'm sure

352
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,360
we will because it's very relevant to HDL, but just for the metabolism part of it, this so-called

353
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,360
CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein, essentially transfers cholesterol esters between

354
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,880
apoB-containing lipoproteins and HDL and it's a major modifier of the HDL particle in terms of

355
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,560
its size and composition. We know this because people who lacked CETP have hugely elevated HDL

356
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,040
cholesterol levels, big time, like over 100. That really told us that cholesterol ester transfer

357
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,680
protein siphons cholesterol out of HDL and when you don't have it, you have a lot more cholesterol

358
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,920
in HDL and just point back to our previous discussion of mice. Mice don't have CETP.

359
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,640
So among the differences, one of the things is that mice have a lot more HDL cholesterol relative

360
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,240
date would be because they lack this CETP protein. I mean, I know we're going to come back to this,

361
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,840
but I just, I worry that for the listener, this would be an opportunity missed if we don't dive

362
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,560
into CTEP a little bit because of the following. If we take a step back, a listener is going to be

363
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,840
saying, Peter, Dan, what the hell are you guys talking about? Like I am so lost. The only thing

364
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,600
I know is when I go to the doctor, the doctor says my good cholesterol is high. I'm in good shape.

365
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,360
So let's do this. Let's hit pause for one sec and acknowledge that a standard lipid panel spits out

366
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,520
a bunch of numbers, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol. And if you're lucky,

367
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,720
VLDL cholesterol, non HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, that's basically the standard

368
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,600
metric. If the lab is competent and they're using direct measurements, your HDL cholesterol,

369
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,240
LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol should sum to your total cholesterol. And of course, your

370
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,320
non HDL cholesterol should be the same number as your total cholesterol, less your HDL cholesterol.

371
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:51,040
Want to pause and also insert that with nomenclature, HDL is not a laboratory metric. It is a LIPA

372
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,360
protein. The laboratory metric is HDL cholesterol, HDL C, or if using NMR, HDL P, HDL particle number.

373
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,120
Or APO A1, an analogy to measuring APOB. Exactly. The units that you've been throwing around,

374
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,320
of course, are the HDL cholesterol. A moment ago, you said, hey, people who are deficient in CTEP

375
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,440
could have HDLs over 100. Of course, that means HDL cholesterol over 100 milligrams per deciliter.

376
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,520
Now, there is an observation that goes back probably to the late 70s, right? I mean,

377
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,200
it probably goes back to late 70s, early 80s, which is in some of the earliest Framingham cohorts,

378
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,880
which observed the risk of ASCVD in five cities. We don't need to go into what Framingham did in

379
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:44,160
the first cohort. But what came out of that was higher HDL cholesterol was better than lower HDL

380
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,240
cholesterol. In fact, that was four times greater if my memory serves correctly as a predictor of

381
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,400
ASCVD than high LDL cholesterol was a negative predictor. Am I remembering that correctly?

382
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,600
Yeah, that's about right. Yep.

383
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,040
By now, we're talking about 82, 83, 84. This has been a long time since I've looked at this stuff,

384
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,600
but it emerges that, hey, high HDL cholesterol seems to be positively associated with outcomes.

385
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,320
And obviously, that's a big part of why HDL cholesterol became known as good cholesterol

386
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,120
and LDL cholesterol became known as bad cholesterol. We'll obviously talk about why those terms are

387
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:28,080
inaccurate. But it wasn't long until companies, drug companies were saying, hey, wait a minute,

388
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:35,760
we know that if CTEP is inhibited, this enzyme is inhibited, HDL cholesterol goes up. That must

389
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,400
be a good thing, right? That led directly from this observation I mentioned that people who lack

390
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,120
CTEP genetically have these hugely elevated levels of HDL. One directly from the other. Well, gosh,

391
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:56,960
that must mean that if we could pharmacologically inhibit the CTEP, it would be a way to raise HDL.

392
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,920
And of course, as you know, that absolutely turned out to be the case. But the story goes beyond that.

393
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,040
So the first company to do this was Pfizer, right? Wasn't the first CTEP inhibitor?

394
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,640
The first CTB inhibitor, Torcetribib, was from Pfizer, correct?

395
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,400
And that was, you could take a skeptical view of the trial, which was Lipitor was about to go off

396
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,320
patent. And so they came up with a trial that was Lipitor by itself versus Lipitor combined

397
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,640
with the CTEP inhibitor. And I remember actually, this was probably early 2000s, right? Thinking,

398
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,080
oh, this is super, I mean, this was back when I was in my surgical residency. So I was

399
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,480
only tangentially interested in this, right? It wasn't my field. But interesting in that I knew

400
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,880
my family history for ASCVD was high, so I was paying attention. And I remember thinking, well,

401
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
God, this has got to be great, right? You got one drug that's going to lower LDL-C,

402
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,640
one that's going to raise HDL-C. This is a can't miss drug. And then in September of 2006,

403
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,720
lo and behold, not only did it not get better, it was slightly worse, right?

404
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,160
Yeah, bombshell. So first, I want to emphasize, the genetics did predict what happened. That is,

405
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,600
pharmacologic inhibition of CTP is extraordinarily effective at raising HDL a lot. In fact,

406
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,200
putting people kind of over 100 HDL cholesterol, like the folks who lack CTP. But you're absolutely

407
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,320
right. There's a lot of excitement about that. A lot of excitement about HDL is the good cholesterol.

408
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:25,280
And that trial, the first of several with different CTP inhibitors, not only didn't show benefit,

409
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,040
but showed an actual adverse effect. Now, it has to be said that in retrospect,

410
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,120
we're pretty sure that adverse effect, more people, literally more people died.

411
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,320
That adverse effect was due to off-target effects of the drug, not due to CTP inhibition itself.

412
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,480
So that drug, of course, was discarded, but it didn't kill the field because the idea was, well,

413
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,440
that was just a bad drug. Let's get a clean CTP inhibitor and see what that really does. I don't

414
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,680
know if you want to ask me questions or I can continue the story. Yeah. Let's go down that path

415
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,400
because it's still a little, it got progressively less murky as time went on, but let's go down the

416
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,120
path of the evolution of CTP inhibitors, which let's be honest, it's for what, we're almost

417
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:17,840
15, well, actually 16 years post the halting of that trial and the discarding of that drug.

418
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,800
And we still don't have a CTP inhibitor on the market, right?

419
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,680
We don't. There is still a CTP inhibitor that's in development, which I'll get to,

420
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,080
but there is certainly not one on the market. As you know, Peter, and certainly probably many of

421
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:37,760
our listeners do, three additional CTP inhibitors were then taken into late-stage clinical development,

422
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,080
including large cardiovascular outcome trials. To summarize the results of that, one of them was just

423
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,680
flat, didn't do anything, didn't hurt people, but didn't help. A second one was stopped early because

424
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,760
it really didn't look like it was doing anything, helping. And the third one was followed through

425
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:03,440
and did show about a disappointing 9% reduction in cardiovascular events. But I also want to point

426
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,960
out that it lowered LDL and ApoB pretty well also. 9%, given that you also lowered LDL and ApoB

427
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,040
was not exactly exciting and that drug was not taken further in terms of approval. I have to say

428
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,400
one other thing that's just fascinating for sort of our field and maybe in general. One of these

429
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,480
drugs, dalcetrapib, that failed in its clinical trial, a detailed genetic study was done post-hoc.

430
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,840
And there were individuals who were found to have a particular genetic variant that looked like on

431
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:44,000
post-hoc analysis that group actually benefited from the drug. And that led to a subsequent attempt

432
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,720
to do another trial focused specifically on people of that genotype with the CTP inhibitor,

433
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,960
which was just reported out really within the last year as a negative trial. That CTP inhibitor

434
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,720
actually had two different trials, one in kind of a very focused precision medicine way, but it still

435
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,560
didn't produce any benefit. This has been a long saga of using CTP inhibition to raise HDL

436
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,960
as a way to reduce risk. And as we're going to be talking about more, it really is one of the key

437
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,240
planks that has led to, I think, what is now rock solid, which is HDL cholesterol itself, the HDL

438
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,960
cholesterol itself is not directly and causally protective against atherosclerotic cardiovascular

439
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,280
disease. There's a lot of nuances there, which we'll come back to, but I feel pretty confident

440
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,440
making that statement. And I just think there's a great opportunity to also talk about why it's so

441
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,840
important to have hard outcome trials in the field of cardiovascular medicine. I think it's true in

442
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,360
all medicine, but let's go back and think about the first lipid lowering drug introduced in the

443
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,840
United States in, God, about 1950, right? Maybe 1959, something like that, right? So try Panerol,

444
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,560
which I can never remember the name of the enzyme, but it's the enzyme that converts

445
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,680
desmossterel to cholesterol in the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Believe it or not, this is a

446
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,680
sign of my aging, Dan. I used to know the names of these enzymes. It was like, and it's not delta-24

447
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,800
desaturase, but it's a cousin or derivative, isn't it? But anyway, so you had this drug,

448
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,840
triperinol, that inhibited that enzyme and lo and behold, it lowered cholesterol. Now, this was

449
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,600
for the listener, this is back in the day before we knew anything about the sub fractions of

450
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,960
cholesterol. So we just knew from some of the early work of Ansel Keys that if you looked at

451
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,200
very, very high levels of total cholesterol and compared that to people who had very,

452
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,720
very low levels of total cholesterol, there was a difference in outcome, cardiovascular outcomes.

453
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,800
This was an observed finding. There was no intervention to test that. So this drug came

454
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,760
along and it really lowered total cholesterol and it likely would have been lowering LDL cholesterol

455
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,600
and APOB. It basically got approved on the basis of that without of course the hard outcome. So it

456
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,520
gets approved, it goes into circulation and it's really only after it was approved, gosh, probably

457
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,000
what, eight to 10 years later that they had enough post surveillance data to say, you know what,

458
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,240
this drug is lowering cholesterol all right, but it's actually increasing mortality, cardiovascular

459
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,840
mortality. Drug was pulled off the market. I don't know what is known about the why, but I

460
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:30,160
know Tom Dayspring and I have speculated that it was probably the desmosterol spike that was causing

461
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,240
the problem. So you might've been trading one problem for a worse problem. Are you familiar

462
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,360
with that drug or that story? Only peripherally, but of course there's been a ton of research in

463
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,120
desmosterol really over the last several years. We now, based on that, that the plausibility of

464
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,080
the fact that the adverse effects were related to increasing this nostril I think is quite real.

465
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,320
That very well may be the explanation. By the way, this is a totally tangent off-topic point, but

466
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:04,240
it's become quite in vogue to use clomaphene or clomid for testosterone replacement in men. And

467
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,560
the reason for it is A, it's quite effective. So if you give clomaphene, you are telling the

468
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,800
pituitary to make a lot of LH and FSH, which of course is telling the testes to make a lot of

469
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,960
testosterone. This would certainly in the short term have the advantage of preserving testicular

470
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,040
function, unlike giving exogenous testosterone, which suppresses testicular function. And I think

471
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,720
for short term use, it probably isn't a bad thing. It's an off-label use of course for clomaphene.

472
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,160
And we used to do it for this purpose, right? So if a guy was still considering reproduction

473
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,520
or we were considering this a ridge treatment between testosterone, we would use it. But

474
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,040
because we always measure desmosterol, lithosterol, compensatorol, cytosterol, these sterols when we

475
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,640
measure our patients' cholesterol levels, we noticed how high the desmosterol levels were getting in

476
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,520
those patients. And we figured out pretty quickly it was the clomid that was doing this. And it

477
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,960
would reverse, but it could take a year to return desmosterol levels to normal after you stopped the

478
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,440
clomid. So about four years ago, once we put two and two together, we stopped using clomid. But it's

479
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,000
interesting to me that the use of that hormone has gone through the roof. There are now like

480
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,160
clomid clinics opening up. And I don't understand why someone, and we've done a lit search. I don't

481
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,000
understand, we just need to write this up. I think at some point. Yeah, it's fascinating.

482
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,400
Because I don't understand why someone hasn't put the two and two together, especially long-term

483
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,560
use. Again, I don't think using clomid for a couple of years is going to be problematic. And

484
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,440
I certainly don't think it's problematic for women using it for IVF. When I think about a guy

485
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,040
being on this for 10 years, and I'm talking desmosterol levels going up by 20 fold,

486
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,920
that would be concerning. And we went back and tried to see if we could find out how high the

487
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,720
desmosterol levels were in the triparinol trials, not trials, but in the levels that if anybody had

488
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,520
pulled serum or saved serum from those subways, we couldn't find it. So we don't really know how high

489
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,400
it was, but the assumption has to be that that drug and clomifene both interfere with the same

490
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,960
enzyme. Really fascinating. I would encourage you to write that up. So what's the point of that

491
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,440
whole long-winded story? The point of that long-winded story is things can make a lot of sense

492
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,800
until they don't, right? That's for sure. Before we leave CTP inhibition though, I do want to just

493
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,720
remind your listeners that there is still one CTP inhibitor, obocetrapid, that is still in clinical

494
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:39,040
development. What differentiates it, it's much more effective at lowering LDL and ApoB. We now

495
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,600
no longer think that raising HDL cholesterol with CTP inhibition is going to help you. We don't think

496
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,080
it hurts you, but we don't think it's going to help you. But we do think that there's still merit.

497
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Of course, we know there's merit to raising LDL cholesterol and ApoB. You mean lowering. I'm sorry,

498
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,240
lowering. Perhaps this CTP inhibitor could be part of the armamentarium to do that. So we'll see. Stay

499
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,120
tuned. Now, Dan, maybe this was naive of me, but after the third failure of a CTP inhibitor,

500
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,040
my very crude interpretation is not unique. I'm sure a lot of people have speculated this,

501
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:22,960
is that if at least part of the benefit of HDL involves stuff we're going to talk about, right?

502
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Delipidation, reverse cholesterol transport, all of those things. And you slap a CTP inhibitor on

503
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,760
one of those particles, thereby making it harder for the particle to efflux its cholesterol to get

504
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,000
rid of its cholesterol, which is why you now measure much higher HDL cholesterol, which on the surface

505
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,920
looks good. That could actually be problematic. In other words, if you see a lot of people in a room,

506
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,320
it might be tempting to conclude that there's something awesome going on in that room.

507
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,440
But what you don't know if you can't measure all the ins and outs is it might be that those people

508
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,440
are all stuck in the room because the door is locked. I know that's a bit of a crude analogy,

509
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,200
but is there any merit to that sort of thinking around the different ways in which one might

510
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,840
boost HDL cholesterol and how some of those could actually be deleterious if they prevent function?

511
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,840
There absolutely is, but I think it's probably not relevant to CTP for reasons we can return to,

512
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,000
but it is relevant to another protein that I think now's a good time to introduce,

513
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,360
which is another key protein, a receptor that is basically the major HDL receptor.

514
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,480
Essentially the equivalent of the LDL receptor, but for HDL, and it's known as SRB1,

515
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,800
another unfortunate nomenclature. SRB1 is a receptor that basically is on a lot of cells,

516
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,640
but the liver is the most important with regard to HDL. It essentially binds the HDL particle,

517
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,360
basically sucks the cholesterol ester out of the HDL particle, and then releases the

518
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,680
cholesterol depleted HDL back into the circulation to go back around and do whatever it's doing.

519
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,520
So the analogy I like to use, Peter, is that of garbage trucks. So a very simplistic view of HDL,

520
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,160
which we're going to return to because it's much more nuanced, is that HDL to a certain extent

521
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,480
functions like garbage trucks that are picking up things trash in places where you don't want it,

522
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:21,280
and returning it to the liver, dumping it off via SRB1, and then going back now empty to do more

523
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,720
of its role. Again, it's more complicated than that, but that's an analogy. So this brings me

524
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:33,280
back to SRB1. So there are humans who lack SRB1. What do you think the problem is? Very high HDL.

525
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,880
They have very high HDLs. They have very high HDLs because they can't unload the dump trucks,

526
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,080
but they actually have increased risk of heart disease because they are not efficiently

527
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,800
unloading that HDL. So very similar to your analogy of the locked room, you're not clearing the HDL

528
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,680
and doing that normal process of recycling the trucks back to the periphery to do what they

529
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,600
need to do. And so that's, I think, our best example of this concept of constipation of the system,

530
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,800
leading to high HDL but paradoxically to increase risk. And of course, the analogy would be that,

531
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,280
not the analogy, but the interpretation that would be, you would never want to develop an SRB1

532
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,000
inhibitor. Yes, it would raise HDL quite a lot, but it wouldn't protect against heart disease and

533
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,880
probably would hurt people. Yeah, I remember the first time Tom shared a case study with me of a

534
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,120
patient with presumably defective, not necessarily completely absent, but SRB1. And

535
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,440
this was one of those things where you could tell just reading the journal, it must have been 40

536
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,920
years old, but her LDL cholesterol was whatever it was, 100 milligrams per deciliter. Her HDL

537
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,880
cholesterol was like 150 milligrams per deciliter. So she had quote unquote high cholesterol,

538
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,360
but initially people assumed it was not of concern because the fraction that was HDL cholesterol was

539
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,520
what was contributing to it. And of course, on further exam, I mean, she had very, very advanced

540
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,120
atherosclerosis for a woman her age. Yep, exactly. We don't see this often. I can tell you that I

541
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,400
have not yet seen a case of that. Now, admittedly, my practice is not large, but we're certainly

542
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:18,560
looking for it when we see people with high HDL cholesterol, typically north of 90. I guess we

543
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,960
should talk about this as well, but we can do that in a moment after this question, which is why is

544
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,880
there a sex difference between these two? Because there is quite a significant sex difference

545
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,400
between men and women in terms of HDL cholesterol. But at what point, Dan, as a clinician, do you

546
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,640
start to worry about that? And if there are doctors or patients listening to this, when would you

547
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,560
recommend that somebody go and get checked out for a genetic deficiency there? SRB1 deficiency

548
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,200
is not common. I completely agree with you. Huge project we've had for a long time now is

549
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,240
essentially collecting people or consenting people with extreme high HDL with the goal of trying to

550
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,840
find what the underlying genetic cause is. And I will tell you that that's how we found a few of

551
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:03,760
these SRB1 folks, but most of them don't have any identifiable gene that we can point to and say,

552
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,480
here's the smoking gun. Here's why your HDL is high. HDL is very heritable, meaning that there's

553
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,920
a lot of genetic determinants of HDL, but it's more about so-called polygenic inheritance where

554
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,200
multiple different genes, including SRB1, but not major genetic defects, just sort of more common

555
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,520
variants, but many others, like some of the things we've been talking about, including a CTP and

556
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,760
ABCA1, all contribute to the heritability of the HDL cholesterol. But to get back to the clinical

557
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,080
implications, my view at this point, we can talk more about the data. It's pretty clear that

558
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,680
high HDL is not uniformly associated with protection. And there are certain circumstances

559
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,000
where that's true, especially if it's extremely high. Perhaps we'll get back to this, but there's

560
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,120
a fair amount of evidence now, including a recent paper that individuals of African ancestry who

561
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:58,560
tend to have higher HDLs anyway, that the high HDLs are not as protective or maybe not even HDL is

562
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:05,200
that well associated with risk. So my clinical advice to anyone with high HDL is not go get

563
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,080
yourself sequenced to find out if you're deficient in SRB1. The odds of that are extremely low,

564
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:19,680
but never use a high HDL as a reason for not using a statin or some other LDL lowering or

565
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,520
preventive therapy. That is, you should never be dissuaded from doing what you would have

566
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,160
otherwise done in that patient just because their HDL is high. Does that make sense?

567
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,880
Yeah, absolutely makes sense. And I have a very short paragraph in my book that'll be coming out

568
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:41,200
in a while where I cite two Mendelian randomizations that really look at this in some detail. I think

569
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,120
I've explained Mendelian randomization before on the podcast, but it's always worth, I think,

570
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,840
a short explanation again, in case you haven't heard it. This is basically a technique where

571
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:58,720
you look for genes that impact traits that you are interested in. So in this case, because as you

572
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,960
pointed out, HDL is very genetic. That means that there are sets of genes that we would identify

573
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,480
that predispose people to having very high versus very low HDL cholesterol. And because those genes

574
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:17,600
are randomly occurring, you can look at that as though it's a natural experiment. And you can look

575
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:24,880
at based on the natural occurring spreading or scattering of those genes, how are outcomes

576
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:34,400
effective? And it turns out that low HDL cholesterol is not causally linked to atherosclerosis,

577
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,760
and high HDL cholesterol, genetically high, is not causally linked to protection from ASCVD.

578
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,160
So I think those are very important findings, and I think it speaks to why, as you say, you can't

579
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,200
use high HDL cholesterol as a reason to not treat in the presence of other risk factors.

580
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,200
I completely agree. It's interesting, though, that that persists, isn't it? I do find this to be

581
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,800
probably top three most vexing discussions I have with other physicians, which is, I know his LDL

582
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,680
cholesterol is 140 milligrams per deciliter, but God, I mean, his HDL is 80. I mean, his ratio,

583
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,760
I mean, that's when they say the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL or LDL to HDL is such and such,

584
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,520
and therefore I don't need to treat. I mean, it makes me wish I had hair to pull out.

585
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,800
You're absolutely right, and I'll just reiterate, high HDL is never a reason not to treat someone

586
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,120
who would have otherwise merited treatment. I do want to make clear, though, there are lots of

587
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,920
people who are on the fence about whether to start a statin, who have LDLs that are kind of borderline

588
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,800
or even not that terribly high. And of course, we look at the whole patient, we look at the risk,

589
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:48,640
we look at their calculated risk, other risk factors. But I'll just say that a low HDL

590
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,480
in the setting of someone who you're generally on the fence about treating,

591
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,560
perhaps could contribute to tilting toward, yes, I'm going to treat this person. In other words,

592
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,480
a low HDL, at least in most populations, again, I think individuals of African ancestry, perhaps

593
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,720
we have to be a little bit more careful about using HDL as a predictor. Maybe we'll come back

594
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:16,320
to that. Otherwise, I think a low HDL can be used not absolutely, but relatively to tilt toward

595
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,480
being more aggressive, but only in the context of the overall risk profile.

596
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,040
And obviously part of that, Dan, has to do with the relationship between low HDL cholesterol,

597
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,560
if my memory serves me correctly, it's the HDL two fraction and the association with that and insulin

598
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,800
resistance. So there's no question that a phenotype, and as you point out, and we should come back to

599
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,600
this, we don't even do this calculation for African-American patients because we've long observed

600
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:49,840
it's not helpful, but in non-African-American patients, the ratio of triglyceride to HDL

601
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,360
cholesterol when both are in milligrams per deciliter is reasonably associated with insulin

602
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,040
resistance. And the higher that ratio, the more insulin resistant they are. And obviously that

603
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,200
ratio is driven up by an increase in triglycerides and a reduction in HDL cholesterol. Why is it that,

604
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,240
I mean, we've spent hours on this podcast talking about why insulin resistance would lead to or be

605
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,440
associated with high triglycerides. We haven't done the opposite or the reverse of that. What is

606
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,640
it about IR that drives down HDL two? I'll just say first though, that one of the other analogies I

607
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:29,600
like to make is that HDL cholesterol, while not causally related to disease, is sort of like an

608
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:38,080
HBA1C for cardiovascular risk factors. It's an integrator of information related to insulin

609
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:45,200
resistance, related to triglycerides, related to inflammation, that in one number, in most people,

610
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:50,080
when it's low, it's telling you something about cardiovascular risk, even though itself it isn't

611
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:55,360
directly impacting on risk. So in answer to your question, I think one of the big issues with HDL

612
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,680
cholesterol is that it's an inverse barometer of triglyceride efficiency of triglyceride

613
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,520
metabolism. And again, we talked about efficiency earlier. You can only learn so much from measuring

614
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,520
a fasting triglyceride after a 12-hour overnight fast. It's useful. It's the way we do it in terms

615
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:21,120
of lipid panels. But a lot happens after a fatty meal, and a lot of that action is basically over

616
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,880
in most people by 12 hours. Some people are extraordinarily effective at clearing their

617
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,800
dietary fat and even their liver-derived fat, like mice. Others are not so effective, but their

618
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,320
fasting triglycerides may not necessarily even reflect that. The HDL cholesterol does reflect

619
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:44,640
that. There's a complex, as we discussed earlier, complex frequent interaction and exchange between

620
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,800
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and HDL, with the net effect being the higher the triglycerides at

621
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,600
any given time, the lower the HDL is as a result of the complex interactions. So if you can picture,

622
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,080
we do a lot of these experiments where we bring in people and we give them a high-fat milkshake.

623
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,000
We draw blood multiple time points after that milkshake, and we measure triglycerides and all

624
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,200
sorts of other things. People differ a lot in their response to that high-fat milkshake challenge.

625
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:18,880
The higher that triglyceride goes, the area under the curve, the lower the HDLs are. That relationship

626
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,800
is extraordinarily strong. So just like HbA1c, that HDL cholesterol is sort of reading out

627
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:32,320
the 24-hour triglyceride metabolism much better than the overnight fasting triglyceride

628
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,680
measurement is. That's sort of why HbA1c is better than fasting glucose. That's the analogy.

629
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,320
First of all, I've never heard that before, and that might be if I learn nothing else on this

630
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,200
podcast, Dan. That is hands down the most amazing thing I have learned, not just today, but I'm

631
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,920
going to go out on a limb and say this week, potentially this month. That is super fascinating.

632
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,760
First of all, people on this podcast have probably heard me gripe over the lack of integral

633
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,360
functions in biology. My background, of course, in math and engineering, we love integrals. As

634
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:10,880
imperfect as the A1c is, as you said, it is an integrator, and it's so hard to find integrators.

635
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,040
Ferritin sort of does it a little bit for iron, but not nearly as well. The holy grail, of course,

636
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,280
would be to find an integral of something like mTOR activity or something like that.

637
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,320
I've never before been presented with or confronted with this. I want to make sure

638
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,640
we all understand this a little bit better. There's a couple of things that you've said there. One is,

639
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,280
if you stick an IV in a person's arm, let's just do that to go easy on them. We're going to just

640
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,560
be able to draw blood continuously or call it every five minutes without poking them. You bring

641
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,960
them into a lab fasted. You measure their HDL cholesterol. You measure their trigs. Let's just

642
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,360
say they show up in the morning fasted. Their trigs are 100 milligrams per deciliter. HDL is

643
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,880
50 milligrams per deciliter. Most people would look at that and say, oh, that's great. Person

644
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:00,080
looks super healthy. You give them a high fat shake, and 30 minutes in, you just start measuring

645
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:05,520
every couple of minutes the concentration of those two things. I think most people somewhat familiar

646
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,560
with metabolism would not be surprised to learn that the triglycerides will go through the roof.

647
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,160
As an aside, anybody who has accidentally done a blood draw with their doctor after eating a meal

648
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,080
when it was supposed to be fasting will be familiar with this. We see this from time to

649
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,800
time when patients make mistakes. They have a big fat breakfast before the blood draw and you get

650
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,760
their trigs back in their 400 or 500 milligrams per deciliter. Highly variable from person to person,

651
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,880
just to be clear. Highly meal dependent as well. Exactly. Very much depends on what the meal is.

652
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,280
In this experiment though, you're specifically giving them something to elicit the biggest

653
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,520
triglyceride response. In the example I gave Dan, let's say triglycerides go 100, 125, 150,

654
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,080
all the way up to 400 before they start to come down. That generates an area. You could integrate

655
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:56,000
that on the curve. Can you give realistic ideas or values for what the HDL cholesterol would do

656
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,400
during that period of time? The HDL cholesterol definitely dips during that time in a way that's

657
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,360
proportional to, roughly proportional to the triglyceride levels, but not anywhere near the

658
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,760
same degree of magnitude. Right. Simply because it's starting lower and you have a constraint

659
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,440
bottom versus no constraint top. Starting lower, but also the dynamics of its turnover are very

660
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:24,640
different. I think the key point here is HDL is not just an integrator sort of acutely over that

661
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:33,120
meal, but chronically in your example, the HDL cholesterol might go from 40 to 38 or 37,

662
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,960
which doesn't sound like a lot after that one meal, but the repeated meals that that individual

663
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,040
is eating that are high fat and that repeated triglyceride excursion has a more chronic effect,

664
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:51,760
a little like glucose and HbA1c that keeps taking the HDL down over time until you get to kind of

665
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,320
a new steady state. So the cute effect on the HDL is real. It's modest. The chronic effect on the HDL

666
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:04,880
of that abnormal postprandial triglyceride metabolism is quite substantial. And that's why

667
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,400
HDL is a good, as you say, integrator of this effect. And actually what you just said, Dan,

668
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,880
is kind of what I was hoping to go to next, which is if everything I said were true, that might not

669
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,400
be enough to explain the full integral function because it probably captures some of what's

670
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,720
happening outside of the meal. Just as hemoglobin A1c doesn't only reflect what would be captured

671
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,240
in an oral glucose tolerance test, it captures what's happening over 90 straight days when you're

672
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,440
eating, when you're not eating. Exactly. And that's also why there's a very strong statistical

673
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:46,000
relationship between fasting triglycerides and the HDL. So the fasting triglycerides themselves

674
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,440
are still affecting HDL metabolism. It's just that the postprandial part is also a key component.

675
01:04:52,400 --> 01:05:00,560
So let's then again, just one more time, sort of reiterate the lagging nature of HDL cholesterol

676
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:08,080
through HDL biology to what's happening with the efficiency of maybe for lack of a better word,

677
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,760
lipid partitioning. The lagging nature, meaning the integrating over time? Yeah, exactly. Let's

678
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,840
use an example. So you've got a person who is exercising. And so you have two people who are

679
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,920
similar except that one is very insulin resistant and one is quite insulin sensitive. The insulin

680
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,160
resistant person is going to have a higher level of insulin. All things equal, they're going to

681
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:39,120
have a more difficult time oxidizing free fatty acid. So as energy demand goes up from the muscle,

682
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,360
they're going to be more likely to utilize glycogen as opposed to utilizing triglyceride.

683
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,240
So at any point in time, you might measure differences in glucose, differences in lactate.

684
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,920
You might, well, you would see lactate as well, but differences in triglyceride level. You might

685
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,800
also notice more fat in the liver or some fat in the liver of the insulin resistant person,

686
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,520
none in the insulin sensitive person. Into that situation, even when they're not eating,

687
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:08,160
they're quite different physiologically. What is the HDL discerning or doing in those two scenarios

688
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:14,320
that's being reflected in the ongoing integral function of it? The simplest, most direct model

689
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,920
is that the HDL is reflecting the 24 hour excursions in triglycerides, like we were just talking about.

690
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:28,480
I think what you may be getting at is there are almost certainly other components of metabolism

691
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,840
that the HDL is integrating and reflecting, particularly in the complex insulin resistance

692
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,640
world. We know insulin resistance has a lot of effects other than affecting triglycerides.

693
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:45,760
And insulin resistance, I'm sure, has effects that are affecting and are reflected by

694
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:52,880
a lowering of HDL. What I can't tell you is exactly what those are. That's an area that is

695
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,080
still a topic of investigation. I will give you one hypothesis though, and one that maybe I think

696
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:04,800
has some merit. As you know, adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by fat that has an inverse

697
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,840
relationship to insulin resistance. So basically people who are insulin resistant have lower levels

698
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,800
and people who are more insulin sensitive. And adiponectin itself appears to have some direct

699
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:22,640
effect on HDL metabolism in the right direction. We could talk about it possibly by tweaking the

700
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,080
liver in ways that then the liver affects HDL. So where I'm really going with this, although I have

701
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:34,320
to say the data still are not completely solid, is that another way that insulin resistance

702
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:42,480
is impacting on HDL is through adiponectin secretion affecting HDL metabolism in a way

703
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,720
that's completely different than the triglyceride hypothesis that I just put forth. You follow me?

704
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,600
Yeah. And it's funny. We used to measure adiponectin and leptin levels.

705
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,040
Again, one of those things I sort of stopped measuring. Do you think that that's a helpful

706
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,560
biomarker independently? And should that be something that's back on our plate?

707
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,800
Absolutely fascinating to try to put together these metabolic pathways

708
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:08,320
in terms of its utility as a clinical marker? I guess I'd have to be a little bit skeptical.

709
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,400
I'm not quite sure how I would use it in terms of guiding clinical care.

710
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,120
I mean, I think that was sort of where we ended up, which was, look, we get more actionable

711
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:24,160
insight out of other metrics. Okay. That was really interesting. And again, before we leave

712
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,640
the pharmacoside of this, can we talk for a moment about niacin? Oh, sure. It's been a while

713
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,240
since niacin came up on a podcast, but this is an interesting drug because it clearly raises HDL

714
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,680
cholesterol and it lowers APOB, doesn't it? It does. It lowers triglycerides. It lowers APOB.

715
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:45,680
It lowers LDL. All modestly, but really. Peter, niacin, I just chuckled because niacin is one

716
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,640
of these areas where we as lipidologists and me personally have to really eat a bit of crow.

717
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:58,160
There was a time when I prescribed niacin to a lot of patients with primarily the idea that it was

718
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:04,080
the only thing we had to raise HDL. This was in an era where HDL is the good cholesterol and raising

719
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:09,680
it must be good, right? I also told myself, well, niacin does lower triglycerides. It lowers APOB.

720
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:15,360
It lowers LDL. It also, as I'm sure you know, modestly lowers LP little a as well.

721
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:21,200
About 15% lowering of it. Yeah, 15, 20%. It basically was like, this is a nice broad spectrum

722
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:26,000
lipid lowering drug that, you know, not in place of, but on top of a statin for certain people who

723
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,520
had certain lipid profiles, mostly high triglycerides, low HDL, it has to be providing some benefit,

724
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,640
even in the absence of, as you pointed out, the clinical trials that really are a cornerstone of

725
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:42,640
cardiovascular medicine. Well, the clinical trials, you know, got done. The high trial, which

726
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,800
was a very well done trial, which frankly just didn't show much benefit of niacin, a blow to us,

727
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,360
but the field comes up with reasons why that trial may not have been right. Bottom line is,

728
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:59,360
one more trial run by Merck with a drug that also helped to potentially address some of the issues

729
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:06,000
with niacin was done. Very large trial, very well powered trial. And that also had really

730
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,560
minimal or very disappointing effects on reducing cardiovascular events. Essentially those two trials

731
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,200
killed niacin. So over the next, you know, year as patients would come back, I would have the

732
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,840
discussions that maybe you've had discussions with patients too like this, you know, that niacin I

733
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,720
put you on, you know, eight years ago that you've been taking religiously despite the question that

734
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,120
it causes when you take it. I really think I have to tell you that I'm not sure you need to take it

735
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:36,800
anymore. And it was a humbling experience to basically have a drug that I had prescribed

736
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,560
quite a lot basically to tell patients that I don't think that in retrospect, this is helping

737
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,760
you much. I do have a subset of patients who are so wedded to their niacin that despite that,

738
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,520
they haven't wanted to stop. But the vast majority of my patients have stopped their niacin.

739
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:56,240
And what's the mechanism by which niacin raised HDL cholesterol?

740
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,040
I think one is certainly triglyceride lowering, like we were talking about earlier,

741
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,680
but probably not just that because the increases in HDL were somewhat disproportionate to what

742
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,600
you'd predict from the triglyceride lowering. Although again, with the complexity, it's a little

743
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,680
hard to make that calculation. So there probably is some other mechanism. And to this day, I don't

744
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,400
think we really understand it. We tried for a while to try to figure that out. Niacin is a

745
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,080
very complex drug. Of course, we're talking about niacin here in pharmacologic dosing,

746
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:34,320
not in the kind of vitamin dosing. We don't really know. I think it's fair to say how niacin raises

747
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,720
HDL beyond its triglyceride lowering effect. It's not a drug we used much, if at all. But

748
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:46,960
the few times we did, I was actually really amazed at how much it raised HDL cholesterol.

749
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,120
I mean, it wasn't uncommon to go from 50 milligrams per deciliter to 90 milligrams per

750
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,440
deciliter on a strong dose. Let's shift gears for a second and talk about something that we briefly

751
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,440
touched on, but I think we now want to go into a little bit more detail. If everything we've

752
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,040
talked about so far is somewhat complicated, I actually think for me at least this next part,

753
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:13,760
especially the RCT stuff, gets complicated. So let's talk about what HDL lipidation,

754
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,600
delipidation, and reverse cholesterol transport are, because this is really where we start to

755
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:25,040
get into some of the sophistication of the HDL and even the interaction with other cells like

756
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,440
macrophages and things like that. I'll start and then you can kind of lead me along because this

757
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:35,920
can get quite complicated. Maybe just to orient you, Dan, why don't we start with, unless you have

758
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,440
a better way to do it, I'm totally open, but if you're looking for a goalpost to start in,

759
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,960
do you want to start with a foam cell stuck in an artery wall or is there a different place

760
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,320
you'd want to start the discussion? That's a good idea. So many of your listeners know that a core

761
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:57,520
concept in atherosclerotic vascular disease is the macrophage that's taken up lipids and is now a

762
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,320
so-called foam cell, meaning it looks foamy under a microscope because it has all this lipid and when

763
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:09,360
you stain tissues, the lipids become like bubbles within the cells and they look foamy. The foam cell

764
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,800
the lipid loaded macrophage is a core pathologic feature of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

765
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,600
It's also the first thing you see. So careful studies that have really looked at vascular

766
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:29,040
tissues in children and teenagers and young adults on the way up, you basically see lipid loaded

767
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,080
macrophages accumulating in the sub-entimal space, in the intimal space in the large vessels,

768
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:40,480
before you start seeing some of the more complex features of infiltration of other leukocytes and

769
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,640
extracellular matrix and all the stuff that ultimately comes to complex atherosclerotic plaque.

770
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,960
There's been a strong belief for a long time that this is one of the core initiators of the process

771
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,400
and I think that's probably true. An analogy would be like with Alzheimer's, the A-beta being kind of

772
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:00,400
the core initiator of the process leading to much more complex pathology. So macrophages have very

773
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:08,160
well-established mechanisms for ridding themselves of cholesterol. Keep in mind, no cell except the

774
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:15,680
liver cell has the ability to metabolize cholesterol to other sterile species. Only the liver can do

775
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:21,280
that. Cells can make plenty of cholesterol but the only way cells can deal with their cholesterol

776
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,120
is to quote efflux the cholesterol, to push the cholesterol out of the cell and get rid of it.

777
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:33,040
So if you think at the whole body level, all of the body is making cholesterol but that cholesterol

778
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,960
ultimately has to come out of those cells into something. This is where HDL comes in and ultimately

779
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,880
get back to the liver where the liver then can metabolize it or directly excrete it into the bile

780
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,680
then it goes out the intestine in the feces. So all cells have to be able to do this and all cells

781
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,560
in fact have the ability to push cholesterol out of their cells but macrophages really have to do

782
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,640
it. That is because macrophages are like kind of the dump truck of the body. They're picking up

783
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,080
not only LDLs and lipoproteins with cholesterol, they're scavenging cells, dead scales,

784
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,360
apoptotic cells and of course all those cells have lots of cholesterol. So macrophages need very,

785
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:18,000
very effective ways to rid themselves of cholesterol and they do have effective ways of doing that.

786
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,280
When those pathways get overcome or less efficient, the macrophage then builds up

787
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,680
cholesterol and becomes the kind of foam cell that we're talking about. Macrophages have

788
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,960
transporters. They have a very abundant amount of this ABCA1 that we talked about earlier.

789
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,960
Earlier we talked about it in the gut and the liver. Now I'm saying that macrophages have ABCA1.

790
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,480
ABCA1 is one of the, not the only, way that macrophages rid themselves of cholesterol.

791
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:51,760
If you recall, the main acceptor of cholesterol via ABCA1 transporting out of a cell is APOA1.

792
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:58,480
This led now quite a long time ago to the general paradigm that macrophage foam cells

793
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,520
are building up cholesterol because they're not getting rid of it effectively and that one of the

794
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,920
best ways to get rid of it would be to promote these efflux pathways via ABCA1 and other

795
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:17,600
transporters that are being driven by APOA1 to HDL, which then by my garbage truck analogy,

796
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,120
the garbage truck, i.e. the HDL, is picking it up in the periphery like the blood vessel

797
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,920
and returning it to the liver, dumping it off in the liver, and then going back and doing its job

798
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:35,280
again. This process of quote efflux, cholesterol efflux from macrophages and frankly other cells,

799
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,520
particularly in the blood vessel wall, has been for a long time now thought of as a key

800
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,920
process that would help to protect against the early initiation and progression of the

801
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,280
atherosclerotic plaque. Peter, that was long, but that's the start.

802
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,280
Well, and I think that's, look, let's just make sure everybody's interested in what we're talking

803
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:01,760
about here, which is when we really talk about the positive valence of HDL as a particle,

804
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:09,120
it's because of this, right? In large part, this is a big piece of the positive association,

805
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,360
presumably, or negative association, depending on the direction of HDL. We might see,

806
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,440
as we've been talking about it, it really now speaks to function. Part of the problem it would

807
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:28,560
appear is that very crude metrics like the amount of cholesterol in an HDL or even the number of HDL

808
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,080
particles or the size of an HDL particle, those are basically the only things we can measure,

809
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:41,920
clinically at least, those are so crude and so far removed from providing any quantification

810
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:48,400
of the process you just described that I suspect in part, that's why we are stuck in a way that

811
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:56,400
we are not on the ApoB side of the ledger because so much of the damage caused by ApoB is simply

812
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,280
captured in the number of them, given the stochastic nature with which they enter artery walls and get

813
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,520
retained. Would you agree with that assessment? I would absolutely agree with that. So this process

814
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:12,160
of cholesterol reflux, as the ideas evolved, is, if you will, the first step in this broader

815
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,960
physiologic process that Peter briefly referred to that we call reverse cholesterol transport,

816
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:23,200
or RCT, different than a randomized control trial. If forward cholesterol transport is basically the

817
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,800
cholesterol coming out of the liver into VLDL and LDL and then depositing in tissues like the

818
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:35,360
artery, the reverse transport is the picking up of the cholesterol, putatively via ApoA1 and HDL,

819
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:42,720
and returning it back to the liver. This process of reverse cholesterol transport, plausibly,

820
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:48,240
and I think some data, at least in animal models, is related to protection against atherosclerosis.

821
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:53,520
That is, the more effective you are at the integrated process of not only picking up the

822
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,120
cholesterol via efflux, but effectively returning the cholesterol to the liver for excretion,

823
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:05,760
the more you would protect against atherosclerosis, as the theory goes. I'll just remind you about our

824
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,200
example with SRB1. That's the terminal, sort of one of the terminal steps where the HDL is dumping

825
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:17,280
off the cholesterol. If you interrupt that process, your HDL goes up, but the process of

826
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,600
reverse cholesterol transport is being constipated, and therefore there's increased risk of atherosclerotic

827
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,840
cardiovascular disease. One of the great goals of the field has been, can we promote that first

828
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,880
step of the process? Can we figure out a way to promote the driving of the efflux process

829
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:42,720
from the macrophages and maybe other cells in the atherosclerotic plaque to acceptors like HDL

830
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:50,240
in order to protect or maybe even regress atherosclerotic plaque, shrink it, as a way of

831
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:55,600
trying to reduce risk? I'll just say that as we move into this next phase of complexity,

832
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:01,840
I think what's pretty clear is it's not the mature HDL particle. When we measure HDL cholesterol,

833
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,960
that's what we're measuring, is the cholesterol in the mature particle. That's almost certainly

834
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:12,640
not the particle that is driving this first step of the efflux of the cholesterol from the foam

835
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:19,920
cell and the macrophage. That's maybe why simplistically raising HDL cholesterol, like with

836
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:26,240
CTP inhibition, doesn't actually reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.

837
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:32,400
But are there other ways more creatively that we might be able to drive that process? Also,

838
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,160
to Peter's earlier functional point, might it be that different people, even with identical HDL

839
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:44,560
cholesterol levels, have different function of their HDL? One person with an HDL cholesterol of 50

840
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:50,480
might have something about their HDL pathway that is super functional at driving efflux,

841
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,320
whereas another person with the same HDL cholesterol doesn't do nearly as well. If we

842
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,480
could measure function efficiently, might we have a better way of assessing risk and maybe

843
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:09,200
even targeting interesting therapies more so than just measuring this fairly not so dynamic measure

844
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,040
of HDL cholesterol itself? There's more to say there, Peter, but I'll turn it back over to you.

845
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,760
Well, no, I mean, I think you illustrate the very important distinction between static biomarkers

846
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:23,200
and dynamic biomarkers. We have very few dynamic biomarkers, an OGTT and old glucose tolerance,

847
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:31,120
dynamic biomarker in a sense, but most things are very static and static things allow us to miss

848
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:37,440
flux. So that example you gave of two people whose HDL cholesterol is both 50 milligrams per

849
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:44,800
deciliter. We have no clue what the velocity through the HDL is. In one of those cases,

850
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,560
it could be a bump on a log and the HDL is not really doing a heck of a lot. And in the other,

851
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,080
that could be the busiest beaver on the face of the earth, just transporting lipid

852
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:58,240
out of foam cells right back to the liver back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And

853
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,880
that could be the most industrious little guy on the block. And you could be in a totally different

854
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,920
risk situation as a result of that. So going back to the RCT, how often is it happening

855
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:15,760
that an ApoB, white-bearing lipoprotein, let's just call it an LDL, is floating around, so not

856
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:22,000
yet in artery wall, but on his way there, presumably. And an HDL come along and they collide

857
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,520
in the artery itself and delipidation takes place. So the HDL says, hey, I'm going to take some of

858
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,480
your cholesterol away and take it back to the liver now, which by the way, LDLs do as well. I

859
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,320
mean, LDLs are obviously carrying cholesterol back to the liver. But not as a reverse cholesterol

860
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:41,040
transport process, but yeah. The scenario I described, does that occur often? No, I don't

861
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:47,600
think so. In fact, as we discussed earlier with CTP, the directional flux of cholesterol in the

862
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,920
blood is more from HDL to ApoB containing lipoproteins rather than the other way around.

863
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,720
So I'm pretty comfortable in saying, I don't think that what you just outlined is a way that HDL,

864
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,440
HDL doesn't directly delipid, ideal. No, no, I think it's more about if it's happening at all.

865
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,160
I want to say all this is couched in, this is the paradigm that we're dealing with,

866
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,120
but where there's still a lot of uncertainty about it. But if it's happening at all,

867
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:16,640
it's really more that something about HDL or something, ApoA1, is more interacting with cells

868
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:22,000
to promote efflux of cholesterol rather than with other lipoproteins like ApoB containing lipoproteins.

869
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:28,240
What do you think the future could look like here in terms of commercial assays to measure

870
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:31,760
HDL function? I know that we're a long way away from that, so maybe I should start with something

871
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:38,720
even more basic, which is, what would it take in the lab to measure HDL functionality

872
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,760
if resources were unconstrained? No, that's where I wanted to go. So first, I want to say that

873
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,320
several years ago with this concept of reverse cholesterol transport as a dynamic process,

874
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:55,680
we developed an assay in mice that simply speaking involved taking cholesterol loaded macrophages

875
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:01,280
with labeled cholesterol, injecting them into the mice, and then following that label all the way

876
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:07,840
through the HDL to the liver to the gut to the feces. And we called that integrated reverse

877
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:13,600
cholesterol transport. And we showed in a variety of different genetic and pharmacologic approaches

878
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:18,960
that when you tweak that process either up or down, it mirrored the effect of that process on

879
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,280
atherosclerosis. What I'm really trying to say is something that promoted that process and made it

880
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:28,720
more efficient also reduced atherosclerosis, something that constipated that process,

881
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,640
increased atherosclerosis. It gave us a lot of confidence, frankly, it gave the field a lot of

882
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,640
confidence that integrated measure of reverse cholesterol transport is actually relevant to

883
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:44,240
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, at least in mice. So that brings me to humans. We can't do

884
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:49,200
the type of experiment I just described in humans. It's not feasible as a research or as a clinical

885
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:55,760
assay. So we thought long and hard about how can we start to think about doing this in people and

886
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:02,000
developed what I'll call an ex vivo cholesterol reflux assay, where the concept is we took

887
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,680
someone's blood or plasma, we isolated the HDL specifically, we got rid of the ApoB-contained

888
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:13,840
lipoproteins, and then put that on cells that were labeled with cholesterol and we measured the

889
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,920
effectiveness by which that HDL removed cholesterol from cells. What kind of cells did? And what we

890
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:26,720
found, as I think you know, is we were really struck with how different individuals HDLs were

891
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:32,080
at their ability to extract cholesterol from cells, even with the same HDL cholesterol level.

892
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:38,800
And it sort of affirmed this concept that HDL cholesterol is not really telling us or informing

893
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,760
us on the efficiency of the function of HDL, at least in this case, the function defined as the

894
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:49,440
ability to extract cholesterol from cells. And so we went on to use that in larger numbers of

895
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:56,400
individuals and showed that actually that was much more predictive of risk of coronary heart disease

896
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,360
than just measuring HDL cholesterol, even when you controlled for HDL cholesterol statistically.

897
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:06,640
And many others have shown the same thing. So I think it's pretty well established at this point

898
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:13,520
that this so-called cholesterol reflux capacity measurement of HDL is a better marker or predictor

899
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:19,280
of risk than just measuring HDL cholesterol, consistent with the idea that function is

900
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:25,120
important and that perhaps if we could increase function, we could maybe have a mechanism for

901
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,680
reducing risk. Now, Peter, you asked about the clinical apoligibility of that assay. You know,

902
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:35,920
I get asked all the time by patients and referring doctors, can you measure my patient's HDL function?

903
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:41,120
There's a lot of effort in this regard. Full disclosure, I was part of starting a little

904
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:45,600
company now several years ago called Vassar Strategies. And Vassar Strategies does do

905
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:52,960
this measurement in a very reproducible sort of way, mostly related to biomedical biopharma research.

906
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,120
But there is a lot of interest in trying to bring this clinically. And there are other

907
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,880
assays that are being developed. You know, when you're using radioactivity, it's a little,

908
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,760
you know, it's cumbersome for a high throughput clinical assay. And others are developing assays

909
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:11,920
that are cleaner and simpler and faster and cheaper. I think there's a chance we could have

910
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:17,760
a more widely available clinical assay to us for this purpose within the next, say, two to three

911
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,160
years. Right now, it's still under development. Two follow up questions there, Dan. One is just

912
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:28,800
a technical question on the assay. What type of cell are you using to measure the efflux capacity?

913
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,800
Well, when we first sort of pioneered this work, we used a mouse macrophage cell line

914
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,600
called the J774 cell. We have done it with human macrophages as well, and so have others. We like

915
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,320
to think that the macrophage is the most relevant cell type for reasons we discussed. Yeah, that's

916
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,560
the answer. And then I guess the second question is using the hypothetical, but probably somewhat

917
01:27:52,560 --> 01:28:00,000
real example of we'll take 100 people that have an HDL cholesterol that's about the same. We do this

918
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,920
assay and we rank order them in effectiveness. You're saying that that rank order of effectiveness

919
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:13,200
correlates directly to risk. Are you saying directly related to risk by proxy, i.e. other

920
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:18,480
measurements like insulin resistance, ApoB, or are you saying actual outcomes? The first study we did

921
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,280
and published was cross-sectional with clinical coronary disease. So basically it was calcium

922
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:29,040
scores or things like that. An association cross-sectionally with prevalent disease. Then we basically said

923
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:35,200
we need to know if this is predictive of incident disease, events that occur. So we went to colleagues

924
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:39,840
who did the Eric Norfolk study, which you're probably familiar with, a very large prospective

925
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,760
study in the UK, in Europe. They provided samples and we measured this in a very large number, many

926
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,680
thousands of samples in a baseline in people who had been followed for 10 plus years. And we showed

927
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:57,120
even in that setting that the efflux capacity was predictive of incident cardiovascular events. So

928
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,000
yes, these are hard events, not just proxies like measurement of coronary calcium, for example.

929
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:09,840
Which is, again, fascinating. How well does that prediction hold up if you corrected for other

930
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,840
things that could be measured in the blood, such as insulin resistance, triglyceride, or ApoB?

931
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:21,040
We did do these statistical analyses correcting for clinical risk factors, including, of course,

932
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:27,760
HGL cholesterol itself. We corrected for things like BMI and presence of diabetes, dichotomous

933
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:33,200
presence of diabetes. If memory serves, we didn't attempt to correct for a sophisticated marker of

934
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,120
insulin resistance, like HOMA or anything, because I'm not sure we even had that data.

935
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:42,400
So your point is well taken. At some point, is this causal or is it still associative,

936
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,320
but just even better associative because it correlates with things even better than HGL

937
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,560
cholesterol? And I think that's why we need, of course, interventional studies that actually test

938
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,720
the hypothesis. Well, or even could we use it, there could be a hybrid there, right? Which is,

939
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:03,360
it's absolutely causal, but because it's so difficult and complex to initiate at scale,

940
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:15,200
what if we use AI to figure out that it's equivalent to a new metric that is a composite

941
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,760
metric of things that we can measure as biomarkers, if that makes sense. I hear what you're saying,

942
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,280
and that would be a great thing to think about. In our paper in Epic Northfolk, we did correlations

943
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,880
of the efflux capacity with lots of different things. Frankly, I have to go back and look at

944
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,040
that and remind myself if we had like fasting insulin or anything, because I think that starts

945
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:38,320
to get more at the insulin resistance component. But you're absolutely right. We may be able to find

946
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,480
markers that in composite would predict efflux capacity rather than having to measure the efflux

947
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:48,960
capacity itself. I'm not convinced we'll be able to do that, but I think that it's a good thought.

948
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:57,760
The analogy that comes to mind is certain labs use a series of NMR metrics to predict insulin

949
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,600
resistance, which I've always found not that interesting, frankly, because we can measure

950
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:07,040
insulin resistance so easily that using NMR to add another insulin resistance metric,

951
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:13,680
it seems a bit backwards. But the idea was they were able to basically look at the NMR spectra of

952
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:19,840
all the lipoproteins and impute a composite metric that came back. So if you could do that

953
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,920
in the other direction, which would actually be the valuable direction, it could be amazing. In

954
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:31,120
other words, if there was an HDL function score built out of X, Y, and Z, anything else before

955
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:36,160
we leave the topic of kind of measurement, we haven't really talked about the NMR side of the

956
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:41,680
equation. That's probably a bias because we don't use NMR, but clearly there are labs out there that

957
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:47,520
will count the number of HDL particles and spit out an HDL P. Anything you want to say about HDL P

958
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:54,480
or anything like that? Yeah, the overall number of particles is obviously correlated with HDL

959
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,800
cholesterol, but is a different measure because HDL cholesterol is just that amount of cholesterol

960
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,600
carried in the HDL, whereas the particles are more analogous to sort of measuring APO B,

961
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,360
the meaning total particle number. I think the data on balance suggests that HDL particle number

962
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:16,480
is a little bit better than HDL cholesterol at predicting risk. We haven't formally compared

963
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:22,080
HDL particle to cholesterol efflux capacity, the functional measurement. Fundamentally,

964
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:27,680
it's another static measure though. And so while it has maybe some limited predictive value,

965
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:32,880
I don't think it takes us that much further in terms of trying to get at where we're really

966
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,000
trying to go, is better predictions of risk, particularly in a setting where we might want to

967
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,880
intervene to actually try to reduce risk. Let's talk about something you mentioned

968
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,080
kind of in passing a couple of times. Peter, before we leave this topic though,

969
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:52,560
I do think it's important to remind your listeners that this concept of promoting the efflux and

970
01:32:52,560 --> 01:33:00,720
reverse cholesterol transport pathway is being tested with another intervention called CSL112.

971
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:06,400
It's a form of APOA1 that's been complexed with lipids in a so-called recombinant HDL particle

972
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:12,480
is being tested for impact on cardiovascular outcomes in the setting of acute coronary

973
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:20,240
syndromes. So people have come in, been randomized to four weekly injections of this APOA1 containing

974
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:26,320
recombinant particle, which is very effective at promoting cholesterol efflux based on all the work

975
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:32,080
that's been done, with the idea being that this may directly impact the plaque and impact on

976
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:41,040
cardiovascular events. So this is, I would say, the closest thing we have to a formal test of the

977
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:47,040
cholesterol efflux hypothesis as an intervention in terms of whether it will reduce risk. Those of

978
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:53,200
us in the field are on the edges of our seats, it'll be a little while to really see what this

979
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:59,360
trial shows. I do think it's going to be interesting either way. So earlier, Dan, you mentioned kind of

980
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:05,360
briefly the association of plasma APOA1 and HDL cholesterol with neurodegenerative diseases,

981
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,840
such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I don't know if it extends to Parkinson's or Lewy body.

982
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,360
What do we know about that? Well, this is, I think, a fascinating new area of HDL biology

983
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:20,320
that has a number of components and that's still being investigated. I want to maybe

984
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,960
start by bringing in APOE. We haven't talked about APOE. APOE clearly has a role in APOE

985
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,720
containing lipoprotein metabolism and mediating the uptake of those remnant particles into the

986
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:37,840
liver. Can you actually explain this a bit more because most people hearing this are going to

987
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:44,160
think of APOE the gene and of course the gene for APOE people are going to be familiar with. It

988
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:49,520
exists in three isoforms, two, three, and four, but of course these things combined. So you have

989
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:56,400
six combinations of an APOE genotype and of course the gene codes for a protein. So I mean, I assume

990
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,880
everybody has the same APOE protein. You're going to have different amounts of it and different

991
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,640
potentially functionality depending on the combination of which gene produced it.

992
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:11,520
Exactly. APOE is possibly one of the most fascinating genes and proteins in human biology

993
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:17,680
in terms of its roles and the isoform issue and its relationship to disease. So as you point out,

994
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:22,880
there are three common isoforms of APOE, APOE3 being the so-called wild type or the most common.

995
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:30,640
You know, in lipidology we focused a lot on APOE2 because if you inherited two copies of APOE2,

996
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:38,560
that form of APOE is defective in binding to the LDL receptor and the other receptors that mediate

997
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,560
uptake of remnant lipoproteins, both chylomicron remnants and BLDL remnants. And therefore, if you

998
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:52,560
homozygous for APOE2, you're at risk for so-called, again, the terminology is bad, type 3 hyperlipidemia.

999
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,080
Which is basically a remnant clearance disorder. These individuals can't clear their remnants

1000
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,400
appropriately. They get high triglycerides and cholesterol. They also are at increased risk of

1001
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,920
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It's a classic lipidology thing.

1002
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,880
And these patients require Fena fibrates to bring down the LDL and triglyceride?

1003
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,600
They respond to a lot of the standard LDL lowering therapies like statin and azetamide. They even

1004
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:22,480
respond to PCS-G9 inhibition. But sometimes we have to add on fibrates as well to maximally

1005
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:27,440
control them. Depends on how severe they are. And yet those people, and by the way, that's the only

1006
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:35,360
genotype I've never seen. It's much more rare than the 4-4 homozygotes. But the 2-2 would come with

1007
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:40,240
about a 20% risk reduction, relative risk reduction in Alzheimer's disease. But paradoxically comes at

1008
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:46,800
this higher risk of ASCVD. Exactly. So comes at higher risk of lipid disorder in ASCVD. But that's

1009
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,760
exactly why I brought up APOE in response to your comment about neurodegenerative disease.

1010
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:58,000
So as probably a lot of people know who are listening, the APOE4, as you just pointed out,

1011
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,080
the APOE4 form, which is present in about 25% of people. So it's quite common. And even in the

1012
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:10,240
homozygous form, certainly plenty of people out there who have both two copies, is in a dose

1013
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:16,800
dependent way the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. No question about it. And as

1014
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:23,200
you said, Peter, APOE2, which is bad for your lipids in the blood, is actually protective against

1015
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:30,320
Alzheimer's. It's absolutely fascinating biologically. There has been so much work to try to understand

1016
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:38,000
how APOE is interfacing with Alzheimer's disease. So APOE is made in the brain. It's made by cell

1017
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,680
types like microglia in the brain. And it's a lipid binding protein that transports lipids.

1018
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,760
And now we know from genetics of Alzheimer's that there are lots of other lipid genes that are

1019
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,760
related to Alzheimer's. So the story starts with the fact that APOE made in the brain is somehow

1020
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:59,040
impacting on Alzheimer's risk. And if you have this form of APOE4, and especially if you have

1021
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,040
two forms of APOE4, you are at very substantially increased risk of Alzheimer's for reasons that

1022
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,320
we still don't fully understand. But as a lipidologist, I think it has something to do with

1023
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:16,160
lipid transport in the brain. So that brings me to HDL. The APOE in the CSF and in the brain

1024
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,800
is mostly made there. The newer developments that are relevant to APOE1 and HDL are that

1025
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:32,320
there is clearly APOE1 in the brain and in the CSF. APOE1 is not made in the brain. So APOE1

1026
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,400
gets there somehow through the blood, which I'll come back to. But there's now quite a lot of

1027
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:46,000
observational data that strongly suggests that APOE1 is protective against neurodegenerative

1028
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,320
disease. Now this is associative data. It doesn't prove causality. But the reason I think it's

1029
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,880
plausible is that two of the major genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's that are expressed in the

1030
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:07,520
brain are ABCA1. Remember that lipid transporter, that rid cells of cholesterol, and that APOE1

1031
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:16,400
interacts with and promotes? And ABCA7, a very close relative of ABCA1 that structurally looks

1032
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:22,000
very similar and that we don't know exactly what it does, but I think it's a safe bet that it's

1033
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,480
transporting some sort of lipid to something in the extracellular space, whether that's APOE1 or APOE

1034
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:36,720
or something else. So the plausibility of APOE1 being protective against neurodegenerative disease,

1035
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:42,480
particularly Alzheimer's, is quite high. And frankly, there's a lot of work to be done to try

1036
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:48,400
to figure it out. There's one other point I'll make, which is the blood levels of APOE1 and the

1037
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:53,040
CSF levels of APOE1 and the relatively small number of studies that have measured both in the

1038
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:59,520
same people are not that well correlated. So it's not simply a matter of if you have a high level

1039
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:05,440
of APOE1 in the blood, that's going to generate a high level of APOE1 in the CSF. So what that

1040
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:12,480
probably means is the processes that are happening that get the APOE1 across the blood-brain barrier

1041
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:18,640
are highly regulated processes that, a little like the cholesterol efflux story, probably differ from

1042
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:22,560
person to person and aren't directly being driven by the level of APOE1 in the blood.

1043
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,640
Where I'm really going with this is this concept that if we could figure out how that happened,

1044
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:33,120
if we could somehow promote more APOE1 going into the brain, into the CSF,

1045
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,920
the data suggests that that might be a very interesting opportunity to blunt or reduce

1046
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:47,520
risk of Alzheimer's. I find it fascinating, as you can tell. Dan, do we know if this relationship is

1047
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:55,040
stronger or weaker as a function of APOE genotype? Is the effect more pronounced? Do we have enough

1048
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,280
data to parse out that type of relationship? So I'll give you an example. Yeah, that's a really

1049
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:05,440
super question. And I don't think we have big enough data sets yet to be able to parse it out

1050
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,160
in terms of by APOE genotype to figure that out. But I have to go back and look for that, but I

1051
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:17,200
don't think we know that yet. Do you have any idea why labs have not developed what would be very easy

1052
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:22,320
to do, which is just a commercial assay for APOE concentration? There's certainly some data to

1053
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:29,040
suggest that APOE concentration might be more relevant than APOE genotype, although of course

1054
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:33,600
it's highly influenced by APOE genotype. But you could almost think of it as a gene expression

1055
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,240
measurement, a crude measurement of gene expression for APOE. Is that something that you've seen or

1056
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,960
used even in the lab? You're talking about APOE in the blood, right? Yes. Not in the CSF, just to be

1057
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:50,960
clear. There are automated assays for APOE. We run one routinely in our lab. I think it's not a

1058
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,320
clinically used assay. No, I've never even seen a CLIA-based assay for it. Right. I think mostly

1059
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:01,120
because it isn't that helpful in the limited studies that have been done, which admittedly

1060
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,920
maybe aren't as voluminous as they should be. It isn't that really helpful in terms of predicting

1061
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,720
cardiovascular risk. Total plasma APOE. Oh, I was thinking more for neurodegenerative disease.

1062
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:17,680
Has that been looked at? Oh, well, I didn't say it, but the levels of APOE in the CSF and the

1063
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:22,400
levels of APOE in the blood for the few studies that have measured both in the same people also

1064
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:27,600
do not correlate much at all. You would need CSF APOE if you wanted to do anything with this.

1065
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:32,160
Exactly. That's what I'm getting at. You would need to be able to do it. I would not be surprised if

1066
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:37,760
someone develops an assay for APOE concentration in the CSF as a clinical tool, because there I

1067
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:46,640
think that might be highly relevant. Interesting. So here we have basically HDL potentially being

1068
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:56,640
protective in the brain and presumably doing so via APOE1 potentially offsetting some of the APOE

1069
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:02,240
problem, APOE being, as I think one of our previous guests referred to as kind of the

1070
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:08,480
general contractor of cholesterol in the brain. Does HDL do anything with nitric oxide? I think

1071
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:13,920
I remember reading something about promoting sort of endothelial NOS activity, nitric oxide

1072
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,080
synthase activity. Is that a major issue? There's been a variety of other quote functions that HDL

1073
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:24,240
has been reported to do, which I think are absolutely real. Their relevance to human

1074
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:29,040
disease and pathophysiology I think are less clear. But one example is what you just said. So

1075
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:35,280
a couple of investigators, most notably Phil Schall and Dallas has shown very clearly and

1076
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:42,320
beautifully in cells and mice that HDL can promote nitric oxide production in a way that would be

1077
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:46,240
expected to be beneficial, both in terms of blood pressure lowering and maybe protection

1078
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:51,520
against atherosclerosis. And that SOB1, the receptor we've been talking about, is also

1079
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,280
present on endothelial cells and mediates at least part of that effect of HDL. It's a fascinating

1080
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:03,520
observation that is absolutely, I think, solid. Translating that observation to relevance in

1081
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,920
humans I think is challenging, but I think plausible. Another, we've been talking about

1082
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,600
insulin resistance. I'm sure you're aware of the data that suggests that HDL can interact

1083
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,800
directly with skeletal muscle in a way that promotes insulin sensitivity. No, I'm not.

1084
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:25,280
Fascinating work. Again, I put it in the same category of solid in terms of what it's been

1085
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:30,720
able to show. Mechanistically, a little bit unclear and relevance to human disease and

1086
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:36,320
physiology I think is still a little bit unclear. These are just two of the other types of things

1087
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:41,440
that HDL has been shown to do that would be putatively beneficial but are of uncertain

1088
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:48,640
relevance to real human disease. It's even more sort of removed than that because even if we knew

1089
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:56,080
mechanistically that this were sound, we're still back in the same area we are with ASCVD. In ASCVD,

1090
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:02,080
there's really very little ambiguity about the utility of HDL, the beneficial utility of HDL.

1091
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:08,800
Yet we're standing here with our hands in front of us saying, well, what can we do about it

1092
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:16,480
clinically as a physician, as a patient? What do I get to do about this knowledge that HDLs

1093
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:23,200
are helpful particles when I can't measure the manner in which they do their job? The only

1094
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:29,760
things that I can measure are as useless to me as my eye color basically. Then we're expanding into

1095
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,360
and look what they can do in muscles and look what they can do in insulin sensitivity and look

1096
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,280
what they can potentially do in the brain. It really comes back full circle to how we open

1097
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:44,960
the discussion, Dan, which is this is such a complicated area of biology that I would guess

1098
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,560
it has to be considered the next frontier of the lipid space. When we take a step back and put

1099
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,760
ASCVD in the context of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, so these are the big three

1100
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:02,240
killers in the modern world. We know so much more about ASCVD and we have so many more tools to

1101
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:06,320
effectively treat it. We know a bit about these other diseases, but in the case of Alzheimer's,

1102
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:10,960
we don't have a single tool to do anything about it. In the case of cancer, most of our tools do

1103
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:16,480
nothing. 90% of the tools do nothing, i.e. they barely extend median survival but don't cure

1104
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:22,240
people. But in ASCVD, we can really move the needle. Yet you could argue half of the field,

1105
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:28,000
we still know nothing about. Is there going to be a renaissance, you think, or are we up against

1106
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
some technical limitation on this inability to measure function? I say that in a practical way.

1107
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,480
I mean, yes, I think you're already measuring function in the lab, but is this a bridge too

1108
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,800
far for the clinician? Well, I'm going to separate that into using a measurement of function for risk

1109
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:51,200
prediction and then the implications for intervening therapeutically. I think that HDL

1110
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:58,480
function, say, cholesterol efflux, has the ability to allow us to more specifically assign risk

1111
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:05,600
better than just measuring HDL cholesterol. I think realistically we need a good reproducible,

1112
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:13,760
easy to run, automatable assay that then is tested in large numbers of people and shown to predict

1113
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:19,440
risk better than HDL cholesterol itself. I feel like knowing what I know is going on in terms of

1114
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:24,640
developing those assays, that there's a decent chance that we're going to get there. But it's

1115
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:28,320
not just the development of the assay, which actually there are several assays now that are,

1116
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:34,560
but it's the proving that the measurement actually enhances risk prediction enough,

1117
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:39,040
not just incrementally, but enough to make it actually worth doing in clinical practice.

1118
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:44,400
I think there's a, I'm not going to say 100%, but I think there's a more than 50% chance

1119
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:49,280
that we're going to see at least some assay come out that will allow us to do that. And then it

1120
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:55,440
will be, frankly, physicians like yourself and like Tom Dayspring who pick up that assay and

1121
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:59,920
start using it in their patients and start trying to get a sense for whether it's useful in the

1122
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,840
context of a sophisticated preventive clinical practice. I think with regard to intervention,

1123
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,960
the study I talked about is huge in terms of this. Let's just assume that that study is

1124
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:17,680
positive. Four infusions, weekly infusions, significantly reduces cardiovascular events

1125
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:23,040
in patients with ACS after 90 days. If that study is positive, if you think about that,

1126
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:30,080
the implications for that product, but more importantly for the field that showing that

1127
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:36,720
actually triggering cholesterol efflux via infusion of that particle, that type of particle,

1128
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,920
that will rejuvenate the field of cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport as a

1129
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:48,080
therapeutic target for intervention. I think if that trial is not positive, I think the concept

1130
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:55,680
of intervening around HDL and reverse cholesterol transport for purposes of ASCVD is probably past

1131
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,360
recovery. That would be my view. And even that CTP inhibitor that I mentioned that's still in

1132
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:06,480
development, it's really more about reducing APLB than it is about raising HDL. When does that trial

1133
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:12,080
read out, the function trial? I should have refreshed my memory on that. I just can't remember.

1134
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:18,080
Where is it being done? How many centers? Roughly. It's a global study. There are centers in US and

1135
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:23,360
Australia and Europe. It's a classic global large cardiovascular outcome trial. I think the leaders

1136
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:28,080
of the trial I think are in Boston. Remind me, does it have a fancy acronym yet? Yes. And I'm

1137
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:33,120
embarrassed to say that I'm not quite coming up with that either. We will figure that out and it

1138
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:37,680
will be in the show notes. If I could just follow up on your next frontier comment. I don't think

1139
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:43,520
HDL per se is the next frontier, but I do think lipid metabolism in the brain is one of the next

1140
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:50,320
frontiers. I really do. With regard to neurodegenerative disease, but also other brain function, I say that

1141
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:56,480
as a long-term lipidologist who is focused primarily on the blood. So I admit my biases

1142
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:01,440
and looking for things that we can apply as lipidologists our expertise to. But I do think

1143
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,680
understanding lipid metabolism in the brain and its relationship to disease, the brain is of course

1144
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:14,480
the most lipid rich organ of any organ in the body, has been an under investigated area that we have

1145
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:19,360
a lot to do. But where I think we're going to be uncovering some very interesting things that

1146
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:24,560
with luck have implications for therapeutic intervention to prevent neurodegenerative disease.

1147
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:30,800
Dan, it's hard to go anywhere from here. That is, I mean, both exciting and important in ways that

1148
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:36,560
are rarely captured even in the subject matter. So I want to thank you for taking a subject matter

1149
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:42,640
that is so complicated that I've largely shied away from really doing anything on it in the AMA

1150
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:48,080
series that we do and so eloquently describing it and really using if someone's listening to this

1151
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:51,120
and this is the first podcast they've ever listened to of ours, they might think, oh my god,

1152
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:55,680
that podcast is too technical. But I think for regular listeners, they will appreciate that

1153
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:01,120
you really did a great job simplifying a very complicated subject matter and certainly did a

1154
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,200
better job than I would have ever been able to do, not simply because I don't know as much,

1155
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,680
but because the ease with which you were able to speak about this is impressive. So

1156
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,640
thank you for taking the time. Thank you for doing that. And most importantly, of course,

1157
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,560
thank you for your work in this field. We, I think collectively, look forward to seeing how

1158
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:20,640
things shake out over the next decade. Thanks very much, Peter. I really enjoyed it.

1159
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:24,720
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:28,880
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring

1161
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:34,000
you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

1163
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:44,080
benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that

1164
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:49,600
detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is

1165
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:55,200
nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes hearing

1166
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:01,120
these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything

1167
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:06,240
without having to listen to spiel's like this. The qualities, which are a super short podcast

1168
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:10,320
that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics and

1169
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,880
tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1170
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,800
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1171
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:24,800
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

1172
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,960
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you
