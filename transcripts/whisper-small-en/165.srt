00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello Peter.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey Bob.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How's it going?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's going well man.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ready for an AMA?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ready as always.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright, so in this case we got great questions about glucose.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we aggregated a bunch. I think it would be good to do a deep dive.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to go through a couple of questions here and see what you think.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So the first question is more of a statement than a question.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've heard Peter talk about how fasting glucose and even HPA1C measurements can often be misleading.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And how he favors OGTT, which is short for Original Gangster Time Trial.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, perfect. I think it might be oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And also wearing a CGM to get a better sense of glucose homeostasis.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My understanding is that OGTTs and CGM's are typically reserved for people with diabetes.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So he's got the following questions.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why does Peter find these tests useful in quote unquote healthy people?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What is Peter looking for when assessing someone's glucose levels?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What does he like and hate to see?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How does Peter define normal versus abnormal control of glucose?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If I'm not diabetic, do I have anything to worry about here?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And there's another question that was, are you able to do a breakdown of what you look for on different people's CGM data?

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And what you would advise to improve their numbers?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Similar to the AMA you did on lab tests.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, so I'm going to pause you right there Bob.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I want you to just answer this question for me honestly.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you pay this person to ask these questions?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Asking for a friend.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I mean, seriously, like these are the perfect questions, the most salient questions, the most important questions.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And this might become by extension then one of the most important AMAs we do in terms of the aggregate impact it could have on health and longevity.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because these questions really get at the root of where I think, I hate to use this term, but for lack of a better word, where the mainstream medical system is just so out of sync with what I believe the future of medicine is going to be.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So let's take a step back on all of this for a second.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Type 2 diabetes has a definition and it is defined as having a hemoglobin A1C concentration greater than 6.5%.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And that corresponds to an average blood glucose, God, I should know this, but the fact that I pay so little attention to it tells you why I don't even know it.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I believe it corresponds to an average blood glucose of approximately 130 milligrams per deciliter.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And of course, the way it works is it measures the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So it's taking out red blood cells and it's looking at how much glucose is stuck to them.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And obviously the more glucose that is stuck to them, the more you can infer that the average concentration of glucose is higher during the period of a red blood cells life.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But of course, this is potentially misleading because if a red blood cell has a very short life, for example, I see this in a couple of my patients, including a patient who's recovering from prostate cancer who still has some GI bleeding issues, but it's not.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's patients with gastritis, et cetera, but women with a heavy menstrual period.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So people who are losing significant amounts of blood have a higher turnover red blood cells.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They're going to have an artificially low hemoglobin A1C.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Conversely, people who have red blood cells that stick around a very long time, people with a microcytic pattern, meaning they have very small red blood cells that are less likely to get chewed up in the splenic system,

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
which is where we ultimately kind of break down red blood cells.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They're going to have an artificially elevated hemoglobin A1C because their red blood cells are living longer on average than the typical person, which is about 90 days.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So that's one reason why I'm not a huge fan of hemoglobin A1C.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But the broader point here is that I find it unhelpful to simply say if your hemoglobin A1C is above 6.5 and you have type 2 diabetes, you have quote unquote a disease.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If it is below 6.5, you are normal.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Or even if we go one step further and say, well, there's a pre-diabetes, which is defined as 5.7 to 6.4.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And those people we have to watch out for, but anybody at 5.6 and down is completely normal, as though there's some enormous difference between 5.6 and 5.7 or 6.4 and 6.5.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So while on the one hand I understand the need to simplify things, I think oversimplification is erroneous, and I think we should view these as a continuum.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So glucose at the average level is a continuum.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And as the person who asked the question noted, I am a far greater proponent of CGM.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now, Bob, I don't know if you're wondering what this thing on my arm is, but in case you are, this is a CGM. This is a continuous glucose monitor.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And as its name suggests, it measures glucose continuously.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And while I do not have diabetes, and while most of my patients don't have diabetes, many of them, along with I, wear this device.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I think what we'll get into today is the why, right? So what are the metrics we're tracking here, and what are we describing as ideal and optimal as opposed to acceptable along those metrics?

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Anything else I can say broad strokes before we jump into the nuts and bolts of this, Bob?

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think that covers another question about the continuous glucose monitor.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wondering if it's like streaming, or does it actually take measurements every like certain period of time? Does it like take a measurement every few minutes?

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, so actually I thought it would be helpful, Bob, to just sort of show you and obviously listeners kind of what this looks like.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it connects to your phone, and every five minutes it is spitting out a number.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so if you look at it in a 24-hour fashion, when you turn your phone on your side, you get sort of the 24-hour tracing.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So for my last 24 hours, I've averaged about 90 milligrams per deciliter, and my variability has been about 9 or 10 milligrams per deciliter, or my standard deviation.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My peak level has been, let me see, I have to go back and look.

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My peak was 102, and by extension then I've had no peaks above 140. That's going to come up later on.

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So obviously if my peak was 102, I was never above 140. And my nadir was 77. So range of 77 to 102.

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So anyway, that's the kind of data you get out of these things. And obviously they have reports that will spit out your average blood glucose over one day, seven day, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, et cetera, along with the standard deviation and things like that.

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And the way these things work, of course, is they're not actually measuring in the blood. They're measuring in the interstitial fluid.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And that, of course, is the remarkable technology, right? It's that it's able to impute what the glucose level is in the blood without actually having to sample the blood. That's the magic of these things.

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And knowing you, I suspect I already know the answer, but I'll ask it anyway. Have you looked at your CGM and compared, say, your three-month data to your HBA1C?

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course. Yeah. And there's no comparison. So because I actually have something called beta thalassemia minor, or I carry the trait for beta thalassemia, I have tiny little red blood cells, or as my roommate in med school, Matt McCormick used to call it, shite for blood.

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So the size of my red blood cells is very small. So my mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hematocrit are very low.

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not anemic because I make up for it by having a lot of them. So I have a lot of red blood cells. They're just all very small. So I have kind of normal hemoglobin hematocrit oxygen carrying capacity.

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But my hemoglobin A1C always runs high. I've measured it as high as 5.8. The lowest I've ever had measured is 5.1.

78
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But any time I've measured it, if I go and look at my, because I've been wearing CGM for almost six years now, if I go and check my A1C versus my trailing 90-day CGM, it almost always suggests that the hemoglobin A1C is higher by 0.5 to 0.8.

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So if I measure a 5.7 on the hemoglobin A1C, it's overstating my blood glucose, and it should really be about a 5.1 or a 5.2. Does that make sense?

80
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

81
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And we see the opposite in some people, right? We have some patients where their CGM is actually showing us a much higher level of average blood glucose than what their hemoglobin A1C predicts.

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So it's important to understand hemoglobin A1C is a measurement that predicts average blood glucose. CGM actually gives you average blood glucose, and you can reverse engineer and impute at A1C.

83
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's obviously the latter that is much more interesting because you're directly measuring the variable of interest.

84
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, it's amazing technology. It's, you know, the difference between like a snapshot and a movie.

85
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, entirely. And again, I mean, from when I started wearing these things nearly six years ago, I thought, I don't know why everyone in the world isn't wearing it, you know, notwithstanding the cost and the logistics of it.

86
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the obvious reason why everyone wasn't wearing it was their cost prohibitive. And, you know, certainly back then they were quite involved, but they're getting better and better and better.

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I'd like to believe that there will be a day when you go to your first visit at your doctor, they actually, you know, or prior to your first visit with your doctor, they send you, they mail you a CGM and you wear it for 30 days.

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that data is looked at by your doctor and your doctor. By the time you arrive in the office, he or she has that information. And, you know, instead of looking at an A1C or a fasting glucose, they can really look at what your glucose excursions have looked like over a period of time in the real world.

89
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And they do that with, I guess, if things look fishy, but they'll do it with a sphygmomanometer, like they'll send you home with a blood pressure monitor and you'll take it every, you know, so often, maybe three times a day or whatever it is to get a look at your blood pressure that way.

90
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right. We do that with our patients. Most of our patients, there's a particular blood pressure monitor we fancy and we have them keep it at home. We have a special log. We have a, you know, a method that we want them to go to.

91
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We have a, you know, a method that we want them to go about doing it, recording it, and then we'll track that as well. Unfortunately, in the wearable space, blood pressure is still far from primetime. We've tried a bunch of the wearables in that space and have not been impressed yet. But I actually think we're going to, I think there's going to be wearables in the blood pressure space soon.

92
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So, okay. So where do you want to start on this? Because I know that part of the question that was posed is what are the metrics that we track? But I want to go back and sort of state my thesis, right? Or call it my hypothesis, I guess.

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:15,000
My hypothesis is that outside of the formal diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, so now I'm referring to what the person asking the question called as quote unquote normal people. And it's important that we leave quotes on that because I'm going to argue that that term has no meaning. But in the non-diabetic, which may be a better way to describe it, population, what is my argument? My argument is the following.

94
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lower average blood glucose is better. So, you know, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.1 is better than a hemoglobin A1c of 5.5, even though neither of those people are anywhere near having type 2 diabetes.

95
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Two, the more you can minimize glucose variability, the better. And of course glucose variability is very difficult to measure without a CGM. Using a CGM, the standard deviation is the obvious mathematical tool to do that. And lower is better.

96
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, stated another way, if you have two people who both have an average glucose of 100 milligrams per deciliter, which by the way corresponds to about a hemoglobin A1c of 5 to 5.1, which would be excellent.

97
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And one of them has a standard deviation of 10 milligrams per deciliter, and the other one has a standard deviation of 20, the person with the lower one is better off.

98
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Second, pardon me, third, minimizing glucose peaks is important, irrespective of the first two things I said, average glucose and variability. Although obviously the more peaks you have, it's going to all things equal push up glucose and it will certainly increase variability.

99
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I would argue specifically that glucose peaks are problematic and that we want to minimize them. And so getting a little bit ahead of myself, what are the three metrics we are constantly tracking in our patients and what am I constantly tracking in myself?

100
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So, for those of you who haven't heard all of the back episodes, it becomes a great way to go back and filter and decide which ones you want to listen to in detail.
