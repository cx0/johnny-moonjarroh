00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,040
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,460
at PeterAttiaMD.com.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,460
Hey, everybody.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,760
Welcome to this week's episode of The Drive.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,840
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,240
and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
If you're listening to this, you probably already know.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
The two things I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,560
I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,440
I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,280
all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,660
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,700
And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,440
The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
with you.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,180
In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,160
has mirrored this.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,680
So all of this raises a natural question.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,500
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,820
But after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Now the first and most important of these is trust.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,340
paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it.

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,720
Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,400
I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,680
So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,740
work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,800
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,560
If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
works for you.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,960
In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
It's that simple.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
get back more than you give.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,960
So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,260
other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,260
These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,840
of our shows.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
episodes.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,540
That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,480
podcasts when they come out.

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,960
Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
deals possible on the products that I love.

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,920
And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,240
do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,960
about for free and have them pass savings on to you.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,160
enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,440
members to support us at a level that makes sense for you.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,080
Welcome to the kickoff of this Matthew Walker three-part series on sleep.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,280
This is one of the topics we are asked about the most, and I think this will be a fan favorite.

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,360
This series of podcasts will be released over three weeks with this one being the first.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,520
Now at the end of the series, we're going to take questions for a follow-up AMA with

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
Matthew.

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,960
Asking questions on the AMA forum and listening to the AMA podcast with Matthew, along with

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
all AMAs, will only be available to subscribers.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,440
If you haven't signed up yet, you can do so now at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,960
My guest this week is Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,080
of California, Berkeley, and the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Matthew earned his undergraduate degree and PhD in neurophysiology in London and subsequently

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,000
became a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School before moving to Berkeley.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,360
His research examines the impact of sleep on human brain function in healthy and diseased

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
populations.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,800
To date, he has published over a hundred scientific studies.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,480
He has received numerous funding awards from the National Science Foundation, National

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Institutes of Health, and he's a fellow with the National Academy of Sciences.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,560
He's the author of the international bestseller, Why We Sleep, which also happens to be the

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,120
favorite book of my not yet two-year-old son.

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,440
He holds many patents covering various consumer-based sleep recordings, sleep tracking, and sleep

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
simulation.

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,880
He's a sleep scientist at Google where he helps the scientific exploration of sleep

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
in health and disease.

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,120
He is also an enormous fan of Formula One and my hero, Ira Tonsena.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,200
In the third part of this installment, we actually spend quite a bit of time discussing

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
this.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Here in the first part of this series, we discuss the relationship between sleep, dementia,

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,000
and Alzheimer's disease, the four pillars of sleep, sleep stages, measurements, and

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,280
the overall importance of sleep, the lack of sleep and dangers of drowsy driving, and

96
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,360
how the conversation of sleep has changed over the past several years.

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,480
Without further delay, here is the first installment of my three-part series with Professor Matthew

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Walker.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Hey, Matt.

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,680
Thank you so much for making time to meet on a Sunday.

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
Absolute privilege and a delight to be with you, Peter.

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
What's with the weather in Berkeley?

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Is it always this bad?

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,920
Now, when Peter says, is it always this bad, it's probably in the low 60s and there isn't

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
much blue sky.

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,800
It's dry and there's a very pleasant breeze and there is some wonderful blossom.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I know it's not San Diego.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Everything is utopian and people are singing Come By R at the end of the day and holding

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,320
hands, but it's a pretty good day when you consider it's still February.

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Right, right.

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I know.

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
It's like I live in these extremes.

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,360
In San Diego, the bar is like it has to be perfect.

114
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,080
Then in New York, you just sort of expect it to be sort of like I was there two days

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
ago and it stunk.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,280
I mean, all three of those are best than the United Kingdom.

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,480
My home country where essentially you have nine months of really bad weather and then

118
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,360
three months of winter and then that's your year.

119
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,920
This day, February, like this low 60s, I'm a happy man.

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,000
I came from Canada where it's bad in a different way, but the first time I saw California was

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,800
my interview for med school and it was a February day and it was 76 degrees.

122
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,200
That was the first time it occurred to me that you didn't have to suffer.

123
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
I never realized.

124
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,760
I mean, I guess intellectually I understood that it could be warm in the winter, but it

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,400
never occurred to me that you could choose to do that.

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,120
So well, now speaking of this, so what brought you to the US?

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
It was science.

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,600
I did all of my education back in United Kingdom.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I actually started off at medical school.

130
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,400
So back in the UK at aged 18, you can actually go to medical school.

131
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
It's a five year program.

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,880
And after about two years, this wonderful professor came up and said, look, you're a

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,840
nice guy, but you're always asking questions and you're asking them.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,200
I think genuinely you're not asking them to be an ass, but I think you're actually a scientist,

135
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,800
not a doctor, because at the time, you know, he was thinking doctors are interested in

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
answers.

137
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,920
Scientists are interested in questions.

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,760
I think you're a scientist, not a doctor.

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,320
So we didn't have MD PhD programs back at that time.

140
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,760
So then, you know, I thought about it for the summer, came back, switched to neuroscience.

141
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,200
So essentially brain science did that as an undergraduate, then went on to do my PhD

142
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,920
at the medical research council in London and then came to Harvard for my first faculty

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,520
position there.

144
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,840
And I was there for seven years as faculty in psychiatry at Harvard.

145
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,080
And the winters just got to me and, you know, the environment at times as well, academic

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,080
was perhaps more combative and competitive.

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,880
And I think that's one way to breed productivity in a department.

148
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,720
And I'm not shaking a finger at it, but by nature, I'm just a person who is much more

149
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,920
collaborative and collegial rather than combative and competitive.

150
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,080
So Berkeley fit my mentality better, came out here, weather was great.

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,000
California, it's an immense, the easy place to arrive and a very difficult place to leave.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
And I think I probably won't.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
I know that feeling.

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm probably leaving California.

155
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm going through the morning process of accepting the departure because you're right.

156
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
You'll be back.

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,920
It's a hard place to leave.

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,320
When did the switch sort of flip in terms of your passion for sleep?

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,240
I think back at medical school, I was always interested in states of consciousness.

160
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,120
I guess you would describe it as I was fascinated by anesthesia, was fascinated by even hypnosis.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,160
I remember I actually went out to meet this hypnotist to try and understand not, you know,

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
the act and the show.

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I wasn't interested in that.

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,920
I fundamentally wanted to understand what did he think happened within the brain to

165
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,000
produce this altered state of consciousness.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,880
So I got really interested in how the brain can switch between sort of states, mental

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,400
states and then just fundamental awareness states.

168
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,200
That then naturally led me to just become fascinated by sleep.

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,360
I mean, there is no better demonstration of a gigantic shift in conscious state that happens

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,800
to almost every single living creature on this planet every 24 hours.

171
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,840
And back then, this was 20 years ago, we had this fundamental question.

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,120
Why do we sleep?

173
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,720
And what was staggering to me is that it took a third of our lives.

174
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,680
Every species that we've studied today does it sleeps.

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,960
It seems to have evolved with life itself on this planet.

176
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,520
Even more, we've understood the functions of the other main biological drives, eating,

177
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,200
drinking and procreating for tens, if not hundreds of years.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,920
But the fourth main biological drive, the drive to sleep had continued to elude scientific

179
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
judgment.

180
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
How was that possible?

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,200
And back then, 20 years ago, if someone were to ask you, you know, why do we sleep?

182
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,520
The crass answer was we sleep to cure sleepiness.

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,440
And that's the fatuous equivalent of saying, well, we eat to cure hunger.

184
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Well, that tells you nothing about the fundamental nutritional benefits of macro nutrition.

185
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
But that's where we were at with sleep.

186
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,160
So it was for me, this perfect collision of a fascination in an innate biological problem

187
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:45,080
and universal behavior conserved across evolution, together with the fact that we did it for

188
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
a third of our lives.

189
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,680
Plus the fact that science had not been able to crack this, this nut.

190
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,600
It was one of the last great remaining scientific mysteries.

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,120
I thought, well, you know, if you want to pick something that's going to sustain you

192
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,960
for the rest of your life and some of the most acerbic, brilliant minds in science had

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,040
tried to crack this nut and failed, including Francis Crick, wonderful scientist who discovered

194
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
the helical structure of DNA.

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
It's unlikely I'm going to do it in my lifetime, but at least it will sustain me as a scientist.

196
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
That's a problem.

197
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,840
And I could not let it go.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,720
And so that was where the intellectual bite happened.

199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,760
The data, the empirical scientific bite happened when I was doing my PhD.

200
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,440
I was studying brainwave patterns in people with dementia and I was trying to do differential

201
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,160
diagnosis very early on in the course of cognitive decline, seeing which type of dementia did

202
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
they have.

203
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Was it frontal lobe dementia?

204
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Was it Lewy body dementia?

205
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,680
Was it Alzheimer's dementia?

206
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,720
And I was failing miserably for two years.

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,080
I was getting nothing.

208
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,360
I used to go home.

209
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,840
I was living in this doctor's residence and I had this sort of in the middle of my room,

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,640
this little igloo of journals that used to sit in on a Sunday, just this kind of like

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,640
sort of sanctified circle of knowledge.

212
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,320
And I was reading one Sunday and I realized that the different pathologies in these different

213
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,240
dementias, some would hit the sleep centers and others would leave those sleep centers

214
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
completely untouched.

215
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,640
Even within forms of dementia that clinically presented very similarly.

216
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
That's right.

217
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Yeah.

218
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:23,000
You could see certain brainstem nuclei, certain centers within the basic base of the brain.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,040
Some of those were getting eroded by the dementia and those are sleep generating centers.

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,320
Whilst in other of those pathologies, those centers were spurred until very late in the

221
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
disorder.

222
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,400
So they probably weren't affecting my early patients.

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,080
So I realized I was measuring their brainwave activity at the wrong time.

224
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,640
I was measuring my patients whilst they were awake.

225
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,440
What I should have been doing is measuring them whilst they were asleep, got a small

226
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,840
grant, set up a sleep lab, learned how to do it, got some great results.

227
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,000
And then the question became, if the sleep is so disrupted, is it not just a symptom

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
of dementia?

229
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,800
Could sleep disruption actually be a biomarker of dementia?

230
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,520
Could it actually foretell when you were going to develop dementia and which type or

231
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,400
even more profound is sleep disruption an underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease?

232
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,200
And I think right now, based on the weight of the data that we have, and we and others

233
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,920
have got large research programs doing this work, the evidence I think is causal.

234
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,800
I think that sleep at this stage may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors,

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,000
at least that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer's disease.

236
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,240
I feel the causal evidence for that now in humans and animals is strong enough to make

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
that statement.

238
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,560
And I don't make that statement lightly.

239
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Yeah, that is profound because when you think about the other really big ones, vascular

240
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,360
disease and insulin resistance, they both feed into a very similar mechanism, which

241
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,960
is neuronal energy deprivation.

242
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
That's right.

243
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,920
So do you think that sleep disruption or poor sleep, and I want to come back to the semantics

244
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,200
around that because I don't actually think I'm well equipped to talk about this intelligently,

245
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,880
but do you think that that also disrupts some aspect of energy metabolism in the brain or

246
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,800
where in the sort of chain of events do you think that that impacts?

247
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,760
I think one of the places that it impacts is in oxidative stress.

248
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,880
I think it's safe to say that wakefulness is low level brain damage and we need sleep

249
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,000
to avert some of that low level brain damage.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Sleep is the price that we pay for wakefulness, essentially.

251
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,120
And something I mentioned in a book that I put out was, and I got a little.

252
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,040
Just a little book, just a little, just a little New York Times bestseller.

253
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,120
Which by the way, before we're done, I brought my copy because my youngest son, who's named

254
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,720
after our mutual favorite race car driver, loves moons.

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,800
It's all he thinks about, moons, moons, his pajamas, moons, everything.

256
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,720
And he loves your book except for the fact that on the inside there are no pictures of

257
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
moons.

258
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,600
So he'll sit there and he'll look at the cover and he'll go, moo, moo, moo.

259
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,320
And then he flips through it and he gets so frustrated that there's no moon pictures inside.

260
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,280
I will course correct that if there's a second edition and I will just try to place the words

261
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,080
underneath that it is for the benefit of Ierten.

262
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,120
But in the book, you know, I proposed that we didn't evolve sleep, that perhaps we've

263
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,320
got it the wrong way round.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,960
Perhaps the default state of life on the planet was sleep and it was from sleep that wakefulness

265
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
emerged.

266
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Wow.

267
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,640
Why could it not have been that way?

268
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,400
Now I don't have any good evidence to support my hypothesis.

269
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,080
I think it could be utter nonsense, but I think it's a tenable hypothesis.

270
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,600
It's just one that's difficult to test.

271
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,480
But to come back to your question about Alzheimer's, which I think is critical, I think the first

272
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,400
thing is that we see that with insufficient sleep, you get increases in oxidative stress.

273
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Those oxidative stress processes lead to a whole cascade of kind of a finger flick domino

274
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,320
effect of things that lead to neuronal death.

275
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,800
One of the areas in the brain that is most sensitive to that is an area that we call

276
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,640
the hippocampus, which is a critical memory center.

277
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,260
It's probably one of the first structures to undergo damage in Alzheimer's disease.

278
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,520
It's part of the reason why the sort of the phenotype of Alzheimer's is forgetfulness

279
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
problems with memory.

280
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
I think perhaps the stronger evidence though, in terms of sleep and Alzheimer's disease

281
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,320
risk is a remarkable discovery that was made probably about five or six years ago now by

282
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,520
some folks at Rochester University in rats.

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,720
What they discovered is that the brain actually has a sewage system inside of it.

284
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,760
Now your body has one that you're all familiar with called the lymphatic system, but it turns

285
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,160
out the brain has one.

286
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,520
It's called the glymphatic system named after the cells in the brain that form this system

287
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,320
called the glial cells, also known by sort of from a Greek derivative meaning glue.

288
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,400
So they used to be just thought as the sort of the cell.

289
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
The sort of irrelevant stuff between the neurons.

290
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Exactly.

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,560
It was like junk DNA.

292
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,480
And of course what we always learn is that mother nature is far too efficient to leave

293
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,600
inefficiency on the table like glue or junk.

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,720
And it turns out they form this sanitization system within the brain.

295
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,680
And what happens they discovered is that when you go into deep sleep at night, this

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,360
sewage system kicks into high gear and essentially those glial cells which surround the brain

297
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,640
cells themselves, the neurons proper, they shrink in size by up to 200%.

298
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,180
And then all of a sudden it leaves a vast amount of room for cerebrospinal fluid to

299
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:06,480
start perfusing the brain and washing out the metabolic detritus of wakefulness.

300
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,900
So it would be like New York City at night, all of the buildings shrunk down to 200%.

301
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,980
You know, they became miniaturized.

302
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,220
And then there was this big effluent flush that just happened across Manhattan to clear

303
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,640
out all the debris.

304
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,040
And it's essentially good night, sleep clean, that you get this power cleanse at night.

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,060
Why is this related to Alzheimer's?

306
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,180
Well, one of the critical ingredients that they found that the glymphatic system washed

307
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,700
away was a sticky toxic protein called beta amyloid.

308
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,100
Beta amyloid is probably one of the two core proteins that we know underlie your risk for

309
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
the development of Alzheimer's.

310
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,020
Ergo, if you're not getting your sleep at night, you're not getting that washing away

311
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,580
of the toxic Alzheimer's protein.

312
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,540
Every night then you are building up more amyloid within the brain.

313
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,660
If you keep doing that night after night, it's like compounding interest on a loan.

314
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,220
It's just escalating your Alzheimer's risk.

315
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,060
That's why we can then explain the associational evidence, which I don't like associational

316
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,620
evidence in epidemiological studies.

317
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,780
And I don't think you're a huge fan of it, perhaps either.

318
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,420
Just don't tell anybody at the Harvard School of Public Health.

319
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
Yeah.

320
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,460
Or maybe the NIH and I were applying for grants for epidemiological studies.

321
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,500
What we certainly see is that if you bucket people into the amount of sleep on average

322
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,020
that they've got across the lifespan and at the end of the sort of life or in late life

323
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,020
in their seventies and their eighties, we do a special type of PET scan to map the amount

324
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,100
of amyloid in their brain.

325
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,820
And then you just sort of look at those brain scans.

326
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,620
Anyone on the street would not need any statistics.

327
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,780
They would not need any training in brain science to see that one of these maps is different

328
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
to the other.

329
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,580
It's on Sesame Street.

330
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,140
And what is remarkable is people are getting seven hours of sleep or less compared to seven

331
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,300
hours of sleep or more.

332
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,820
There is marked differences in the amount of amyloid that's built up.

333
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,060
Now that's just associational evidence.

334
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,580
But then when you take it down to the level of animal studies where they selectively deprive

335
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,780
animals of either deep non-REM sleep or they fragment their sleep, you get an immediate

336
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,060
amyloid buildup.

337
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,580
Essentially within the brain, you start to have what looks like a sort of, you know,

338
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,660
an amyloid sort of genetic process that's happening.

339
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
That's rats.

340
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,460
So then we can all wave our hands if we want because we would like to beat our chests and

341
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,580
sort of, you know, say, I don't need my sleep.

342
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,780
And that's just rat stuff.

343
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,700
Well, the studies have now been done in humans where we will take a human being and for one

344
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,460
single night, we will take away the deep sleep.

345
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,460
And the way that you do that is that you just play these auditory tones at night.

346
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,380
So they never wake up.

347
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,940
So the total amount of sleep that they get is still eight hours, but I can just selectively

348
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,260
excise your deep sleep when that that sewage system should be kicking into gear.

349
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,060
And then the next day we do something that's really rather unpleasant.

350
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,060
We do a spinal cord puncture and we suck out some cerebrospinal fluid and we can measure

351
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,900
the amount of the two toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer's.

352
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,780
One is called beta amyloid that we've discussed.

353
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,300
The other is called tau protein.

354
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,820
And we see the next day after one night of sleep disruption, a significant increase in

355
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,620
circulating levels of amyloid and tau.

356
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,060
For me, that was kind of like the turning point where I finally felt comfortable going

357
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,820
on record and saying, at this point, folks, I really feel comfortable saying that your

358
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:45,020
sleep is a critical component of your prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

359
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,980
I really think the evidence is now in that direction and way in that direction.

360
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,740
It's not just epidemiological.

361
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,140
It's not just prospective longitudinal studies, which are better than cross-sectional sort

362
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,780
of epidemiological.

363
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,220
It's not just causal in rats.

364
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,220
It's experimentally causal in humans after one night of sleep.

365
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,140
Do you see variation there?

366
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,620
Because one of the things that I find difficult with understanding all diseases and Alzheimer's

367
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,180
would be sort of more so than even cardiovascular disease because we still have so much less

368
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:26,260
data is there must clearly be enough variation between people that it's very easy at the

369
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,700
heterogeneous level to miss things that you would see in an otherwise homogeneous population.

370
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,460
For example, when you look at the coinage of the term Alzheimer's disease, it's quite

371
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,220
likely that that was coined based on a patient who probably had a PSN1 or 2 mutation.

372
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,620
Such an early onset of the disease versus the disease we typically see.

373
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,580
I mean, today, those patients make up less than 1%.

374
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,420
It's almost a different disease from the one.

375
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,780
These are people that are presenting in their 50s and they're usually dead before they're

376
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,580
60, whereas 99% of the population are getting a sort of later onset disease.

377
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,700
Within that population, all of the variation with ApoE genotype, it almost makes you wonder

378
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,360
if there's different susceptibilities to this deprivation because everybody and their brother

379
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,700
can point to the exceptions to these rules.

380
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,100
The person who did everything right slept like a baby every night and ends up down this

381
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
one path.

382
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,420
Then of course, the person who does everything incorrect and seems to be completely fine,

383
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,020
or at least from the perspective of no obvious disease.

384
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,540
Their analogy is really interesting because I don't really find myself hugely in the

385
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,300
amyloid beta camp as the main causal driver.

386
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,180
I think it's more of a result, but it's interesting.

387
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,740
What you posit is if it's more about the clearance of that than the generation of that, that

388
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,620
would be a congruent view with this idea that there could be other things on the back end

389
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,460
that are driving this primarily.

390
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,820
Of course, I think with Alzheimer's disease, it strikes me as just so complicated because

391
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,540
of the genetic predisposition coupled with the multiple pathways that can seem to drive

392
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,660
comparable insults to an otherwise incredibly sensitive organ.

393
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,420
I hugely cleave to the idea that probably what we call Alzheimer's right now is going

394
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,980
to be sub-typed at some point in the future that we'll have.

395
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,620
Imagine it's like cancer, where in 30 years, hopefully the rate of growth has slowed, that

396
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,420
it's not a pandemic, but you might have five sub-types or something for that.

397
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
That's right.

398
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,500
I think we will see that.

399
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,660
Then we will start to pattern match what features it.

400
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,580
I think the fact that sleep already, let's just call Alzheimer's disease this strange

401
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:48,740
heterogeneous mix right now that we feel uncomfortable about in terms of pinning one exact pathological

402
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,140
ingredient as the causal trigger for that.

403
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,620
In fact, I actually probably think tau is, if you look at the data, probably stronger

404
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,860
in terms of predicting cognitive decline at least than amyloid is.

405
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,540
The fact that we've now found that insufficient sleep will also lead to tau aggregation too,

406
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,940
I think is concerning and worrying.

407
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,700
Let's accept that this Alzheimer's thing, this disease state is heterogeneous.

408
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,740
The fact that sleep, and we can find such a strong predictive sleep signal in terms

409
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,220
of that risk, despite it being such a diffuse gray matter ball itself of a disease, must

410
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,180
mean that the links between insufficient sleep and this heterogeneous thing are, I think,

411
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,540
probably quite strong.

412
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,340
Otherwise, the dirtiness of the equation would be such that those associations would be far

413
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,140
weaker rather than stronger.

414
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,660
The fact that they're already present leads me to believe that when we do eventually subtype

415
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,420
Alzheimer's disease, we will then find that there are subsets of sleep features that are

416
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,860
deterministic of those subsets of Alzheimer's.

417
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,700
For example, deep sleep will be predictive of one form of Alzheimer's.

418
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:08,660
Sleep fragmentation, which is more about sleep quality than it is about physiological quantity.

419
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,580
Sleep fragmentation will be predictive of something else, another subtype of Alzheimer's

420
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
disease.

421
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,180
Then I think basic- Duration could matter.

422
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,680
I think there probably are four pillars of sleep.

423
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,420
There is probably regularity.

424
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,300
How consistent is your sleep schedule?

425
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,940
Are you undergoing what we call social jet lag, which is where you're bouncing around,

426
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,180
you're going to sleep at 1 a.m., then 10 p.m., and all over the map?

427
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,360
There's regularity.

428
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,840
There is the continuity of your sleep.

429
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Is it fragmented?

430
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,480
Are you waking up many more times, or is it just nice one long shot?

431
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
That's a second feature.

432
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,560
I think the third feature is quantity, how much sleep you're getting, and how much of

433
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,280
the different stages are you getting.

434
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,860
Then independent of how regular your sleep is, how continuous your sleep is, and the

435
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,000
amount, the quantity, the final is quality.

436
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,600
Quality has become big in the last five years in the sleep field.

437
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,040
In other words, what is the electrical signature of your sleep?

438
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,800
Just because you're getting eight hours of sleep doesn't mean that you're getting eight

439
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,520
hours of good electrical quality deep sleep.

440
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,280
I hope that we get the chance to speak about things like caffeine and alcohol, other substances

441
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,400
of abuse that can make you feel like you're sleeping eight hours.

442
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Quantity just fine.

443
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Quality poor.

444
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Come back to your question.

445
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,320
I love the way that you think about that problem, and I agree with it very much that Alzheimer's

446
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,600
disease is probably going to be heterogeneous.

447
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,400
I think the pathology already points to that and its complexity.

448
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,440
The way that sleep plugs into that heterogeneous disorder that we call Alzheimer's is also

449
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,160
going to be heterogeneous in nature.

450
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Different sleep features will be predictive of different aspects of the amyloid pathology

451
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,080
cascade.

452
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,520
We just submitted a paper, which I'm going to blow now in terms of media outlet, which

453
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,720
hasn't been accepted yet.

454
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,040
We just tried to ask the question across someone's lifespan, if you bucket them into 10-year

455
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,560
decades and you ask, what was the quantity and quality of their sleep from their thirties

456
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,040
and forties, forties and fifties, fifties and sixties, so on and so forth.

457
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,520
Then at the end of their life, you stick them in a brain scanner and you map how much amyloid

458
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,840
is in the brain and how much tau is in the brain, which is what we can do here at the

459
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
sleep center.

460
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Then you essentially can, in a retrospective manner, say, was sleep at certain times of

461
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:49,440
life more critical in predicting how much amyloid you will have late in life?

462
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,240
In other words, are there certain decades during an adult's lifespan where sleep is

463
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,240
even more important for determining your...

464
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,000
How can you do that retrospectively?

465
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,080
Let's say you had this cohort of patients.

466
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,680
Maybe at best you could, through questionnaires, infer duration, but how would you be able

467
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,520
to infer anything about depth or quality?

468
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Depth we can't do, but quality we can do.

469
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
We've got a set of standardized questionnaires that have been essentially validated against

470
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,520
gold standard, what we call polysomnography, which essentially is sleep laboratory grade

471
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,680
recording with electrodes.

472
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,520
What we find is that those questionnaires have good predictive validity relative to objective

473
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
gold standard measures.

474
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,320
It's a hop, skip and a jump, but you can say, look, these subjective questionnaires seem

475
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,000
to go pretty well hand in hand with sleep quantity and quality.

476
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,280
Let's take those questionnaires and then let's ask of those patients what they were

477
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,160
doing in terms of their sleep quantity and quality in those different bucket decades

478
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,480
of their life.

479
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,480
It has all of the problems that you can imagine.

480
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,960
This seems like a slightly better version of a food frequency questionnaire, which your

481
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,440
peers would be relying on to do the same question about nutrition.

482
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,760
It's reliant on an individual.

483
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,360
It's got problems with history because the further you go back, does that signal of accuracy

484
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
degrade?

485
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,960
How big are the hazard ratios?

486
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,600
Because I guess this is where one of those things where if sleep could account for 25%

487
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,180
of this disease, or if it increased the risk by say 25% would be a better way to say that,

488
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,680
it strikes me as unlikely that you could see that signal because that's not a big enough

489
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,320
signal with all the noise you've just described.

490
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,440
But if you were talking about a hazard ratio of six or seven, or it's so funny today, one

491
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,240
of my kids asked me about smoking.

492
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,000
Why do people smoke?

493
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,200
I couldn't resist going down the Bradford Hill pathway.

494
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,660
Unfortunately he's four and a half, but he got a probably about a 12 minute lecture on

495
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,180
epidemiology and the hazard ratio of small cell lung cancer and smoking.

496
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,160
But the punchline in my story to him, Peter Attia, ladies and gentlemen, Peter Attia.

497
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,520
I was trying to explain to him what it would mean to have a 14X increase in risk, which

498
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,840
was basically what was observed in the first physician study of smoking.

499
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,040
The point there is that is such a massive signal that, I mean, as you describe it, I

500
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,160
love whenever you can get these things, that statistics aren't necessary.

501
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,240
When you don't need the P value to figure it out, that's it.

502
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,800
So does your intuition, and again, I don't want you to scoop what's already in this paper,

503
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,960
so if you can't speak about it, no problem.

504
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,220
But do you have a sense of that magnitude and therefore if even a crude backwards looking

505
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,900
metric is directionally pointing you at something that you think, wow, this isn't a subtle change?

506
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,060
Yeah, I mean, we're up in the region of from 0.45 to 0.6.

507
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,060
So it's-

508
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,900
In risk reduction for those doing it correctly?

509
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Correct, yeah.

510
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,180
So it's substantial, but what was interesting to me, which gave me more confidence, was

511
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:10,020
that the windows of sleep sensitivity were, now by the way, across the entire lifespan,

512
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,420
if you're getting less sleep at almost any point in the lifespan, the risk that you're

513
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,100
going to have higher amounts of these Alzheimer's disease proteins in your brain is greater.

514
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,940
That's what we find across the board.

515
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,100
What's interesting is that when it comes to those two different proteins, amyloid and

516
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,580
tau, there are different decades that are predictive.

517
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,820
So if it's just one global subjective bias in your questionnaire, that you shouldn't

518
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,780
see that result.

519
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,980
So there is a sensitivity and specificity to these two different proteins that to me

520
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,020
got me more excited that it transcended some of the limitations that are inherent in this

521
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,340
approach and also the fact that for amyloid, you get a very strong predictive signal, you

522
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,980
know, thirties to forties and then again, sort of sixties to seventies.

523
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:09,300
And for tau, it's actually somewhere in sort of the starts in the fifties to sixties and

524
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,420
then goes through until the eighties.

525
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,380
So what about childhood?

526
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,460
So we actually, we didn't go back in terms of child, just because at that point it's

527
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,300
really difficult to feel confident about that data.

528
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,420
You'd have to get parents who are not living at that stage.

529
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,540
But to me, I think the fact that you've got these strange kind of hotspots across life.

530
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,980
And you have a, you described a bimodal distribution for amyloid beta.

531
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Yeah.

532
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,620
Which then lends me to believe that that result is difficult to explain by sort of

533
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,580
just general memory biases, which would be kind of more of a linear approach.

534
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,080
But I don't, I mean, I think the point is that, you know, the evidence that continues

535
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:54,300
to build in favor of this story, that insufficient sleep is a significant lifestyle factor in

536
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:00,300
your deterministic ratio odds of developing Alzheimer's disease is ever stronger now.

537
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,620
And the fact that unlike many of the other lifestyle factors, the mechanism underlying

538
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,220
it has now been demonstrated causally in humans and adults.

539
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,260
And it's been done so acutely within a 24 hour period of time.

540
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,020
That to me just knocked me sideways.

541
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,700
And the controls did not have, so if you controlled for everything except the perturbation, you

542
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
didn't see the amyloid or tau rise in the controls.

543
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Yeah.

544
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,100
And it's interesting too, because one of the reasons I've been a little less excited

545
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,540
about amyloid, there's two reasons.

546
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,100
One is what can only be, I think, described as just the abject failure of the pharmacologic

547
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,180
approach to amyloid reduction.

548
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,020
At our last counting, oh, I don't want to be misquoted on this.

549
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,980
We'll include it in the show notes, what the actual number is, but it's basically one amyloid

550
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,540
antibody quasi success at disease stabilization to the tune of 2000 failures.

551
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
That's one thing.

552
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,940
The second is the autopsy studies of people who died without any clinical evidence of

553
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:08,660
Alzheimer's disease who still have amyloid, making me wonder if amyloid is necessary but

554
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,300
not sufficient.

555
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
And therefore, what if there's something else going on?

556
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,580
And of course, the third thing I would now add just based on thinking about it for two

557
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,300
seconds, so this might not be well thought out is in the next couple of hours, we're

558
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,820
going to talk about a whole bunch of other things that sleep does that are in and of

559
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,100
themselves completely devastating to your health that also would feed into that, for

560
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,300
example, the impact that negative sleep has on cardiovascular disease.

561
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,820
And it's become quite clear that if you're doing bad things to your heart, you're doing

562
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
bad things to your brain.

563
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,820
And of course, we're going to talk about glucose disposal, hyperinsulinemia and all of

564
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,300
those things, which also have a clear impact.

565
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,140
So I think this would only strengthen the case that sleep deprivation is bad for you

566
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,340
and bad for your brain.

567
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,180
It to me makes it harder to tease out potentially the mechanistic links, although there's no

568
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,420
reason, as you said, that it can't be multifaceted.

569
00:36:59,420 --> 00:36:59,900
Yeah.

570
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,580
And I think there are certainly those conundrums where you see patients with non-trivial

571
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,780
amounts of amyloid in the brain, let's say, at post-mortem who are even only in the early

572
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,140
stages of MCI of what we call mild cognitive impairment.

573
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,340
They haven't transitioned yet.

574
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,860
I'm glad you remember to explain these things because I'm nodding away like, of course,

575
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,820
I know what MCI is.

576
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:27,340
But that aside, I think the idea that it's necessary, maybe not sufficient, but necessary

577
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,260
if you truly don't want necessary in your life.

578
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,260
And if you're getting insufficient sleep, you're placing a necessary there where it

579
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,500
doesn't necessarily have to be.

580
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,580
No, the analogy could be with lipoproteins.

581
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,460
You know, there's a.

582
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,100
Oh, that's a very.

583
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,340
Yeah.

584
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,820
Right.

585
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,860
I mean, lipoproteins are absolutely necessary, but not sufficient for atherosclerosis.

586
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,260
And so some people say, well, there's no efficacy in reducing lipoproteins.

587
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,300
And I think part of it is it's diffuse, right?

588
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,180
You're only attacking one of the four constitutive elements.

589
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,380
Four things have to happen for you to get atherosclerosis, the lipoproteins being one.

590
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,060
So that's actually an interesting idea.

591
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,820
And it's a great argument for why would you want something that's necessary,

592
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,940
but not sufficient there?

593
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,300
Why would you decrease your odds?

594
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,620
Yeah.

595
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,460
I mean, you know, think about it like this.

596
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,540
If your goal, the two most feared diseases in developed nations right now,

597
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,700
I believe are cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

598
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,540
And I would say it's in the other order.

599
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,500
And yeah.

600
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,460
And I think Alzheimer's is, you know, top of the list that

601
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,020
do you want to de-risk the probability of Alzheimer's disease in your life?

602
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,700
If you truly don't want to invite right to, you know, this thing called Alzheimer's disease

603
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,820
and invite it in, in the mail coming at you, but you're getting, you know,

604
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:46,700
less than seven hours of sleep a night, you're not working in the direction that you wish.

605
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,300
You're going against Alzheimer's disease prevention and you're working well towards

606
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,820
Alzheimer's invitation.

607
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,860
People will often say, you know, how much sleep do you get?

608
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,260
And I'll say, like, I give myself a non-negotiable eight hour sleep opportunity.

609
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,060
And that's not because I'm trying to practice what I preach.

610
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,780
I don't want to be some poster child for sleep.

611
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:14,540
If you understood what I knew about sleep and all cause mortality, as well as most disease

612
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:22,140
processes, you would realize that I'm being nothing short of utterly selfish in my preservation of

613
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,660
an eight hour sleep opportunity.

614
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:28,140
I don't want to die young and I don't want sickness and disease in my life.

615
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,300
My family, for example, has got a very strong history of cardiovascular disease.

616
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,860
And we know that deep sleep is probably the best form of blood pressure medication

617
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,300
that you could ever wish for.

618
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
That would be an easier one to study.

619
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,140
I'm guessing we'll come to that later.

620
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,540
Yeah.

621
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,180
The ability to perturb deep sleep and then see the change in blood pressure.

622
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,820
Yeah.

623
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,020
I think the point is, I think, bash people over the head with this sufficiently, but

624
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,100
the link between a lack of sleep and Alzheimer's now, I think, is very strong.

625
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,060
What I find though positive about that is, with Alzheimer's disease, just as you mentioned,

626
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,420
when it comes to pharmacological approaches, we just don't have anything that looks robust right

627
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,660
now.

628
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,740
So medicine in many ways, and especially for Alzheimer's disease, has started to shift from

629
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,260
a model of late stage treatment to early stage prevention.

630
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,620
And I think I feel very comfortable saying that one of the best preventative actions that you can

631
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:30,060
take on the basis of the science right now is start to capitalize on your sleep at night.

632
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:35,180
So let's shift gears just a little bit and go back to the polysom.

633
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,940
Let's explain to people, because we're going to eventually have to talk about

634
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,900
tracking these things.

635
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,620
And I want to bring up some of the commercially available ways that people do that, which

636
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,980
I think by definition are still not accurate enough for people to compare them to their

637
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,620
polysom.

638
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:58,460
But if I came into your lab tonight and I was willing to go to sleep there and you would

639
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,900
hook me up to an EEG, what are the different patterns of brainwaves and how would you

640
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,380
morphologically describe them and then bucket them by these stages you've already sort of

641
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,580
touched on a little bit as deep REM, deep REM, deep non-REM, et cetera?

642
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,820
Yeah, so upon falling asleep, human beings and in fact all mammals will experience two different

643
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,940
stages of sleep.

644
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,180
One of them is called non-rapid eye movement sleep.

645
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,020
The other is rapid eye movement sleep.

646
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:33,820
Non-REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages, which are unimaginatively

647
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,980
called stages one through four.

648
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,780
Thank God.

649
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,820
Yeah, I know.

650
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,060
I think that's all that the sleep deprived people who are experimenting could come up

651
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,780
with at that time.

652
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,300
So increasing in their depth of sleep.

653
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:52,140
So stages three and four of non-REM sleep are the really deep restorative stages of sleep.

654
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,940
Stages one and two are the lighter stages of sleep.

655
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,220
And then on the other hand, we have rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep, which is named

656
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,500
not after the popular Michael Stipe pop band, but because of these bizarre horizontal shuttling

657
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,180
eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep, these rapid eye movements.

658
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,540
So you have these two different types of sleep and they will essentially, as you fall asleep

659
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,140
here in at the sleep center at Berkeley, they will go into essentially a battle for brain

660
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,740
domination throughout the night.

661
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:31,260
And that cerebral war between non-REM and REM is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes

662
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,780
and then replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep,

663
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,100
or what we call a hypnogram of sleep.

664
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,740
And so what you will see is that upon falling asleep, you'll go into the light stages of

665
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,620
non-REM, stages one and two.

666
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,860
Before we do that, let's say before I fall asleep, when I'm just laying in the bed,

667
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,620
how would you describe my brainwaves under the wakeful condition?

668
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,540
So at that point, what we typically see is that when you close your eyes,

669
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,060
the back of the brain goes into what's called an alpha rhythm.

670
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:08,380
So when you're awake, your brain shows this remarkably frenetic, high frequency electrical

671
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,500
activity. In other words, your brain is going in terms of its brainwaves, it's going up and down

672
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:20,220
many, many times a second. And the amplitude is very small,

673
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,860
which kind of is paradoxically you think, if I'm awake, then my brain is active.

674
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,580
And so the size of those brainwaves should be big. It's not, it's actually very small.

675
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:35,260
And here's the reason. Different parts of your brain are doing different things at different

676
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,860
times. So those brainwaves sort of are all canceling each other out.

677
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:46,460
So the analogy would be, if I were to dangle a microphone above a sports stadium,

678
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:53,820
what I'm picking up is the signal from the crowd of a hundred thousand individual neurons that sit

679
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:01,100
underneath it. That's how an EEG electrode is. Now, before the game starts, that's wakefulness.

680
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,020
And at that point, the hundred thousand people in the stadium, the hundred thousand brain cells,

681
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,300
they're all speaking to each other at different moments in time.

682
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,580
So there's a lot of cancellation.

683
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,700
So there's a lot of cancellation. They're not all coordinated,

684
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:21,100
but it's very fast and frenetic. So I just get this signal that is very desynchronized and

685
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:27,260
it's not synchronous. So they're not summing their power together. So the size of that brainwave is

686
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:33,420
not very big, but that's why the frequency is so high. The frequency is high, meaning that you're

687
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:41,100
sort of going up and down maybe 50, 60 times per second. Now, as you start to fall asleep or actually

688
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:46,620
even before you start to fall asleep, as you're lying in bed awake, the back of the brain is the

689
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,100
first part of the brain that really starts to settle down. It goes into what we call alpha rhythm

690
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,260
when you close your eyes. And I assume that's just because the occipital cortex is in the back and

691
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,060
you've closed your eyes. Brilliant. So the back of the brain, visual brain, if you close your eyes,

692
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,580
that part of the brain essentially stops processing the outside world and it goes into its

693
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:12,860
sort of default state when it's awake of slow frequency, it drops down from maybe 50 times per

694
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,620
second down to about, let's say 10 cycles per second. But still relatively low amplitude.

695
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:25,580
But still relatively low amplitude. Then once you start to actually transition, when you make that

696
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:32,300
bridge from the world of wakefulness to sleep, as you sort of cross through that window from one of

697
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,900
those worlds to the next, something bizarre happens. And if anyone out there is lucky enough

698
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,180
to be listening to this and they have a bed partner, you can actually see this. Just look at

699
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:49,740
their eyelids as they're falling asleep. And what you'll see is that their eyeballs start to roll in

700
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:56,700
their sockets and they're called slow rolling eye movements. Now we don't know why the eyes roll in

701
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:02,140
the sockets like that, but it's the first sign that you're making the transition from the world

702
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,500
of wakefulness into sleep. We use it as almost an indicator of the transition into sleep. Now,

703
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,460
by the way, if your partner wakes up, sometimes people will wake up from that state and they see

704
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:18,620
you just looking over them in bed, staring at their eyelids. If you're in early in a relationship,

705
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,340
it's usually the end of the relationship. It's just a point of note. Please don't blame me.

706
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,900
Usually wait till you're married and then start to do that one. The divorce usually is harder to

707
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,220
come by. So then you start to go down into the light stages of non-rem sleep, stages one and two.

708
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,980
Then after about 20 or so minutes, you'll go down deep into stages three and four.

709
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:46,460
And in one and two, have we transitioned out of that alpha wave? I mean, where do we start to see

710
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:54,460
the thetas and theta already happening in stage one? In stage two, you actually go into theater

711
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:01,100
activity, which is now down from 50 cycles per second, maybe down to just sort of six or seven

712
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,300
cycles per second. And the amplitude's getting a bit bigger. It is getting a bit bigger. Yeah. And

713
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,660
then every now and again during stage two, the way that I know that you're in this lighter stage of

714
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:17,260
non-rem sleep stage two is that you'll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity that we

715
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,620
call sleep spindles. That's the K spindle. And that's sort of where you get this, actually you get

716
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:28,300
a nice big slow wave, like almost like a single slow wave. And then you get this burst of a sleep

717
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,540
spindle. And we actually did this great project here at the sleep center where we did the

718
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:39,740
sonification of sleep and we, we extracted brainwaves from human beings. And then we sort of,

719
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:45,260
you know, smooth them a little bit with some sort of audio software and then you can play them back.

720
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:50,860
And it's beautiful because when you hear these sleep spindles, they are these short,

721
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,740
synchronous bursts of electrical activity that last for about a second and a half.

722
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,540
And they go up to about 10 or 15 cycles per second. So it's almost like that beautiful rolling

723
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:08,700
R in sort of in the Hindi language, you know, sort of like a cat pairing. So, so you get these big

724
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,980
slow waves and then you get this ripple of a spindle. And when you hear it on the speakers,

725
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:25,500
it's just sensational. You get this, you know, it's, and it's every time I hear it. I mean,

726
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,140
this is spine tingling stuff. When you realize this is going on right now,

727
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,060
physiologically in someone's brain. And then from there, you start to go down to the really deep

728
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,980
stages of non-rung sleep stages, three and four. And at that point, the brain goes into this

729
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:49,580
incredible synchronous mantra chant of these slow waves. So the brain waves slow down,

730
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:56,380
you go down to maybe just one or two cycles per second, very, very slow brainwave activity,

731
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:03,020
but the size of those waves crashing on the beach of the cortex, as it were, they are huge. And the

732
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,900
reason is this go back to the sports stadium analogy. Let's say that we're here at Berkeley

733
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,980
and we're playing Stanford arch rivals. Yeah. Which hopefully you're going to kick their butt.

734
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,100
Fingers crossed. Just make sure there's no band anywhere to be found.

735
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,020
It always does. It's a terrible to say, but at that point they're chanting in unison.

736
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:27,100
They're all chanting in unison. So it's louder, but they're now making the same sound together.

737
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,860
And you can actually hear what's being said. Exactly. So now in that single microphone,

738
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:40,380
you can hear Stanford sucks, Stanford sucks. So all of a sudden, all of, for reasons that we

739
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:48,380
are only now starting to understand, the brain coordinates hundreds of thousands of neurons,

740
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:54,460
unlike it does at any moment elsewhere in the 24 hour period, hundreds of thousands of brain

741
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,700
cells all decide to join hands, as it were, physiologically, metaphorically, and they all

742
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,900
fire together. And then they all go silent. They all fire together. And then they all go.

743
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,860
And what I find amazing about that, by the way, is how slow that frequency is. You're basically,

744
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,900
you could be, this could be only happening once a second, right? That's right. And that's why it got

745
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:22,220
a terrible rap for 20 or 30 years, because it actually looked not dissimilar to some aspects

746
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:28,940
of coma. That's how slow those brainwaves were. So sleep scientists were, you know, understandably

747
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:34,060
fooled into thinking that deep sleep was a time when the brain essentially was just doing nothing.

748
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:42,140
Now we realize the exact opposite is true because it's during that deep sleep that you get

749
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:48,540
essentially information transfer within the brain. It's a file transfer mechanism. And the way to

750
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:54,300
think about this is let's say it's like long wave radio. If you're in the city, you tune into FM,

751
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,460
which is shortwave radio. You can pick up a bunch of signals and the further you drive out into the

752
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:04,300
desert, let's say here in California, you just lose those channels. Cause the range from the tower

753
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,300
is so short that you just lose that range. But if you go onto sort of, you know, the long wave radio

754
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,500
stations, you can still pick up stations for hundreds of miles. Why? Because the carrier

755
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:23,260
frequency of those radio waves is much slower. And so the distance over which you can transfer

756
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:32,380
information is much further. Deep sleep is a brain state of long distance information transfer.

757
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:38,060
Is there morphologically a difference that you can see between stages three and four, which are

758
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,060
obviously both Delta waves, but how do you distinguish those two?

759
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:48,780
Technically, no. The way it's defined is that what proportion of a 30 second period of time,

760
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,660
and that's the way that we score sleep. I'll have you sleep for eight hours, then I'll chop up that

761
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:59,420
eight hours into 30 second bits of information. And for each 30 seconds, you'll get a sleep score

762
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:06,620
and then we add them all up. And what differentiates stage three of deep non-rem sleep from the very

763
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:13,420
deepest stage, which is stage four non-rem sleep is simply what proportion of that 30 seconds

764
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:21,340
is consumed by that deep slow brainwave activity. If it's sort of less than 50 percent, then it's

765
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:30,060
stage three. If it's more than 50 percent, stage four. So morphologically no, although if you really

766
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:38,460
look at it morphologically, on average, yes, the waves are typically larger in amplitude and slower

767
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:45,020
in frequency in stage four than they are in stage three. And do people always progress

768
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,460
monotonically through these or do sometimes people go one, two, four, three, REM, for example?

769
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,900
No, you will have to go through three to get to four. You have to go to three to get to four.

770
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:03,420
You have to go from two to get to three to get to four with the exception of probably, let's say,

771
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:09,980
two examples. One is pathological. If you suffer from narcolepsy, one of the things that typically

772
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:16,380
happens is that you go from being awake straight into REM sleep. So to sort of finish the 90 minute

773
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,140
cycle, and this will make sense, you go sort of stage one to stage two, stage two, three, three,

774
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:28,620
four. Then after about 70 minutes, you'll rise back up into stage two. And then finally you'll

775
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,740
pop up into REM sleep. And then you'll have a short REM sleep period. And then you'll go back

776
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:39,500
down again, down into non REM sleep, up into REM, down into non REM sleep, up into REM. And you do

777
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:48,540
that, as I said, every 90 minutes. However, what changes is the ratio of non REM to REM within that

778
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:54,780
90 minute period as you move across the night, such that in the first half of the night, the

779
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:00,700
majority of your 90 minute sleep cycles are comprised of lots of deep non REM sleep and very

780
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:06,540
little REM sleep. But as you push through to the second half of the night, now the seesaw balance

781
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,980
changes. And the majority of those sleep cycles are comprised much more of rapid eye movement sleep

782
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,100
and almost no deep sleep. And that's why it's always dangerous when people say, you know, I'm

783
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,820
one of those who survives on, you know, six, six and a half hours of sleep at night. I wake up,

784
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,340
you know, five, five 30 to get a jumpstart on the day. And you can ask, well, let's say you're

785
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,940
getting six hours of sleep. How much sleep are you losing? And they will say, well, according to your

786
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,540
definition of eight hours of sleep, well, I'm 25% off because I'm getting, I lose two hours at the

787
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:45,740
end of an eight hour night of sleep. So I'm sleeping 75%. I'm losing 25% yes and no, because

788
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,860
yes, you're disproportionate. Exactly. So yes, you're losing 25% of total sleep, but you could

789
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,740
be losing up to 70% of all of your REM sleep because it's the REM sleep rich phase that you

790
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:03,580
are short changing to get a jumpstart on the day. So you've got to be very careful when you try to

791
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,820
think of your sleep dynamics. But to come back to your point, sorry, yes, you always have to go

792
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,460
through that linear progression. Norel epilepsy is a standout case that you'll usually go from

793
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:18,620
wakefulness sometimes immediately into REM sleep. Very frightening. Most people don't experience,

794
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:24,220
you know, logical, rational waking consciousness, and then go immediately into irrational

795
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,940
hallucinogenic consciousness, which is what REM sleep is. It's very disturbing when you speak to

796
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:34,860
these patients. The other is if you are horrifically REM sleep deprived or chronically sleep deprived,

797
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,940
occasionally you can make the transition straight into REM sleep. We see this in people who are

798
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:46,780
abusing alcohol heavily, who are alcoholics, alcohol, and we'll come onto this blocks your REM sleep.

799
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,140
You can build up such a hunger for REM sleep that the brain says, well, tonight I'm going to

800
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,060
forego the non-REM sleep. I'm just going to go and feast on REM sleep straight away. There's

801
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,420
hysteresis in the system, maladaptively so. That's a bad sign when you get hysteresis like that,

802
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:07,260
that type of pressure. Does this explain, and maybe this is not even really correct, but you

803
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:14,540
could see that someone who's constitutively sleeping six hours a night would suffer perhaps fewer of

804
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:21,020
the memory consolidation issues because they're still getting much of their deeper sleep earlier

805
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:28,460
in the evening, presumably where that hippocampal consolidation takes place and the lack of REMs

806
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,580
manifestations are just harder to see. Is that partially explain any of that or is that even

807
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:39,660
accurate? It turns out that different types of memory rely on different stages of sleep at

808
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:45,500
different times of night. So what we found is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit

809
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:51,500
the save button on your memories so that you don't forget. And for that, it's all about deep non-REM

810
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:56,700
sleep. So as long as you were getting, let's say, the first half of the night, the first five hours,

811
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,500
then it's likely that you may have been able to protect those memories. But here's the other

812
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:07,340
problem that stage two non-REM sleep, which actually happens most in the second half of the

813
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,500
night. In the second half of the night, you're having either REM sleep or stage two. And in fact,

814
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,940
if you look at those sleep spindles, they exponentially increase towards the end of the

815
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:22,780
night. So you get most of your sleep spindle rich sleep in the last two hours of the night. The

816
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:28,700
reason that's important is because you not only need sleep after learning to consolidate to save

817
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:35,660
those memories, you also need sleep before learning to get your brain ready in preparation

818
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:42,140
to actually lay down new memories. And there it's stage two non-REM sleep and these spindles.

819
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,940
So what we've discovered is that the more of those sleep spindles that you have,

820
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,620
the greater refreshment of your memory encoding ability to. So think about it like this.

821
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,740
Yeah. And this is a very beautiful experimental demonstration because you can surgically deprive

822
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,620
people of each of those. And I've seen other talks you've given, of course, and in your book,

823
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:07,500
you touch on this, where you could preferentially from an experimental standpoint, prevent somebody

824
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,660
from consolidating memory and you could similarly prevent them from forming new memory.

825
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:16,860
Even though we can keep the total amount of sleep consistent. So it's not a stressor,

826
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,500
it's not that wakefulness, it's you can selectively excise just like you said,

827
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,580
individual stages of sleep. What's the biggest detriment that persons face clinically with the

828
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,860
reduction of REM? I think right now, based on the weight of the evidence, it probably starts with

829
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:40,300
mental health. Anything from depression, anxiety through to disease, anxiety, depression, and then

830
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,820
suicidality. I think one of the most striking things that we've been seeing in our hands and

831
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,540
other people have demonstrated to them, this is probably the second other big area of work that we

832
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,260
do here at the sleep center is sleep and mental health. You know, sleep is emotional first aid,

833
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:02,220
bottom line period. And what you find is that in young teenagers, one of the strongest predictors

834
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,420
of firstly suicidal ideation, in other words, thoughts of taking their own life,

835
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:14,220
strongest predictors of suicide attempts, and tragically, a very strong predictor of suicide

836
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,460
completion is insufficient sleep and sleep fragmentation. And what we've been finding is

837
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,340
that it's REM sleep that seems to provide essentially a form of overnight therapy.

838
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:32,620
And it's REM sleep that resets or recalibrates the emotional networks in the brain. And there's a

839
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:38,060
series, there's a network of them that involves an area called the prefrontal cortex, and particularly

840
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,060
the middle part of the prefrontal cortex, which acts like a top down regulator of your emotions.

841
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,300
So there's deep emotional brain centers, centers like the amygdala, which is a centerpiece region

842
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,700
for the generation of strong, impulsive, aversive negative reactions. Anyone with a young boy knows

843
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,260
what the amygdala does. Right. Exactly. If they have a temper tantrum in the middle of, you know,

844
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,020
the supermarket, it's because firstly, their prefrontal cortex, you know, has just not developed

845
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:12,620
yet. And what little of it that there is, if they haven't slept well, is obliterated. That's actually

846
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,740
a really great example of one of the most obvious observations. Like we taught, you know, I mean, any

847
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:25,020
parent listening to this knows how emphatically you protect the nap. Correct. You know, and it's like-

848
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:30,620
For mental, for emotional, mental health. Yeah, just for behavioral health of the child. Correct.

849
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,820
And it's sort of like your day revolves around the nap. Like, can you go to Disneyland today? I don't

850
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,220
know. It depends if we get the nap schedule and, you know, yes or no. And what you're basically

851
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:46,860
providing is a technical explanation for something that is so empirically obvious, it's undeniable.

852
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,820
And it's not the opposite, right? So bear with me for a moment. When it comes to the broader mental

853
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:57,100
health stuff, you could easily construct an argument that says the arrow of causality is the

854
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:03,420
other way. The person who is anxious, it's the anxiety that's keeping them awake. Now, my guess

855
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,580
is in reality, these two feed off each other constantly. I think you're right. You might be

856
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,300
predisposed to anxiety that fosters lack of sleep. The lack of sleep amplifies and boom,

857
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,860
boom, boom, boom. It's a two way street, but is the traffic flowing more dominantly in one direction

858
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:21,260
than the other? And I think this is what your point you're going to make. But then the behavior of a

859
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:27,260
four year old is a perfect example of you only need to screw that up one night. You give a four

860
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:34,540
year old one bad night or miss one nap. I mean, it's very obvious how that translates into the

861
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:40,220
behavior. So that would point in the direction of the sleep can really be the driver of the

862
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,860
pathology if you want to use pathology to describe that, which of course is a strong term to describe,

863
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:49,500
you know, outbursts of four year olds. But just to make the point, right? That to me is one of the

864
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,780
most interesting, albeit somewhat glib examples. But I think it's so consistent, you know, and I

865
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,220
use that frequently where you often see a parent with a child and the child is crying and they

866
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,540
look at you and they say, well, they just didn't sleep well asleep. As if there's this universal

867
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:09,820
parental knowledge that bad sleep the night before equals bad mood and emotional reactivity the next

868
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:16,860
day. And what's striking is that if you look at the data somewhere between infancy and even now

869
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:24,300
childhood, not only do we abandon the notion that sleep is absolutely essential and non-negotiable,

870
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,340
but we start to stigmatize it with this label of laziness that you're slothful or that your child

871
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:37,980
is slothful for getting sufficient sleep. And the reason that upsets me, and I am, I'm getting a

872
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:43,340
little bit, I'm getting a little bit animated, which is off for a British man. But the, you know,

873
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:50,300
the reason I do is because firstly, you know, it took mother nature 3.6 million years to put this

874
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:56,780
eight hour thing called a night of sleep in place. And within the space of 70 years, if you look at

875
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:02,620
the data, we've lopped off almost 20 to 25% of that. You know, imagine coming along and saying,

876
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:08,780
you know, in the next hundred years, I think what I'm going to do is for the entirety of human

877
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:15,020
society, I'm going to reduce their oxygen saturation by about 20 to 25%. Do you think that's a good

878
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:20,780
idea? And the answer is no. No, it's such a great example. I'll pause for a moment just to tell a

879
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:26,700
funny story that you and I have talked about off mic, which is up until about 2012, I was in the

880
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:32,540
I'll sleep when I'm dead camp. And I know what led to that. It wasn't that there was a very deliberate

881
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,220
decision at the end of medical school when a good friend of mine with all the best intentions, who

882
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:44,140
was a year ahead of me. So he was now in at the end of his internship, as I was about to begin mine,

883
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,540
he said, and this is in the days when we didn't have the 80 hour work week requirement in residency.

884
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:58,300
So we averaged, I think about 114 hours a week in the hospital. So he said to me, look, Peter,

885
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,740
you're, you're signing up for, you know, whatever five, seven years of this thing.

886
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:07,740
If you spent every moment outside of the hospital sleeping, you would still be tired.

887
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:15,420
The only difference is you wouldn't have any fun. So make sure you live every moment that you're not

888
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,740
in the hospital to the fullest. And so for me, that basically meant if I wasn't in the hospital,

889
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:24,540
I was swimming, I was going out with my friends, I was trying to meet girls, like I was doing

890
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:30,620
anything, everything such that during that period of my life, I, I just know, because I was pretty

891
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:35,500
adamant about recording how much time, like I was very wed to this idea. There's 168 hours in a week.

892
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,060
If I'm spending, you know, 114 of them here, and I spend this many driving and I spend this many

893
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:44,140
getting groceries and I spend this many swimming and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think I, I was

894
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:50,700
about 28 hours a week of sleep. So it wasn't four every night because you'd have none and then six

895
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,900
and then three and then eight. Like you, you could binge sleep from time to time,

896
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,860
but it was pretty much 28 a week. I'll come back to some of the implications of that. But fast

897
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,780
forward a few years. I'm talking to a good friend of mine, Kirk Parsley, who's a physician who,

898
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:08,220
like you, is adamant about, you know, the importance of sleep. And we're having dinner

899
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:13,420
one night and he says, he's challenging me on this. And he says, so let me get this straight.

900
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:19,740
You've just decided that you're going to sleep half of what is evolutionarily programmed. And I said,

901
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:26,540
yeah, he goes, does it strike you as odd that evolution would have designed us to spend a third

902
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:34,780
of our life not mating, not watching out for predators, not hunting for food, but doing this

903
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,260
thing for some other purpose. Do you think that thing must have been important? And it was such

904
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:44,140
an obvious argument, but it really overnight changed the way I thought about this, which was

905
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:52,380
evolution went to great lengths to do this and superficially at great cost to us. Right. I mean,

906
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,940
you could argue, well, imagine you didn't need to sleep and you could spend 24 hours a day

907
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:02,540
foraging for food or a mate or some other thing, but it didn't. So it's sort of, it's sort of like

908
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:08,140
there's probably a reason we are not anaerobic to your point about reducing oxygen saturation by

909
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:13,020
25%. You know, if you were to think about that, you know, during sleep, just as you said, you're

910
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:18,700
not eating, you're not finding food, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're

911
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:24,700
not caring for your young, you're vulnerable to predation on any one of those grounds,

912
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:29,180
but especially all of them put together as a collective. It's completely anti-evolutionary.

913
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:34,060
It sounds like the dumbest thing. And, you know, I often said, and it has been said before,

914
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:40,380
if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital set of functions, it's the biggest mistake

915
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:47,340
that the evolutionary process has ever made. And we now realize from this constellation of evidence

916
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:52,540
that mother nature did not make a spectacular blunder in putting this thing called an eight

917
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:58,940
hour sort of need of sleep in place. It is the greatest life support system that you could ever

918
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,940
wish for. It is a remarkable health insurance policy. And what's great is that it's largely

919
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:11,500
democratic. It's mostly free. And in terms of a prescription from a doctor, it's largely painless.

920
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,460
So I almost wanted to title a book, Consciousness is Overrated,

921
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:23,180
or just sometimes dot, dot, dot, consciousness is overrated. But when you really look at the

922
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:30,060
evidence in terms of risk derisking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed

923
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:36,620
world, it's very hard to look no further than sleep. And that's why I don't want to trivialize

924
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:42,940
diet and I don't want to trivialize movement and activity. But what I would say is that if you want

925
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:48,060
to put sleep up against either one of those two and kind of play the whole head to head game,

926
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:54,860
which I don't think we need to do here, I would simply say that sleep is the foundation on which

927
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:59,180
those two other things sit. It's not the third pillar of good health. I think it is the foundation.

928
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:05,100
That's a really interesting way to think about it, because I typically describe four pillars or five,

929
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,140
if you include all of the exogenous molecules that you could lump together. But another way to

930
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,500
think about it, which again, I don't think is necessarily the right way to think about it,

931
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:18,620
but sometimes it makes the point. If you deprive yourself of food, how long can you survive?

932
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:26,300
Well, we have one person up to 382 days. Even someone who's as lean as you could survive 30

933
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,100
days with no food. How long could you survive without water? Depends greatly on the temperature,

934
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:38,780
et cetera. But you could make the case that deprivation of sleep would result in the quickest

935
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:44,780
reduction of health, certainly more than not eating or not exercising for a period of time.

936
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,620
And those studies have been done in rats.

937
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:50,060
And actually we know some of this from humans who have been trying to... In fact,

938
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:53,980
didn't the Guinness Book of World Records, I can't remember if I read this in your work,

939
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:58,620
they've actually banned attempts at longest period of sleep deprivation.

940
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,580
So I mentioned this. Yeah.

941
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,940
Yeah. You might leave it in the book.

942
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,140
There was a time when you could still try and beat the world record of sleep deprivation.

943
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:10,380
And it got up to about sort of, I think the last true effort was about 24 days.

944
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:17,900
But I think it was debatable, that one. But based on the weight of the scientific data,

945
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:23,980
the relationship between sleep loss and mental health, sleep loss and cancer,

946
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:30,620
sleep loss, cardiovascular disease, sleep loss and metabolic syndrome, Guinness started to feel

947
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:36,620
very, very uncomfortable. And then when suicide came on the table, it pulled it. So in other words,

948
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:41,260
think about this, there was a gentleman, Felix Baumgardner, I think his name was,

949
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:47,980
who sponsored by Red Bull, went up in a capsule in a hot air balloon to the outer surface of our

950
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,660
planet. This was about four years ago.

951
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,860
Four years ago. This was remarkable.

952
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:58,860
He opened the door and then he jumped out and he fell back down to earth at over a thousand

953
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:05,740
kilometers an hour using his body alone. He broke the sound barrier and he successfully came down.

954
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:15,100
And now Guinness says for that, just fine. However, to sleep deprive yourself, no,

955
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,620
much more unsafe. We're not going to let it happen.

956
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,700
You are allowed just to put it in context.

957
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,900
You're allowed up to 12 jumps off Niagara Falls.

958
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,260
Basically.

959
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,300
But that's okay. But no, no, you're not going to, that's such a great point. I want to go back to

960
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:33,020
one other thing to close the loop on this. And again, the listener may say, boy, this is where

961
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,020
there's a lot of stuff going on here, but there really is. Like this is, I think you have to have

962
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,460
a lot, and I'm trying to think about all the questions I can ask that others would have.

963
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,940
If you took two individuals who are sleeping six hours a night, if you have one person who,

964
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:50,380
just for the argument's sake, is doing it from 9 PM to 3 AM, and another person is doing it

965
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,020
from midnight to 6 AM, would you expect, or even if it were, let's make it even more clear,

966
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,860
it's the same individual, but you do it over a period of weeks. You transition them from

967
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:06,540
9 to 3 versus midnight to 6. Would their sleep wave cycles look the same? Would they still be

968
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:12,780
truncating the same amount of REM at the tail end of that? Or would they start to do some forward

969
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,660
truncation?

970
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:22,060
So essentially what happens is that your brain has a different hunger or different appetite

971
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:26,780
for different types of sleep. So think of those different stages of sleep, like a finger buffet,

972
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:34,060
and at different times of the night, that buffet is going to be sort of consumed more heavily

973
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:41,660
in terms of the deep non-REM sleep phase, which would probably be the hours from 9 PM through

974
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:48,380
until about sort of 3 AM. That's really the window of preferential appetite for your brain

975
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:53,660
when it comes to deep non-REM sleep. That's when it will preferentially eat at that type of sleep.

976
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:01,740
But then from about 3 AM through until about midday, then the brain shifts in terms of its

977
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:08,140
pattern. If you let people just sleep it out, if you look at sort of extreme owls who, and we

978
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,220
should speak about chronotypes at some point, but people who like to go to bed very late and wake

979
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:18,140
up very late, essentially there, then the buffet is going to get hit hard in terms of REM sleep

980
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:25,660
devouring. So I make that point that your brain has different taste sensitivities to non-REM and REM

981
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:31,900
across the 24 hour clock face, because it means that if you're shortchanging your sleep by two

982
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:37,740
hours, but you're doing it by going to bed very early and waking up very early, then what's going

983
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:41,900
to happen is that you're probably going to be losing most of your REM sleep because most of your

984
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:47,820
REM sleep happens in the late morning hours and you're already awake by 3 or 4 AM in the morning.

985
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:53,580
And so you're not getting the chance to get into those REM sleep rich phases. And which of those

986
01:12:53,580 --> 01:13:00,620
patients would develop more appetite for sleep the subsequent evening? The person who was deprived,

987
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,220
and you know why I'm asking, by the way, it's exactly what we were talking about earlier.

988
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:09,340
It's this jet lag question. If you know you've got that flight and you need to force yourself

989
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:14,460
to sleep at a time zone, that's not right. I'm just now thinking about, well, I always do the

990
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:20,540
nine to three. Would I be better off doing the, in other words, I'm depriving myself of REM. Would

991
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:25,020
I be better off just describing, just restricting myself? Well, you're depriving yourself of REM,

992
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,900
but you're also still depriving yourself of total sleep as well, you know, when it comes to the jet

993
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,220
like model. And you know, there are, there's some, I think that that's an interesting model. And I

994
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:40,140
think it does work that you can try to in the week before you start to fly, let's say you're going,

995
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:45,820
I'm going home to London, which essentially is eight hours ahead. So I need to now essentially

996
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:50,220
start to sort of, by the time I'm waking up, people in London have already been awake for

997
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:55,660
essentially eight hours. So I need to start to get myself on the schedule. So I start to wake up,

998
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:02,940
you know, 10 minutes earlier for about five days before. And, you know, so I'm only about an hour

999
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:09,900
shifted, but it helps. And then the morning of the flight, I'll wake up really early. And then I

1000
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:15,340
won't make the mistake that everyone makes on those transatlantic flights, which is they sleep

1001
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:20,860
in the second half of the flight. You shouldn't do that. You should sleep in the first half of the

1002
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,740
flight, which is when most people in the UK are asleep. And by the middle of that flight,

1003
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:30,940
most people in the UK, that's the time to wake up. And so you should be waking up that time

1004
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:38,540
so that you build up enough of this sleepiness pressure by the time that you want to get to bed

1005
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:44,300
once you've landed that evening in London. And this won't make too much sense right now. And I

1006
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:48,780
think we'll, we'll speak probably a lot more about this when we speak about caffeine and a denecence

1007
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:55,260
pressure. But that, but to come to your point, you're building up what's called sleep pressure.

1008
01:14:55,260 --> 01:15:01,100
The longer that you're awake, the more of that healthy sleepiness that builds up. But to come

1009
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:08,060
back to the real question at hand, yes, just because you sleep, you know, five hours from one

1010
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:14,060
point in the clock face, maybe earlier in the night to sort of early in the morning versus five hours

1011
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:20,380
late in the morning until later in that day, the type of sleep that you get will not be the same.

1012
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:28,140
You will be selectively shortchanging yourself of sleep, either of deep sleep or of REM sleep on

1013
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,940
either side of that equation. This points out another interesting observation, which I do want

1014
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,620
to spend some time talking about wearables because of course, you know, we're both wearing our

1015
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,540
wearables at the moment. And I think we both acknowledge that, look, I mean, these things

1016
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,140
are still not quite at the level of the polysom and maybe they never will be. I mean, that's a

1017
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,980
very difficult thing to replicate from, you know, something on your wrist or your finger.

1018
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:53,980
But it's so funny, this might explain an observation I always experience when I come

1019
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:59,580
from New York back to California, which is I generally try to stay on California time,

1020
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:04,460
even when I'm in New York, going to bed later, waking up later. And in California, I'm a very

1021
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:09,580
early sleeper and an early riser. So even if I'm trying to keep it at eight hours and eight hours,

1022
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,660
and I can do that very well in California, not as well in New York, my first night back, even my

1023
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:21,420
first two nights back in California, I have much higher deep sleep. And that would explain it. It's

1024
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:26,540
this phase shift that I'm capturing this, I mean, last night was because I came back from New York

1025
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:34,700
last night, you know, went to bed at, I don't know, 8 30 p.m. and got up at five or yeah, probably

1026
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:39,900
4 30 or five in the morning. So you had a huge deep sleep. Exactly. So you've dragged your eight

1027
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:44,540
hour window. If you think about the sort of eight hour window and you slide it back on the clock

1028
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:51,740
phase from midnight to 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. to in fact, nine p.m. You're dragging that eight hour

1029
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:59,820
sleep phase back closer into the deeper sleep rich phase, the deep non-REM sleep that you want.

1030
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:05,420
So what your sort of aura ring will be telling you is you got more deep sleep. And perhaps you

1031
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:11,340
may actually see a little bit of a reduction in REM sleep. As you go to New York, you may see the

1032
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:16,300
opposite. As you sleep later in the morning, you'll get more of that REM sleep. I generally do see that pattern,

1033
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:21,420
which is I get, and it pisses me off too. I'm like, I didn't get as much deep sleep and I got

1034
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:27,100
more REM sleep. And not that REM is bad, but I'm generally more upset by the dearth of deep. You

1035
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,620
know, this is interesting. It's now really I really I really need to think about that because of course,

1036
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:35,420
on some level, our body is responding to cues in the environment. It's not just responding to the

1037
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:39,260
intellectual knowledge that, hey, in California, it's this time, it's time to go to bed. It's,

1038
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:44,540
I mean, light is playing a role. Meal timing is playing a role. Huge meal. And yeah, I want to

1039
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,540
definitely talk with you about this because this is to me, it's such an important topic. And then,

1040
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,180
of course, the accumulation of a denis scene and of course, the melatonin. So by the way, I would just

1041
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:58,620
say that, you know, I think REM sleep, some people, I have this kind of bimodal distribution of

1042
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:04,220
questions. Some people will say, how do I maximize my REM sleep? And I say, why do you want to

1043
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:08,700
maximize your REM sleep? And say, well, that's dream sleep. And that's the good stuff, right?

1044
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:13,980
As if, you know, it's like saying, you know, how do I maximize the amount of yolk in my egg? You know,

1045
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:18,860
do I get like the, can I go the ostrich egg, whatever it is? I don't know what the analogy is.

1046
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,100
And the question is, Mother Nature has found this equilibrium. Don't mess with it. It's the

1047
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:28,860
da Vinci code of sleep and stick to it. You're good to go. But also then other people will say,

1048
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:34,060
you know, how do I get more deep sleep? Or, you know, I, you know, I could get upset by that lack

1049
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:39,420
of deep sleep to come back onto REM sleep and how important it is. The studies have been done where

1050
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:44,540
firstly they deprived. And by the way, these studies have never been done again since the

1051
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:49,660
1980s. And they probably never will be because of the ethics regarding them, because they are just

1052
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:55,020
so devastating that we probably won't be allowed. And rightly so, I think to do these studies

1053
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:00,700
to animals ever again, but they essentially deprived animals of sleep until they died.

1054
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:08,700
And what they found was that rats will firstly die as quickly, if not quicker, almost by about

1055
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:15,020
20% from total sleep deprivation as they will from total food deprivation. So if you want to put

1056
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,820
sleep in food. That's interesting that their gap is much narrower because for humans, the gap is

1057
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:25,180
very, you'll die way earlier from sleep deprivation than food deprivation, unless you're, you know,

1058
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:29,740
the leanest person on the planet. And there is a tragic disorder that I described a little bit in

1059
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:35,100
the book. It's a very rigidly inherited disorder called fatal familial insomnia. And it's really

1060
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:43,500
the only evidence short of the disgusting travesty that is total sleep deprivation used in

1061
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:48,460
certain countries for interrogation tactics that we know of that has led to death.

1062
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:54,460
But withstanding that this disorder, fatal familial insomnia says it in the name that

1063
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:00,620
essentially human beings, how old do people typically survive? It usually takes about 18

1064
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:06,780
to 24 months before they die. But the problem is this is not, they wake up one day and they are

1065
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:11,580
no longer sleeping at all. It's a gradual thing. So it's kind of like it masquerades as just

1066
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:17,020
typical insomnia first restless nights for the first two or three months. Then it gets worse.

1067
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:22,700
Then you're only sleeping four hours. Then, you know, by month 12, you're already sleeping two

1068
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,740
hours. How much of this is genetic versus environmental versus we don't know. It's

1069
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:34,540
strongly heritable that we know. So it's within the Mendelian sort of, you know, pool of genetic

1070
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:39,820
disorders and it's testable. We know the gene. Interestingly, it's what seems to be the single

1071
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:45,980
gene. Yeah. And it's a prion protein gene abnormality, which is, if you don't know about

1072
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,780
prion proteins, you may have heard of mad cow disease, which was rife in the United Kingdom.

1073
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:55,260
That's another thing. That's another prion protein disorder. That's why you can't donate blood.

1074
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,660
And it's also why, yeah, I'll probably forget half of what I've been saying and start repeating

1075
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:04,620
myself because I've been vegetarian for about 12 years. But before I went that route, I think I

1076
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:11,340
definitely was in the phase of eating beef when it was filled with these prions in the United Kingdom.

1077
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,500
So my brain is probably Swiss cheese at this stage, but essentially this disorder,

1078
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:21,580
fatal familiar insomnia, it gives us some degree of disease proof that insufficient sleep is fatal

1079
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,740
for human beings. But we knew it in these rat studies because these rats would die as quickly

1080
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:30,300
from food deprivation as they did from sleep deprivation. But the more striking thing was

1081
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:36,700
then they did a second round of studies. They selectively deprived them of either just non-rapid

1082
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:42,460
eye movement sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. And what they found is that the rats were dead

1083
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:48,860
within about nine to 10 days with total sleep deprivation. They were dead within just about the

1084
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:55,340
same period of time from REM sleep deprivation. Duration was kept constant or also reduced?

1085
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:00,460
It was still reduced somewhat. But you could probably look at a control that had a same

1086
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,340
duration without a selective deprivation. Correct. So it's called, yeah, and there is

1087
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:09,100
a, what's called a yoked paradigm. It's a very clever technique where you can mimic the total

1088
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:14,060
amount of sleep deprivation in one other animal, but the other animal is still getting the chance

1089
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:19,900
to get REM sleep. So REM sleep selectively removed. The rats died basically almost as

1090
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:26,540
quickly as they did from total sleep deprivation. And then non-REM sleep deprivation was deathly.

1091
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:31,820
Ultimately, it just took longer. It took about 20 days. Total sleep deprivation. Let's just say for

1092
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:37,580
argument's sake, you die in nine days. Sleep reduction, but selective REM deprivation. You

1093
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:44,300
die in the same period of time. Basically sleep reduction, but deep deprivation. You live maybe

1094
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:51,100
twice as long. Yeah. So everything deathly, everything fatal, just that one takes a little

1095
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:57,580
bit longer to kill you than the other. And what I find either strange or exciting about that is

1096
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:03,740
if you look from an evolutionary standpoint, those two types of sleep did not emerge at the same time.

1097
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:11,580
We only have observed true rapid eye movement sleep in birds and mammals.

1098
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:20,220
We don't see true rapid eye movement sleep in reptiles, amphibians, fish, or insects. Now,

1099
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:28,220
birds and mammals evolved separately along the evolutionary path from amphibians, fish,

1100
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:34,540
and reptiles. So what this means is that when we went from the transition from being reptilian to

1101
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:42,700
either avian or mammalian, that's when REM sleep emerged because we see non-REM sleep in every

1102
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:48,220
species. Even in insects, we can observe something that looks like non-REM sleep in reptiles, fish,

1103
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:54,860
amphibians, birds, and mammals. Every one of them has non-REM sleep. Not every one of them has REM

1104
01:23:54,860 --> 01:24:01,180
sleep. Only birds and mammals have REM sleep. In other words, REM sleep is the new kid on the block

1105
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:07,420
in the time course of evolution. REM sleep firstly emerged later in the course of evolution. And

1106
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:14,860
secondly, what's kind of wonderful is it emerged twice independently, once in birds and once in

1107
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:21,420
mammals. So you could argue that, well, if deep non-REM sleep, which is much more evolutionary

1108
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:26,060
from an evolutionary perspective, it's in a much older form of sleep, wouldn't it be the much more

1109
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:32,940
necessary fundamental one? And therefore, wouldn't you die sooner? No, it seems the opposite because

1110
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:38,220
you'd say, well, for the same reason that the cockroach can survive the nuclear disaster,

1111
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:43,740
the avian mammalian pathway is more evolved, neuronally, presumably, and therefore probably

1112
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:51,020
requires something essential in REM that when it deprives you, it takes away your superpower,

1113
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:55,660
which is a cortex. And I think that's exactly what it is, which is when you look at anything

1114
01:24:55,660 --> 01:25:01,740
that has essentially a complex nervous system, maybe that's where the pressure for this thing

1115
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:07,820
called REM sleep emerged. Even though we know that non-REM sleep actually supports many essential

1116
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:13,260
central nervous system functions like synaptic pruning and some great sort of neural function,

1117
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,500
you know, the glymphatic system clearing up the 30-cal time function. It's sort of similar to your

1118
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:23,740
oxygen analogy, which is when you go from being an anaerobe to a faculty of anaerobe to an a-robe,

1119
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,980
who's going to be most sensitive to oxygen deprivation? Yeah, exactly. And so, you know,

1120
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,500
it's always a dangerous scientific hypothesis where you can argue it both ways, but I always

1121
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:37,260
found that interesting and it's uncommented, but I just wanted to note that for, you know, 20 minutes

1122
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:43,420
ago in kind of in defense of REM sleep, that, you know, if we should all be worried about the amount

1123
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:48,460
of deep sleep that we're getting, absolutely. But we also need to be worried about how much REM sleep

1124
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:55,740
that we're getting, because from a pure mortality risk standpoint, REM sleep is arguably even more

1125
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:00,780
important than non-REM sleep. And we'll come to this later, but my recollection of the literature is,

1126
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:05,100
and I think you even alluded to this earlier, ethanol's biggest hit is going to be on REM,

1127
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:11,500
isn't it? Hands down. This is where we come on to substances that are misunderstood and misused when

1128
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:16,300
it comes to sleep. And now before we go there, Matt, look, for me, I don't need any more of a case

1129
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:22,700
in the importance of sleep. And I think honestly, the Alzheimer's thing alone should be sufficient

1130
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:28,620
for anyone to take this seriously, because certainly my patients, that's the single most

1131
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:32,060
important thing to them. Now, there are some of them that are more high risk, you know, people

1132
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:36,620
that have, you know, APOE4 genotype that's in the, you know, the direction that would increase risk

1133
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:41,580
or family history, but I don't think I've met a patient yet who doesn't say on some level

1134
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:47,740
preserving cognition as their single highest priority in life. That said, can you spend even

1135
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:53,180
just a minute, a couple of minutes? It's the drive after all. We have all the time in the world,

1136
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:58,300
making the case, the similar case in the presence of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

1137
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:05,180
Yeah. And I want to touch on that point before we go on about this Alzheimer's disease risk. You know,

1138
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:10,860
a lot of people out there may be having this sort of like sleep machismo moment where they have this

1139
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:16,460
braggadocio attitude of getting insufficient sleep. And they say, look, I'm in my fifties and,

1140
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:22,380
you know, I'm fit as a fiddle. And my cognition is razor sharp and I sleep five or six hours a

1141
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:26,700
night. So we've got, you know, heads of state, for example, who are saying this, people who,

1142
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:32,060
you know, have a huge impact on the public and they're saying these things. And it makes me sad

1143
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:39,340
because you can look at two other heads of state who were very vociferous about their proclamation

1144
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:46,620
of the uselessness of sleep, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Both of them were chess beaters

1145
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:51,580
when it came to insufficient sleep. They were very proud of saying that they only got four or five

1146
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:56,140
hours of sleep, that they were immune to the effects of insufficient sleep, that sleep was for

1147
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:01,420
the week and that you can sleep when you're dead, which PS is mortally unwise advice based on the

1148
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:06,540
evidence, the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. That's what all of the studies tell us.

1149
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:13,500
I don't think it's coincidental now looking back that both of them went on to develop Alzheimer's

1150
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:21,260
disease. And it makes me so sad because I saw pictures of Margaret Thatcher in an enfeebled

1151
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:28,220
state of dementia. And I'm just thinking, you know, if only when she was, you know, in her fifties

1152
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:34,860
and had that bravado about sleep, if she could see herself in that bed, in that later state of

1153
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:42,780
life in such a crippled mental cognitive functioning state, would you be so brave about it?

1154
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:47,100
And I would hope that she wouldn't, that humility would come into place.

1155
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:52,060
So that's the first thing about, I think, the insufficient sleep argument and people

1156
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:57,500
rightly being frightened, having the daylights frightened out of them about preserved cognition,

1157
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:02,140
you should have that regarding your sleep. The other one though, that frightens me too,

1158
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:06,700
is the other way that a lack of sleep can get you is not chronically across the lifespan without

1159
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:12,140
Alzheimer's disease, but acutely with car crashes. And I know that we'll come on to this at some

1160
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:17,100
point too. But the only thing I would say is that I get many emails from people who've read the book.

1161
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:24,300
And two months ago, I got an email from a gentleman, I won't name him, and he was in his late thirties.

1162
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:34,620
And he described how three months before that, he had lost his wife and his 18 month, 18 month old

1163
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:41,500
child in a car crash. And it later became apparent that the person who hit them had basically been

1164
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:46,220
surviving on about five and a half hours of sleep for the two months prior that they'd had what's

1165
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:53,580
called a microsleep. They actually lost control of their car at 60 miles an hour at a moderate drift

1166
01:29:53,580 --> 01:30:01,020
angle. You are essentially in the next lane within less than a second and you're in the ditch

1167
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:07,340
after a second. And they went straight head on. And now he was going to have to raise his four-year

1168
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:15,260
old son by himself without the wife that he loved, without the 18 month daughter that they'd invested

1169
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:22,540
in. Because someone perhaps had heard from someone vocally in the public that surviving on five hours

1170
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:30,060
of sleep was something that was okay to do. And to me, that just breaks my heart. I just don't

1171
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:38,220
feel comfortable in having the responsibility like the head of a state of a country. And then

1172
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:44,540
speaking about this thing, this kind of magic attitude of insufficient sleep, because that's

1173
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:50,780
what it can lead to. It can lead to the travesty of the explosion of a nuclear family.

1174
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:57,820
And my guess is, even though it's going to be very difficult to actually quantify this, I believe that

1175
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:06,700
the story you just shared is an especially tragic, poignant example of something that probably occurs

1176
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:11,500
much more than we were able to quantify. I sometimes say to patients, you know, the four

1177
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:16,060
horsemen of death would be these big chronic diseases that kill us, but we can never forget

1178
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:20,700
accidental death. And then when you look at accidental death, how do you quantify it? Well,

1179
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:27,580
it turns out that three forms of accidental death form 80% of them. And the biggest among them is

1180
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:36,380
motor vehicle. Right. And so the question is, what can you do to reduce that risk? So if you look at it,

1181
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:41,500
some form of distraction, and I've included sleep deprivation in that, but now I almost feel like

1182
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,740
they need to be separated out. Distraction, meaning you're puttin' with your phone, you're

1183
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:51,180
checkin' ways, you're doing something you shouldn't be doing with your phone, sleep deprivation,

1184
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:56,700
ethanol, failure to wear a seat belt, and reckless driving. I mean, that basically accounts for it.

1185
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:03,180
It wouldn't surprise me if that sleep deprivation bucket is bigger than we think.

1186
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:10,140
I mean, we've got some decent data on this. And firstly, what we know is, in the hour that we've

1187
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:15,980
been talking already, numerous people have lost their life in a drowsy driving related accident

1188
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:22,300
based on the statistics. We know that already. And the way that we can tell that is both from

1189
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:27,580
speaking to the people who were involved in the accident, but you can also pick this apart from

1190
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:33,100
the dynamics of the accident as well. And here's the problem. When you are under slept, we're not

1191
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:36,940
talking about a night of total sleep deprivation. That's where you fall asleep at the wheel. And

1192
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:42,060
that's the obvious one. The much less obvious one, but the much more common one is what we call

1193
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:48,620
microsleeps. So when you are trying to survive on seven hours of sleep or six hours of sleep,

1194
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:53,100
and it really just takes that little of a dose. By the way, I haven't forgotten our cardiovascular

1195
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:58,220
question. I will come back to it. But what you essentially have are these small lapses,

1196
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:04,620
we call them microsleeps, where the eyelid will partially close. And you can pick this up on a

1197
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:09,580
camera. And they've done these studies systematically where you dose people from getting

1198
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:15,820
nine hours of sleep to eight hours of sleep, seven, six, five, four, three, four, one week,

1199
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:22,780
two weeks, three weeks. These studies have been essentially looked at, sliced and diced

1200
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,940
parametrically. They're probably the best studies done within the field of sleep.

1201
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:32,140
And so we know them very well, what your lapse rate is, what your microsleep rate is.

1202
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:41,180
And what you find is that the eyelid partially closes. And at that point, you no longer react.

1203
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:47,900
And the reason I'm bringing this point up is that drowsy driving accounts for more accidents on our

1204
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:55,500
roads than either drugs or alcohol combined, combined. Now I'm not condoning drink driving

1205
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:01,260
or driving inebriated under any circumstance. What I am saying, however, is that firstly,

1206
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:07,900
drowsy driving is a huge part of this problem on our roads. And the reason that it's not just

1207
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:15,260
problematic is because it's usually much more deathly. When you are drunk, you typically react,

1208
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:22,540
but you react too late. So you do something, but it's not enough. And you crash when you have a

1209
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:29,660
microsleep. Yeah, it's a project. You do nothing. That's why drowsy driving is more fatal than

1210
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:35,580
drunk driving typically is because there is no application of brake. There is no application

1211
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:41,100
of brake. There's no course correction of steering wheel angle. There is nothing. There is simply a

1212
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:48,460
car with no one in control. And it's a two ton missile on the freeway at 65 miles an hour with

1213
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:56,860
no one in charge. This is why I feel really uncomfortable about the idea of public proclamations

1214
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:03,580
of insufficient sleep. And I get that. And there are people, sports stars, all sorts of people who

1215
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:11,820
I respect hugely. And I have an immense amount of sympathy for where they're coming from,

1216
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:18,140
because I think there's a lot of public pressure to be this outspoken. I'm going to be crushing it

1217
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:25,500
on the sports field, and then I'm going to be back in the gym the next morning and sleep is for X,

1218
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:32,220
Y and Z, who cares. But then you get someone in a car and you hear a story like that. And I can't

1219
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,940
help but just have my heart broken. But I think, you know, Matt, your work has come along at a

1220
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:40,380
really interesting point. I mean, I have to be honest with you. I remember when your book came out

1221
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,820
and my initial thought was, does the world need another sleep book? Because there's 2000 of them

1222
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:56,060
out there. And I think there's two things that are different. The first is your book is exceptional.

1223
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:01,900
Actually, I'd say three things. Your book is exceptional. The third is your understanding

1224
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:07,020
of the topic and your credibility is exceptional. And those aren't necessarily synonymous. You can

1225
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:12,380
have really credible, thoughtful people who write a book, but the book itself isn't exceptional,

1226
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,660
or it doesn't hit the tone. And some and conversely, you can have someone who puts

1227
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,900
together a good book, but they themselves don't have the credibility. I think that so you can take

1228
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:27,100
credit for the first two. I think the third is, is the little bit of luck, which is, I think we are

1229
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:34,780
at a point in time where people are ready to hear this. In other words, if you, the exact same

1230
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:40,860
professor wrote the exact same book 20 years ago, I'm not convinced it would have the same impact it

1231
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:45,660
is having today. Now, I don't know, you probably have a better sense than me. I don't know exactly

1232
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:52,780
what accounts for that difference today. Is it that today we are more interested in, you know,

1233
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:57,260
the thin end of the wedge for this might have been our interest in performance. Maybe that is the

1234
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:01,660
thing that first got people to think about this, which is, well, wait a minute, you know, if I want

1235
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:09,900
to be better at X, Y and Z, whether it be my sport, my craft, my whatever, is sleep a tool I need to be

1236
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:14,940
optimizing the way people have for many years realized, hey, what you eat and how you exercise

1237
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:22,220
absolutely impacts your performance. So I'm not, I'm not sure what it is, but I, I have a feeling,

1238
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:30,300
and I actually had this discussion with my daughter a couple of weeks ago, that we will look back at

1239
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:36,940
the way we think about nighttime electronics, sleep deprivation and things like that. We will look back

1240
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:42,700
at that in 20 years, hopefully sooner, the way you and I would look back at, you know, a smoking

1241
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:49,580
mother being told by her doctor, smoke this brand versus that brand. Like we can't even fathom that

1242
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:55,980
that was a discussion that took place as recently as about 1966 in the United States. And yet we're

1243
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:01,500
kind of in the, our infancy in the dark from a clinical perspective, from sort of a public

1244
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:07,500
health perspective and functioning on this. So firstly, I mean, so much great stuff to unpack there.

1245
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:13,180
I think you're absolutely right. I think the success of the book is largely despite my,

1246
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:19,420
my ability to, to write and convey ideas. I think what happened is that it was a perfect storm

1247
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:24,700
where there has been- I gave you, I gave you two thirds of the credit. Thank you. And I, and I,

1248
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:29,580
I don't know if I can take them. I feel so ashamed, but I think that the middle point is

1249
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:39,980
the erosion of sleep time has hit an all time high. We are now sleeping less than we have ever done

1250
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:45,820
in what seems to be the history of our species. Now we can't say that for sure, but what we

1251
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:51,100
certainly can say is that back in the earliest record that we have of a systematic questionnaire,

1252
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:57,020
which was in 1942 by Gallup, what they found was that the average American adult was sleeping 7.9

1253
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:03,100
hours a night. Now that number is down to six hours and 31 minutes. That's the average

1254
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:08,140
6,031 minutes. That must mean that- How linear has that decline been,

1255
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,500
Matt? Has that been something- Nonlinear.

1256
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,100
Yeah. It's accelerating, isn't it? It's accelerating. Yeah. So I think you've,

1257
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:19,980
you've had this ballistic erosion of sleep time, this decimation of sleep throughout

1258
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:23,980
industrialized nations. And it's not just America, by the way, Japan is even worse. It's down to

1259
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:30,380
6,021 minutes. My home country, the United Kingdom, not much better, 6,049 minutes.

1260
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:37,500
And these are averages. You've got to imagine that at least a third of the people are probably

1261
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,700
trying to survive on five hours of sleep, certainly during the week they are.

1262
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:49,100
It's that plus this incredible explosion of sleep science over the past 30 years.

1263
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:54,620
And this perfect storm has led to a collision where society is sleeping less.

1264
01:39:55,180 --> 01:40:01,100
Disease and sickness has been escalating in a manner that, you know, we've almost never seen

1265
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:07,900
before. And the knowledge of what sleep is doing, we know far more now, sleep is not just curing

1266
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:15,100
sleepiness. Sleep is actually supporting, there is no physiological system in the body and there is

1267
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:21,340
no operation of the brain that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you get it or demonstrably

1268
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:27,660
impaired when you don't get enough. That knowledge and the causal knowledge of sleep in that, it's

1269
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:33,340
not just associational. It is many of them are causal links with those disease states. I think

1270
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:40,700
led to this ability to write this book at this time that felt as though it was somewhat unequivocal

1271
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:45,660
that it was very difficult to argue with. You know, you can pick apart one study from another,

1272
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:53,420
but when you build that blueprint manifesto, when you build the scientific cold, hard, rational,

1273
01:40:53,980 --> 01:41:00,140
emotion-free case for sleep, it's very difficult to argue with. And it just happened that we were

1274
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:06,620
at that time in our human history with sleep and we were at that time in our scientific journey

1275
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:12,140
regarding our understanding of sleep. I think that's why the book felt like it needed to be

1276
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:16,940
written and needed to be written now. For what it's worth, you had many moons on the front and

1277
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:25,420
back cover, so my little I.R. thing was delighted. He loves that. He's probably read literally from

1278
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:30,860
cover to back cover. Back cover, nothing in between. Yeah, exactly. That's just fine. I ask people,

1279
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,260
they please, you don't have to read the book, you just have to buy it. That's all I ask.

1280
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:39,820
Okay, there's like literally a hundred more things I want to ask you about. So

1281
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:46,620
can you make the case for why cardiovascular disease is worsened by or accelerated by

1282
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:50,300
sleep deprivation? And then same question I'm going to ask you in a moment for cancer.
