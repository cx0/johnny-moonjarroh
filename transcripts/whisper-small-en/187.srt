00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Hey, Sam. How are you doing today?

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,760
I'm doing good. How are you?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:22,400
Good. Good. Congratulations on the publication of your book very recently. Having never done

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,840
that before, I can still only imagine it's akin to giving birth or something like that.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,120
It feels like the weight of the world off your shoulders after how much research you've put into

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,280
that.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:41,200
Yeah, it's a huge relief just to be done. So I'm trying to think about a future project,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,640
but I feel like I need a few years just to relax now.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,800
Oh, yeah, yeah. I imagine there's nothing more annoying than when you publish a book when somebody

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,240
says, so what's your next book going to be about? It's like, let me bask in this one.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,120
Yeah, I've done that a few times.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,120
Like many books that go really deep into a topic, be it science or otherwise, they often start out

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,480
as articles. And of course, you wrote a piece, was it 2015? When was that piece?

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,320
It came out in 2016.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,760
Yeah. And it was the New York Times Magazine piece, correct?

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,800
Right.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,320
And I remember that quite well. You and I had spoken quite a bit before then. And I know that

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,960
that sort of ultimately led to the work that went into this book. But more broadly speaking,

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,600
what attracted you to this topic of Warburg cancer metabolism, the era of Nazi Germany,

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
and science in that era? What gravitated you to that?

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,080
Yeah. I mean, like so many people in this world, I was influenced by Taubes at a fairly early stage

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,760
of my interest in metabolism. I read some of his work and that had led me

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,240
to other authors and eventually to a lot of your work and your blog, which I learned a lot from.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,840
So I had been interested in metabolism for a number of years. But I had not really thought

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,880
of cancer as a metabolic disease or thought about cancers being lumped with obesity and diabetes and

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,000
heart disease. And when I start to read more about that and see that they clustered together

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,160
and that you see the same pattern that begins in the 19th century of all these metabolic

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,960
conditions growing more common, that's what really sort of sparked my curiosities. You know,

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,000
cancer isn't supposed to be metabolic like these other diseases. You know, it's bad luck. It's

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,440
mutations that are caused by environmental carcinogens or whatnot. So it just stayed in

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,200
my mind. But I hadn't planned to write about it until I came across a mention of Warburg. I think

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,760
it was just one sentence, you know, 1923, a German scientist makes an important discovery

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,440
about the metabolism of cancer cells. And, you know, so I Google Otto Warburg and I start to

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,440
read about him and, you know, it was kind of a light bulb moment for me like, oh my gosh,

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,680
I have to write about this man. You know, because I'm a journalist, a storyteller by profession. And

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
so I don't write about science usually unless I feel like I know how to tell a story. If I have

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,920
a central character, then I know how to tell a story. So once I had Warburg, I knew I was going

39
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,920
to write about it and I knew I had a way to tell the story. Before we get to that story,

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,080
I want to kind of understand a little bit about your work as a writer. You're a prolific writer,

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,680
you actually teach a course in science writing at Johns Hopkins now, don't you? Yes, I do. So

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,000
when did you realize you were a writer? Well, my father is a writer, so it helped to have that,

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,680
you know, for many people grow up, it seems like a, you know, an unusual career choice. But for me,

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,720
it was, you know, obviously, you know, potential option, just having seen my father do it. But

45
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,880
truth is, I didn't try to at least not consciously to follow in his footsteps. If anything,

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,800
I thought that, you know, I might need to distinguish myself by choosing a different path.

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,960
And, you know, I like my father mostly writes fiction, I like to half joke that my big rebellion

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,840
was moving into nonfiction. But it really was in college when, you know, I wasn't sure what I was

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,200
going to do. And I was getting a lot of praise for my writing. And, you know, the praise felt good.

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,440
And I, you know, I wasn't, you know, killing it necessarily in other areas. So, you know,

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,400
I saw that it was my strength, I enjoyed doing it. And I sort of, you know, just continued with it

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,360
because I was succeeding with it. So do you think a good writer is born or made or how much of your

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,200
success do you attribute to some inborn gift versus something you'd been cultivating and nurturing and

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,320
practicing? Yeah, it's a tough question. I think about it a lot because I teach science writing and

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,400
general creative writing at Johns Hopkins now. And, you know, I certainly think that everybody

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,960
can improve a lot as a writer. And, you know, I think clearly every day about how to get better at

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,440
teaching it and helping people improve. But, you know, at some level, it's innate. You know,

58
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,280
some people have more natural ability than others with language. But I think it's pretty analogous

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
to, you know, musical talent where some people can very quickly get very good at an instrument,

60
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
sit down on the piano in a matter of weeks, be good and others will struggle for months and

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,920
have to practice again and again. But they eventually get there. So, you know, it's not,

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't think it's correlated that strongly with intelligence. It's a sort of just an ability to,

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
you know, use language in a certain way that comes naturally to some people and comes to other people

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,320
with more practice. But I think everybody can get pretty good with enough practice.

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,520
So when you're teaching a class, let's just say there's a hundred students in the class,

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,200
what type of an assignment would you give if you wanted to very quickly figure out the

67
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,040
breadth of natural ability or the spectrum of natural ability across the students? How would

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,040
you ferret that out quickly? The truth is that you can see it in almost any writing sample. You know,

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm on the faculty of Johns Hopkins. I'm also involved in the application,

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,160
in reviewing applications and selecting students for the science writing program.

71
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,520
And, you know, they submit samples of their writing, but I often look most closely just at

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,560
the cover letters because I feel like, you know, within a paragraph or two, I get the feel, you

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,080
know, if they have a feel for the language or not. So it really comes across, you know, I think

74
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,520
almost in any three or four sentences, I can start to feel is, you know, are there extra words in

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,640
these sentences? Is the logic tight? Does it flow? It really doesn't take very much to figure it out.

76
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,800
That's amazing. And it makes me feel so self-conscious because of how often I write,

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,320
you know, every Sunday I'm putting out a newsletter and I enjoy writing a lot, but

78
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,800
it doesn't, I don't feel like it comes naturally to me so I can imagine, you know, how many people

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
must read that and go, oh my God, like, yeah, what he's saying is interesting, but he's such a horrible

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
writer. And of course, I know what it's like to read very good writing. You know, you can sort of

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,160
spot the extremes or at least I can spot the extremes. I don't think I could rank 100 people

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,920
from one to 100, even though obviously there's somewhat, you know, there's a lot of subjective

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,600
stuff in there, but, you know, I could certainly say this is exceptional. Like I can read Sid

84
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,880
Mukherjee and say, wow, this is really, really good. And similarly, I can read something that

85
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,240
is absolutely horrible and say, this is really, really bad. I might not be able to tell you why,

86
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,200
though. So how much of it is also being able to in that cover letter, say,

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
you gave a couple of examples, right? Like this person is using a lot of unnecessary

88
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,280
words or they're presumably repeating themselves or this is illogical. That's a lot to pick up in

89
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,240
just a paragraph. Yeah. I mean, I think it comes down to clarity more than anything. You can read

90
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
something and grasp it right away because the language is concise and clear and you can read

91
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,480
other things where it's just a very simple statement, but you actually have to read it two

92
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:40,640
or three times just to grasp the writer's meaning. So, you know, George Orwell famously wrote about

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,480
politics and English language and, you know, how much good writing depends on clear, concise

94
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,600
thinking. And I think that's true. But such a big part of it, you know, everything that I write

95
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,360
comes out pretty poorly in the first draft, even my emails that if I really care about an email,

96
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,520
I'll spend a lot of time just going over and over and over because it's the repetition,

97
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,920
it's correction after correction after correction where the writing starts to improve. So,

98
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,600
you know, I think the difference between a good writer and a less good writer is often,

99
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,600
you know, how many times the good writer goes over the work, whereas the lesser writer will

100
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,520
just say, yeah, doesn't matter that much and send it off. But there's a price to pay. You know,

101
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,800
I waste half my life worrying about sentences and an email. So, you know, it comes at a cost.

102
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,440
And, you know, for the record, I was a big fan of your blog when you were posting more regularly.

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,680
So I think you're being too hard on yourself. Thanks. Did you go to journalism school or did

104
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,840
you do something after undergrad to further hone your writing skills? I did. I graduated and then

105
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:55,280
I took a few years off to work at a magazine and then I spent two years doing a MFA program at

106
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,680
Columbia. It's a creative nonfiction program. So it's not journalism. I thought about going to

107
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,960
the journalism school, but I chose creative nonfiction because I was interested more in long

108
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,560
form and more in sort of, you know, storytelling as opposed to rigorous reporting that, you know,

109
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,960
I do that as well. But I was really more interested in book writing and sort of long form nonfiction.

110
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,960
And how do they teach at that level? I mean, obviously people who show up to do a two year

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,040
MFA at Columbia, which is arguably the best school in the United States, at least to study that subject

112
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
matter, you're dealing with a bunch of really talented people to begin with. But what are they

113
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,560
doing in two years to take you to the next level? Yeah, it's mostly a writing workshop. So,

114
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,160
you know, every semester you have a group of about 15 students and a professor and you submit,

115
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,800
you know, three, four times during the semester, you submit your own work and everybody in the

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,560
class critiques it. And the professor, of course, you know, critiques it and discusses it. And that's

117
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,520
really the heart of most writing education. And it's a grueling process at times. You know, you

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,200
have 15 people sitting there telling you everything that's wrong with your work and you can't listen

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,840
to all of them. And they often disagree and you can go a little crazy, you know, trying to make

120
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,720
your work sort of fit everybody's expectations. There are some writers in recent years who have

121
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,240
really been pushing back against this workshop approach because they feel it turns every piece

122
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,360
into sort of a formulaic story or essay where you meet a certain set of expectations that everybody

123
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
has and you don't do more experimental work. So there are a lot of debates about that. But

124
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,640
I do think it's really important because even the best writers in the world don't know when

125
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,960
their own work is working. You know, you need feedback from other people. So much of it is

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,920
trial and error and, you know, writing a short story. I might use the first person, you know,

127
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,120
telling it from my own perspective. And then everybody says it's not working. So I try it

128
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,640
again and I write from the third person not using the I. And then it suddenly works. And you don't

129
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,960
really know what works until you get responses because when you're writing, you know, if you get

130
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,640
on a roll, everything feels good. Everything, you know, if you're in that space for, you know,

131
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,840
a few minutes when you're writing, you think, oh, I'm on a roll. This is great. And then you show it

132
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,800
to your workshop and nobody likes it. So you need that feedback. And, you know, maybe sometimes

133
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,960
you're right and they're wrong, but ultimately you're trying to publish your work for an audience.

134
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,320
So the audience has to be right at some level. Does it amaze you when you see

135
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,600
people like, you know, Atul Gawande and Sid Mukherjee and Azra Raza, people who didn't

136
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
necessarily formally train in writing, but who seem to write beautifully?

137
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
Yeah. I mean, it's beyond amazing. It's actually really annoying and frustrating.

138
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,560
I, it just, you know, all, you know, I admire all three of the people you mentioned and,

139
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,040
you know, not only are they exceptional writers, but, you know, they're full-time

140
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,280
physicians and doing these incredible things. And it just absolutely blows my mind that

141
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
they have the time to do it. And when they do it, they do it, you know, almost,

142
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,600
in a way that's almost unimaginably good. Like I get depressed reading Mukherjee because I think,

143
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,520
you know, what's the point of me even trying when he's writing in this way? So I don't know how they

144
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,840
do it, but, you know, I just have to accept that, you know, very few people reach that level and you

145
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,480
can still do good things that you're not reaching that level. Well, that's definitely a good way to

146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,840
think about it. So let's get back to the, to the story here. And let's assume that the listener

147
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,720
here doesn't really know anything about Warburg. That name means nothing to them. What's the,

148
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,960
where's the right place to begin this story? We've, you know, he's born into a pretty well-to-do

149
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:03,520
family in the kind of latter third of the 19th century. Tell us where to pick up this story.

150
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,240
Sure. Yeah, I do think that his childhood is a really important part of the story. You know,

151
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,680
I had a hard time finding a lot of original sources and documents about his childhood, but the

152
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,040
the basic facts are that, you know, his father, Emil Warburg, is a very prominent physicist,

153
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,760
despite coming from a famous Jewish family. He rises to the top of German physics. He's at the

154
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,480
University of Berlin, which is very unusual for somebody of a Jewish background in the late 19th

155
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,640
century. And Einstein really loves his father. He says that he's like his favorite physicist and,

156
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,880
you know, Emil Warburg ends up providing some of the experimental proof for some of Einstein's

157
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,600
theories. So Einstein was a regular in the house when Warburg was a teenager, Max Planck, Emil

158
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,120
Fischer, you know, all these titans of German science. And, you know, the Germans revered their

159
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,400
scientists. The country was at the top of the scientific world at the time. So Warburg's,

160
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
you know, vision for himself is, you know, he's going to grow up and be a great scientist, like

161
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,240
the people that hang around in his house. He's going to make a world-changing discovery, just as

162
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,440
his father and Einstein and Emil Fischer have. And the question is where he's going to, you know,

163
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
focus his energies. And he moves away from physics, which is a little surprising.

164
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,200
I think that was his rebellion in a way. And he wanted to outdo his father, Emil Warburg.

165
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,920
And so he moves into the realm of biology and physiology. But it's always throughout his life,

166
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,720
through the lens of a physicist and always interested in energy and how, you know,

167
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,840
we can understand biology through an understanding of energy. So he didn't fully move away from his

168
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,240
father so much as take the physics into a new realm. And that extended to a study of photosynthesis as

169
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:05,120
well. So how old was he at the beginning of World War I? That's a good question. At the beginning of

170
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:12,960
World War I, he, I'd have to go back and do the math. So it was 1914 and he was born in 1883.

171
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,720
So he was in his early 30s, I guess. And so what was the impact of World War I on German scientists?

172
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:32,800
It was, you know, pretty remarkable that, you know, given that if you look back from a historical

173
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,360
perspective, I don't think that Germany's position at the time is particularly defensible, but there

174
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,320
was, you know, just this huge surge of nationalism and the scientists were by and large got, you know,

175
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,320
signed on and signed letters in support of the fatherland and were ready to go fight on the

176
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,840
front lines. And, you know, many of them did. In some cases, you know, many of these scientists were

177
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Jewish and because of the politics at the time, they were, you know, their German patriotism was

178
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,840
questioned. So by signing up for the war effort, this was a way to prove they were full Germans.

179
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,960
So that was a big part of it. And many of them went to the battlefield and others,

180
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,600
you know, worked with Fritz Haber, who develops these gas weapons and, you know, all these sort

181
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,120
of new weapons of war that are coming out of German science. You know, it surprises me that

182
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,720
Warburg went to the battlefield rather than working with Fritz Haber, who, you know, he knew

183
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,920
and, you know, was in, you know, ended up working in the same area in Dalam where Warburg worked. So

184
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,160
it's hard to understand why that happened. But, you know, I think Warburg was really wanted to

185
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,520
prove himself and he loved horses and he joined a cavalry regiment. So I think that was a part of

186
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,640
the appeal for him as well. Now, Einstein urged him not to go, correct?

187
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,880
Well, Einstein, Warburg went and then Einstein wrote a letter to him in 1918. So the war was

188
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,720
nearing its end. And by that point, you know, everybody could see everybody who was rational

189
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,600
and paying attention that it was a lost cause. Germans were dying by the tens of thousands.

190
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,080
And, you know, as madness as Warburg's mother put it, and they want their desperate, you know,

191
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,600
for Warburg to come home, his parents are desperate. So they're friends with Einstein and

192
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
they can't convince Warburg to come home. So they turned to Einstein and, you know, they know that

193
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
Warburg reveres Einstein and they say, you know, will you write him a letter? So, so Einstein does.

194
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,080
And it's really a perfect letter because it, you know, he knew Warburg well enough to know that

195
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,200
he was a narcissist. And so he wrote the letter saying that you're just too important for science.

196
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,280
We can't afford to lose you. And we don't have Warburg's response to that letter, but sure enough,

197
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,120
he comes home shortly thereafter. So I think it was the letter from Einstein that most likely

198
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,640
convinced him and, you know, possibly saved his life. And, you know, five years later, he makes his

199
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,560
great breakthrough about cancer fermentation. So I like to think that, you know, that Einstein may,

200
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,200
you know, have saved his life and therefore deserves credit for this great cancer discovery

201
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,560
as well. And some indirect way. You wrote about Warburg that he was pathologically dedicated to

202
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,960
his science. What did you mean by that? Yeah. I mean, I think it's hard to understand unless

203
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,120
you grew up in 19th century Germany, but, you know, somebody, a friend who knew him,

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,440
described it as having a religious devotion, like a prophet who has like this fervor who

205
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,560
just thinks about nothing but science and is passionate about science. You know,

206
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,040
Warburg used to say a scientist has to be prepared to die for the truth,

207
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,400
get a sense of his perspective there. And I think my favorite example, the one that's maybe most

208
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,960
revealing, is that at one point a friend was telling Warburg about somebody, a mutual friend

209
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,040
or somebody she knew who was having mental difficulties and going through various problems.

210
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,080
Warburg's advice for this person was tell him to think about nothing but science. Just think about

211
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,800
science all day. And, you know, the person in question wasn't even a scientist, but that was,

212
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,760
you know, reveals, you know, a lot about Warburg. I think about how he viewed the world and

213
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,960
this devotion to science was partially about narcissism and wanting to be great. But I think

214
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,160
partially, you know, obviously a genuine love of science and curiosity about the truth, but also

215
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,640
a way to avoid looking internally. You know, I think that comment about the other person really

216
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,920
reveals that he was covering something up by focusing on science all the time and, you know,

217
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:48,320
trying not to look inward. What do you think he was afraid to look at? Well, you know, he was,

218
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,920
he was a great narcissist. And, you know, I think when you see that personality type,

219
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:03,600
it almost always comes sort of hand in hand with deep insecurity. And he was clearly, you know,

220
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
extremely insecure. You had laugh, you know, whenever he was criticized, he would lash out and

221
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,240
start these feuds with other scientists. So, you know, I think that, you know, that that's where

222
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,760
it ultimately came from. But he also had, you know, all these difficult things to deal with, you know,

223
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,040
being Jewish in Germany wasn't easy even before the Nazis. And then he has this other complicated

224
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,080
issue, which is that he's clearly homosexual. He ends up spending his whole life with his male

225
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,160
partner and he couldn't be out at the time in Germany. And his mother was pressuring him to

226
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,400
get married and questioning his lifestyle. And there were all sorts of rumors about him. So

227
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,880
he had a lot of stress and, you know, there are various ways it comes out. Like he can't do

228
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,080
public speaking. You know, he keeps being told, you know, to get your degree, you have to go and

229
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,160
give these talks and he just refuses. And if it was anybody else, they probably would have failed

230
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,640
him. He was so brilliant that they just finally decided to move him along. So, you know, there

231
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,680
were a lot of psychological issues there. Did he for his I mean, was he in the closet his entire

232
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,960
life or did he eventually come out? Well, yeah, I'm not sure I would use the phrase in the closet.

233
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,320
I mean, in a sense, almost everybody was in the closet. So I actually, you know, he didn't fully

234
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,640
come out and say I'm gay or talk about it. But I think he was about as out as one could be

235
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,320
throughout most of his life. You know, he didn't try to hide the fact that he lived with another

236
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,920
man when he was invited to give a talk. His partner, Jacob Heiss, would always come with

237
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,720
him. Warburg was, you know, in some instances say I'm not going to come unless, you know, my partner

238
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,480
comes. So, you know, they would go to the opera together and travel to his vacation house together.

239
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,560
So, you know, he didn't explicitly say, you know, I'm a homosexual, but I think he came

240
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,440
pretty much as close as anybody of that era. And, you know, I really respect him for that.

241
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:11,440
And he met Hitler. There's no record of them meeting. I think there's a lot of indirect

242
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,440
evidence that Hitler was directly involved in his case and his fate.

243
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,840
I can go into that detail or maybe we can build up to that. But there is no record of a direct

244
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,360
interaction. Well, yeah, I guess before we get there, let's I want to come back to that because

245
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:40,000
it's the intersection of them is so fascinating to me. But let's go back to post World War I

246
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,680
and pick it up where Warburg moves into his sort of seminal work. So it's 1918.

247
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,280
Einstein's convinced him to come back, potentially saving his life.

248
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
His first choice, I suppose, is where is he going to set up shop, right? Is he going to stay in

249
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Berlin or is he going to leave and he elects to stay? Yeah, yeah. He actually, you know,

250
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,320
right before he leaves, he's given this incredible position, his own sort of wing in the Kaiser

251
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,080
Wilhelm Institute for Biology, which is sort of the pinnacle of German science. They create this

252
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,640
Kaiser Wilhelm Society, which is now the Max Planck Society, as supposed to be the Oxford of

253
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
Germany. The idea is that they're going to get the best scientists in the world and give them

254
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,720
everything they need. It's actually inspired a lot by the Rockefeller model, the Rockefeller

255
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,400
Institute in the United States, just find the most brilliant people, give them what they need

256
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,280
and let them go. So he returns, you know, right before World War I, he's about to start this

257
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,880
position. His lab was under construction. And when he returns, it's a very different world. You know,

258
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,000
all the wealthy funders of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society are now bankrupt. So he doesn't even have,

259
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,920
you know, much money for his work at this point. There's this famous example. He has to write a

260
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,480
grant proposal for one of the only times in his life. And, you know, he can't bear to do it

261
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
because he's so narcissistic. So he finally writes, you know, scribbles on a piece of paper,

262
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,880
I need $10,000, 10,000 marks, and he actually gets the money. But he actually focuses on,

263
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
when he comes back from the war, he focuses on photosynthesis rather than cancer first. And

264
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,000
it's actually really interesting. I think that when his father was trying to get him out of the war,

265
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,280
he was making the case that Warburg was needed for photosynthesis research because he was going

266
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,240
to find new ways to grow food, make photosynthesis more efficient and have more crop yields. And,

267
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,600
you know, the Germans had been starving throughout much of the war and there were huge

268
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:49,760
food shortages. So, you know, he, you know, came back and really, I think, wanted to solve world

269
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,640
hunger. And that remained an interest of his throughout his life. But he was always interested

270
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,920
in cancer as well. At one point, he asked another famous scientist for advice, should I do

271
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,800
photosynthesis or cancer? And the scientist says, do cancer. Photosynthesis is working pretty well.

272
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,200
So he decides to do cancer. And it's because, you know, he wants to make a world changing

273
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,000
discovery and cancer really has become a German obsession by the 1920s. You know, if you look

274
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,920
back into, you know, the early 19th century, you know, there's not much cancer. And obviously,

275
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,400
there's all sorts of discussions and things you have to look at in terms of longevity and

276
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,800
diagnostic techniques. But I think there's overwhelming evidence, which I try to document

277
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,920
in my book, that cancer did really increase and continue to increase well into the 20s and 30s. And

278
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,800
by the 1920s, there's a panic. So many people are getting cancer, you know, it still pales in

279
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,280
comparison to today's rates, but it's a panic at the time. And, you know, the Germans had conquered

280
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,600
so many diseases. Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich had figured out bacteriology and infectious diseases.

281
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,680
And it just seemed natural that they were going to do the same thing with cancer. And Warburg

282
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,520
worshiped Ehrlich and Koch and, you know, thought he was going to be the next one to make this

283
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,880
great discovery. And so he takes on cancer and pretty quickly finds this remarkable thing,

284
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,600
which is, you know, as you well know, and probably a lot of your listeners know that, you know,

285
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,000
most cancers eat differently than other cells. They ferment glucose rather than,

286
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
you know, burning, you know, breaking it down and burning with oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation.

287
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,160
So this cancer cell shift to fermentation is a remarkable discovery and, you know, ends up

288
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,760
occupying his life, his thoughts, and he ends up focusing on that for much of his life.

289
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,760
So let's go back to how that discovery was made and what he was actually seeing in the laboratory

290
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:58,640
that led him to this observation. Sure. Yeah. So he, you know, the background is that he had been

291
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,760
studying actually sea urchin eggs in the first years of the 20th century when he's still a young

292
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:14,080
scientist. And he had seen that these eggs, you know, it's just a little complicated and that,

293
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,720
you know, he didn't necessarily get all of this right. But what his early studies showed was that

294
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,800
when the eggs were about to grow and proliferate, they would immediately begin to increase oxygen

295
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,120
consumption. And it made perfect sense because, you know, you need energy to grow and, you know,

296
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,920
using oxygen is the more efficient way to create energy for the cell. So when he turns to cancer

297
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,520
in 1923, he expects to see the same thing, you know, cell needs to grow, it needs more energy,

298
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,560
it's going to use more oxygen and burn more nutrients with oxygen to grow. And so, you know,

299
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,920
the experiments that he does is, you know, he takes, you know, a slice of a tumor from a rat

300
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,880
and, you know, he attaches it to a manometer, which is a device, really a very simple sort of

301
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,360
U-shaped tube, which can just measure changing gas pressures. And, you know, he expects that

302
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,080
these cells will start to take up more and more oxygen and he'll see the pressure change inside

303
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,480
of his U-shaped tube. But he doesn't see it, he doesn't see the oxygen consumption increasing.

304
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,760
Instead, you know, he checks the solution that these cells are in and he finds it's full of

305
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,280
lactic acid. You know, lactic acid is what's made from fermentation, you know, what human

306
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,000
cells make from fermentation. Of course, you know, yeast and other microorganisms will make alcohol

307
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,880
and carbon dioxide. But so he sees that they're clearly fermenting and, you know, it's a strange

308
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,280
phenomenon that is happening. And he, you know, tries to do other experiments. They end up doing,

309
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,840
you know, tests in vivo and people and seeing that they have more, you know, with cancer have

310
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,760
more lactic acid in their blood. And, you know, every test he sort of carries out comes to the

311
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:13,440
same conclusion that cancer cells are taking up a lot of glucose and fermenting it to lactic acid

312
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:22,000
and using less oxygen than he would expect. Go a little deeper for folks into that biochemical

313
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,040
pathway. So when a cell is presented with glucose as substrate and it wants to make ATP,

314
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,200
what are the different fates of that glucose molecule? And why is it so absurd that a cell

315
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,240
would in the presence of sufficient oxygen choose to make lactate? Why is that such an unusual thing

316
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:53,440
to do? Why is he so surprised by this? Sure. You know, he wasn't the first to understand or to see

317
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:03,200
that a human cell can ferment. It was understood, you know, going back to, you know, the previous

318
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,280
decades that human cells could do this. You know, it was very surprising when it was discovered

319
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,720
because it was thought only microorganisms did it. But, you know, Warburg was very close with another

320
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,360
physiologist, Otto Meyerhoff, who, you know, made a lot of important discoveries and found that

321
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,520
human cells could do much the same thing that microorganisms can do. So Warburg knew a cell

322
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,640
could do this, but what he didn't know was that a cell would ever do this if oxygen was available.

323
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,560
It was always thought to be a compensatory thing that moved to fermentation if you didn't have

324
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,840
enough oxygen or, you know, if there was, you know, as Warburg thought some damage to the mitochondrial

325
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,240
where the oxygen is used to burn nutrients. So the really surprising part of it was not just that

326
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,560
a cell was fermenting, you know, if you do, as you know, intense exercise and oxygen, you know,

327
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,960
your lungs are eating and you don't have enough oxygen to sort of keep up with the needs and,

328
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,400
you know, fermentation will, you know, glycolysis will take place in that setting as well. But the

329
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,040
surprising thing and what we now call the Warburg effect is that the cancer cells had oxygen and

330
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,280
they were still turning to fermentation, you know, what we call aerobic glycolysis. So that was the

331
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,400
really surprising part. Yeah, aerobic meaning in the presence of oxygen, but still undergoing

332
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,160
this inefficient pathway of glycolysis. And it's so inefficient, in fact, that from an energetic

333
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,920
standpoint, it's hard to understand because the total yield of ATP when you take glucose to

334
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,920
lactate, I believe is four units of ATP, two going, and I could be wrong, it could be two.

335
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:50,480
Whereas in normal aerobic metabolism, which would be oxidative phosphorylation, you would take

336
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,720
glucose, which has six carbons, you would make two molecules of pyruvate, which each have three

337
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,280
carbons, and that pyruvate would be turned into acetyl-CoA into, and then it would enter the

338
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,880
mitochondria and where it would go through all of the steps of the electron transport chain.

339
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,160
The final emissions would be carbon dioxide and water. And that process would yield either 32 or

340
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:23,760
34 net molecules of ATP. So the difference is so stark, right? It's like a 17x difference in

341
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,960
energy yield, which as you point out, the only reason you would ever make that sacrifice in

342
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,480
favor of lower energy yield is if you have no choice. So if I said, hey, go for a jog and

343
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,160
run your eight minute mile pace, that's great. I'm demanding ATP at a slow enough rate,

344
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,320
and therefore you have enough oxygen that you can do it the efficient way.

345
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:58,720
But if we make somebody run for their life, the fastest quarter mile ever, all of a sudden the

346
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,160
need for ATP is so great that it can't be matched by enough oxygen intake. So you take this

347
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,480
inefficient pathway, which unfortunately we can't sustain for as long because with lactate comes

348
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,280
hydrogen and hydrogen reduces the pH and that reduction in pH with that hydrogen ion makes it

349
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,080
very difficult for the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle to release. And that's what people

350
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,440
are actually experiencing when they feel that horrible burn that's actually erroneously

351
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,720
attributed to lactate. It's really the hydrogen ion. So yeah, it's like we knew about this,

352
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,280
but I think this was a really interesting discovery. And that's why I think the term

353
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,880
aerobic fermentation is a paradox, right?

354
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,440
Yeah, I mean, the aerobic glycolysis or aerobic fermentation,

355
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,880
from Warburg's perspective, it was a paradox. And as we'll maybe talk about more, not everybody

356
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,280
sees it that way, but many scientists continue to see it that way. I think that's the only

357
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,160
explanation that if you're choosing to use glucose in this way to ferment it rather than to do the

358
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,840
much more efficient way of breaking it down and getting much more ATP, then the only way to

359
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,840
explain this paradox is that something is broken and why else would a cell do this?

360
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,560
And we'll certainly get to that because today I think we have other explanations. But going back

361
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,920
to Warburg, how did he then explain the observation? So if science is a process of making an observation

362
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,040
and then coming up with hypothesis, what was his hypothesis in light of that observation?

363
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,800
His hypothesis was that the mitochondria, he didn't have full understanding of mitochondria

364
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,760
at this time, but he felt that there had to be some sort of defect in the mitochondria,

365
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,440
the structure that was burning nutrients with oxygen because it made no sense otherwise. And

366
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,800
the only way to really understand it is that Warburg idolized Pasteur and he had his library set

367
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,000
up so that he was gazing at a portrait of Pasteur at all times. One side was Robert Koff,

368
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,080
the other side Paul Ehrlich, but Pasteur was in the center. And it was Pasteur who had discovered

369
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,960
that microbes could ferment, that they didn't need oxygen. It was this shocking thing to him.

370
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:44,960
Life without air. And Pasteur himself had explained it by the fact that if they were cells were

371
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,000
fermenting and not using oxygen, it must be because there's some kind of problem because

372
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,440
why wouldn't anybody, any cell use oxygen if it could? And it's called the Pasteur effect,

373
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,640
the seesaw-like relationship, respiration with oxygen goes down, fermentation goes up.

374
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,800
So that was how, and that's what other scientists had found when they were studying frogs and

375
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,120
I mentioned Meyerhoff. So that's how everybody understood this relationship. So

376
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,280
that was Warburg's lens. I think a seesaw is a good way to think about it. Respiration goes

377
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,400
down, fermentation goes up. In my book, I talk about it as a backup generator clicking on.

378
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,600
And what's interesting about it to me is that both Pasteur and Warburg were sort of

379
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,520
aristocratic personalities. And I think they really thought of fermentation as lower and less noble

380
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,520
than respiration. Warburg actually literally used those type of terms when talking about it. So

381
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,800
for him, it was just almost shocking, almost unbelievable that a cell could use oxygen and

382
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
they would do this lowly thing that microorganisms do. It's impossible.

383
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,840
So how did Warburg attempt to actually test the hypothesis? So if the hypothesis, if the observation

384
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:12,160
is cancer cells are undergoing aerobic glycolysis to fermentation and the hypothesis is they're

385
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,920
doing this because their mitochondria are defective, how would he test that hypothesis to

386
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,600
increase the confidence that he would have in that hypothesis?

387
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,520
He didn't really have a great way to test it. Certainly not at the time in the 1920s. I mean,

388
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,560
the test that he did was just to see the effect over and over, but he couldn't

389
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
prove that it was a problem with defective mitochondria.

390
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,400
Did he recognize that, by the way, as a limitation?

391
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,280
I don't think he did. The most surprising part really is that in the early 20s, his first test

392
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,880
actually showed that respiration was continuing. And then later in his career,

393
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,720
he does additional experiments and insists that respiration is not continuing or if it is,

394
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,480
can be explained in various ways that there's uncoupling, which causes the electrons to leak

395
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:23,120
out, et cetera. But his early tests showed that fermentation was increasing while respiration

396
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,680
continued to just sort of hum along. And he just sort of denied that or came up with various

397
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,760
explanations for it. But it was really in the post-war period where he starts to make more

398
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:45,280
and more extreme statements. He finds these cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. I think

399
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,920
they're called ascites. Is that correct? And he sees that in his test of these cells, he sees

400
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,960
very little respiration and just very high fermentation rates. So he becomes more and

401
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,000
more convinced. And he called these pure cancer cells. He thought it was the best test of it,

402
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,280
but he never really had any concrete evidence that there was some sort of structural defect

403
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,320
or in the mitochondria. He felt it was almost tautological that the job of respiration is to

404
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,520
keep fermentation repressed. And if that relationship is not working, then it's necessarily

405
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,760
broken. At one point when critics were charging him with asking for more proof, he said it was

406
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,600
a semantic debate. It's necessarily true because it's not supposed to work that way.

407
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,040
Which really is ironic, right? Based on his observation, there is absolutely no way to know

408
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,960
if his observation is the cause or the effect of cancer. So I was struck by, I think in his case,

409
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,800
you could almost use the word, the arrogance with which he would treat it as tautological

410
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,920
as opposed to acknowledging that, hey, absent additional tools, laboratory tools, it's

411
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,520
difficult to know for sure if this is cause or effect. Which actually brings to the forefront

412
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:17,680
of this discussion this overlap between him and Hitler, right? Which is this view of cause and

413
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:26,320
effect that Hitler even writes about, right? Oh, I think you're referring to Warburg's

414
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:34,240
thinking about causation and cancer. Correct. Yeah. One of the interesting things that I found is that

415
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:43,360
Warburg and Hitler, Hitler was one of history's greatest monsters. I always had the chance to

416
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,200
compare anybody to him, let alone Warburg, who's somebody I admire greatly despite his flaws. But

417
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,600
I couldn't help because I was writing about both men, I couldn't help but see some parallels in

418
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:02,640
their story. First and foremost, they grew up in Germany or at the same time, Warburg's born in

419
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:12,800
1883, Hitler in 1889. And at the time, the hero of the day is Robert Kuff, the German scientist who

420
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,440
makes, discovers the causal relationship between microorganisms and infectious diseases. It starts

421
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,840
with anthrax, then he has his great breakthrough with tuberculosis. So it's hard to, from our

422
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,760
perspective today, it's hard to, I think, appreciate how much Germans revered Kuff. They were like

423
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,760
parades and flags with his face on it because he was conquering disease. And so Hitler and Warburg

424
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,040
are both narcissists, both want to be the greatest men of their generation. And the model for that

425
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,680
is Robert Kuff, first and foremost, in their childhood. And what's amazing, I think, is that

426
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,040
Kuff is most famous in a way for his postulates, which talk about how you can know one thing causes

427
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,400
another thing and what conditions you have to have to show that a microorganism actually causes

428
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,760
the disease. Which are, let's see if we can rattle these off, right? So one is the healthy individual

429
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,280
can never contain the microorganism that is reported to be caused, right? Right. I think that

430
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:26,720
another one is the corollary is that anyone with the microorganism must have the disease.

431
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:33,040
And then I think anytime you take a healthy person and insert the microorganism, you must be able to

432
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,960
cause the disease. I think that's the third one. What's the fourth? It's been a year since I...

433
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,760
But that's the gist of the logic. It's a very rigorous logic that, again, I think we all take

434
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,760
for granted today. But at the time it was remarkable and it demonstrated the causal

435
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,520
relationship between these various microorganisms and the diseases they caused.

436
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,640
Yeah. And a key breakthrough, if I'm remembering correctly, is that they had already known that

437
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,320
you could take blood or whatnot from one organism to another and transfer the disease. But Kuff

438
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,000
understood that he first had to get the micro and grow it outside the body. So

439
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,720
he wasn't transferring anything else. He had to prove that it was the microbe itself by growing

440
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,280
it independently and then taking some of those microbes and injecting them. But in any case,

441
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,680
if you listen to Hitler's speeches, some of his speeches in the 40s and read some of Warburg's

442
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,920
papers, they actually... It's almost like they're quoting Robert Kuff. You can hear the same phrases

443
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,920
and talking about causality. And one of the most chilling things that I... And they both refer to

444
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,520
Kuff directly, but the most chilling thing I found, I think, is that Hitler, multiple occasions,

445
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:03,120
referred to himself as the Robert Kuff of politics. And he said that Kuff had saved the world through

446
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,160
science by eliminating the microbes, the microorganisms that caused disease. And I've done the

447
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,440
same thing with the Jew. So he saw his effort in some ways as a scientific project and that killing

448
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,200
Jews in his twisted mind was like eliminating microbes. And of course, it wasn't just Warburg

449
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,920
and Hitler, but I was just struck that they were both using this language of causality.

450
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,040
And so how did Warburg describe that in terms of primary and secondary causality of cancer? How did

451
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:43,600
he really start to sharpen his thinking on that? So Warburg says that every disease has a prime

452
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:50,240
cause and a secondary cause, and he uses the analogy of Robert Kuff that the prime cause of the disease

453
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,840
is the microbe, and then there are all these secondary causes, the unsanitary conditions

454
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:04,640
that cause the microbe to get onto a person and make them sick, various plagues and anything

455
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,920
that causes a microbe to transfer and get into someone's blood is a secondary cause, and the

456
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,840
microbe itself is the primary cause. So Warburg tries to extend this to cancer. He says the most

457
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,320
fundamental thing about cancer is the shift to fermentation. And so that is the primary cause.

458
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,680
Although there was never proof for this, he insisted that it existed in 100% of all cancers.

459
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,560
I think today people say 70% or more, but not 100%, but Warburg thought it was 100% of all

460
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,560
cancers. I should modify that by saying probably all cancers at some point start to ferment as they

461
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,880
have reduced access to oxygen if they become advanced cancers, but at the most fundamental

462
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,600
level, I don't think you can say 100%, but Warburg said it was 100% of all cancers ferment. This is

463
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:57,200
the primary cause, and anything that causes the fermentation can be thought of as a secondary

464
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,920
cause. So you might have a dangerous chemical, and that injures the mitochondria, and therefore you

465
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,920
have fermentation. So that's the secondary cause is the chemical or anything you can think of,

466
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,680
a virus that causes cancer would damage the mitochondria. It's always viewed through the

467
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,640
lens of causing a structural problem, which causes respiration to be damaged and fermentation to

468
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,360
increase in a C cell-like relationship. What did Warburg believe accounted for the

469
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,600
significant increase in the prevalence of cancer leading up into the 1920s and 1930s?

470
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,680
As a secondary cause by his definition.

471
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:46,960
At the time, in the 20s and 30s, he doesn't say much about it. But I think it's clear looking back

472
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,960
that he was from an early time very worried about environmental carcinogens, but in the post-war

473
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,680
period, he becomes very outspoken about environmental carcinogens. And I think his

474
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,360
influence is much wider than many people realize. In Germany, he starts campaigning against smog from

475
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:14,720
automobiles and buses and food dyes used in the German food supply and all sorts of chemicals.

476
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,920
He becomes basically an organic farmer, one of the first organic farmers I've heard about. He has

477
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,560
his own garden, and he has his partner, Jacob Heiss, is the only person who's allowed to cook

478
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:31,200
for him. And he even has a well where he gets his own water. So his hypothesis was that the chemicals

479
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,360
in our food, first and foremost, were poisoning ourselves, poisoning the mitochondria and causing

480
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,920
the shift to fermentation. But what's really interesting, I think, is that if you read

481
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,720
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which is a hugely influential book and really changed American

482
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,920
environmental policy, Warburg is actually the first cancer scientist mentioned in the book. And

483
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:04,880
it's clear that that's exactly how she viewed cancer and saw all these environmental chemicals

484
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,680
as causing cancer via the damage to respiration that Warburg cited. So I think he ended up

485
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,040
having a massive influence on American life, just nobody knows about it.

486
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,600
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1931. What was the seminal work for which he was awarded?

487
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,080
Sure. Yeah, a lot of people think that he got the award for cancer, but that's not true. He was

488
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,320
nominated in 1926 and should have won for his cancer research. But it was apparently a tie,

489
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,160
and they gave it to the other guy. And no one really knows why Warburg didn't get it in 1926.

490
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,760
In 1931, he gets it really for figuring out the final step. He believes it's the only

491
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,920
step at the time, but really the final step of a respiration, understanding how the electron

492
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:01,360
passes down the electron transport chain and is able to react with oxygen. So he sort of

493
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:08,400
elucidates this process and wins the Nobel Prize for that. So what happens during World War II?

494
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,240
As you point out, obviously he's Jewish, he's gay. I'm guessing that both of those things

495
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,400
make him an enormous target for Nazis. Why does he stay in Germany?

496
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,680
Yeah, it's one of the most fascinating parts of his story. 1933 comes along and only two years

497
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,560
earlier, the Rockefeller Foundation has built this beautiful institute for him. He has designed the

498
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,080
institute himself after a country manner that he admires. And he's on top of the scientific world,

499
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,600
he's just won the Nobel Prize. And all his colleagues start to flee, his Jewish colleagues,

500
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:54,880
they see what's coming. And Warburg refuses to see it. He's not going to give up his kingdom

501
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,040
in Dallum in southwestern Berlin. He says, I was here before Hitler. And like a lot of Germans,

502
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,200
he believed that the Nazi phenomenon would be short-lived. His cousin Max Warburg had said,

503
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,240
we just need to give Hitler enough rope to hang himself. So Warburg had said, maybe six months a

504
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,800
year, he thought they'd be gone. But I think that part of it was, he was so arrogant and so

505
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,560
narcissistic that he couldn't fathom anybody telling him what to do, let alone, he called him

506
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,880
Bavarian noisemakers. These Nazi thugs were going to kick him out of his institute. No way.

507
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,360
I mean, that was his perspective. And I think the most shocking thing about his story is,

508
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,440
he has a famous Jewish name, his father's Jewish, so he's Jewish by the Nazi standards. He lives with

509
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,720
his male partner. He should have been as vulnerable as anybody in Nazi Germany. And yet he not only

510
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
staves, but he provokes the Nazis. He screams at them when they come to his institute demanding

511
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,920
Aryan descent forms. At one point he says, he'll burn down his institute if they come again.

512
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,800
He won't do the Hitler salute. He won't put up the Nazi flag. So he really was in a very

513
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,440
dangerous situation in 1936. The New York Times ran an article saying Warburg, maybe in jeopardy.

514
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,680
He was famous enough at the time that they were writing about him in the Times. And he was also

515
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,200
tremendously stubborn. He said to his sister at one point that it's going to be either me or them,

516
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,120
I'm not budging. And his sister's understanding of it was that the more pressure he got,

517
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,640
the more he insisted on staying because he couldn't stand to think that he would lose that battle.

518
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,080
And it's very hard to understand this. When we look back, we see these Jewish scientists clean

519
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,760
and we think, oh, what wise, moral people, they saw what was coming and they left. They didn't

520
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,720
want to be a part of it. But at the time, it was really considered a shameful thing that to leave

521
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:59,040
was to accept that you were somehow a lesser German. And Warburg, that was the antithesis of

522
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,240
everything Warburg stood for, to do anything that would cause him shame would be unimaginable. So

523
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:11,600
there was really no way he was leaving. He didn't think about it, but I think he correctly understood

524
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,600
that he would never be the same if he left. Did he journal? I mean, what type of sources

525
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,160
were you able to, if any, get into his head during that period of time?

526
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:30,160
It was honestly one of my most important, I didn't find it myself, but it already existed in German.

527
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:37,520
But one of his sisters, Lotte, kept a diary and she was a writer and she wrote a great deal about

528
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,520
him and recorded their conversations. So that ended up being really my key source for a lot of this.

529
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,160
Warburg didn't keep a diary, but because he was famous and he wrote a lot of letters, I had a lot

530
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,040
of letters that he wrote. And whenever somebody encountered him, they would often write down their

531
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:02,000
impressions because he was such a character and he was already world famous. But at the very end of

532
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,680
the war, he actually did scribble out some notes. A few years ago, a historian, Karin Nicholson in

533
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,120
Germany, actually discovered in the back of his notebooks these notes, which were really

534
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,640
fascinating. He was dealing, we haven't really talked about that part of the story, but he was

535
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,920
dealing with some guilt that he faced by not protecting certain people who worked for him

536
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,400
from being forced into the military. So he started to scribble out these defenses and just,

537
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,040
it's only a few sentences here and there, but it gives you a window into how persecuted he felt

538
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,640
at the end and how guilty in some ways I think he felt as well. How many people did he know that

539
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:52,800
died in concentration camps? Fewer than you would think, partially because most of the Jewish people

540
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,080
that he associated with left, in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, I think there were like 2,500

541
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,200
Jews at various institutions and Warburg was the only one who stayed until the very end. So

542
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:10,400
most of them left and a lot of people don't realize that German Jews,

543
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,920
in many cases, were more likely to survive the Holocaust than other European Jews.

544
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,680
So he didn't, some of his Warburg cousins actually were murdered in the camps. He wasn't

545
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,960
particularly close with them, but he didn't lose a lot of people who were close to him, but

546
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:37,920
he certainly knew people. I don't have a good answer to that question, but it would be impossible

547
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,000
for him to have not known a lot of people who died, but I don't know that there were people who

548
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,320
were closest to him. He certainly knew hundreds or thousands of people who fled for their lives.

549
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,280
In countries like Poland, there was clearly a moment in time when you could no longer leave.

550
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,360
Was that true in Germany as well? Was there basically a time beyond which if you had not

551
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,040
left, you were not going to leave? Yeah, I mean, certainly for Warburg there was because

552
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:14,160
he was famous and the Nazis saw propaganda value in having him there. For others, it really

553
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:22,480
changed a lot after the war started and by that point if you hadn't left,

554
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:30,720
you were in grave danger if you were Jewish or homosexual or various other persecuted categories

555
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:39,760
in Nazi Germany. But in the early 30s, you had an opportunity to leave Germany at least, but

556
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,480
it was extraordinarily difficult because they would take all your wealth. You basically had to

557
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,080
give up everything and leave with nothing and find a new career. This is in Germany. The other

558
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:57,840
countries didn't have the advance warning and the Jews of Eastern Europe were much less wealthy.

559
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:06,320
These are in many cases more people who lived in much less wealth than the German Jews and never

560
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:11,600
really had a real opportunity to escape when the Germans rolled in. So it was very different for

561
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,200
Eastern Europe where the Holocaust really begins. So what do you attribute the fact that he

562
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:25,280
survived the war to? Is it simply that the Germans benefited more by him staying there and being alive

563
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,880
as a showcase of their scientific prowess? Or do you think there was an explicit directive

564
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:38,480
from Hitler or someone else saying, despite the fact that he's everything we despise,

565
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,720
he's everything we despise, there's value in the work he'll do?

566
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:51,920
Yeah. So by the mid 30s, it's clear that he serves propaganda value for them. The Berlin Olympics in

567
00:57:51,920 --> 00:58:01,680
1936, they're able to show that this guy who has Jewish ancestors is still here working in Germany.

568
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:08,240
But by the late 30s, that propaganda value drifts away and certainly is useless once the

569
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,840
war starts. So he's increasingly sort of grave danger as things progress throughout the late 30s.

570
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:23,360
Meyerhoff, a lot of people stayed until 1938. Meyerhoff, who's also a Nobel Prize winner, escapes

571
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:30,640
in 1938 and flees to France. And from that point on, that's when Germans roll into Austria and all

572
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:38,640
the Austrian Jews who can escape escape in 38. But the fascinating thing really, it comes to

573
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:47,120
a head in 1941, where, you know, by that point, you know, the war is in full swing and, you know,

574
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,920
there's no value to keeping Warburg alive, really, you know, for propaganda means at that point.

575
00:58:52,560 --> 00:59:01,280
So Warburg is called to Nazi headquarters in 1941, June 21. And he meets with Victor Braque,

576
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,720
who is one of the worst Nazis, a guy who designs the euthanasia killing program that sort of starts

577
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,640
the mass killing. And it looks like it's going to be the end for him. He's already received an

578
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,480
eviction notice from his institute. He has a lot of enemies in German science. I mean, you have to

579
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,480
keep in mind, he had a lot of enemies in German science before all this started. So you can imagine

580
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,320
that how many people hated him and wanted to get rid of him. You know, all the other institutes

581
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,960
were full of Nazis. It was the only one that wasn't. So, you know, they finally succeed in,

582
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:36,400
you know, getting rid of him. And he's called to Nazi headquarters. And he sits down with Victor

583
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,840
Braque. And he's told that he's actually going to be allowed to live on one condition that he

584
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:48,720
focused on cancer research. And, you know, it's extraordinary in itself. But the part that

585
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,600
surprised me most, you know, and other German historians had recorded this meeting on June 21st,

586
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:01,360
1941. But what I realized, nobody had yet realized that this was an extremely important moment in

587
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:07,200
German history. The very at dawn, the next morning, the German tanks rolled into Soviet territory was

588
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,840
the launch of Operation Barbarossa, which is, you know, the biggest at the time, the biggest

589
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,840
military invasion in history. It was, you know, the most significant moment in the Nazi project

590
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,400
in a lot of ways. And that very day, they're sitting around, you know, worrying about Warburg.

591
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,440
And it wasn't just Victor Braque. You see in Himmler's Daily Planner that he has a meeting

592
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:35,520
about Warburg that day. And then later that night, Goebbels kept a diary. And he records in his diary

593
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,400
that later that night, just hours before Operation Barbarossa, he and Hitler are talking about cancer

594
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,040
research. The diary, that diary doesn't say Warburg's name, but given that everything else that went on

595
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,840
that day and that Warburg was in the building, it certainly seems, you know, that Hitler knew what

596
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,600
was going on. And at Warburg, there's more evidence of Hitler's direct involvement, because

597
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,880
Warburg has applied for something that they called a German blood certificate. This just

598
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,000
shows you what a, you know, twisted, horrific world it was at the time that, you know, for

599
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,080
Judah to survive in Nazi Germany, at that point, if you had managed to stick around that long,

600
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:18,000
you could apply to have yourself upgraded to be more Aryan. So Warburg goes through this

601
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,600
application process at this point, I think it's defensible, because, you know, it's really to

602
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,680
save his life in a way. But Hitler would actually review these applications himself. And certainly

603
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,280
for a Nobel Prize winner, Hitler would have reviewed this application. So, you know, as you

604
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,120
had to talk about all your ancestors and submit photos, you know, just sick stuff where, you know,

605
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,920
the kid would, you know, look at the noses of the people and decide if he would upgrade them or not,

606
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,520
so that they, they never actually formally Aryan eyes, Warburg, but it's clear that Hitler would

607
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,800
have been involved in that review. And that probably decided on that day, June 21 1941,

608
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:01,760
to let him continue to focus on cancer. Was Hitler personally obsessed or touched by cancer? What

609
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,400
was this? I mean, was it simply just the epidemiology of the time?

610
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:14,720
Yeah, he, you know, was very personally touched by it. When he was a teenager,

611
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,360
he lost his mother to breast cancer. And his mother was really the, you know,

612
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:26,720
historians say the only person he was capable of loving. And he had already just sort of failed to

613
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,280
get into art school and was depressed. He comes back to Austria, or comes back to his hometown in

614
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,600
Austria, and sees his mother dying of breast cancer. And it's just distraught. It's actually

615
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:45,760
a Jewish doctor who's caring for his mother. And he left a little reflection on the experience.

616
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,760
He said in his entire life, he's never seen anybody look as dejected as Hitler. And, you know, Hitler

617
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,440
sort of okayed these experimental treatments on his mother, which left her riding in pain. And he

618
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,520
was there at the bedside. And for the rest of his life, he was obsessed with cancer and talked

619
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,720
about it constantly in his speeches as a metaphor, but was also a hypochondriac who constantly had

620
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,320
stomach problems and thought it was stomach cancer. And, you know, it became a huge part of

621
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,560
the Nazi project is trying to eliminate cancer. And, you know, one of the very uncomfortable

622
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,600
things about this is that, you know, as monstrous as the Nazis were in every way, they actually did

623
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,960
make some advances in cancer prevention, you know, for all the wrong reasons. But, you know,

624
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,840
they inherited, you know, a great scientific establishment and it makes sense that they

625
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,920
would actually make some progress on cancer. It's very interesting to imagine a world without

626
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:48,000
the Nazis, given the prominence of German science into going into, you know, the Second World War,

627
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,480
and how much of a balance and how much of a shift in power that was scientifically post-World War

628
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:02,640
II, right? How effectively that was the change from Germany being the epicenter of science,

629
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,280
not just biological sciences, but physics, and then that shifting. In fact, so many of the

630
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,240
journals, right, shifted from being published in German to being published in English post-World

631
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,880
War II. Yeah. I mean, early 20th century, you had to speak German to be a scientist or be able to

632
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,440
read German. You know, it's incredible how the extent to which, you know, all the early Nobel

633
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,800
Prize winners were Germans, not all, but, you know, shocking percentage. It's rumored. I don't,

634
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,800
I've never actually been able to confirm if this is true or not because I've read various accounts

635
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:42,320
that Warburg could have won a second Nobel Prize during the Second World War. What was your finding

636
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:49,440
on that? Yeah. I think that he, you know, certainly deserved a Nobel Prize for his cancer work, which

637
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:56,160
he didn't get in 1926. I don't think there's really proof of the, you know, Warburg said that

638
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,480
he didn't get the Nobel Prize in the 40s because the Nazis wouldn't allow it. He certainly was

639
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,240
considered for it. I found evidence that he was considered for it, but I didn't find any evidence

640
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,600
that they were going to sort of give him the award, but couldn't because of the Nazis. And what work

641
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:19,280
was that in the 40s that they would have been potentially considering him for? Yeah.

642
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:26,800
Warburg, you know, his Nobel Prize, as we talked about before, was, you know, for understanding the

643
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:33,840
last stage of respiration, this, you know, enzyme that we now call cytochrome oxidase. But, you know,

644
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,840
at the whole time he had been saying in the 20s that this is the only thing you need to know for

645
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,720
respiration. It's kind of analogous to what he said about cancer. But then he finally accepted

646
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:50,320
that no respiration is actually a multi-stage process and you actually need, you know, not just

647
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,480
to react directly with oxygen, but to rip hydrogen off these nutrients and to pass the electrons down

648
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,240
the transport chain. So he became interested in these hydrogen transfers and understanding, you

649
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,560
know, how the reaction took place. And he actually, you know, a lot of people think this is the best

650
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:13,200
science he ever did. He actually made huge advances in understanding the role of coenzymes

651
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,000
and how they react with hydrogen and allow for these transfers. You know, it was really innovative

652
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:29,600
work, really kind of set the stage for decades of enzyme research. So, you know, that led to

653
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,680
the discovery of the components of NAD among other things. So he did deserve a Nobel Prize for that,

654
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,200
but I didn't find any evidence that they were going to give it to him. But I think he fairly

655
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:47,280
deserved three Nobel Prizes. Say a little bit more about his work on NAD. That was actually

656
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,200
new to me. I until recently was not aware of his contributions there. It's not surprising,

657
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,600
I suppose, when you consider his involvement with the electron transport chain. And as you point out,

658
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:03,200
the electron transport chain transports its electrons using hydrogen back and forth,

659
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:09,040
transporting between NAD and NADH. But it's actually kind of an interesting story, right,

660
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:16,080
about how he made these discoveries. Yeah. So, Warburg is trying to do a chemical analysis to

661
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:22,400
figure out the reactive component of what we now call NAD. He called the in-between ferment.

662
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,280
And he can isolate a very small amount, but he can't get enough of it to really understand and

663
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,920
do the chemical analysis of what it is. And he's using horse blood to study it. And he says at one

664
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,600
point to figure this out, I'm going to need to kill all the horses in Germany. And he was a great

665
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,760
lover of horses, so that was not a good option for Warburg. But he knows, he has enough of the stuff

666
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,520
to figure out the molecular weight and a few basic facts about it. So he has a friend who works in the

667
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:00,240
chemistry industry and in the chemical industry. It's just a big part of German industry. And he

668
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,800
asked him to look it up, see if he can find anything similar. And based on what he looks up,

669
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:13,040
he finds an exact match, which is nicotinic acid. And so Warburg is the one that figures out that

670
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:18,560
this key component that makes this reaction possible is actually a chemical that everybody

671
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,000
knew about that was being used in photography for decades. Warburg said a day ago, I couldn't

672
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,480
buy it for all the money in the world. And now I can get it for two marks. And it actually turned

673
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:37,760
out to be hugely important, not only for understanding respiration, but for understanding

674
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:46,160
the disease, pellagra, which was only solved after Warburg made that discovery. And someone thought,

675
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,880
let's give this chemical to people who suffer from this disease and see if it cures them. And sure

676
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,000
enough, it did. And it's one of the ironies of Warburg story that he always wanted to make a

677
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,720
great discovery and save lives. And he actually did, but he never even really recognized it or

678
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:08,000
saw it that way. So he stays in Germany after the war ends. He could obviously at this point have

679
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,920
gone anywhere. He could have come to the United States, which is what many of his peers had done

680
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:19,520
before the war. What was his reason for staying? In terms of staying in the years after the war?

681
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:26,080
Correct. Yeah. Yeah. I think that for a few years after the war, I think he was prepared to go

682
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,600
elsewhere. I mean, I found letters of him searching for places and he comes to America in the late

683
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,800
40s and he stays in one lab for six months and another lab for six months. But it's clear that

684
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:45,200
there's no future for him in America that a lot of the Rockefeller's no longer want anything to do

685
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,800
with them because it looks suspicious that he had stayed. The truth is he despised the Nazis as much

686
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:57,360
as anyone, but anybody who stayed when they could have left is under suspicion. And he's making more

687
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:06,080
and more extreme statements about cancer. So he's alienating a lot of people. And meanwhile, in 1950,

688
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,480
the Americans give him back his Institute. They had taken it over when they had their

689
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:17,600
military occupation of Berlin. So he gets to go back to his beautiful Institute. And he has,

690
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,240
again, some propaganda value for the Germans. We can say, look, we've given this person of

691
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:27,440
Jewish descent, his Institute back, and he's living here and thriving in Germany. So I think,

692
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,640
you know, if he had gotten the right offer, I think he would have gone to America, but he ended

693
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,160
up sort of returning and reestablishing his old life in a lot of ways. In some ways, it's

694
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,440
shocking and upsetting. But, you know, by 1955, you know, from his perspective,

695
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,040
it was like nothing had happened. You know, he's continuing with all the same stuff.

696
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:53,600
Now, forgive my ignorance. How is it that was it a is it was it an easy choice for him to end up

697
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,520
in West Berlin as opposed to East Berlin following the war and what determined

698
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,080
that was it simply a function of where he was prior to the war and therefore it was somewhat

699
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:09,360
fortuitous? Yeah, it is actually interesting and a little bit complicated. His Institute ended up in

700
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:16,960
the American sector. But another extraordinary thing about his story is in 1943, bombs are

701
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,680
falling near his Institute. And he's actually moved to a new Institute and the Nazis built him,

702
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,920
you know, sort of they sort of refurbished this beautiful sea house for Warburg in the middle

703
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,360
of the worst part of the war for them when, you know, there's no gasoline for anything.

704
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,640
It's forbidden to build anything if it's not for the war effort. And they take time out

705
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,680
to build, you know, sign for Warburg to continue his cancer research in a safer place.

706
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:46,160
But in that that Institute was actually ended up in Soviet territory. So he was sort of caught

707
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,520
between these two different worlds. And he had a vacation house, which is in Soviet territory. So

708
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,200
when the war ends, he is actually under Soviet rule and he has to escape back to the West.

709
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,520
But the Soviets were trying to recruit him much more so than Americans. Interestingly, you know,

710
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,720
both a lot of the great German scientists and, you know, unfortunately, a lot of Nazis ended up,

711
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:13,360
you know, being smuggled into America, you know, for the purposes of American science. But the

712
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,880
Germans, I mean, the Soviets were going after them as well. So he is sort of caught between

713
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,920
these different worlds, but ends up, you know, because his Institute is in West Berlin,

714
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,720
is able to stay in the American side, ultimately.

715
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,760
So interesting to me, because you have to wonder if people in Berlin at that time understood how

716
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:40,240
stark that contrast would be. You know, you could argue that, well, gosh, it's just it's wonderful

717
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:46,000
that the war is over and the Nazis are gone. And, you know, you might end up on this American side

718
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,800
or, you know, what the time was American occupied, or you might end up on this what will be a Soviet

719
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,160
side. But it probably couldn't have been clear just how different those two would end up being

720
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:03,440
over the coming, you know, four or five decades. Yeah, I don't think it was clear, but it was clear

721
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,920
that the Soviets, you know, with good reason were much more feared. So, you know, in the last days

722
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,880
of the war in 1945, you have a lot of people fleeing westward, not so much because they could

723
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,040
imagine what the Cold War was like for decades, but because they were worried about being murdered

724
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:22,720
and raped, you know, because the Soviets were, you know, with good reason, you know, furious

725
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,680
at the Germans and out for revenge. And they certainly took that revenge. So it was understood

726
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:32,000
that you had a better chance of surviving if you made it westward. But I don't think anybody could

727
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,040
foresee what happened in the following decades.

728
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:42,000
Warburg has a really interesting tit for tat with with with Sidney Winehouse in in science,

729
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:49,600
about a decade later, I actually was able to pull up the article and and read it. They both wrote

730
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,680
letters. And and Winehouse was really kind of a mild mannered guy, wasn't he?

731
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:02,800
Yeah, he was, you know, most of the people Warburg had these, you know, vicious, you know,

732
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,720
scientific feuds with I would look them up and they seem, you know, much more reasonable and calm

733
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:13,120
than than Warburg himself. Winehouse, I mean, the Philadelphia suburbs, he actually worked at a

734
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:19,280
hospital just a mile away. He died in what, the early 90s, I think. And he he was at he was at

735
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,400
Penn, wasn't he? Or no, he was at Jefferson, if I recall. He may have been, I think he was at

736
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,280
Lincoln Hospital, but maybe maybe at Jefferson as well. I'm not sure. But he was around here.

737
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,200
I actually found some people that knew him and talked them a little bit.

738
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,600
But he but he publicly called Warburg out. He basically said, don't agree with this observation.

739
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,000
I mean, agree with the observation. Don't agree with the interpretation is what he said.

740
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,120
Yeah, I think if you look at the quotes from him, he was relatively calm about it. But, you know,

741
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,960
as a journalist, I have to laugh. I'm sure it was the headline writer. You know, the headline under

742
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,240
one of the articles was cancer theory overthrown. You know, I don't think that Winehouse would have

743
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:03,920
put it that way. But, you know, some editor like me just wanted to, you know, make it a little more

744
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,960
sensational. So well, and he was deferential to Warburg in the article. I mean, he did say something

745
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,800
to the effect of I don't remember exactly, but the gist of it was in we owe a great debt to

746
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,960
to Warburg for his amazing contributions to the field, et cetera, et cetera. But, you know,

747
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,440
cellular respiration is basically there. He said, look, there's no difference in oxygen consumption

748
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,640
between these cells and there's no evidence that the mitochondria are damaged.

749
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,640
Warburg's rebuttal was far less kind. Yeah, he was. Yeah. You might be thinking of the papers

750
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:43,120
in science in 1956. Yes, exactly. Yeah. They had a back and forth. I believe it's August 1956,

751
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,320
where first, you know, Warburg writes a piece in early 56 and then Winehouse responds in Warburg.

752
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,120
That's right. Response to his response. And, you know, Warburg, you know, comes off. I mean,

753
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,640
it's a really elegant paper that he writes. He was a great writer. And we should have talked

754
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,400
about Warburg's writing at the beginning because, you know, I really admire his writing. And

755
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:07,680
but, you know, he makes much bolder statements and denounces his opponents in a way that

756
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:15,040
that Winehouse doesn't. Winehouse is a more humble scientist. But that is, yeah, I encourage all

757
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,720
listeners to look up Warburg's paper from 56. It's pretty remarkable. We'll link to it in the

758
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:24,400
show notes for sure. I love reading that stuff. I mean, I just absolutely fancy reading that stuff,

759
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,880
which actually an example of one of my favorite scientific papers to read is the next logical

760
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:37,840
place to go in this story, which is the paper by Watson and Crick describing the helical structure

761
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,560
of DNA. So that's relevant to the story for reasons you will tell us. But it's also a funny paper in

762
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:52,160
that the I think it's the last line either in the abstract or the paper makes some very, very,

763
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:58,160
very understated remark that this this thing, what they're referring to as DNA, you know, may prove

764
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:04,560
to be of interest at some point or something to that effect. I used to be able to quote it verbatim.

765
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:12,640
But what is it about the discovery of DNA that would ultimately put a

766
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:22,000
change the course of Warburg's discovery and this entire field of cancer metabolism for decades to

767
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,040
come? Yeah. So, you know, by the fifties and sixties, Warburg is already fading away for some of the

768
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:36,400
reasons we've talked about, you know, Winehouse challenges his beliefs that, you know, cancer

769
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,400
cells have defective mitochondria. He sees respirations running fine. So there's more

770
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:47,360
skepticism of Warburg and people suspect him because of the Nazi years. But I think the single

771
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:53,920
biggest factor was sort of the changing wind in science and, you know, more than anything,

772
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:01,920
you know, the discovery of oncogenes beginning really in the mid-1970s when they're first

773
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:08,560
able to identify specific genes that in their mutated, activated form cause cancer. So

774
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:15,200
this unleashes the whole new world of molecular biology and Warburg's study of enzymes and cancer

775
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:20,720
metabolism starts to seem like, you know, old world biochemistry stuff. And, you know, if you want to

776
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:27,280
really understand cancer, you got to look at the DNA and these signal transduction pathways and all

777
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,520
the new molecular biology. And, you know, there's literally stories of like, you know, people seeing

778
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:38,000
manometers thrown in the trash, you know, Warburg's signature tool. And it's just amazing to me how

779
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:46,240
quickly Warburg gets relegated to the old world and, you know, nobody's interested in, you know,

780
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,240
by, you know, by the 90s, you know, students don't know his name. And then...

781
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,640
And by the way, he died in what, 1970?

782
01:18:52,640 --> 01:19:00,880
1970. But, you know, there's all these remarkable examples in the year 2000, Robert Weinberg,

783
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,920
co-authors, you know, the Hallmarks of Cancer paper, which sort of, you know, is, I'm sure you

784
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:14,080
know better than I do, the sixth, you know, fundamental traits of cancer and doesn't include

785
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,680
the Warburg effect or mention Warburg or metabolism. He later, you know, they later do a revised

786
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:25,200
edition and do mention it 10 years later, I believe. So Warburg is just gone from cancer

787
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,720
science, gone from textbooks. You know, Weinberg's famous textbook in 2006 doesn't mention him,

788
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:34,880
you know, Mukherjee, who, you know, I think his book is absolutely brilliant, but also doesn't

789
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,920
mention Warburg just because nobody was mentioning it. You know, it's just not something that people

790
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,120
were interested in. They talked, you know, the enzymes that Warburg's today were referred to as

791
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,560
housekeeping enzymes, you know, seems, you know, cancer needs to divide and therefore it needs

792
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:54,160
energy, it needs nutrients, but it's sort of, you know, just not fundamental to the process,

793
01:19:54,160 --> 01:20:00,400
just something that's needed to supply cancer as it progresses. And it's really shocking to me

794
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,720
that something so fundamental could just get lost. But I think, you know, to some extent,

795
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,880
that's how science works. You know, there's an exciting new thing and it's hard to focus on two

796
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:18,640
things at once. And look, I mean, I think it is a very remarkable discovery in the 1970s that there

797
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:26,320
are oncogenes. And Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop are awarded the Nobel Prize in 1989

798
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:33,600
for that discovery. It holds a lot of great promise. Certainly by the time I got to medical

799
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:40,080
school in the late 90s, that was, I mean, my God, if I could go back and figure out how many

800
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,680
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes I had memorized and all the pathways and such,

801
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,680
I mean, that was really what, that's the only thing that mattered in cancer biology.

802
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:57,520
So what do you think led to the Renaissance? I mean, for me personally, the first thing that

803
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:07,360
came on the radar screen was a science paper in 2009 written by Matthew Vanderheiden and

804
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:14,960
co-authored by Luke Antley and Craig Thompson. Was that sort of the first thing that showed up on

805
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,720
the radar? I mean, obviously those three had been doing a lot of work leading up to that. I've had

806
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,760
Lou on the podcast and we've talked at great length about his work and the discovery of PI3 kinase.

807
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:34,080
So clearly this idea that metabolism mattered was on the radar of others, even though it was not

808
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:40,640
necessarily on the forefront of the field. I think that that paper was in the moment,

809
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:48,320
it was 2009 or 2010 that it sort of reached the mainstream. But as you mentioned, they had been

810
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:55,680
working on this stuff for some time. So it was really in the late 90s that the revival starts

811
01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:03,920
mid to late 90s in the two key labs, I think, at the early stages. One is Craig Thompson, who you

812
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,880
mentioned, who is now the president CEO of Memorial Sloan Kettering. And the other lab was

813
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:17,520
Chi Ban Dang, who is at the time at Johns Hopkins. And they both were sort of working on

814
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:25,760
understanding cancer and molecular biology and both sort of tracing these signaling pathways

815
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:33,520
to the cell and sort of working their way back to metabolic enzymes. In Chi's case, he found that the

816
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:40,640
transcription factor, MIC, was actually activating lactose dehydrogen, LDH.

817
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:50,400
And he was really quite shocked to find that this pathway leading back to this basic fermentation

818
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:57,760
reaction. So he became very curious about Warburg and reading the old papers on enzymes and

819
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:06,960
really helped launch a lot of the metabolism revival. And then Craig Thompson and Vander Heiden

820
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:14,960
was a student in his lab. They had also sort of independently rediscovered metabolism and ended

821
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:22,480
up focusing on AKT, which is, you know, was already known as an oncogene that caused cells to

822
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,360
proliferate. So the surprising part of their work wasn't that they had found an oncogene,

823
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,600
but that this oncogene was actually a metabolic gene. And what its role was basically to allow

824
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,480
glucose into the cell and that, you know, Thompson, I think correctly states that this is the most

825
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:45,120
fundamental thing that it does and that the proliferation is downstream of this glucose uptake.

826
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:54,400
Yeah, it's a very pro-growth factor. So what I think is most interesting about the 2009 paper

827
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,760
in Science is that it acknowledges the Warburg effect but comes up with a different explanation.

828
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,240
Right.

829
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,360
And what was that explanation?

830
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,880
So, you know, prior to this point, you know, the accepted view or that Warburg's view, which,

831
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:16,240
you know, again, some people still support is that all fermentation is a response to

832
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,680
defective mitochondria. It's compensatory. The cell can't create energy in one way. So it's using

833
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:28,160
the backup generator. It's revving up fermentation. But, you know, what Thompson and Vander Heiden

834
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:34,080
can't really argue in that paper is that, you know, we actually don't have, you know, as we

835
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:39,040
talked about with Winehouse, we don't actually have the evidence that respiration is completely

836
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,920
defective. So the mitochondria still seem to be functional and intact. And there are other

837
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,720
reasons that a cell might need to take up a lot of glucose. And, you know, first and foremost,

838
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:55,040
they're bioenergetically need the building blocks to create, you know, new nucleotides and lipids

839
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:02,080
for the daughter cells. So it makes sense that, you know, glucose uptake would increase rapidly.

840
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,040
But the cells, they actually, you know, they're getting some energy, some ATP from respiration,

841
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,440
some from fermentation, but they have enough to continue to function. What they really need are

842
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,960
the building blocks for growth. And so that is a sort of new way to understand the Warburg effect.

843
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:23,280
And I think that, you know, that's now what most scientists, but not all sort of view is the main

844
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:31,440
explanation. What's your view? You know, it's tough as a science writer.

845
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:37,280
At a reporter, you know, I am not trained as a scientist. And I interview one person,

846
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:44,320
you know, famously, Thomas Seyfried, who is very much a Warburgian who thinks that Warburg got it

847
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,960
exactly right, and that it is a problem of defective mitochondria. And he cites the research of,

848
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,000
I believe, Peterson at Johns Hopkins, who also believes this. So there are a lot of very smart,

849
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,040
accomplished scientists who think Warburg got it exactly right. And, you know, it would have been

850
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,960
easier for me to write in this book to conclude that Warburg was right about everything. You know,

851
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,480
that's a story that would have been easier to tell and made my narrative tighter. But,

852
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,400
you know, I interviewed many more people who felt that Warburg was wrong about this, that

853
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:20,480
it was not ultimately a problem of defective mitochondria. And, you know, I look at papers

854
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,840
from both sides and don't ultimately feel that, you know, I have a good way of resolving this

855
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:35,280
debate. But ultimately, I cited much more so with Cantley and Thompson and Vanderheide and

856
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:43,840
others like now, Chandel, who also takes this position. And, you know, it's partially just

857
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,200
a number saying like many more people believe this and their evidence is compelling and I can

858
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:53,520
see that they're brilliant. And it's partially also sort of an intuitive feel for the science.

859
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,760
And I say that because, you know, one of the things that really struck me is when Craig

860
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:07,920
Thompson was giving a demonstration for students about what cancer is. He puts up this slide, I

861
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,320
don't know if you've ever seen this talk and he shows a mold growing on a piece of bread. And he

862
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,640
said everybody's first cancer experiment and then he shows the mold growing. And, you know, it really

863
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:24,480
goes back to Pasteur in understanding, proliferative metabolism is not something that happens in

864
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:30,320
microorganisms only in response to defective respiration. That's what Pasteur thought, but

865
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:36,160
he was wrong. You know, proliferative metabolism happens when a cell can get all the nutrients it

866
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,160
wants. You know, you put, I mean, when I say a cell, I mean the microorganisms, you know, you put

867
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,960
the yeast on grain and they don't care how much oxygen is available. They take up the grain and

868
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,440
they grow and they grow and they multiply. And that I think is a fundamental program that

869
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,920
ourselves know how to do as well. And I think that's really the key to the story is what causes,

870
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:02,720
you know, this proliferative program to, you know, to take off. And I think it's, you know,

871
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,840
in single-celled organisms, it's the nutrients. And I think in, you know, when you look at advanced

872
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,000
organisms and animals, we have to think not just about the nutrients, but the hormonal

873
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,880
involvement as well. It's much more complicated, but the fundamental, you know, program is running

874
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:24,160
and it's the nutrients and the growth factors. I mean, I think if you just step back from it

875
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:29,280
and you say, you know, what is cancer? It's a problem of growth. Okay. Well, what causes things

876
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,400
to grow, you know, nutrients and hormones, that's where you start the conversation. And I think that

877
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,320
if science had progressed in a different way, then that always would have been the focus, but,

878
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,680
you know, it was only in, you know, the late 1960s where we could even measure insulin in the blood,

879
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:52,320
you know, so cancer, all this stuff about the Warburg effect as a response to, you know,

880
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:58,800
damaged respiration made sense before we knew anything about, you know, insulin and growth

881
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:05,600
factors. But, you know, the science has progressed and I tend to view it in much more of the way of

882
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,960
Thompson and Cantley, but I do think that Seafree deserves a ton of credit for sort of bringing

883
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:17,280
metabolism back into the conversation. And it is, as I said before, you know, I think everybody agrees

884
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,440
that as a cancer progresses, you know, the blood vessels no longer are getting oxygen in the same

885
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:29,440
way. And that's clearly playing a role in terms of revving up fermentation. So it's not necessarily

886
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:35,280
either or, but at the sort of core origin of cancer, I don't see that the respiration damage

887
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:42,000
is being sort of conclusive. Yeah. And I don't either. I mean, I just think on first principles,

888
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,320
it doesn't actually make sense, right? So if you follow the logic of Warburg,

889
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:55,120
if the primary insult or the prime cause to use his language is damage to the mitochondria,

890
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:03,360
that's an insult to a cell. That's a deficit to a cell. That's an inhibition of a cell's ability

891
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:10,720
to respire and frankly acquire energy. So the fact that the cell has the ability to do something

892
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:15,520
outside of the mitochondria in a compensatory fashion is great. But in and of itself, that

893
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:22,400
doesn't explain why it would take up more nutrient. It simply explains why it would metabolize

894
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:28,160
nutrient in a different way. And to, for me at least to focus just on the availability of

895
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:34,640
nutrients and hormones doesn't explain to me why if we're, let's just talk about colon cancer,

896
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:40,800
right? Or pancreatic cancer, you pick your cancer, you have a normal cell and you have an abnormal

897
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:46,560
cell. The normal cell, presumably then is the one that is not going to become cancer. The abnormal

898
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,080
cell is the one that is going to seed the cancer. They're both exposed to the same amount of

899
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,240
nutrient. They're both exposed to the same hormonal milieu. So why is only one of them going down that

900
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:04,080
cancerous pathway? Why is one turning into a polyp? And why is only that polyp becoming

901
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:09,920
dysplastic and ultimately, you know, or metoplastic and ultimately dysplastic and ultimately

902
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:18,880
becoming metastatic. I think that the hormones and the nutrients are simply the fuel that allow

903
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:25,360
the thing to happen, but they're not the spark. And to me, the spark is what matters. And that's

904
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:32,720
why I don't agree that Warburg was correct. I don't agree that the initial insult is the

905
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:42,240
mitochondrial insult. I think that the event that is driving this, I think the oncogenic effect is

906
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:50,400
the driver. And I think the metabolism allows the cancer to be even more adaptable to the scenarios

907
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,560
that you describe. And I've spent perhaps not as long as you, but I've certainly spent a lot of time

908
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,080
talking with people on both sides of this, going to conferences.

909
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:08,160
But in the end, it somewhat matters because it comes down to what's the implication of this from

910
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,920
a treatment and prevention standpoint. And I would say in the opposite order, right? What's

911
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,520
the implication of this from a prevention standpoint? What's the implication of this

912
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:20,560
from a treatment standpoint? And that's what I think about because in the end, that's the part

913
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:26,960
that I think is a kind of a bedside doctor, that's the part you have control over is what can you do

914
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:32,240
to prevent cancer or reduce the probability of cancer? I don't think one can truly ever prevent

915
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:40,800
it. And then in the presence of it, what can you do? So how did this work impact your thinking on

916
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:50,240
that question? Sure. Yeah. In my mind, that's really the key to my whole story is, there's

917
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:56,720
sort of two components to it. One is what's going on inside the cancer cell. And that's all this

918
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:01,920
discussion we've had about the Warburg effect, but there's another part to the story, which is

919
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:11,520
150 years, 200 years of cancer epidemiology and seeing various environmental causes of cancer or

920
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:18,400
various theories about what causes cancer. And what really struck me, and I don't think,

921
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:24,240
you know, as a journalist, I can't understand the science sometimes in the same way that

922
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,720
probably you can and a lot of the people I interview can, but what I try to do is connect

923
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,800
dots. You know, that's one thing I can do as a journalist is look at one scientific field and

924
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:37,360
another scientific field that aren't necessarily talking to each other and try to put stories

925
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:44,400
together. And the thing that really struck me was that in the late 90s, at the very same time that

926
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,800
Thompson's lab and Chivan Dang's lab are returning to Warburg metabolism,

927
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:55,600
we have these new epidemiology papers coming out showing both that insulin is correlated,

928
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,160
elevated insulin, hyperinsulinemia is correlated with cancer and obesity is correlated with cancer.

929
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,200
So it happens at the same moment. And that in a lot of ways, that was my project for the end of

930
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:11,200
the book is trying to understand, you know, is the obesity story related to the overeating of glucose

931
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:17,360
in the cancer cell. And I think those two stories are related. And that's why, you know,

932
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:22,640
the last part of my book is really a focus on hyperinsulinemia, because I think it's

933
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:28,800
a piece that puts it all together. It could explain the obesity, it could explain the cancer,

934
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:35,280
and it could explain why cancer was once a rare disease, and then in step with diabetes and

935
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,920
obesity and other, you know, quote unquote, diseases of civilization became much more common. So

936
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:46,320
in my book, insulin is sort of the explanation which ties it all together, which obviously not

937
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:53,760
all cancers are caused by insulin. And, you know, insulin's role, according to some scientists,

938
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,160
is only indirect, it causes the obesity and the obesity causes other hormonal changes in

939
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,880
inflammation. But one way or another, I think it's a big part of the cancer story. And the part that,

940
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,480
you know, if we're going to really make progress on prevention, we have to focus,

941
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,880
I think, on hyperinsulinemia. To me, you know, this is now exactly 50 years since the war on

942
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:18,960
cancer begun. And, you know, we've made so little progress in many ways, certainly with respect to

943
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,960
prevention, you know, there's been remarkable cures and therapies. And, you know, I review the

944
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,640
scientists who make this work, but certainly in terms of prevention, you know, we're just not

945
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,560
making progress. And I think it probably comes back to the hyperinsulinemia.

946
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:40,480
And, again, I do kind of like the way Warburg positioned a prime cause and secondary causes. So

947
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:48,640
when you think of the ravenous diarrhea that was ripping through London in the 1800s,

948
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:55,120
the prime cause was cholera. But the secondary cause was the lack of sanitation, right? It was

949
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:04,320
that which permitted the cholera to travel so freely from sewage to drinking water.

950
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:13,200
So now let's think about cancer through the lens of the two most readily identified epidemiologic

951
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:18,400
factors on scale, not necessarily with the clarity of evidence, but just in terms of breadth of

952
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,960
numbers impacted. First and foremost is smoking. And second, as you point out, is obesity,

953
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:31,280
at least in the developed world. So with smoking, would we put it in the prime or secondary cause?

954
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:36,880
I think we'd put it in the prime cause, right? I think we would argue that the evidence for the

955
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:45,360
causal relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer is likely related to the carcinogenic

956
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:53,120
effect of the tobacco on presumably the DNA structure of the cells that leads to mutations

957
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:57,920
that drive unresponsive or unregulated growth. Would you agree with that?

958
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:05,520
Yeah, I mean, it does come down to semantics at some level. You could argue that the prime cause

959
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:13,520
is the mutation in the DNA that's driving the cancer. Or you could say that cigarette

960
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:19,520
smoke is the prime cause. I personally find it more logically compelling to talk about the prime

961
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,720
cause as the very first thing in the step and the very first step in the process. So I think you can

962
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:30,240
say cigarette smoking is the prime cause. But by Warburg's definition, he would say that if you

963
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:36,000
accept that paradigm, then you would say the mutation is the prime cause, the chromosomal

964
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,560
damage, whatever it is. Another way to think about this is that the accepted paradigm is that all the

965
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:49,520
problems, one way or another, go through the DNA and that the safe read and paradigm is that all the

966
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:55,360
problems go through the mitochondria. So those are the two causal centers. But I think logically,

967
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,440
prime cause should be the very first thing. So smoking and the case of cancer makes sense to me.

968
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah, no, I agree with you. I think that makes sense. So now the question is, how do we apply

969
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:12,800
that thinking to the second one? So if we posit that indeed, obesity plays a causal role in cancer,

970
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:18,000
there's no dispute that the correlation is quite strong. That I mean, you don't need to be an

971
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,840
epidemiologist to understand that. The question is, is that correlation causative? Now with tobacco,

972
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:31,120
the correlation is so strong that it's very hard to find somebody who doesn't appreciate that

973
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:36,960
there's a causal relationship there. I did see somebody on Twitter the other day try to argue

974
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,920
that tobacco has no relationship to cancer. But let's put that guy aside for a moment.

975
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:49,840
With obesity, it's a little harder because the hazard ratio isn't nearly as large as it is with

976
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:58,160
tobacco. And obesity is actually harder to disentangle from its other multivariate parameters.

977
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:04,640
It comes with so much else. So the person who is obese eats a different way, sleeps a different

978
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:12,560
way, exercises a different way. The list goes on and on and on of other things that could potentially

979
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:19,680
play a role. But again, for the purpose of the discussion, if we posit that obesity is causally

980
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:28,400
related to cancer, then the next step is, is it one of the growth factors associated with obesity,

981
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:34,480
of which insulin is one? Is it other changes that are prominent with obesity, such as inflammation?

982
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:46,800
How do you then arrive at, for example, insulin being the prime candidate, to use the word prime

983
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:53,440
again within the obesity paradigm that's driving this? And that says nothing, by the way, of where

984
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:58,000
we're going to then have to go, which is, is it the enabler or is it the primary cause?

985
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:08,080
I mean, my argument is that ultimately, as you said, these are very complicated.

986
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:14,400
There's many different factors that play out. But my ultimate argument is that the obesity

987
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:20,080
is not causal, that it's actually the hyperinsulinemia that is simultaneously

988
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:27,600
driving the obesity and the cancer cell proliferation. So I think part of the evidence

989
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:34,000
for that is that there are people who are, quote unquote, metabolically healthy obese that

990
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:40,400
they store more nutrients in their subcutaneous fat, more energy in their subcutaneous fat and

991
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:45,520
not the visceral fat. And they tend to be metabolically healthy and do not have insulin

992
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:50,560
resistance. And they seem to be no more likely to get cancer. Whereas when you look at the insulin

993
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,520
resistance and people who are thinner, but clearly, I think it's most people actually do have insulin

994
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,640
resistance. And when you see that metabolic disruption, people who aren't obese, that also

995
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:05,280
tends to correlate with cancer. So I think you can, to some extent, dissociate the obesity,

996
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,640
but then you still have to, the insulin cancer correlation isn't as strong as smoking either.

997
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:18,080
So you still have a lot to work with. And then there's the question that you brought up is,

998
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,880
I think this is what you're referring to, is the insulin actually the first prime step in the

999
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:30,640
process, the hyperinsulinemia, or is it a mutation that occurs for some other reason and allows the

1000
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:37,600
cancer cell to take advantage of that hyperinsulinemia? Yeah, is the model basically that if you take

1001
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,560
a two by two matrix where you have

1002
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:57,120
chromosomal insult, yes or no, hyperinsulinemia, yes, no. So which one gets cancer? Is it only the

1003
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:02,800
double positive? I mean, we would agree that the double negative almost assuredly does not,

1004
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:08,640
and we would probably agree that the double positive does. The question is, what's happening

1005
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,800
on the other corners? What's happening in the individual who has the chromosomal insult in the

1006
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:20,640
absence of hyperinsulinemia and what's happening to the person without the chromosomal insult,

1007
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:25,440
who is hyperinsulinemia? To me, those are the questions that matter a lot, and they matter a

1008
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:32,160
lot for the sake of prevention. Now, the obviously, and this is the approach that I take

1009
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:40,240
clinically, which is let's be overly aggressive and assume that both of those are sufficient.

1010
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:48,880
Then you would say, well, you have to put yourself in the double negative box, which is avoid

1011
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:56,080
hyperinsulinemia and any sign of metabolic ill health and do every single thing imaginable

1012
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:02,080
to reduce the burden of DNA insult. You try to narrow yourself and confine yourself into this

1013
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:06,720
very narrow box, and then you layer on a whole bunch of other things like really aggressive

1014
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:13,440
screening and all this other stuff. That's what you would do if you don't have a choice.

1015
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,720
If you're absent perfect information, you have to probably act more aggressively.

1016
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:23,360
But I still think this question of which of the two positive, negative, negative,

1017
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:28,160
positive squares, at least for me, I don't have a great understanding of those.

1018
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,080
Both, I think there are examples and counter examples for both.

1019
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:40,000
Yeah. No, I mean, I don't think anybody has a great answer for it at this point, but I do find,

1020
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,480
you know, this is speculative, but one hypothesis is sort of that these

1021
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:52,240
chromosomal insults occur by chance or for whatever reason. Eventually, you get one in this

1022
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,880
PI3K pathway and the cell is now able to take advantage of that hyperinsulinemia.

1023
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:05,680
But another speculative idea is that if you have hyperinsulinemia and sort of excessive glucose

1024
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:11,040
metabolism, that it's actually going to be driving the chromosomal insult through creation

1025
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:16,400
of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria and that the hypermetabolism, as Craig Thompson

1026
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,960
puts it, actually creates a way for the cell to mutagenize. So, I think that's probably part

1027
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:28,640
of the story. And there's new research coming about how nutrients are actually, play a huge

1028
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:35,360
role in epigenetics as well. So, it may be that there's just bad luck and mutation comes along

1029
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:40,160
and then if the insulin is there, a cell takes advantage. And if it's not, maybe that microscopic

1030
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:44,880
tumor never takes off. You know, a lot of people die with cancer rather than from cancer, as they

1031
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:51,200
say. Maybe the immune system can kill these microscopic tumors if not for the insulin,

1032
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:57,760
keeping the insulin really tells the cell to stay alive. And so, I don't think we have great answers

1033
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:04,080
to these questions, but I think that if you just step back and look at the epidemiology, like

1034
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,240
something has to be going on with nutrition because the cancer was so much more rare

1035
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:15,520
prior to the shift to the Western diet. And it could be many different things, but

1036
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:23,920
it all points to hyperinsulinemia. And it's a growth factor and cancer cells are covered

1037
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:29,360
in insulin receptors. It just makes a lot of sense that this is really fundamental in one way

1038
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:34,800
or another. I'll just say that the counterpoint is, you know, maybe that you just have bad luck

1039
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:41,600
and get an AKT mutation, then the cell, you know, no longer needs insulin and can just get all the

1040
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,000
glucose at once. And that's, you know, maybe true in some cancers, but as I understand it,

1041
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,440
that even when you have these mutations in this PI3K, KTM, TARP pathway, that they're still insulin

1042
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,840
dependent, just less dependent. So, you can imagine a scenario at least where keeping insulin

1043
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:03,520
really low will help even if that chromosomal insult takes place and it makes the cell more

1044
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:10,720
susceptible. You know, what about non-insulin requiring nutrients such as fructose? Rick

1045
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:18,480
Johnson and Lou Cantley have both spoken about this. What, if anything, did you uncover about

1046
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:27,760
the potential role of fructose in cancer? Yeah. That was one of the more surprising

1047
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:34,960
parts of the story for me and humbling in a way as well. You know, a reminder to me, you know,

1048
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,240
I was writing about Warburg who always believed too strongly in his own ideas and couldn't,

1049
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,640
you know, accept that they may be wrong. And, you know, it's anytime you're writing a book that has

1050
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,680
any kind of argument in it, you sort of fall into that trap and have to remember that, you know,

1051
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,880
science changes and not everything's proven. So, I had decided, you know, early in my writing

1052
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:02,400
process that I thought sugar, sucrose was a big part of this story. But my assumption was that

1053
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:08,960
it was all by way of driving, you know, liver fat and insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

1054
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:15,840
And then in recent years, this work out of Cantley's lab and Richard Johnson's and has shown

1055
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:23,120
that, you know, even independent of the effects on insulin, that fructose seems to drive, you know,

1056
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:26,960
certain cancers that, you know, particularly in the colon that are able to get the fructose

1057
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:34,800
and actually, you know, turns on, you know, through sort of a, an odd metabolism actually turns on the

1058
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:40,320
Warburg effect and allows sort of ATP to go down and then glucose to flow in. But the surprising

1059
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:45,360
part for me was that, you know, that could be disassociated with insulin. I had to step back

1060
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:52,640
and say that, you know, maybe sugar is even worse than we thought and is sort of causing cancer in

1061
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:59,920
two different ways in some cases. Yeah, that to me is the most interesting question. Still somewhat

1062
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,800
unresolved, frankly, although I think Rick Johnson's work is among the most compelling I've

1063
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:12,720
seen to disentangle that relationship of fructose independent of its caloric contribution.

1064
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:22,400
And as you said, this is a mechanism that has an indirect effect on insulin, right? So fructose

1065
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:29,040
metabolism when consumed in excess does in fact lead to insulin resistance, which by its very

1066
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:36,080
definition leads to hyperinsulinemia. But the work you allude to in colonic cancer by Lou Cantley

1067
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:43,360
actually posits that, you know, that it's the energetic issue in the cell that you alluded to

1068
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:51,280
of the trans and Johnson as well. It's this lowering of ATP in the process of metabolizing

1069
01:48:51,280 --> 01:49:01,600
fructose. And it's that that ADP ATP sort of switch that can drive the hyper influx of glucose.

1070
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:08,080
And that's not necessarily an insulin driven phenomenon. Yeah. Yeah. Now that, you know,

1071
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:12,240
it's kind of odd for me in a way, it supported my hypothesis that sugar is at the center of the

1072
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:18,560
story, but it sort of upended my idea of what the mechanism was. So, you know, there's still

1073
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,960
a lot to learn, but I found, you know, Rick Johnson's whole discussion of this

1074
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,200
absolutely fascinating. I listened to the podcast and when he was talking to you,

1075
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,280
you know, part of it, you know, all the stuff we were talking about, you know, the turn to fermentation

1076
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,600
of low oxygen environments, which, you know, again, I think you and I agree that that's maybe

1077
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:42,320
not the whole story of some people think, but that it, the seesaw like relationship does exist. But

1078
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,400
his example, which really fascinated me was that these naked mole rats, I don't know if you remember

1079
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,880
this, but the end, they live in this low oxygen environment and they run a lot of Warburg

1080
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:58,480
metabolism by converting glucose to fructose and then using the fructose to drive the Warburg

1081
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:04,080
effect. It was really fascinating to me. What did you learn in this project that

1082
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:09,040
you absolutely positively could have never predicted? I mean, you sort of alluded to the

1083
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,760
fructose more than glucose issue here. Was there anything else that either historically or

1084
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,280
scientifically completely caught you off guard and challenged what you thought you knew about

1085
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:29,760
yourself or this body of work? Yeah. It's a good question. I think one of the things that really

1086
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:37,440
struck me, and I think a lot of people who spend years researching and writing about Nazis end up

1087
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:44,880
with a similar insight, but you sort of have to go through it to maybe realize it, is, you know,

1088
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:51,360
I grew up Jewish and learning about the Holocaust and Nazis and in my mind, you know, they were

1089
01:50:52,400 --> 01:51:00,480
evil monsters and they were, but I never humanized them. And now I had to sort of look

1090
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:06,080
at the personal stories of all these Nazis and not think of them as in an abstract,

1091
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:12,560
you know, evil monstrous way, but understanding as human beings, how they went down this path and

1092
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:18,240
how it happened progressively throughout the 30s and how it could be that somebody who, you know,

1093
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:23,440
might in one context be a nice neighbor and friend and then, you know, go into the office and,

1094
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:29,920
you know, work on documents that, you know, that need to, you know, millions of people ultimately

1095
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,920
getting murdered, you know, just getting into the lives of these people and seeing that progression

1096
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:41,680
and it really was chilling and eye-opening in a way to make me think that this wasn't an anomaly,

1097
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:46,240
that this in theory, you know, it has happened elsewhere and in various forms and could happen

1098
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:53,200
elsewhere. So it made me sort of much more politically attuned to certain extremist politics.

1099
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:59,440
So that was part of it on a political level and, you know, on a personal level in terms of the

1100
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:06,240
writing. It was such a daunting project for me. How many words is the book, Sam? I actually don't

1101
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:14,880
even know. I think it's about 120,000 some words, but, you know, I didn't have the training in

1102
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,560
biochemistry. I didn't speak German fluently and I really, you know, I didn't plan to write the

1103
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:25,200
book. The publisher came to me and said, I saw your New York Times article. Do you want to do this?

1104
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:34,480
And I hesitated and say yes right away because such a big project. But, you know, I think that

1105
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:41,840
over the years, I sort of learned a lot about myself as a writer and sort of was able to

1106
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:51,120
gradually, you know, trust myself more as a historian. And, you know, I think that I feel

1107
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:56,960
more confident as a writer having completed this project. We'll see, you know, if I still feel that

1108
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:03,360
way after somebody crashes the book. But for me, I felt like I was taking a big risk and that I made

1109
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:08,640
it to the end of that project, you know, is very rewarding. It makes me feel confident about taking

1110
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:14,000
on other stuff. As a writer, do you pay attention to what people say about your work or do you go

1111
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:23,680
out of your way to avoid reviews and things like that? I go out of my way to avoid reviews. What's

1112
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:29,120
fascinating to me is that even positive reviews, which, you know, I'm very grateful for,

1113
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:33,920
but they also make me uncomfortable. Just the thought of anybody sort of passing judgment,

1114
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:39,600
you know, on something that, you know, you work on so hard for so many years, it's just too much

1115
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:45,120
to get a reaction to it in some ways. I'm incredibly grateful for the positive reviews and

1116
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:50,160
it's been really rewarding to get some nice responses to the book on Twitter. But, you know,

1117
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:54,320
I think there's going to be a New York Times review out soon. I'm not even sure I can read it, you know,

1118
01:53:54,320 --> 01:54:01,040
just I have the same thing with my student, you know, I teach and students provide, you know,

1119
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,960
assessments of my teaching at the end of each semester. And I read them because I need to know

1120
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,680
how to become a better professor, but it makes me deeply uncomfortable.

1121
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:13,200
You know, I don't write book reviews anymore because it's just, you know, when somebody works

1122
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:17,360
on something so hard for so many years, it's terrible to have to pass judgment on it.

1123
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:22,960
You know, I'm kind of a softy, I guess. But how do you learn that? I mean, I can be totally

1124
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:29,040
sympathetic to that. But is there a model where you let somebody else read the reviews and pass

1125
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:36,240
on just the objective, you know, this is working, this is not working feedback? I'm asking,

1126
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,840
honestly, for personal reasons, as I sort of think about how to digest

1127
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:46,320
feedback in a forum that is actually very harsh. No, I mean, no, it's certainly I think it's

1128
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:52,720
certainly true that if you don't read your views, you're not going to learn as much. But in a way,

1129
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:58,160
it's too late at that point. You know, what I do is for, you know, before I finish the project,

1130
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:02,960
I sent, you know, first and foremost, my editor who is wonderful, live right Dan Gerstle,

1131
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,000
to give a shout out. But, you know, I also have a handful of trusted friends who

1132
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,840
I send the manuscript to and get their feedback on. And, you know, certainly, that doesn't make

1133
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,840
me uncomfortable because it's a different dynamic. It's not in public, it's in private. And there

1134
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:25,280
are people that I trust. And I don't feel publicly shamed if they tell me it's awful. And, you know,

1135
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:29,440
I can't get better unless I get their feedback. And, you know, I got tremendously valuable

1136
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,800
feedback from those early readers. So, you know, I don't think there's a writer. I mean,

1137
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,920
every writer I know does some form of that. And I think everybody should.

1138
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,960
So, Sam, tell folks again, the name of the book.

1139
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,520
The book is Ravenous, Otto Warburg, the Nazis and the search for the cancer diet connection.

1140
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,440
All right. Well, Sam, thank you very much for taking the time,

1141
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:56,240
so much time to sit down with me today and talk about this and share these insights with all the

1142
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:02,000
folks that are everybody's interested in cancer. So, I think there was a lot here both in the

1143
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,600
history of it and also the implication, which is potentially that metabolism plays a very important

1144
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:18,160
role in cancer. It might not be entirely clear if it's the trigger, you know, if it's the spark,

1145
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:25,120
if it's the oxygen, if it's the fuel, but it's in that mix. So, the more we can do reduce

1146
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:30,720
hyperinsulinemia, improve our metabolism, reduce reactive oxygen species, all these things that

1147
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:34,800
you've spoken about, presumably the better odds we have against the disease to which we've made

1148
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,920
very little progress as you pointed out in the last few years. So, thank you, Sam.

1149
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,880
Yeah, thank you so much. It was an honor to be on the show.

1150
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:46,320
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1151
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,720
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1152
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:56,240
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1153
01:56:56,240 --> 01:57:01,440
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now, to that end, membership benefits include a

1154
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:07,040
bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1155
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:11,200
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is,

1156
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:16,560
nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

1157
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,600
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to

1158
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:27,200
hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short

1159
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:31,840
podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics,

1160
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:36,560
and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1161
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:40,480
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1162
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:46,480
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

1163
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:50,560
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you

1164
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,360
